      Evaluate the role of loading Clopidogrel in acute ischemic stroke in improving neurological
      outcome of stroke in cases patients will be non-eligible for, or declined, treatment with or
      intravenous thrombolysis with rTPA, rTPA is not available or thrombectomy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. First ever presentation with acute ischemic stroke. Previous transient ischemic
             attacks (TIA's) are not excluding, regardless of their frequency or severity

          2. Ictus to drug time does not to exceed 9 hours (allowing for at least 30 minutes to
             obtain imaging)

          3. Patients with undetermined time of onset will be included only if they were last seen
             well within the same time window (9hrs). Onset of events in patients presented with
             stuttering stroke will be considered from the onset of the first clinical
             manifestation.

          4. According to National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, patient
             will be recruited with NIHSS between 4 and 24 (both inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients eligible for intravenous (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) rTPA
             thrombolysis or thrombectomy.

          2. If NIHSS on admission is 3 or less, 25 or more, or patients who are showing rapidly
             resolving symptoms prior to the results of imaging.

          3. Clinical seizures at the onset of stroke.

          4. Patients with known history or manifestations of any major organ failure.

          5. Patients who have had acute myocardial infarction within 1 month; and/or with
             management interfering with the current study (e.g. warfarin).

          6. Patients with active malignancies, and/or have been on chemo- or radiotherapy within
             the last year.

          7. Patients with active peptic ulcer and/or (gastrointestinal tract) GIT surgery or
             bleeding within the last year.

          8. Persistent uncontrolled vomiting during the first day of admission.

          9. Patients with major surgery within the last 3 months.

         10. Patients with history of uncontrolled bleeding site, within the prior year.

         11. Patients with known allergy to study drugs.

         12. Patients with known history of persistent or recurrent (central nervous system) CNS
             pathology (e.g. epilepsies, meningioma, multiple sclerosis).

         13. Patients with past history of head trauma with residual neurological deficit

         14. Patients who are on regular Clopidogrel during the week before admission.

         15. Patient with raised prothrombin time (PT) on admission, either on anticoagulants (with
             raised INR&gt;1.3, PT &gt;18 second) or not (PT&gt; 15 second), or on drugs that might increase
             possibility of peripheral bleeding (e.g. corticosteroids).

         16. Patients who have an indication for full anti-coagulation during the first week of
             their hospital stay will be retrospectively excluded.

         17. Patients receiving anti-coagulants in deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis doses
             will NOT be excluded:

               -  Enoxaparin 40mg/d (or equivalent).

               -  Heparin with partial thromboplastin time (PTT) not exceeding 50 seconds.

               -  Oral anticoagulation with INR &lt;1.5.

         18. Pregnancy or breast feeding

         19. Stroke due to venous thrombosis

         20. Hemorrhagic stroke

         21. Blood pressure &lt; 90/60 or &gt; 185/110 mmHg, if not responding to intravenous
             antihypertensive therapy or requiring aggressive treatment to reduce it below this
             limit

         22. Arterial puncture in a non-compressible site within the previous week

         23. Strokes following cardiac arrest or profuse hypotension.

         24. Blood glucose level &lt; 50 or &gt; 400 mg/dl on admission

         25. CBC with picture of severe anemia (Haematocrit &lt;0.25), thrombocytopenia (Platelets &lt;
             100,000) or leucopenia (WBC &lt; 3,000).

         26. Significant electrolyte imbalance that may account for the presenting manifestations

         27. Contraindications to imaging

         28. Urgent brain CT revealing any of the following:

               -  Hemorrhage.

               -  Major cerebral non-vascular pathology.

               -  Suspected arterio-venous malformation (AVM).
