  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has thus far been only one randomized and masked clinical trial in the world to
      evaluate the efficacy of the intraoperative intracameral injection of antibiotics with the
      objective of preventing endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. The ESCRS study from 2007
      confirmed that the intracameral use of cefuroxime reduced the incidence of endophthalmitis
      approximately fivefold. Unlike in Europe, where this drug came to be widely used after the
      2007 results, cefuroxime is not commercially available in Brazil. Many studies around the
      world have substituted cefuroxime with moxifloxacin, which is a drug that is easily found
      around the world in eye drop form. It is widely used in postoperative regimens in cases of
      ophthalmologic surgeries, and it is free of preservatives that are toxic to intraocular
      structures (corneal endothelial cells). Three studies (all respective) found that the
      intracameral use of moxifloxacin is safe and effective for preventing endophthalmitis
      following cataract surgery; however, no controlled, randomized, and masked clinical trials
      have been performed with this objective. If this trial confirms its hypothesis (a reduction
      in the incidence of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery) and if minimal side effects
      are reported, moxifloxacin may be an option for routine intracameral use during cataract
      surgery, thus reducing cases of endophthalmitis and consequent cases of blindness.

      Patients who are diagnosed with cataracts and for whom surgery is indicated shall be
      evaluated in terms of their visual acuity and refractive error and via biomicroscopy,
      automated keratometry (Auto Kerato Refractometer KR 8000® Alcon), Goldmann applanation
      tonometry, fundoscopy, biometric assessment (Ocuscan RxP® Alcon or Lenstar LS900® Haag-Streit
      International), and specular microscopy of the cornea (EM-3000® Tomey) to count the corneal
      endothelial cells. Each cataract case shall be classified based on the Lens Opacities
      Classification System III (LOCS III).

      Patients who choose to sign the informed consent form after being informed of all of the
      aspects of the surgery and this trial shall be randomly divided into 2 groups that shall be
      approximately equal in size and stratified by gender. Group A shall receive an intracameral
      injection of 0.03ml of 0.5% moxifloxacin (150 micrograms in 0.03 ml) at the end of the
      cataract surgery, followed by the use of a 0.5% moxifloxacin in eye drop form associated with
      0.1% dexamethasone before the bandage is applied. Group B shall not receive the intracameral
      moxifloxacin injection at the end of the cataract surgery; these patients shall receive only
      0.5% moxifloxacin in eye drop form associated with 0.1% dexamethasone before the bandage is
      applied.

      The cataract surgery shall be performed using the standards followed by the Department of
      Ophthalmology at São Paulo State University, Campinas (UNICAMP). It shall be performed by
      second-, third-, and fourth-year ophthalmology residents and by attendings when cases are
      more complex. Preoperative pupil dilation shall be performed through the use of 10%
      phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide 3 times in five-minute increments. The anesthesiology
      technique used shall depend on each case and shall be either topical anesthesia, peribulbar
      anesthesia, sub-Tenon anesthesia, or general anesthesia. Skin sterilization shall be
      performed using an aqueous solution of 10% povidone-iodine. After the sterile surgical field
      is established and the eyelashes are isolated, 4 eye drops containing 5% povidone-iodine
      shall be administered in the conjunctival sac with subsequent irrigation using a 10% balanced
      salt solution. In cases of allergy to povidone-iodine, an aqueous solution of 0.05%
      chlorhexidine shall be used. The principal incision (using a clear corneal incision or the
      near clear approach) shall be 2.2mm to 3.0mm in length. The phacoemulsification technique
      shall be either the stop and chop, the phaco chop, the pre-slice, the pre-chop, or the divide
      and conquer; it shall be applied through the use of the Infiniti® or the Laureate®
      phacoemulsifier (Alcon), with an AcrySof® intraocular foldable lens (Alcon). In cases of
      posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss, a complication that increases the chance of
      endophthalmitis,3,4,15 a mechanical or manual anterior vitrectomy shall be performed (the
      choice shall depend on the case). In cases of thermal burn of the principal incision or other
      situations in which surgical injury is not self-sealing and in which there is a consequent
      leak of the aqueous humor and an inability to keep the anterior chamber in adequate
      dimensions, the incision shall be sutured using Mononylon 10.0.

      The moxifloxacin injection shall be prepared by a trained nurse or physician: 0.03ml (150
      micrograms) of 0.5% moxifloxacin as an ophthalmic solution (Vigamox®) shall be aspirated. The
      eye drop bottles shall be opened at the moment of preparation with a 0.3ml coupled syringe
      (Terumo®) through the use of an asseptic technique. The solution shall then be injected into
      the anterior chamber via paracentesis as the last step in the phacoemulsification surgery.
      The patients from the two groups shall receive 0.5% moxifloxacin drops associated with 0.1%
      dexamethasone after the surgery is completed and before the bandage is applied. The
      postoperative prescription shall consist of 0.5% moxifloxacin associated with 0.1%
      dexamethasone. Administration shall begin 3 hours after the surgery is completed and should
      continue every 3 hours for 7 days (except when the patient is sleeping). After the 7th
      postoperative day, 0.1% dexamethasone without association with moxifloxacin shall be
      prescribed. Its application shall be gradually reduced over the course of 3 weeks according
      to each individual's inflammatory response.

      Patients from both groups shall be masked, while the surgeons and ophthalmologists who
      perform the postoperative examinations will not. In suspected cases of endophthalmitis, an
      independent ophthalmologist from a retina and vitreous practice shall perform the patient's
      examination without knowing whether the patient belongs to Group A or Group B. This
      independent ophthalmologist shall then recommend the most adequate course of action.
      Endophthalmitis treatment shall follow the usual protocol. The postoperative consults shall
      be held on the 1st, 7th, 30th, and 60th postoperative days and shall include evaluations of
      visual acuity (7th, 30th, and 60th postoperative day), refractive error (30th postoperative
      day), biomicroscopy (1st, 7th, 30th, and 60th postoperative day), applanation tonometry (7th,
      30th, and 60th postoperative day), keratometry (30th postoperative day), fundoscopy (30th,
      and 60th post operative day), and endothelial cell counts (60th postoperative day).
