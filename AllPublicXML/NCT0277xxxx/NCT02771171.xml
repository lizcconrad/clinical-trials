  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT and MRI based measurements of the pediatric airway has changed the age-old cone shape
      concept of the pediatric airway and define airway shape as elliptical structure. The cone
      shape was based on the cadaveric measurements done by Bayeux in 1897 and described later by
      Eckenhoff in 1951.

      The present study is based on three-dimensional CT images of the airway column replicating
      the cylinders used by Bayeux for his cadaveric measurements. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the cone shape of the pediatric airway.

      This is a retrospective review of three-dimensional CT air column images of 60 children aged
      1 month to 8 years undergoing radiological evaluation unrelated to airways symptomatology.
      The CT scans will be evaluated in children either sleeping naturally or sedated throughout
      the study period. Volumetric analysis of the air-column was done at the level of cricoid,
      subglottis and trachea

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Patients with a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube in place, tracheo-esophageal fistula,
      pulmonary collapse or atelectasis, mediastinal mass, diaphragmatic hernia, extrapulmonary and
      intrathoracic mass, preterm infants, and patients with genetic syndromes and primary lung
      diseases.

      Patients with poor image quality were also excluded from the study.

    <description>The purpose of this study was to determine the shape of pediatric airway from subglottis to the trachea using 3D dimensional CT air column images. The shape of the airway was calculated on the basis of the volumes of airway column at the level of subglottis, cricoid and trachea</description>
