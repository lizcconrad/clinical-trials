      Patients followed in the Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes): Patients justifying a
      prostatectomy.

        -  Patients justifying prostatectomy together with the bladder (radical cystectomy for
           bladder cancer).

        -  Patients with benign prostate hyperplasia who justified a prostatectomy. Compare serum
           sexual steroid concentrations and intra-tissue on healthy prostates and prostate
           adenoma, assess concentrations intra-tissue sex steroids on cancer metastasis prostate
           specific blood sample under study (30mL) will be performed preoperatively in Patients
           followed in Foch Hospital Urology Department (Suresnes), and a Removal of a fragment of
           prostate tissue or metastasis will be analyze.

      Aim is to compare serum concentrations of sexual steroids and intra-tissue on healthy
      prostates and prostate adenomas compared to concentrations measured in patients operated for
      prostate cancer.

      Steroids concentration will be determined using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The
      analyzed steroids are :
