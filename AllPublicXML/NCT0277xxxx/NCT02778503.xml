  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) is an alternative restorative technique for dental
      caries, applying the partial caries tissue removal philosophy using hand instruments,
      relative cotton rolls isolation, immediate restoration with Glass Ionomer Cements (GIC) and
      avoiding local anesthesia. The chosen material for this study will be the High Viscosity
      Glass Ionomer Cement (HVGIC) due to its unique physical-chemical properties as well as its
      applicability in challenging clinical situations where other materials would not be adequate.
      Although there are substantial evidences regarding GIC properties, information about GIC
      (with different costs) longevity is still weak. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
      assess the effectiveness of ART restorations performed with low-cost HVGIC in cavitated
      dentine carious lesions in primary and permanent molars. This will be a multicenter
      randomized controlled double-blind (patient and operator) clinical trial performed with 680
      primary and/or permanent molars in children between 4 and 9 years old presenting cavitated
      dentine carious lesions in occlusal and occlusal-proximal surfaces. The tooth will be
      considered as the unit sample, which will be randomly allocated to the groups through a
      generated random list numbers and distributed in dark sealed envelopes opened only by dental
      assistants. Teeth in the test group will be submitted to restorative treatment with HVGIC
      Vitro Molar and those in the control group with HVGIC Fuji IX. The restoration effectiveness
      will be assessed by means of both clinical and bitewing x-rays control after 6 and 12 months.

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The costs of each treatment procedure will be calculated and compared with thresholds values for intervention cost-effectiveness by region, determined by World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/choice/costs/CER_levels/en/).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact on children's quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The oral health related quality of life will be measured using a validated questionnaire according to the children's age. The &quot;Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale&quot; (ECOHIS) (Tesch et al., 2008) will be applied with 4-5 years old children. The &quot;Child Perceptions Questionnaire&quot; (CPQ) will be used for 6-9 years old children (Martins et al., 2009). They will be applied immediately before the procedure and on 12 months follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children self-reported discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The discomfort of each treatment will be evaluated using the facial scale of Wong-Baker (Wong, Baker, 1988). The patient will be asked to choose the face that is more similar to how he/she felt during the treatment. The answer should be given solely by the child, which means no parental or professional interferences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caries lesions progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The treatments will be evaluated radiographically. This evaluation will be performed by two blinded examiners, which will evaluate the four patients' radiographies (baseline, after treatment, 6 months, 12 months) independently, two by two, without knowing the chronological order of them. The efficacy of the treatment will be related to the presence or absence of increasing radiolucent area. They will also classify each radiography using Ekstrand criteria (Ekstrand et al., 1997) and analyze them in a software (ImageJ 1.49, National Institute of Health, USA) in order to make the radiographic subtraction.</description>
