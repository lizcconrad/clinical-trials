    <textblock>
      Patients after heart surgery develop sleep disorder in the form of Insomnia. This finding is
      known and described in the literature with respect to a large number of major operations such
      as the pneumonectomy, esophageal resection, pancreatic surgery, liver surgery and so on. In
      the general population, Insomnia is a common disorder and describe in more than 50% in adults
      over the age of 50. In patients with comorbidity among other things, heart disease indicates
      a rate of up to 85% of chronic insomnia. The reasons for insomnia after multiple heart
      surgery, including emotional stress that accompanies the patient after surgery, pain and
      prolonged hospitalization in the hospital. In this study, aim to compare the results of
      short-term treatment with sleep medication after heart surgery on morbidity and immediate
      recovery. This study will allow us to examine the effect of sleep medication therapy in
      patients receiving treatment compared to patients who did not receive treatment.
