  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bedside clinical case learning, such for respiratory distress, represent a challenge for
      medical teachers, especially in critical conditions. In fact, this kind of learning implicate
      the presence of an appropriate case (the patient itself), framework and may be time consuming
      which could compromise the patient's safety and wellbeing.

      New pedagogic tools have emerged to strengthen the medical reasoning and the acquisition of
      knowledge. in recent years, the development of medical simulation has found a growing
      interest in the medical teaching field. Contextualization, reproducibility and reliability
      are the characteristics of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) which guarantee a lifetime
      experience of clinical conditions without putting at risk patient's safety and comfort.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of HFS on fifth year medical students learning
      skills in the assessement and management of an acute asthma attack in the emergency room, and
      to compares it to other modern teaching tools such as &quot;video-case&quot;

    <description>A HFS session for an asthma attack require:
a 5 minutes briefing session: case and equipments presentation and choice of participants
15 minutes of actual simulation
40 minutes of debriefing
A pre and a post test will be taken by the students before and after the session and a satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the course.
Also, another test will be done after 7 days of the course.</description>
