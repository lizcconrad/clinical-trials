    <textblock>
      This is a prospective parallel group design of group-based Mentalization-Based Therapy for
      Adolescents (MBT-A) through a pilot randomised controlled trial comparing group-based MBT-A
      plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone. As a pilot study, we aim to determine: the
      effectiveness of our recruitment strategies; compliance with protocol/procedures; trends
      towards reduced self-harm.
