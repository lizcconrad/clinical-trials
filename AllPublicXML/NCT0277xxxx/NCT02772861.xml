      There are many forms of small bowel disease but their direct consequences on small bowel
      function are often very hard, if not impossible, to establish. It would be helpful if there
      was a reliable blood test to find out how well cells in the intestine are working. The amino
      acid citrulline is produced mainly by these cells, and therefore holds promise as a
      biological marker. Some previous studies have shown that fasting citrulline gave a good
      indication as to how many intestinal cells were present. However, other authors have not been
      able to confirm this.

      Most of the citrulline in the blood is derived from another amino acid, glutamine, in a
      metabolic process that occurs in the intestinal cells, and most of the remainder comes from
      another amino acid, arginine. A further potential marker of intestinal cell function is the
      amino acid 3-methylhistidine. It is possible that a dynamic test, which incorporates time for
      conversion from one amino acid to another in the intestinal cells, might perform better.

      The investigators therefore propose a study of oral glutamine, arginine, and
      3-methylhistidine compared with citrulline itself or placebo (glucose) as it is hypothesized
      that these might increase the amount of citrulline more reproducibly. An initial study in
      healthy subjects is required to establish whether this is true, and if so to provide a normal
      range prior to investigation of patients who have or who might have the short bowel syndrome,
      and in whom the test would be clinically useful.

      In this study, the subjects will take each of the amino acids and placebo in random order.
      Between each 6 hour-long visit the subjects will have at least one week where they are
      independent of the research team and during which they can behave normally. During each visit
      subjects will have a sequence of blood samples from an in-dwelling venous cannula, taken
      before and over 6 hours after a single small oral dose of that day's amino acid given as a
      small volume drink. Urine will also be collected for amino acid assay.

      Purpose and Design The purpose of the study is to determine the value of measuring citrulline
      after oral challenge, aiming to examine this as a function of enterocyte mass in patients
      with short bowel syndrome. The investigators hope to accumulate sufficient preliminary data
      in order to develop a new biochemical test for assessing absorption in future patient groups.

      All subjects will provide written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The
      study will be performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation
      Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), the Helsinki Declaration and national
      regulations. Information about the study will be provided during one-on-one interviews with
      the help of a summary brochure which will be given to all potential subjects.

      The study has been considered by the UK Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare products
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and they agree that it is not a clinical trial of an
      investigational medicinal product.

      Recruitment

        1. Potential participants will be identified by the investigator's team. The sources will
           include hospital and investigator databases.

        2. If permitted, advertisements will be posted for this study on University College London
           (UCL) electronic news sites, disseminated via UCL staff and student emails, with fliers
           to be posted on physical notice boards at UCL. Direct invitations from the researchers
           may also be attempted.

        3. Healthy volunteers will be offered Â£7.85/hour for their participation in this study.

      Consent Written informed consent will be obtained before any study-specific procedures are
      carried out.

      All participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any time.

      Risk, burdens and benefits Apart from the small risks associated with venous access the study
      is expected to be without important hazard. The agents to be administered are essentially
      constituents of the normal diet.

      There is no expectation that participants will benefit from being in this study.

      Confidentiality All data provided to the sponsor or designee will be identified only by
      subject number or initials, thereby ensuring that the subject's identity remains unknown.

      What will happen at the end of the study? Participants will be given a summary of the key
      results and the opportunity for further discussion on request.

    <description>The primary end point for this study will be the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for citrulline after each oral load. This is the fraction of the administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation. Bioavailability is 100% for intravenous injection. It varies for other routes depending on incomplete absorption, first pass hepatic metabolism etc. Thus one plots plasma concentration against time, and the bioavailability is the AUC. The analysis of this continuous pharmacokinetic parameter will be performed on the plasma concentration-time data, using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 17.0, Stata 10.0, Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and Sigma Plot.</description>

    <description>Citrulline is a non-protein amino acid that is present in substantial amounts in watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), with a mean content of 2.1 mg/g fresh weight, ranging from 0.5 to 3.6 mg/g according to variety. The oral dose can reach 20 g, which was administered orally in the present study in one single dose, followed by a washout period of one week Amino Acid Supplement - One dose</description>

    <description>L-glutamine is a protein amino acid found in proteins of all life forms. It is classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid. This means that under normal circumstances the body can synthesize sufficient l-glutamine to meet physiological demands. However, there are conditions where the body cannot do so. Recently, l-glutamine has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the amino acids when the body is subjected to such metabolic stress situations as trauma (including surgical trauma), cancer, sepsis and burns. In the present study, glutamine was administered orally in one single dose of 20 g, followed by a washout period of one week.
