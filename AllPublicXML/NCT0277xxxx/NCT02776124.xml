  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is very common in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC) patients
      undergoing current chemoradiotherapy (CRT) due to dysphagia, mucositis, nausea and other
      treatment-related problems. Malnutrition is associated with lower physical functioning, lower
      immune status, more severe (grade III/IV) late RT-induced toxicities, treatment interruption
      of chemo(radio)therapy, lower chemotherapy response rates, hospital readmission, impaired
      quality of life (QoL), and increased mortality. Although the international guidelines
      recommend early nutritional support in the presence of nutritional risk, the best type of
      nutritional intervention is still unclear. Individualized dietary counseling showed
      beneficial effects in nutritional intake, nutritional status and QoL in head and neck cancer
      patients undergoing RT or CRT-treatment; oral nutritional supplements (ONS) was most
      acceptable in Chinese NPC patients. Previous nutritional intervention trials in head-neck
      cancer patients have been conducted on small samples and did not clarify the role of oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS). Accordingly, although current guidelines recommend as grade A
      the use of ONS associated with dietary counseling for head-neck cancer patients undergoing
      RT, the efficacy of this nutritional intervention still needs to be evaluated in adequately
      sized and randomized clinical trials for Chinese NPC patients.
