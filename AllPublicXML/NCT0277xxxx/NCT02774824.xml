      This is a 9-months extension to the following study, protocol number: 003-03: &quot;A study to
      evaluate the use of SOMVC001 (GALA) vascular conduit preservation solution in patients
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (GABG)&quot;. Participation is allowed exclusively to
      participants enrolled in the main protocol SOMVC001 (GALA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this 9-months extension study of SOMVC001 (GALA) will be contacted by
      phone twice: 6 months and 9 months after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
      During these phone call visits and at twelve months post CABG surgery, adverse events and/or
      concomitant medication changes will be collected from the participant. Twelve months after
      the CABG surgery procedure, imaging will be performed using 64-slice or better MDCT-scan
      angiography. The study participation ends at this MDCT-scan visit.

      In detail, will be recorded incidence of composite safety outcomes consisting of Major
      Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction [MI], and repeat
      revascularization), angina, arrhythmias, shortness of breath [SOB], decreased lumen change,
      graft occlusion and significant stenosis based on Fitzgibbon's scale B and O, following CABG
      surgery.

      Patients in this study are their own control; they receive two SVG; one exposed to GALA and
      the other exposed to heparinized dose saline. The effect of treatment (GALA vs. Saline) will
      be evaluated on paired grafts within-person. Therefore, treatment effect will be presented by
      graft and not by patient. Only adverse clinical events will be presented by patient including
      their potential relationship to the study product.
