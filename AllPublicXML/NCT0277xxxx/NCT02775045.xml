  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the overall management of patients with Eosinophil
      Esophagitis. Currently, the best way to monitor Eosinophil Esophagitis is repeating the
      endoscopy procedure. The investigators plan to identify a biomarker in the blood (a
      measurable substance) that tracks with disease activity and will reduce the need for
      follow-up endoscopies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By definition, Eosinophil Esophagitis involves the presence of eosinophils in the esophageal
      mucosa. Although incompletely understood, the pathophysiology of Eosinophil Esophagitis is
      thought to include food allergen driven inflammation in the esophageal mucosa that triggers
      release of mediators for recruitment of eosinophils. The mediators, such as eotaxin, invoke
      eosinophil activation and trafficking into the esophageal tissue. The subsequent release of
      mediators from eosinophils and other cells, including mast cells and basophils, promotes
      inflammation and fibrosis resulting in Eosinophil Esophagitis symptoms. This protocol focuses
      on early eosinophil activation events in Eosinophil Esophagitis in the peripheral
      circulation, specifically activation of surface β1 integrin, as a biomarker for disease
      activity reflecting eosinophils destined for trafficking into the esophagus. Demonstrating a
      correlation between disease activity and a peripheral biomarker may ultimately facilitate a
      timelier, less invasive and less costly management strategy for Eosinophil Esophagitis.

      55 mL of blood will be drawn during V1 and V2. The blood will be drawn to save serum, for
      flow cytometry to answer the research questions, to isolate plasma and purify eosinophils for
      banking of whole cell protein and RNA, and to allow for genetic analysis of DNA. DNA will be
      isolated for directed genetic analysis of genes related to eosinophil biology and
      inflammation associated with EoE. Currently, these include ORMDL3, eotaxin-3, and IL-13 and
      may include others upon identification in the literature. This limited analysis is not
      expected to be sufficient for subject identification nor is it expected that the genes will
      be predictive of any other disease process. The genetic portion of the blood draw will not be
      optional.
