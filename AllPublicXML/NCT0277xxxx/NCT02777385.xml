  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study regimen consists of cisplatin and radiation for all patients, the standard
      treatment for head and neck cancer. All patients will also receive pembrolizumab (the study
      drug), and will be randomized to two treatment schedules: either pembrolizumab with
      cisplatin-radiation, or pembrolizumab after completing cisplatin-radiation.

      The goal of this research study is to learn which therapy order (adding pembrolizumab during
      vs. after cisplatin and radiation) may be more effective in treating head and neck cancer, as
      well as learn the side effects of these combinations.Pembrolizumab is an immune therapy, a
      drug that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer, and is FDA approved in lung cancer
      and melanoma. It is not currently FDA approved for head and neck cancer.
