  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in
      infants at risk for mother-to-child HIV transmission and determine an appropriate dose of
      maraviroc during the first 6 weeks of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maraviroc is a CCR5 receptor antagonist used to treat HIV infection in adults. Adding
      maraviroc to a standard of care prophylaxis regimen may also reduce the risk of perinatal
      transmission of HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in HIV-1-exposed infants at risk for mother-to-child HIV
      transmission. This study will also determine an appropriate dose of maraviroc during the
      first 6 weeks of life.

      The study will enroll up to 72 mother-infant pairs in two cohorts. Because maraviroc
      interacts with the antiretroviral drug efavirenz (EFV) in adults, infants in this study will
      be stratified within the cohorts based on their exposure to maternal EFV. Cohort 1 will be
      stratified by in utero exposure to maternal EFV, with infants in both strata receiving a
      single dose of maraviroc solution within 3 days of birth and another single dose at Week 1 of
      life. Stratum 1A includes infants without in utero exposure to maternal EFV during the 8
      weeks immediately before delivery. Stratum 1B includes infants with in utero exposure to
      maternal EFV for a minimum of 2 weeks immediately before delivery.

      Cohort 2 will be stratified by exposure to maternal EFV after birth, with infants in both
      strata receiving maraviroc oral solution once or twice daily starting within 3 days of birth
      and continuing for up to 42 days. The initial starting dose for Cohort 2 will be determined
      based on findings from Cohort 1. Stratum 2A includes infants without any exposure to maternal
      EFV either in utero during the 8 weeks immediately before delivery or while breastfeeding.
      Stratum 2B includes breastfeeding infants with exposure to maternal EFV both in utero and
      after birth while breastfeeding, for a minimum of 2 weeks immediately before delivery and
      while breastfeeding.

      Participants will attend an entry visit within 3 days after the infant's birth. Participants
      will attend 5 to 6 study visits through Month 4. Visits may include medical history reviews,
      physical examinations, blood collection from the mother and/or infant, HIV testing, and
      adherence counseling.

                  the eight weeks immediately prior to delivery and if breastfeeding, mother is not
                  receiving maternal EFV. Note: Breastfeeding and formula feeding infants are
                  eligible for this stratum.

               -  For Cohort 2, Stratum 2B: Breastfeeding infants born to a mother who received EFV

                  for a minimum of six weeks and will continue to receive maternal EFV while
                  breastfeeding. Note: Only breastfeeding infants are eligible for this stratum.

          -  At birth, infant's estimated gestational age was at least 37 weeks. Note: If
             gestational age at birth is not documented in the infant's available birth records,
             study staff may assess gestational age at the earliest possible opportunity during the
             screening period and use this assessment for purposes of eligibility determination.

          -  At birth, infant's weight was at least 2 kg. Note: If weight at birth is not
             documented in the infant's available birth records, study staff may assess infant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infant has any other condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator or
             designee, would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives; for
             example, severe congenital malformation, other medical condition, or clinically
