  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of classroom-based
      behavioral interventions (12-hour girls program and 12-hour boys program), to a standard-of
      care intervention, on reducing the incidence of self-reported sexual assault among girls from
      baseline.

      Secondary objectives of this study is to determine the impact of the interventions on related
      physical and mental health status/outcomes, STI-risk behaviors, self-efficacy, and
      self-esteem.

    <textblock>
      In Kenya, up to 46% of women report childhood sexual assault. In an implementation research
      project, a team at Stanford University will be pairing with three Kenyan NGO's to research
      the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent sexual assault amoung adolescent girls in the
      informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya. The study design will be a cluster-randomized
      controlled trial with two arms comparing the intervention to a standard of care group. The
      intervention consists of two side-by-side behavioral and skills-based interventions, one for
      girls and one for boys, taught in schools. The interventions include identifying and avoiding
      risky situations, verbal techniques to diffuse situations, as well as bystander intervention
      techniques for boys and self-defense techniques for girls. Settlements with schools
      participating in the project include Kibera, Dandora, Huruma, and Mukuru.

      This grant is part of the larger &quot;What Works to Prevent Violence: A global program to prevent
      violence against women and girls&quot; initiative, which is a large international initiative aimed
      at the prevention of gender-based violence. The initiative includes 18 projects from around
      the globe, and is supported by the Medical Research Council of South Africa, the London
      School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the UK Department for International Development
      (DFID). The primary contact people at Stanford University for this project are Clea
      Sarnquist, DrPH, MPH (cleas@stanford.edu) and Michael Baiocchi, PhD (baiocchi@stanford.edu).
