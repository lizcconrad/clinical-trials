  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB). Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is known to provide organ protection
      against ischemia-reperfusion injury through its anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate the effect of a single preoperative bolus of EPO on the
      incidence of AKI following complex valvular heart surgery in a randomized, controlled and
      double-blind trial.

             IV, HTN, DM, age &gt; 65 years, peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Complex valvular heart operations were defined as double-valve surgery, combined valve
             and coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, Bentall operation, combined mitral
             valve surgery and tricuspid annuloplasty or reoperation.
