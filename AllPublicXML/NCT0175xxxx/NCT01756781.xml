    <textblock>
      This is a drug-drug interaction study to compare the pharmacokinetics of a 2 mg oral dose of
      midazolam in adult healthy women of non-childbearing potential when administered alone and
      when administered along with 8 daily 125 mg doses of PD-0332991. Volunteers will be
      randomized to one of two sequences. Volunteers in sequence 1 will receive midazolam alone in
      treatment period 1, followed by multiple dose PD-0332991 and midazolam in treatment period 2.
      Volunteers randomized to sequence 2 will receive multiple dose PD-0332991 and midazolam in
      treatment period 1, and following a washout period of no less than 14 days they will receive
      midazolam alone in treatment period 2.
