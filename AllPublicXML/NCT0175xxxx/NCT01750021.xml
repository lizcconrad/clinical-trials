  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic, and treating and preventing obesity appears to be one
      of the world's greatest challenges. The disorder is associated with a wide range of metabolic
      and hormonal changes, including the development of insulin resistance, changes in adipose
      tissue function, increased levels of blood lipids, cardiovascular disease and obesity induced
      fatty liver. Obesity is characterized by inflammation in adipose tissue, altered fat storage
      capacity and increased exchange of lipids between adipose tissue and blood, and increased
      secretion of cytokines from adipose tissue. Cytokines are believed to play a central role in
      the regulation of adipose tissue, the size of adipocytes and other metabolic conditions.

      The hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins and interaction with adipose tissue is essential for
      the body's energy storages. The central role of the liver in energy supply, fat storage and
      normalization of blood values implies the importance of investigating the interaction between
      adipose tissue and liver to increase knowledge about the morbidity of obesity. Central
      obesity and insulin resistance are clear risk factors for the development of fatty liver, but
      the importance of diet is unclear. The common perception is that fatty liver condition can be
      improved by a reduction in dietary fat and cholesterols, but the relationship is unclear, and
      contradictory findings occur in epidemiological studies. It is therefore necessary to better
      understand the impact of the different macro-nutrients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two weight reducing diets with equal
      calorie levels that contain high or low fat differentially affects the adipose tissue
      function, distribution of body fat, as well as tissue, blood and urine levels of inflammatory
      markers, lipids, vitamins, hormones and other substances that may be related to metabolically
      health.
