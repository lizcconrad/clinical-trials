  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapists have traditionally included various forms of manual therapy among the
      therapeutic approaches to spinal pathologies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effect of diaphragmatic stretching on spine and thoracic movement in healthy adults.

    <textblock>
      Spinal pain is a well recognized condition associated with significant personal and community
      burdens. Recent studies estimated the prevalence between 6 and 22% in neck pain, from 4-72%
      in thoracic pain and from 1.0% to 58.1% in low back pain, which increases with age. During
      the last decades numerous researches have been conducted on stretching effects, evidencing an
      increased muscle control, flexibility and range of motion. The main purpose of this
      investigation is to examine the effects of diaphragm stretching in spine and thoracic
      mobility in healthy subjects in order to apply the results in a specifics pathologies in
      future studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of lumbar mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Schober test is a flexion trunk test to evaluate lumbar spine mobility. During this test, while the patient is in the standing position, marks are made in the midpoint between the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs) and 10 cm superiorly to this point.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of trunk mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>In Finger to floor test, the subjects were stood on a stool and asked to flex the trunk forward in order to reach as far as possible with both hands, without blending their knees.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A Baseline Bubble Inclinometer, Fabrication Enterprises Incorporated, New York. USA, was used to measure de active range of motion of the cervical spine. The measurements were performed in two planes of movement, lateral flexion (frontal plane) the right and left side; and flexion-extension (sagittal plane)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal and Thoracic Dimensions and Kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal and thoracic dimensions and kinematics measurements can be used as an evaluative method for diaphragmatic breathing excursion to quantify possible alterations in thoracic capacity and abdominal and chest wall compliance as achieved by all expiratory and inspiratory muscles</description>
