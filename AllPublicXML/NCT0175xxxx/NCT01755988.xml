  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with heart failure is increasing in the western world. Mainly due to
      better treatment of myocardial infarctions and ageing of the population. The amount of health
      care workers is unfortunately not increasing. We want to investigate how two electronic
      devices (a website and an interactive web-based platform) influence the self-care, quality of
      life, hospitalizations and mortality by delivering care from a distance. We also want to
      investigate if a higher quality of care is delivered despite of less frequent visits to a
      nurse and/or doctor. The study takes place in the Netherlands and is a randomized trial.
      Patients with heart failure, registered by an outpatient heart failure clinic or general
      practitioner can take part. They will be randomized to 3 groups: group 1 receives standard
      care, group 2 receives standard care with the website, group 3 receives an adjusted care
      pathway, with both the website and the interactive web-based platform connected to a
      telemonitoring system. In this group all routine consultations with heart failure nurses and
      general practitioner will be substituted by this device.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-care behaviour measured with the validated European Heart Failure Self Care Behaviour Scale(EHFScB scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EHFScB measures the behaviour heart failure patients undertake to maintain life, healthy functioning, and well-being. This includes behaviours like adherence to medication, diet and exercise, as well as self-management of symptoms, but it also refers to behaviours such as daily weighing to assess fluid retention and seeking assistance when symptoms occur. The EHFScB is a nine items presented on a 5 point scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health related quality of life measured with the generic short-form health survey with 36 questions (SF36), EuroQol five Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the disease-specific Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 is composed of 36 questions with standardized response options, organized in eight multi-item scales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and general mental health.
EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire of health for clinical and economic appraisal and consists of two parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels: from no problems, to severe problems. The MLHFQ is a validated questionnaire and consists of 21 items on patient perceptions concerning the effects of congestive heart failure on their physical, psychologic and socioeconomic lives. Response options are presented as 6 point scale.</description>

    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Dutch Heart Failure knowledge scale is a 15 item scale that covers items concerning heart failure knowledge in general, knowledge of heart failure treatment (including diet and fluid restriction) and heart failure symptoms and symptom recognition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To help calculate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions, use of medication, health care use (e.g. hospitalisations, visits to the general practitioner, the outpatient clinics, emergency department and admission to nursing homes) will be recorded.</description>
