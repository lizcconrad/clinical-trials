      The investigators hypothesize that performance of fast-Fourier transformation on the raw
      Doppler signals obtained from ascending aortic blood flow will recreate the pulse wave
      Doppler trace visualized on modern echocardiography machines, and that this will allow for
      the measurement and recording of vascular flow waveforms

      Currently there is no commercially available mechanism for the measurement of blood flow
      velocity waveforms non-invasively. Blood flow velocity waveforms require the use of invasive
      catheters, thus precluding clinical use. Such information would allow the researcher /
      practitioner the ability to continuously measure blood flow, pulse pressure, and the
      pulsatility index of any vascular structure accessible by ultrasound with minimal additional
      risk to the subject / patient. This data, when combined with arterial blood pressure data,
      could also be used to measure peripheral pressure volume loops as well as aortic vascular
      impedance, both of which cannot be currently measured in vivo.

      The ability to measure blood flow velocity waveforms at high temporal resolution would
      provide clinicians with new tools for hemodynamic optimization (both a novel means of
      estimating myocardial oxygen consumption [pressure volume area] as well as afterload [aortic
      vascular impedance]) and researchers with the ability to conduct hemodynamic experiments that
      were not previously possible. This work will serve as the foundation for several other
      related projects which depend on the ability to continuously record blood flow velocity
      waveforms.
