    <textblock>
      The aim of the present work was to analyze the short-term variability of SO2 during
      hemodialysis in sessions with and without hypotension to correlate the SO2 variability to
      hemodynamic instability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last 40 years a lot has been achieved in dialysis regarding both monitors safety
      and membranes overall performances Anyway, intradialytic symptoms still remain a major
      concern for nephrologists: in particular, hypotension is the most frequent [1].

      Intradialytic hemodynamic monitoring systems have been developed to have continuous
      surveillance of the main hemodynamic variables (heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure
      itself, cardiac output, eccâ€¦).

      In a second moment, the further evolution was towards the retroactive control systems, to
      force some of the variables involved in the genesis of the hemodynamic stability, along a
      pre-determined, ideal, trend. In this view, various bio-feedback mechanisms have been
      proposes along the years, for example, to tackle hypovolemia-related hypotension. Their
      scientific rationale is the control of either blood volume or directly natremia, in order to
      pilot plasma refilling towards the vascular compartment [2].

      Despite the great achievements obtained, the forecasting of acute hypotension during
      hemodialysis still remains a complex problem, likely involving more than one variable.

      SO2 can be considered an indirect expression of the hemodynamic stability. Moreover, in
      dialysis, it has always been regarded as a bio-compatibility marker for membranes [3].
      Nowadays, SO2 changes during dialysis are easy to measure with a fully, non-invasive sensor
      assembled on the arterial line.

      We planned this study to analyze on a large number of sessions the short-term variability of
      SO2 during hemodialysis in relationship with hemodynamic tolerance.
