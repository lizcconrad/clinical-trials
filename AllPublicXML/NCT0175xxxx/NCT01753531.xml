  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical performance of the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be demonstrated during a
      clinical trial in which prospectively collected nasal swabs are used in identifying subjects
      who are infected with the influenza virus strain type A or type B. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B
      Test qualitative results will be compared to &quot;Gold Standard&quot; viral culture with Direct
      Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) confirmation techniques using nasal swabs collected from
      symptomatic subjects. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be performed at Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived sites by untrained intended users (e.g. nurses,
      physician assistants, medical assistants, etc.). For viral culture testing with DFA
      confirmation testing, nasal swab specimen testing will be performed by a designated reference
      laboratory.

    <description>Demonstrate the ability of untrained intended users to effectively run and read the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test with insignificant risk of erroneous results. Qualitative results obtained using the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be compared to viral culture with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) confirmation testing on specimens collected during this study. Data demonstrating ease of use will support a request to FDA for CLIA waived categorization of the assay.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject may be of any age and either gender.

          -  Preliminary assessment of the subject by the Investigator/designee should be
             suggestive of influenza virus infection. Subject should present with an influenza-like
             febrile respiratory illness defined as (1) presentation within the last 48 hours of
             developing a subjective feeling of being feverish and/or a temperature recorded at the
             clinic within the last 48 hours of greater than or equal to 100.5 F and (2) at least
             two of the following symptoms: cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat,
             headache, myalgia.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to study enrollment.

               1. A subject who is 18 years or older must be willing to give written informed
                  consent and must agree to comply with study procedures.

               2. The legal authorized representative of a subject who is under the age of 18 must
                  give written informed consent and agree to comply with study procedures. Active
                  written assent should be obtained from children of appropriate intellectual age
                  (as defined by the IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject underwent a nasal wash/aspirate as part of standard-of-care testing during
             this study visit.

          -  The subject is undergoing treatment currently and/or within the past 7 days of the
             study visit with a nasally administered influenza vaccine (FluMist) or with anti-viral
             medication, which may include but is not limited to Amantadine (Symmetrel),
             Rimantadine (Flumadine), Zanamivir (Relenza), Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or Ribavirin.

          -  The subject is currently receiving or has received within the past thirty (30) days of
             the study visit an experimental biologic, drug or device, including either treatment
             or therapy.

          -  The subject has previously participated in this research study.
