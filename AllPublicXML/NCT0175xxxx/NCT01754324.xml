  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic use of opiate medications during pregnancy is a major public health challenge.
      Prolonged exposure to opiates in utero may result in withdrawal symptoms in infants commonly
      referred to as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Signs of NAS may include irritability,
      high-pitched crying, muscle tightness, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, poor feeding, and
      unstable body temperature. Many infants may be treated by supportive (non-pharmacological)
      therapy by minimizing stimulation, cuddling, responding promptly to hunger cues, and other
      comfort care. However, some infants continue to show severe symptoms of withdrawal despite
      these interventions. In these cases, infants may be treated with medications (pharmacological
      therapy). Although it has been several decades since the first descriptions of NAS, there
      still remains limited information with regards to the most effective treatment. We
      hypothesize that medical treatment protocols of NAS with methadone can be optimized by better
      understanding what the body does to the drug (the population-based pharmacokinetics of
      methadone).
