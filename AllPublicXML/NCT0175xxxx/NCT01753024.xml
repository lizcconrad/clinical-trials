  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a frequent problem in critically ill patients that is associated with
      detrimental clinical outcomes. To provide adequate nutritional support, current studies
      focused mostly on the choice of delivery timing, formula selection and the route of
      administration, little attention was paid to malnutrition related to exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency (EPI).

      In fact, malnutrition is also a major consequence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and
      pancreatic damage is commonly observed in critically ill patients without prior pancreatic
      diseases. Hence, EPI associated malnutrition should be concerned due to the high prevalence
      of pancreatic damage in critically ill patients.

      The aims of this study is to evaluate the incidence of EPI in critically ill adult patients
      and explore its potential risk factors. Moreover, the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme
      supplementation therapy on malnutrition in ICU patients with specific clinical
      characteristics will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients who is able to receive early enteral nutrition and estimated to stay
      in ICU at least four days are considered to enroll into this study. Exclusion criteria are
      age under 18 or over 80 years, pregnancy or breastfeeding, known exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency due to pancreatitis, unresectable pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, celiac
      disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatectomy, gastrectomy and medications of
      somatostatin or aprotinin that directly influence pancreatic exocrine function.

      Informed consent documents are signed by immediate family members of the recruited patients.
      All study procedures are performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines for the
      conduct of research on human beings and approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shanghai
      Tenth People's Hospital.

      Once the enrolled patients are admitted to the ICU, they are inserted either a nasogastric
      tube or a nasojejunal tube guided by electronic gastroscope according to the expected feeding
      time, and the position of feeding tubes is confirmed by plain abdominal radiograph. Enteral
      nutrition will be initiated at a rate of 25 ml/h within 24h of admission, and the infusion
      rate increases steadily until the prescribed nutritional requirements are achieved within 3
      days. Daily nutritional requirements are calculated mainly based on the patient's body mass
      index.

      During the study, the details of each patient such as age, sex, BMI, admission diagnosis, and
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score are collected. All clinical
      characteristics that may cause pancreatic damage, including shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;
      90 mmHg), tissue hypoxia (serum lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L), respiratory failure (PaO2 &lt; 60 mmHg),
      anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L), obesity (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2), biliary sludge (total bilirubin &gt;
      17.5 μmol/L), hypertriglyceridemia (&gt; 1.7 mmol/L), sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB), severe head injury, acute stroke, post-neurosurgery, diabetes, inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBS), mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
      are recorded prospectively. Medications such as propofol, valproate, metronidazole and
      morphine-derived drugs, which are applied for more than 24 h and might induce pancreatic
      damage, are also documented. Arterial blood samples are taken 3 days after admission to
      determine biochemical parameters. Stool samples are collected 3-5 days after the beginning of
      enteral nutrition and frozen at -20℃ until analysis. Some patients will undergo CT scanning
      and magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP)to acquire histological evidence of
      exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

    <description>The incidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency will be evaluated that is based on hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia and fecal elastase-1 concentrations. multivariate logistic regression analyses are used to estimate the correlations between exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and clinical events and characteristics, which include APACHE II score, shock, hyperlactacidemia, respiratory failure, anemia, obesity, biliary sludge, hypertriglyceridemia, sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, severe head injury, acute stroke, post-neurosurgery, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy and medications such as propofol, valproate, metronidazole and morphine-derived drugs</description>

    <description>The incidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the nutritional status are evaluated by fecal elastase-1 concentrations before pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy is applied.
Patients are assigned into two groups randomly, the control group is only receiving enteral nutrition without the addition of pancreatic enzyme(CREON), and the PEST group is given both enteral nutrition and pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy at the same time.
Following two weeks of corresponding treatments, the nutritional status and clinical outcomes are documented in both groups for statistical analysis.</description>
