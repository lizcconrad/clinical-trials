  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is a major problem during liver resection. Vascular inflow occlusion, also known as
      Pringle maneuver, has been commonly employed to reduce blood loss during liver surgery.
      However, Pringle maneuver might cause ischaemic insult to the remnant liver and lead to
      post-operative liver dysfunction.

      The investigators hypothesize that liver resection without the use of vascular inflow
      occlusion (Pringle maneuver) is associated with lower postoperative complications rate.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether elective open liver resection without vascular
      inflow occlusion (Pringle Maneuvre) would lead to a reduction of post-operative surgical
      complications in patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Eligible patients undergoing liver resection in the Prince of Wales Hospital will be
      recruited and randomized into 2 study arms comparing the effect of Pringle maneuver.
