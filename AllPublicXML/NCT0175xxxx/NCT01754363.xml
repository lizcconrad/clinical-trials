    <textblock>
      This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the long term (up to 15 years) survivorship
      of the Attune Primary Knee Prosthesis in patients with non-inflammatory degenerative joint
      disease. Data from Subjects who receive one of four knee configurations will be pooled to
      establish a contemporary dataset.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-centre investigation.

      Approximately 30 sites, worldwide, will recruit 1200 patients (1200 knees). Each study site
      is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients (50 knees). An additional 10 subjects per
      site may be recruited at sites which have Sub-Investigators participating in the study.
      Cohort reallocation is permitted. There is no control group. One thousand two hundred (1200)
      Subjects will be stratified into 4 subgroups of 300: cruciate retaining fixed bearing(CR FB),
      cruciate retaining rotating platform (CR RP), posterior stabilized fixed bearing (PS FB), and
      posterior stabilized rotating platform (PS RP).

      Treatment assignment in this study is not randomized. Each site will only enroll patients in
      one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most commonly used as their standard of care.
