    <textblock>
      In patients with advanced heart failure (HF), systemic congestion is the main indication for
      hospitalization. Recent evidence has highlighted the role of fluid retention in the
      pathogenesis of renal dysfunction and subsequent diuretic resistance. Previous kidney
      disease, diuretic resistance, and progression of renal dysfunction often coexist in patients
      with HF and persistent volume overload. This clinical presentation represents the most
      extreme feature of the cardio-renal syndrome. However, available therapeutic options for this
      ominous condition are scarce and limited. Indeed, there are no data from randomized control
      trials using pharmacological interventions that support the beneficial effect on survival.
      Interestingly, intermittent ultrafiltration has recently emerged as an alternative
      therapeutic option for reducing volume overload in patients with refractory HF. Current
      literature suggests that it has potential advantages over standard medical treatment
      particularly in acute stages of HF. Among ultrafiltration methods, peritoneal dialysis (PD)
      has been preferred as an additional resource for the treatment of advanced congestive heart
      failure (CHF) compared with hemodialysis because it can provide a more physiological and
      continuous ultrafiltration. In fact, several studies showed that use of PD improved clinical
      functional class and hemodynamic parameters and reduced hospitalization rates in patients
      with CHF. Nevertheless, most studies were limited by retrospective analyses of small sample
      size, prospective observational design with no control group, or inclusion of patients with
      end-stage renal failure. Therefore, well-designed prospective randomized controlled studies
      are mandatory to confirm the effects of PD in these patients.
