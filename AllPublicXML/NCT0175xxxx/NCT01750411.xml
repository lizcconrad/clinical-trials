  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission of SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma through the integrated
      study of the effect of genetics on the clinical and biological features of asthma and to
      investigate how these change over time. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to promote
      better treatments for severe asthma.

  <detailed_description>

      The mission of the SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma to develop better
      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.
      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, SARP
      investigators have each identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the
      shared longitudinal protocol. At Wake Forest University investigators are specifically
      interested in genetic influences on disease severity and the use of statistical modeling
      techniques to better understand disease phenotypes. Together, these longitudinal and
      mechanistic approaches will enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and
      pharmacologic responses and identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.

        The target recruitment goal for each center is 75% adults (age 18 and older) and 25%
        children age 6-17 years. Within the pediatric age group, an attempt will be made to enroll
        equal numbers of children 6-11 and 12-17 years of age. Similarly, an attempt will be made
        to enroll at least 50% females and 30% minorities.

        Given the mission of SARP, a diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain
        better understanding of asthma and its endotypes. Because there are a number of respiratory
        disorders that may be confused with asthma or confound asthma assessment, SARP enrollees
        must meet the all following eligibility criteria as outlined below:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Physician diagnosis of asthma,

          2. Age 6 years and older

          3. Evidence of historical reversibility, including either:

               -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥ 12%, or

               -  Airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by methacholine PC20≤16 mg/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No primary medical caregiver

          3. Current smoking

          4. Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥ 30 years of age or smoking history &gt;5 pack years
             if &lt; 30 years of age (Note: If a subject has a smoking history, no smoking within the
             past year)

          5. Other chronic pulmonary disorders associated with asthma-like symptoms, including (but
             not limited to) cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
             bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction that is the sole cause of asthma symptoms, severe
             scoliosis or chest wall deformities that affect lung function, or congenital disorders
             of the lungs or airways

          6. History of premature birth before 35 weeks gestation

          7. Planning to relocate from the clinical center area before study completion
