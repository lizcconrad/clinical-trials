      The objective of this trial is to confirm that the modifications to tissue processing, valve
      sterilization and packaging do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness in
      subjects who require replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve.

  <detailed_description>

      Multicenter, prospective, single arm trial - Up to seven hundred (700) aortic valve
      replacement (AVR) subjects and up to one hundred seventy-five (175) mitral valve replacement
      (MVR) subjects at up to forty (40) clinical sites will be enrolled. The trial will include
      male and female patients, 18 years or older, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged,
      or malfunctioning native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve. Patients will be followed and
      assessed after implant for up to 5 years.

             pre- operative evaluation

          5. Scheduled to undergo planned aortic or mitral valve replacement with or without
             concomitant bypass surgery

          6. Scheduled to undergo planned aortic valve replacement with or without resection and
