  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming additional leucine during calorie
      restriction induced weight loss has beneficial or harmful effects on multi-organ (liver,
      muscle, adipose tissue) insulin sensitivity, colonocyte proliferation rates, the gut
      microbiome, muscle mass and function, and bone mineral density in obese, postmenopausal
      women.
