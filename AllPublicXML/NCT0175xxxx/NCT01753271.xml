      Specific Aims and Hypotheses Aims To investigate the incremental benefits of cervicothoracic
      spinal manipulation in addition to shoulder mobilization and exercise for improving range of
      motion, pain, physical function and fear avoidance beliefs in patients with subacromial
      shoulder impingement.

      Hypotheses It is hypothesized that those subjects who receive spinal manipulation in addition
      to shoulder mobilization and exercise will achieve greater improvements in range of motion,
      pain, function and fear avoidance beliefs at two weeks following treatment conclusion, at 4
      weeks following treatment conclusion, and at discharge when compared to the subjects who did
      not receive the spinal manipulation.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>test of resistance change over time - number of repetitions performed</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks, discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The test is performed by asking the patient to hold the shoulder at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion and follow a 20cm wide spiral using their affected arm. The patient is asked to complete as many spiral movements as possible until stopped secondary to pain. The maximum number of repetitions to be performed is 20.
Patients will be followed for the duration of their physical therapy treatment. An average of 12 visits over 6 weeks</description>
