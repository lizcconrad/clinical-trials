  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First episode psychosis patients often experiences treatment delay. This reduces their
      prospects for recovery and makes unnecessary burdens for them and their carers. A better
      understanding of help seeking intentions is required, and has not been explored in a county
      like Nordland, Norway, with long distances and challenging access to health services. The
      purpose of this study is to explore the process of help seeking, including how patients and
      their careers discover and understand the psychotic symptoms. Research exploring the impact
      on families mainly focuses on parents` experiences, and there are less studies focusing on
      experiences and needs of siblings. This study will therefore explore siblings` experiences
      separate from their parents. Methods will be qualitative interviews with patients, their
      carers and siblings. Analysis will be influenced by Grounded theory.
