  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the only satisfactory treatment for loss and weight maintenance in obese
      patients. This loss is a result of several factors that go beyond the simple anatomical
      abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract and may be the product of post-op energy
      expenditure changes. The respiratory quotient (RQ) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) are
      important components of energy expenditure and possible changes in them can perform an
      important role in weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Previously, we conducted
      a cross-sectional study where we measured the RQ and DIT in pre and post-op RYGB patients,
      which was published in the Surgery of Obesity and Related Diseases (SOARD) journal. The
      objective of this study is to perform a prospective analysis of these same variables (RQ and
      DIT), evaluating them in the same patients, when pre and postoperatively.

    <description>All patients underwent an indirect calorimetry test, after a 12-h period of fasting from food and water, avoiding intake of alcohol or coffee, and avoiding physical exercise and cigarettes the day before the examination. To examine possible changes in the thermogenic effect of food, patients received a standard mixed meal (200 ml coconut water and a chicken salad sandwich using whole wheat bread). They then repeated the test 20 min and 60 min after eating to obtain a reading of the metabolic rate by considering DIT and the RQ in the postprandial period.</description>
