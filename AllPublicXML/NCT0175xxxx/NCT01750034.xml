      Participants: Patients presenting to Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe Malawi with burn
      wounds occuring within 72 hours of admission.

      Procedures (methods): This is a prospective randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized
      during admission to receive either open dressing care or closed dressing care of their burn
      wounds.
