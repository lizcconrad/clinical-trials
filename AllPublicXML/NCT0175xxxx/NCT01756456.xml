      This study is aimed at assessing the safety and the efficacy of two dose regimens of
      recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution compared to vehicle for
      inducing a complete healing of stage 2 (persistent epithelial defect) and 3 (corneal ulcer)
      neurotrophic keratitis

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of two dose
      regimens (10 µg/ml or 20 µg/ml 6 times a day) of recombinant human nerve growth factor
      (rhNGF) eye drops solution compared to vehicle for inducing a complete healing of stage 2
      (persistent epithelial defect) and 3 (corneal ulcer) neurotrophic keratitis (NK) as measured
      by the Reading Center evaluating the clinical pictures of corneal fluorescein staining.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the duration of complete healing, improvement
      in visual acuity and improvement in corneal sensitivity following treatment with rhNGF eye
      drops solution

      This is a combined phase I/II study. The phase I and II segments of the study will be
      conducted as an 8 week, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled, parallel group study
      (referred to as the controlled treatment period) followed by a 48 or 56 week follow-up period
      The design of the phase I and phase II segments of the study are identical with the exception
      that in the phase I segment of the study the randomization scheme is different and patients
      will be followed with additional safety assessments and blood samples for PK
      (pharmacokinetic) profiling In the ascending dose Phase I segment of the study two doses of
      rhNGF 10 and 20 µg/ml will be evaluated in a sequential manner

             study. The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read, sign and date the
             Informed Consent document before any study-related procedures are performed. The
             Informed Consent form signed by patients and/or legal representative must have been
             approved by the IEC/IRB for the current study.

          8. Patients must have the ability and willingness to comply with study procedures.

             inflammation not related to NK in the affected eye.

          3. Any other ocular disease requiring topical ocular treatment in the affected eye during
             the course of the study treatment period. No topical treatments other than the study
             medications provided by the study sponsor or allowed by the study protocol can be
             administered in the affected eye during the course of the study treatment periods.

          4. Patients with severe vision loss in the affected eye with no potential for visual
             improvement in the opinion of the investigator as a result of the study treatment.

          5. Schirmer test without anesthesia ≤3 mm/5 minutes in the affected eye.

          6. Patients with severe blepharitis and/or severe meibomian gland disease in the affected
             eye.

          7. History of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedures) in
             the affected eye within the three months before study enrolment. (An exception to the
             preceding statement will be allowed if the ocular surgery is considered to be the
             cause of the stage 2 or 3 NK). Ocular surgery in the affected eye will not be allowed
             during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures should not be
             planned during the duration of the follow-up period.

             transplantation. Patients previously treated with amniotic membrane transplantation
             may only be enrolled two weeks after the membrane has disappeared within the area of
             the PED or corneal ulcer or at least six weeks after the date of the amniotic membrane
             transplantation procedure. Patients previously treated with Botox (botulinum toxin)
             injections used to induce pharmacologic blepharoptosis are eligible for enrolment only
             if the last injection was given at least 90 days prior to enrolment in the study.

          9. Use of therapeutic contact lenses or contact lens wear for refractive correction
             during the study treatment periods in the eye with NK.

         10. Anticipated need for punctual occlusion during the study treatment period. Patients
             with punctual occlusion or punctual plugs inserted prior to the study are eligible for
             enrolment provided that the punctual occlusion is maintained during the study.

         11. Evidence of corneal ulceration involving the posterior third of the corneal stroma,
             corneal melting or perforation in the affected eye.

         12. Presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder or condition that might hinder
             the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could possibly interfere with
             the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the investigator to be
             incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct (e.g. progressive or
             degenerative corneal or retinal conditions, uveitis, optic neuritis, poorly controlled
             diabetes, autoimmune disease, systemic infection, neoplastic diseases).

         13. Any need for or anticipated change in the dose of systemic medications known to impair
             the function of the trigeminal nerve (e.g. neuroleptics, antipsychotic and
             antihistamine drugs). These treatments are allowed during the study if initiated prior
             to 30 days before study enrolment provided they remain stable throughout the course of
             the study treatment periods.

         14. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications
             (e.g. fluorescein).

         15. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.

         16. Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening visit.

         17. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study.

             post-menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study if
             they meet any one of the following conditions: are currently pregnant or have a
             positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Randomization Visit or intend to
             become pregnant during the study treatment period or are breast-feeding or not willing
             to use highly effective birth control measures, such as: Hormonal contraceptives
             -oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected and/or Mechanical barrier methods
             -spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm or IUD during
             the entire course of and 30 days after the study treatment periods.
