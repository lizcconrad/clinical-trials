      Primary objectives:

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
           of BEZ235 when administered twice daily (BID) as a single agent in patients with
           relapsed or refractory acute leukemia

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of daily oral administration of BEZ235 with a BID
           schedule

        -  To describe preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BEZ235 in patients with acute leukemia

        -  To correlate changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers with basic pharmacokinetic data

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To assess pre-treatment phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway-related genes in
           blast cells and all other malignant cells derived from blood or bone marrow.

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic changes in components of the PI3K-protein kinase B
           (AKT)-mTOR pathway in bone marrow following treatment as potential predictive biomarkers
           of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of BEZ235 in association with clinical responses.

        -  To identify potential resistance mechanisms and biomarkers that may correlate with
           efficacy and response from blood and bone marrow samples pre-and post-treatment in case
           of resistance
