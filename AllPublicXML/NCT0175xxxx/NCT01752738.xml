  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is associated with the accumulation of various metabolites, i.e.,
      uremic retention solutes. Evidence is mounting that the colonic microbiome contributes
      substantially to these uremic retention solutes. Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate are
      among the most extensively studied gut microbial metabolites, and are associated with
      cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease progression and overall mortality. Mechanisms
      governing their intestinal uptake and metabolism, however, are currently unknown. The
      investigators aim to explore these transport characteristics in depth. Therefore, colonic
      biopsies will be sampled of patients with chronic kidney disease, analyzed and compared to
      available data of healthy controls. Insights in the mechanisms controlling intestinal
      transport and metabolism of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate is certainly relevant as it
      might lead to novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of chronic kidney disease.
