      The purpose of this study is to help women lose the weight they gained during their pregnancy
      using a SmartPhone app the investigators have developed called E-Moms. The investigators
      hypothesize that the moms given the app to use during the study will lose more weight than
      the moms who do not use the app.

      The E-Moms Study will last about 4 months. The weight management program is 4 months long and
      will end about 6 months after the participant's baby is born. All participants will receive
      Women, Infants and Children (WIC) services.

      For the weight management program, participants will be put into one of these groups:

        1. WIC Moms: receive advice and services for nutrition and weight management after
           pregnancy from their WIC clinic.

        2. WIC E-Moms: receive a personalized diet and exercise plan to help them lose the weight
           they gained during their pregnancy. All information will be given to them using a
           SmartPhone, such as an iPhone. They will also get advice and services from your WIC
           clinic.

    <description>Participants enrolled in the E-Moms group will receive a personalized dietary prescription to promote weight loss and arrive at pregravid weight by 6 months postpartum. Our weight loss intervention will incorporate standard WIC nutritional advice and will encouraged 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity activity, which is about 3,000 - 4,000 steps/day above baseline, as recommended for maintenance of healthy weight. Each participant will be assigned a trained weight management counselor who will provide frequent recommendations and advice and support at least once per week.</description>
