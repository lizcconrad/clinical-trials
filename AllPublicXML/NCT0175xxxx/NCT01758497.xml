    <textblock>
      Introduction Fascia Iliaca compartment block (FICB) is commonly used to treat pain in
      patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) despite the lack of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy
      of FICB for this indication. Therefore the objective of this study was to assess the
      analgesic benefit of FICB for post-operative pain management in THA.

      Methods After IRB approval and informed consent, patients having THA at our center in the
      period 2010-2011 were recruited. Eligible patients were adults, ASA physical status I-III,
      and BMI &lt;30) with no contraindication to study procedures. In the PACU, all patients received
      morphine sulfate IVPCA; patients reporting pain &gt; 3 on the NRS-11 despite IVPCA were
      randomized by the method of sealed envelopes to receive US guided injections of 30ml 0.5%
      ropivacaine (FICB) or 30ml 0.9% NaCl (sham block, SB) beneath the fascia iliaca.

      The primary outcome variable was opioid analgesic consumption during the first 24 h
      postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity (NRS-11) and extent of
      sensory blockade.

      Introduction Fascia Iliaca compartment block (FICB) is commonly used to treat pain in
      patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) despite the lack of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy
      of FICB for this indication. Therefore the objective of this randomized, prospective trial
      was to assess the analgesic benefit of FICB for post-operative pain management in THA. Our
      hypothesis was that FICB would confer an analgesic benefit for patients after THA.

      Methods After IRB approval and informed consent, patients having THA at our center in the
      period 2010-2011 were recruited in the morning of their surgery. Eligible patients were
      adults, ASA physical status I-III, and BMI &lt;30) with no contraindication to study procedures.
      In the PACU, all patients received morphine sulfate IVPCA; patients reporting pain &gt; 3 on the
      NRS-11 despite IVPCA were randomized by the method of sealed envelopes to receive US guided
      injections of 30ml 0.5% ropivacaine (FICB) or 30ml 0.9% NaCl (sham block, SB) beneath the

    <description>Pain intensity was assessed immediately before and after block placement and at 10-min intervals for the first 30 min after block. Sensory assessment was at 30 min after block, using a pinprick test in the lateral, medial and anterior aspects of the thigh. Specifically, sensation in the territories of the lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, and femoral nerves was tested using a scale of 0-2 ( 0 = no sensation, 1 = diminished sensation, 2= full sensation). Assessment of motor blockade was not possible because of lower extremity immobilization after surgery to prevent hip dislocation.</description>
