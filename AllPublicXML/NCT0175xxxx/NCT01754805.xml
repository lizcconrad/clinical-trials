      Patients check in on day -1 and remain confined until all the exit procedures are performed
      on the morning of day 10. Patients to return for 1 post-treatment follow-up visit on day 13.

      Patients receive a single dose of methotrexate on day 1 and day 8 and ASP015K (twice daily)
      on days 3 through 8 plus the morning of day 9.
