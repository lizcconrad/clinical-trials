  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human study to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD7624, following
      inhaled administration of single ascending doses in healthy male volunteers and female
      volunteers of non-child bearing potential. Pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug)
      and pharmacodynamic (what the drug does to the body) parameters will be also assessed as
      secondary objectives.
