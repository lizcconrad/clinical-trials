  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Death from chronic liver disease has doubled in the UK over the last decade. This is largely
      due to the rise in liver disease from excess alcohol consumption, obesity related fatty liver
      disease and hepatitis B &amp; C infections. The current 'liver tests' only identify liver injury
      when the damage is at an advanced stage. They neither estimate the degree of injury
      accurately nor help judge prognosis. The complications from chronic liver disease result
      mainly from raised pressures within the liver. We currently measure this pressure by passing
      a long catheter through the jugular vein in the neck into the liver. This invasive test does
      carry a small yet significant risk of complications and is not available outside specialised
      liver centres. Raised pressure within the liver is also associated with changes in the
      microorganisms within the gut. This leads to increased infective complications among patients
      with liver cirrhosis.

      We aim to noninvasively measure the pressures within the liver using Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). We will recruit 49 patients with chronic liver disease who have had liver
      pressure measurements as part of their routine clinical assessment. The participants will
      attend the Biomedical Research Unit and the MR Centre for a single 2hour visit. We will also
      collect blood, urine and stool samples from them.

      The diagnostic accuracy of the quantitative MRI techniques will be validated against the
      pressures obtained via the invasive test. The quantitative MRI techniques will also
      correlated with biomarkers of liver injury obtained from blood and urine samples. The stool
      sample obtained will be used to characterise the gut microorganisms in these patients.

        Participants will be recruited from liver services from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
        Trust and Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. All the patients will have had HVPG
        measurements performed for clinical indications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of more than 18 years of age.

          2. Patients who have had HVPG measurements within the last 6 weeks.

          3. Underlying portal hypertension due to chronic liver disease - alcoholic liver disease,
             non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis B or C and
             heamochromatosis.

          4. Patients investigated with a clinical suspicion of portal hypertension, but have
             normal portal pressures on HVPG measurements.

          5. Ability to consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with underlying diseases which are NOT related to alcohol excess, NAFLD,
             chronic hepatitis B, C or haemochromatosis.

          2. Abdominal/waist circumference greater than 112 cm (44 inches) due to scanner bore
             constraints

          3. Pregnant women.

          4. Absolute contraindications for MRI. Any patient that indicates on the MR safety
             questionnaire that they have or suspect they may have metal in their eye(s) will
             require an x-ray prior to their MRI scan confirming that their eye(s) are free from
             metal. This will be verified using previous x-ray records. Any patient whose previous
             records indicate that they may have had metal in their eye(s) or any patients without
             any x-ray records will be x-rayed for the purposes of this study. Any patient having
             current metal in their eye(s), will not be given an MRI scan and therefore will not be
             recruited into the study.
