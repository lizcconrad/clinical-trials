  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether an online multi session alcohol intervention
      improves treatment effect compared to single session screening with feedback only.

      All participants in the trial received a single session screening procedure including
      individualized normative feedback (usual care). Additionally, half of the participants
      received a simple online booklet about the effects of alcohol. The other half received an
      online multi session follow up program.

      Aims: Test whether a multi session alcohol intervention improves treatment effect (i.e.,
      reduced consumption of alcohol) compared to single session screening with feedback.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT). Subjects in both conditions receives a single
      session screening procedure including individualized normative feedback. The control group
      receives an online booklet about the effects of alcohol. The treatment group receives the
      multi session follow up program &quot;Balance&quot; .

      Setting: Online study in Norway. Participants: At-risk drinkers is recruited through internet
      advertisements and randomly assigned to one of two conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>number of standard alcohol units consumed during the previous seven days</measure>
    <time_frame>measures six months after baseline (enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to indicate (through online questionnaires) how many standard alcohol units they consumed on each of the previous seven days, on a scale from zero to ten. Then a sum-score for weekly consumption is calculated, ranging from zero to 70.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sick leave during last week</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at six months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sick leave was assessed with a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response for each of the past seven days, and then accumulated, resulting in a score of zero to seven. Participants were instructed to report any sick leave regardless of reason.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative consequences of alcohol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at six months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived negative consequences of own alcohol consumption, during the seven previous days, was assessed by a 13 item index, resulting in a sum score with a theoretical range from zero to 13. The items comprised: headache, nausea, anxiety, worn out, depressed, breaking a plan, breaking a date, sick leave, memory problems, bad conscience, conflict, destroyed something and injuries.</description>

    <intervention_name>Online multi session follow-up</intervention_name>
    <description>An online multi session follow-up program (i.e., &quot;Balance&quot;). The central concept of Balance is to support continued self-regulation throughout the behavior change process. There are four key aspects of the program, the first is focus on goal setting and tracking of alcohol consumption on a day-to-day basis. The second on relapse prevention - for example, when clients report drinking more than their target, they receive individualized content aimed at preventing a full blown relapse. The third is emotion regulation, where content and assignments from positive psychology and from cognitive behavioral therapy are used. Finally, intervention covers alcohol education (i.e. the same topics as in the booklet provided to the control group).</description>
