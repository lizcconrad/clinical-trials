      Objective: To evaluate the effects of perioperative glutamine supplemented total parenteral
      nutrition support on nutritional status, immunologic function and intestinal permeability of
      patients with chronic radiation intestinal injury.

      Methods: The 40 patients with CRII were randomized into two groups, the standard TPN group
      and glutamine-enriched TPN group. The patients were administered total parenteral nutrition
      for at least four weeks (two weeks pre-operation and two weeks post-operation). The
      nutritional status, immunologic function, plasma concentration of glutamine and intestinal
      permeability were measured at 1 day, 1 week and 2 weeks pre-operation, 3 day, 1 week and 2
      weeks post-operation. Nutrition status was determined the plasma concentrations of
      hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and triglyceride. Immunologic function were
      measured by the percentages of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells, the ratio of CD4 +T cells to
      CD8+T cells ( CD4 +/CD8 +) was calculated， and serum IgA, IgM and IgG．The intestinal
      permeability was detected by the urinal ratio of lactulose and mannitol.
