  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tocilizumab changes the cardiovascular risk
      factors on patients with arthritis rheumatoid.

      Study hypothesis: the IL-6 contributes to increase the cardiovascular risk factors of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis because it produces systemic effects as increasing weight
      and atherogenic body fat, changing energy homeostasis and inducing the adipokines production
      and the insulin resistence.

             DMARDs or anti-TNF treatment for a period ≥ 8 weeks before treatment.

          4. If patients are receiving oral corticosteroids, the dose should have been ≤ 10 mg
             predinosona and stable for at least one month before the start of treatment (day 1).

          5. Patients who are able and wish to sign the informed consent and comply with the
