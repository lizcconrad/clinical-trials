  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of carboplatin, as a post-operative
      adjuvant chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer patients who have pathologic residual
      cancer after the preoperative chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Neo-adjuvant period Four cycles of 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide
      therapy at 3-week intervals followed by four cycles of 100 mg/m2 docetaxel at 3-week
      intervals.

      In POST Neo-adjuvant period

      Randomization:

      At the time of post neo-adjuvant period, the patients will be assigned to each treatment
      group in a 1:1 ratio i.e. carboplatin AUC 6 group vs. observation group. Six cycles of
      carboplatin (AUC=6) on the first day of every 21 days.
