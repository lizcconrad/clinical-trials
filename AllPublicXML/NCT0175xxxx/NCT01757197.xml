      This clinical trial is testing a drug called Tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody) as a first
      line therapy for subjects with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (acute
      GVHD) after undergoing a bone marrow transplant. The purpose of the study is to test the
      safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab at differing dose schedules. There are 2 phases to this
      study. Both phases include subjects with acute GVHD have not responded to steroid treatment.
      Subjects enrolled in Phase IIp will receive Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every week or every 2 weeks.
      Subjects enrolled in Phase II will receive one of two dose schedules determined by the
      results of Phase IIp. Depending on the dose they are assigned to, subjects will receive
      Tocilizumab every week or every 2 weeks for a total of 8 doses. The study medication may be
      interrupted, withheld or stopped for different reasons. However, subjects will be asked to
      follow up periodically for one year after starting Tocilizumab treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status Scale ≥ 50%

          -  Glucocorticosteroid refractory acute GVHD Grade 2-4 by the Glucksberg functional
             classification.

          -  Patients who had experienced aGVHD grade 2-4 and responded to glucocorticosteroids in
             the past then had a flare of aGVHD requiring increasing immune suppression to 1 mg/kg
             of prednisone or equivalent are eligible for this study if they are refractory to
             steroids and provided that they did not receive a second line therapy for aGVHD in the
             past.

          -  Glucocorticosteroid refractory GVHD is defined as the following:

               -  No response to corticosteroid therapy at ≥ 1.0 mg/kg methylprednisolone or
                  equivalent after the onset of acute GVHD for a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7

We were unable to collect extensive data on these 2 subjects because they both died early on in the study due to disease complications.</description>
