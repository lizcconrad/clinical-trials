      The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to confirm that the administration of
      grape juice, resveratrol, and grape seed polyphenol extract results in a similar plasma and
      urinary metabolic profile in aged humans compared to rats, 2) to confirm that a combined
      administration of grape juice, resveratrol, and grape seed polyphenol extract result in a
      similar plasma and urinary metabolic profile in adults with tendencies toward metabolic
      syndrome compared to non-obese healthy humans, and 3) to identify the anti-inflammatory
      effects of the combined administration of grape juice, resveratrol, and grape seed polyphenol
      extract.
