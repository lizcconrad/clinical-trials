    <textblock>
      The hypothesis will be tested that fat can also increase absorption of (non)-nutrients from a
      salad. Therefore we designed the current study to show an increase in relative absorption
      (bioavailability) of (non-) nutrients from a mixed salad by adding fat containing dressing.

    <description>Area under the curve (AUC in nmol/l*h) of (non) nutrients. The AUCs are constructed from (non-) nutrient levels measured in plasma chylomicrons at the selected time-points. The size of the areas under the curves will be compared between the test and control dressing.</description>
