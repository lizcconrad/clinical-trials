  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of adding lithium carbonate
      (lithium) to treatment for combat-related post traumatic stress disorder in combat veterans.
      The goal of this study is to establish that lithium is a practical and tolerable treatment
      option for veterans with combat posttraumatic stress disorder.

    <textblock>
      Few evidence-based treatment options exist for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder
      inadequately responsive to standard medication treatments, such as psychopharmacology with
      serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors. Although many agents have been studied in the
      management of posttraumatic stress disorder, including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and
      atypical antipsychotics, augmentation of existing treatments with lithium remains almost
      wholly unexplored. Lithium augmentation may represent a worthwhile treatment option in light
      of its broad clinical utility, including reported clinical benefits for aggression,
      suicidality, and mood; its apparent effects on mediotemporal and prefrontal brain areas; and
      the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder.

      Primary Aim:

      Establish the safety and tolerability of lithium augmentation of psychopharmacological
      treatment as usual for combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.

    <measure>Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>This is a comprehensive side effect rating scale designed to capture the side effects associated with psychotropic medications in both clinical trials and routine clinical use. Its reliability and validity are well established and it has been used in a variety of clinical trials.Forty-eight items are grouped into four categories: Psychic, Neurological, Autonomic, and Other. Causal relationship to each item is rated as impossible, possible, or probable.</description>

    <measure>Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 1-8</time_frame>
    <description>Structured interview scale developed to assess the type and severity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-III-R posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with scoring that can be modified for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria. It consists of 17 interviewer-rated items that cover the core symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria. It includes 5 global rating scales that reflect the impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, general severity, and recent changes in severity, and the assessor's evaluation of the validity of the patient's report.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 1-8</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 21-item, self-report version of the original Scale for Suicide Ideation, a clinician-administered, semi-structured interview (Beck, Kovacs &amp; Weissman, 1979). Response options range from 0-2 (lowest to highest severity) for each item on the scale, with a total scale ranging from 0-38. Items 20 and 21 refer to past suicide attempts and do not contribute to the overall score.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Combat Veterans seeking treatment at the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
             Subjects must be between the ages of 18-50 years old, have a diagnosis of
             Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and assessed with a Clinician Administered Posttraumatic
             Stress Disorder Scale scoring greater than 15 on the Clinician Administered
             Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale -D. Subjects may have a history mild traumatic
             brain injury. Subjects must also have a stable medical condition to be considered for
             the study. Both males and females will be included, and no exclusions will be made for
             race or ethnicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with substance dependence disorder less than two months prior to study
             enrollment; history of bipolar, psychotic and/or cognitive disorders; history of
             moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury; seizure disorder; sensitivity to lithium or
             contraindications to lithium treatment; will not be included in this study.

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in other intervention studies that may affect the outcome
             of this study, or where this study may affect the outcome of the other study, will not
             be included until the subject has completed their participation in the other study.

          -  Women, who are pregnant, suspect that they are pregnant, or planning to become

             team members involved in the consenting process of the study will not enroll subjects
             whom appear incompetent to consent. Recruited subjects unable to comprehend the nature
             of the study, their involvement &amp; possible risks, described to them during the
             consent/enrollment process, will not be allowed to participate in the study for the
             respect of the volunteering subject, their safety, &amp; to ensure that volunteering
             subjects do not experience any coercion to participate in this study.
