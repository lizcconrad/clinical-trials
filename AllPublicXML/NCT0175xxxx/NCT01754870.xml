  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLL/SLL is an incurable disease with conventional chemotherapy, and there are limited
      treatment options available for patients who have become refractory to fludarabine- and
      alkylating-agent based regimens. Bendamustine is a recently FDA-approved agent with
      significant activity in CLL/SLL, including significant activity in the setting of
      fludarabine-refractory disease. However, durations of remission following
      bendamustine/rituximab combination therapy tend to be short in patients with heavily
      pre-treated disease or who have already received rituximab.

      The incorporation of a maintenance therapy to overcome the shorter remission durations in
      this population is a reasonable and feasible option. In considering potential options for
      treatment of CLL/SLL as a maintenance strategy following induction chemotherapy, lenalidomide
      and rituximab are appealing options based on their convenient dosing schedules and recent
      evidence of acceptable toxicity and promising efficacy in combination therapy.

    <description>• The primary objective is progression-free survival for patients entering the maintenance therapy phase with rituximab and lenalidomide after induction therapy with bendamustine and rituximab. Progression is defined as radiographic or clinical progression as defined by the specified standard response criteria for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)or initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy in the absence of progression. Subjects with clinical evidence of progression prior to a planned disease assessment will be evaluated at the time of clinically suspected progression.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease assessments including imaging will be performed after cycles 3 and 6 of induction chemotherapy and every 4 cycles during the maintenance portion of treatment.
Response and progression in cases of SLL will be evaluated using the International Working Group Criteria for response in lymphoma.38 Response and progression in cases of CLL will be evaluated in this study using the Revised International Working Group CLL 2008 Criteria for Response in CLL (IWGCLL)
Radiological methodologies, techniques and/or physical examination, established at baseline for the assessment and measurement of each identified lesion will be used for all subsequent assessments.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity</measure>

    <description>• To determine toxicities observed with induction chemotherapy and maintenance therapy:
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory results.
Drug doses will be modified as required based on toxicity as assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.</description>

         12. Subjects must not have a known history of hypersensitivity to mannitol.

         13. Subjects may have received prior therapy with bendamustine or lenalidomide, but must

             disease.

             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days and again
