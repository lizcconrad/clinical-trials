    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients
      with advanced prostrate cancer, following docetaxel therapy. The purpose of this study is to
      better understand the response and toxicity of cabazitaxel of elderly men (age 75 years and
      older) with advanced prostate cancer who have progressed during or after treatment with
      docetaxel. All patients on this study will receive cabazitaxel by intravenous (through a
      vein) infusion plus prednisone by mouth twice daily, and following the chemotherapy
      infusions, an injection of a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF will help
      the body produce more white blood cells, which should help decrease the risk of getting an
      infection while being treated with cabazitaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, phase II trial of cabazitaxel every 3 weeks in patients who
      are ≥ 75 years of age with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who have
      progressed during or after docetaxel.

      Primary objective:

      -The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of cabazitaxel in men 75 years of age or
      older with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who have progressed during of
      following treatment with docetaxel.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of cabazitaxel in patients ≥ 75 years of age

        -  To determine the PSA response

        -  To determine the effect of cabazitaxel on functional status using geriatric assessments

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  Determine the effect of therapy with cabazitaxel on the number of circulating tumor
           cells (CTC)

        -  To measure the effects of cabazitaxel on apoptosis in CTCs from patients ≥ 75 years of
           age using H2AX and M30 as biomarkers.

        -  To determine the relationship between geriatric-focused assessment of comorbidity and
           functional ability and toxicity and response.

      Patients will receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with 10 mg prednisone daily until
      progression, intolerance of therapy, or withdrawal of consent. Patients will receive
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Neulasta 6 mg sc) with each cycle, starting with the
      first cycle, to minimize the risk of complications from neutropenia. Patients will be
      followed for 28 days after discontinuation of therapy or death, whichever occurs first.
      Patients with serious adverse events at the time of removal from the trial will be followed
      until the toxicities resolve or are deemed irreversible by the treating physician.
