    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of decitabine in the
      treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (name of a group of conditions that occur when the
      blood-forming cells in the bone marrow are damaged) in Chinese patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly
      following patient enrollment), open-label (all people involved in the study know the identity
      of the assigned drug), Phase IIIb study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of decitabine in
      the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients are randomized (study drug assigned
      by chance) in 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with decitabine either 3-day or 5-day course of
      therapy. When a minimum of 30 patients are reached for 3-day course of therapy, the rest of
      the patients will all be enrolled into 5-day course of therapy. Each patient in the study
      treated for a minimum of 4 cycles; however, a complete or partial response may take longer
      than 4 cycles. The entire study duration for each patient will be approximately two years.
      Safety will be evaluated for each patient by monitoring of adverse events, physical
      examinations, vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram, hematology and clinical chemistry
      testing.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which will be rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening. Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Scores of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire – Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C-30) Physical Functioning Scale</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which will be rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening. Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning.</description>
