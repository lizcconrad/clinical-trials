  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful palliation of biliary obstruction is the main goal for reducing morbidity and
      mortality in patients with biliary disease and biliary obstruction related to
      cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical intervention for the sale is unfortunately complicated by a
      30-day postoperative mortality rate of between 7 and 24%. Moreover, because of recovery time
      the quality of life following surgery is only improved in a minority. At present endoscopic
      insertion of a plastic or metal stent is the method of choice to relieve obstructive jaundice
      without the high morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. But this relief is
      unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed and the fact that effective
      biliary drainage in the proximal lesion is challenging.

      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a new therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic
      cells. This therapy involves the intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent
      followed by activation of the agent by illumination with non-thermal light of a specific
      wavelength, resulting in cell death from direct cytotoxicity and ischemic necrosis. A
      randomized controlled trial study by Ortner et all confirmed the significant advantage of PDT
      with regard to relief of jaundice, quality of life, and survival.

      In photodynamic therapy (PDT) the uniform distribution of externally applied light is
      desirable but often difficult to achieve. An optical fiber tip producing cylindrical or
      lateral light emission can facilitate the application of laser energy by direct implantation
      of the tip into solid tumors. However, currently used FDA approved glass diffusers used in
      standard of care PDT might break in the bile ducts causing injury since they are not meant to
      be used within bile ducts through an endoscope or choledochoscope. Hence, there is a need to
      evaluate and introduce more efficient and safe non-glass cylindrical optic fiber diffuser for
      photo dynamic therapy in the bile ducts. Recent studies have shown that the Pioneer plastic
      optic diffuser is safe and effective in photodynamic therapy, it can be also used via a
      choledochoscope. We aim to add to the clinical evidence by conducting an open label
      observational study trial using this fiber optic diffuser during photo dynamic therapy in the
      bile ducts.

      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common malignancy arising within the liver, and
      the association of this malignant condition with high morbidity and mortality is well
      recognized. It originates from the epithelium of bile ducts or ductules. Two types have been
      described: the peripheral type occurring in the parenchyma of the liver and the central type
      occurring within or related to the major bile ducts. Surgery can offer a curative chance, but
      only a minority of patients are candidates for this therapy at initial presentation since
      most patients are found with an unresectable tumor.

      In unresectable cases, the median survival is 6 months. Since morbidity and mortality from
      CCA occurs because of biliary obstruction, successful palliation of that complication is the
      main goal in these patients. Surgical biliary bypass can be offered in order to prolong life
      and relieve symptoms. This intervention is unfortunately complicated by 30-day postoperative
      mortality rate between 7 and 24%. Moreover, the quality of life following surgery is only
      improved in a minority because of the time needed to recover from surgery.

      Endoscopic biliary stenting during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      offers relief from obstructive jaundice without the high morbidity and mortality associated
      with surgery. In addition, a study by Luman et al even showed significant improvement in
      emotional, cognitive and global health scores following stenting. But this relief is
      unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed.

      Local therapies including iridium brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) may prevent or
      postpone these problems.
