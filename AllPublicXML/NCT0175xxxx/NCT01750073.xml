    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel and
      cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab before surgery works in treating patients with
      previously untreated breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may
      block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and tolerability of a neoadjuvant dose-dense regimen
      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab/radiation therapy (as clinically
      indicated) in patients with newly diagnosed stage T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer; followed by
      maintenance trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive OR
      adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) followed by radiation therapy (RT) in stage II-III
      triple negative HER2 (-), estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-) stage
      T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer patients.

      II. To determine the pathological complete response rate (pCR) of this treatment regimen.

      III. To identify possible gene expression profile signatures from whole genome array analysis
      that correlate with clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy as measured by pathologic
      complete response rate (pCR).

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients with HER2-positive cancer also receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without metastasis
      undergo mastectomy or breast conserving surgery 4-8 weeks later.

      POST-SURGERY/SYSTEMIC THERAPY:

      HER2-POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy. Patients also receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 13 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ER/PR POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard adjuvant hormonal or endocrine therapy.

      STAGE T1cN0 TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy.

      STAGE II-III TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard radiation
      therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.
