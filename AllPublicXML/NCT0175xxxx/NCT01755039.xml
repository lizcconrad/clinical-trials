      The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency and management of respiratory
      incidence in patients with invasive out-of-hospital ventilation, either living at home for
      elderly people allay to a weaning centre or at home. Further, the mortality and the frequency
      of hospital admission will be analyzed.

      Background: There has been arise in a number of patients requiring long term ventilation both
      in the in-hospital as well as the out-of-hospital setting. Despite this, little is known
      about the subsequent political course of this patients following hospital discharge.

      Interventions: This is an observational prospective study over a period of one year in a
      sample of 50 to 70 invasively ventilated patients living either in a nursing home specialized
      in the care of ventilated patients or at home. Protocol had been developed containing 20
      suspected emergency incidences in respiratory care. The nursing staffs are instructed about
      the study and how to complete the protocol. The protocol was placed at each patient and every
      time an emergency occurred, the nursing staff registered the incidence. If an emergency
      fulfils more than one criterion in the protocol, every applicable criterion was marked. The
      data will be analyzed using non-parametric descriptive statistics.
