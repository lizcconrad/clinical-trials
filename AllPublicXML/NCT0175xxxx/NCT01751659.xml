    <textblock>
      This is a three phase study designed to examine clinician behaviors with regard to
      recommending and prescribing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a primary Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention strategy, and to identify knowledge-related and
      attitudinal factors associated with these behaviors. Each phase consists of the following:

      Phase 1: Semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews of ATN-affiliated clinicians.
      Approximately 10 clinicians will be interviewed.

      Phase 2: Development of a new theory-based survey instrument and cognitive interview testing
      of this survey. Approximately five clinicians (of those who participated in Phase 1) will be
      interviewed.

      Phase 3: Administration of the newly developed survey to ATN-affiliated clinicians.
      Approximately 60 clinicians will be interviewed.
