  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular advances in cancer treatment have dramatically improved the prognosis of children and
      adolescents with acute leukemia (AL), raising with a great acuity the problem of the late
      physical side effects, social integration, quality of life of the patients and their family
      as well as identification of the determinants of these outcomes. Large nationwide and
      international cohorts developed in general population (I4C, EPIC ELF…) are restricted to the
      study of childhood cancers occurrence. In addition, the national registries (French,
      European) of childhood cancers are designed to evaluate incidence and mortality, but not to
      produce individual detailed data on the follow-up and outcome of these children. Answering
      these questions supposes a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach resting on prospective
      cohorts of cancer survivors, specifically exploring the outcome of these children. These
      cohorts allow to identify prognostic factors of the health condition and social integration,
      and to propose adapted strategies of follow-up. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS),
      which remains the most important study, only concerns the North-American populations and
      rests on a self-reported follow-up assessment. In France, the LEA study, initiated in 2004
      could answer some of these questions, but the representativeness and the size of the
      population (study initially limited to two areas PACA-Corsica and Lorraine) remain
      insufficient to study uncommon events. Similar approaches are conducted in Europe trough the
      broad collaborative Pancare network, to which the LEA program is associated.
