    <measure>Change From Baseline in Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Total Score at Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in the TWSTRS total score at Week 4 was determined for the subjects who received a single dose of Dysport® or placebo by intramuscular injection at the baseline visit (Day 1), and is expressed as weighted overall treatment difference. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline and at all post-treatment visits.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) in CD at Week 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is an investigator-reported assessment of the global clinical change in CD since study treatment administration. The CGIC uses a seven-point Likert scale ranging from +3 (very much improved) to -3 (very much worse), and was assessed by the investigator at the Week 2 and Week 4 visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TWSTRS Responders at Week 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response was determined as the number of responders at Week 2 relative to the baseline TWSTRS total score. A treatment responder is defined as a subject who had at least a 30% reduction in the TWSTRS total score after treatment. This was calculated as ([Week 2 score - baseline score]/baseline score) * 100.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile-58 (CDIP-58) Total Score at Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CDIP-58 scale is a subject-based rating scale measuring the health impact of CD measured in 8 health dimensions including head and neck symptoms, pain and discomfort, upper limb activities, walking, sleep, annoyance, mood and psychosocial functioning. Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact). Negative changes from the baseline total score indicate improvement in the impact of CD on health whereas postive changes indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CDIP-58 scale is a subject-based rating scale measuring the health impact of CD measured in 8 health dimensions including head and neck symptoms, pain and discomfort, upper limb activities, walking, sleep, annoyance, mood and psychosocial functioning. Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact). Negative changes from the baseline total score indicate improvement in the impact of CD on health whereas postive changes indicate worsening. The hierarchical testing procedure would only be conducted if the previous secondary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in CDIP-58 total score at Week 4) reached a statistically significant treatment effect. This secondary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in CDIP-58 total score at Week 2) was performed to characterise the full clinical effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Total Score at Week 4.</title>
        <description>The change from baseline in the TWSTRS total score at Week 4 was determined for the subjects who received a single dose of Dysport® or placebo by intramuscular injection at the baseline visit (Day 1), and is expressed as weighted overall treatment difference. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline and at all post-treatment visits.</description>

        <description>The change from baseline in the TWSTRS total score at Week 2 was determined for the subjects who received a single dose of Dysport® or placebo by intramuscular injection at the baseline visit (Day 1), and is expressed as weighted overall treatment difference.

        <description>Treatment response was determined as the number of responders at Week 4 relative to the baseline TWSTRS total score. A treatment responder is defined as a subject who had at least a 30% reduction in the TWSTRS total score after treatment. This was calculated as ([Week 4 score - baseline score]/baseline score) * 100.</description>

        <description>The CDIP-58 scale is a subject-based rating scale measuring the health impact of CD measured in 8 health dimensions including head and neck symptoms, pain and discomfort, upper limb activities, walking, sleep, annoyance, mood and psychosocial functioning. Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact). Negative changes from the baseline total score indicate improvement in the impact of CD on health whereas postive changes indicate worsening.</description>

Subscale scores were transformed to a common theoretical range of 0 (no impact) to 100 (most impact).

The hierarchical testing procedure would only be conducted if the previous secondary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in CDIP-58 total score at Week 4) reached a statistically significant treatment effect.
