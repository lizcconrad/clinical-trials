  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to continue the implementation of Connect to ProtectÂ® (C2P), a
      community mobilization intervention, which entails developing coalitions to plan for and
      bring about structural changes for purposes of reducing HIV incidence and prevalence among
      youth in targeted communities at five ATN sites.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The C2P community mobilization model entails: determining a geographic area and population of
      focus for the coalitions to prioritize their planning and action; developing coalitions that
      have a shared vision and mission; developing a strategic plan focused on structural changes
      to reduce risks associated with HIV; documenting processes; providing feedback as technical
      assistance to the coalitions; hosting regular working group meetings; and on-going capacity
      building. The National Coordinating Center (NCC), operating under the direction of the
      Protocol Chair, provides guidance, training, technical assistance and feedback to coalitions.

      The evaluation of C2P includes both process evaluation (i.e., documentation of coalition
      actions and achievements of structural changes; and outcome evaluation to qualitatively
      assess (via Key Informant (KI) interviews) if and how C2P efforts, including completed
      structural changes, have influenced the risk environment within each community. In addition,
      local health surveillance data and HIV testing data will be used to evaluate changes in HIV
      testing patterns and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) morbidity among youth.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the extent to which C2P activities influence elements of the community that affect HIV-related risk prevention, testing, treatment and linkage to healthcare among youth aged 12-24 years and represent intermediate outcomes for this study.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of year 5 (study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will include evaluation across three primary intermediate outcome areas:
Achievement of Structural Change Objectives (SCOs) (programs, policies, practices) that target increased levels of HIV-related prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare.
Increased levels of community capacity and social capital to address HIV-related prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare.
Increased levels of sustainability across the HIV continuum of care (CoC) including prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare activities initiated or influenced by C2P, including programs, policies, and new relationships</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine how attributes of the SCOs relate to intermediate outcomes in order to provide guidance and recommendations to policy makers.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of year 5 (study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Attributes that will be analyzed include:
Change strategy (e.g., information provisions, policy change, relationship formation, program creation).
Sector(s) where change occurs.
Distal and proximal causes targeted.
Youth population affected by change (e.g., universal, selected, or indicated).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the trends and associations with strategies used to achieve SCOs (e.g., creating linkages, honest brokering, strategic partnering, etc.)</measure>

        1. The intervention group = Community members who become engaged in the coalitions and in
             the broader mobilization effort; and

          2. The evaluation group = Key Informants within each C2P community who either work or
             reside within the sectors or systems where structural changes have been accomplished
             and/or the coalition has focused their strategic planning efforts.
