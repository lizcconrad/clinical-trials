  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 3 parallel treatment study in healthy adult
      subjects to assess the relative bioavailability of new formulations of GSK1265744 LAP 400 mg
      intra muscular compared to the current GSK1265744 LAP 400 mg nanomilled formulation. This
      study will evaluate LAP formulations of GSK1265744 with different particle sizes.

      Following a 14 day lead in period with oral GSK1265744, forty-five subjects will receive 400
      mg of one of three GSK1265744 formulations which vary in particle size from 200 nm to 5 um by
      intramuscular injection. Samples for determination of GSK1265744 concentrations will be
      collected for 12 weeks post-injection. Safety will be evaluated by adverse event recording
      and laboratory values at frequent intervals throughout the trial. A subgroup of 12 subjects
      will receive a 3 mg dose of oral midazolam at baseline on Day-29 and then again on the last
      day of the oral GSK1265744 lead in period to evaluate the effect of GSK1265744 on CYP3A
      enzymes.

      The subjects will undergo follow-up evaluations for a minimum of 12 weeks.
