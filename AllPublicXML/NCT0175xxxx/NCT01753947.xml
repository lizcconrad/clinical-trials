  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training on simulated models in a surgical skills laboratory has been shown to improve
      technical performance in the operating room. Currently described simulation-based curricula
      consist of trainees practicing the same tasks until expert proficiency is reached. It has yet
      to be investigated whether individualized deliberate practice, where curricula tasks vary
      depending on prior levels of technical proficiency, would translate to the operating room.

      This randomized controlled trial effectively demonstrates that deliberate practice on a
      virtual reality simulator results in an improvement in technical skills in a real clinical
      situation. This enhances the feasibility of implementing simulation-based curricula into
      residency training programs, and consequently has the potential to improve patient safety.

    <description>Participants' technical skills will be assessed in the operating room as they perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under supervision. The procedure will be video-recorded and sent for assessment to a blinded evaluator. Technical skills will be assessed using a previously validated technical skills assessment tool (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill - OSATS)</description>

    <description>Residents in the control group received informal feedback as they performed the initial laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the operating room. This was left up to the discretion of the staff surgeon supervising the operation. This corresponds to the routine teaching and feedback practices that occur during conventional surgical residency training</description>
