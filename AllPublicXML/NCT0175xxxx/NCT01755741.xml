  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the potential impact of a vaginal ring on condom use by comparing the
      performance (total clinical failure, clinical slippage, and clinical breakage) of a standard
      male lubricated latex condom when the female partner is wearing the vaginal ring and when the
      female partner is not wearing the vaginal ring.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             a study condom over 2 periods of up to 4 weeks each;

          6. Agree to use only the condoms provided by trial personnel during the time of
             participation. Additional lubricant will be provided; use of non-study lubricants will
             not be allowed;

          7. Agree to not use other vaginal products, except menstrual absorption products (e.g.
             tampons) and study lubricant during the trial;

          8. Available for all visits and consent to follow all procedures scheduled for the trial;

          9. At low risk for HIV infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Males with untreated erectile dysfunction;

          2. Female with positive pregnancy test;

          3. Either partner allergic to natural latex or vaginal lubricants such as Astroglide ®;

          4. History by self-report of recurrent or a recently-treated (within past 2 weeks)
             sexually transmitted infection (e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia) or HIV(+);

          5. Currently using condoms for protection against sexually transmitted infection;

          6. Either partner taking any topical or oral medication to treat a urogenital condition
             at enrollment, except medication for the male partner to treat erectile dysfunction
             (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil);

          7. Either partner with a self-reported or clinically diagnosed urogenital condition (e.g.
             itching, burning, irritation, etc.) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             affect use of the study condoms or ability to interpret trial data;

          8. Females, based on findings from a pelvic examination, who are not suitable candidates
             for wearing the vaginal ring (anatomical condition, current vaginal infection, etc.);

          9. Current participation in a study or other research involving a drug, device or other
             product;

         10. Any condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with
             adherence to trial requirements or evaluation of the trial objectives.
