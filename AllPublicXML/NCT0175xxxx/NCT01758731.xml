    <textblock>
      This is a research study that plans to learn more about the safety and tolerability of an
      investigational drug called Olaparib, in combination with radiation therapy and cetuximab.

      Hypothesis: Intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent C225 and Olaparib represents a
      feasible, biologically-based alternative to standard chemoradiation, with acceptable
      toxicity, for treatment of locally-advanced HNSCC in patients having a ≥ 10 pack-year smoking
      history.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes for heavy smokers with locally-advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC)
      treated with standard chemoradiation have been traditionally poor, suggesting a critical need
      for translation of novel biologically-based targeted approaches into clinical practice. In
      clinical trials, the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) inhibitor Olaparib has been
      combined with other systemic agents, including paclitaxel, irinotecan, carboplatin and
      gemcitabine, in the treatment of patients with various solid tumors. Pre-clinical models have
      shown cooperative effects of combining PARP inhibition with radiation. A combined modality
      approach utilizing RT in combination with C225 and Olaparib after induction chemotherapy
      represents a rational, targeted approach for investigation in locally-advanced HNSCC
      patients.

    <description>Patients will begin taking Olaparib at the assigned dose three days prior to their first Cetuximab infusion. Patients will receive an initial dose of Cetuximab, 400 mg/m², intravenously over 120 minutes on Day 1. The initial dose of C225 will precede the start of radiation by 5-7 days. All patients will receive RT to a total dose of 69.3 Gy in 33 fractions over 6½ weeks. Weekly C225 will be administered at 250 mg/m2 in combination with daily RT. Patients will be assigned to receive Olaparib (25, 50, 100 or 200 mg bid) in combination with RT and C225. Olaparib will be taken twice daily, beginning three days prior to first scheduled C225 infusion. A further dose level of 300mg or 400mg may be considered should the 200mg Olaparib dose be well tolerated in this C225/RT combination schedule.</description>
