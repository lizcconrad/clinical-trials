  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study persons with Parkinson Disease (PD) with detailed
      clinical, cognitive and imaging at the time of study entry and repeat these assessments 2
      years later. The study looks at how changes in activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
      relates to changes in cognitive function and to see if there is presence or build up of
      amyloid protein.

      Participants with PD will be studied at initial visit assessing clinical, cognitive, and
      brain imaging. A one year and, if applicable, three year cognitive assessment will be done,
      and the entire/complete assessment (same as initial visit) will be repeated again at two
      years. There will be a maximum of three follow up visits. The imaging test battery will
      consist of amyloid and acetylcholine brain PET and MRI scans. The use of acetylcholine PET
      imaging will demonstrate how changes in activity of this neurotransmitter relate to changes
      in cognitive functions, such as memory and mental concentration. A key question will be
      whether persons with PD who not only are losing acetylcholine brain cells but also have the
      buildup of the Alzheimer amyloid protein have a more rapid progression with more severe
      cognitive decline and behavioral changes compared to persons who do not have the amyloid
      protein.
