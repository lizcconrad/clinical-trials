    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study was to assess changes in fecal calprotectin levels
      and its suitability as a monitoring tool in participants with moderate-to-severe Crohn's
      Disease who were treated with adalimumab.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Remission of Crohn's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was a composite index consisting of a weighted scoring of eight disease variables: number of liquid stools, extent of abdominal pain, general well-being, occurrence of extraintestinal symptoms, need for antidiarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal masses, hematocrit, and body weight. CDAI scores range from 0 to approximately 600, a higher score indicates increased disease severity. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score less than 150.</description>

    <description>CR70 and CR100 was a decrease from baseline (Week 0) in CDAI score of 70 and 100 or more points, respectively, a lower score indicating improvement in disease activity.</description>

CDAI scores range from 0 to approximately 600, a higher score indicates increased disease severity. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score less than 150.</description>
