        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients with diagnosis of aHUS who have been receiving eculizumab by personal
             importation (specific eligibility criteria below do not apply) Or,

          2. Patients with current clinical manifestations of aHUS who meet the following criteria:

               1. Patient with diagnosis of aHUS with or without an identified complement
                  regulatory protein genetic abnormality or anti-complement factor antibody and for
                  whom other known etiologies of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) have been ruled
                  out as confirmed in the Exclusion Criteria

               2. Patient (and legal guardian if patient is not an adult) willing and able to give
                  written informed consent and assent (or verbal assent if patient is unable to
                  read or write)

               3. Patient at least 1 month of age and body weight ≥5 kg

               4. Platelet count at screening &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN)

               5. Signs or symptoms of hemolysis (i.e., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 1.5x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) and Hemoglobin ≤ LLN) at start of current aHUS event

               6. Serum Creatinine (SrCr) level ≥ ULN at screening (patient requiring dialysis for
                  acute renal failure also eligible)

               7. Female patient of childbearing potential practicing an effective, reliable and
                  medically approved contraceptive regimen during the entire duration of the study,
                  including the Follow-up Period. At the time of the last follow-up visit, patient
                  must agree to continue to use adequate contraception methods for up to 5 months
                  following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment

               8. Able and willing to comply with study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Shiga-toxin producing E. coli-HUS (STEC-HUS; shiga-toxin and/or STEC positive) History of
        malignancy within 5 years of screening Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
        Identified drug exposure-related HUS Infection-related HUS HUS related to bone marrow
        transplant (BMT) HUS related to vitamin B12 deficiency Known Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
        (SLE) or antiphospholipid antibody positivity or syndrome Chronic dialysis (defined as
        dialysis on a regular basis as renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease
        (ESRD)) Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis defined as positive blood cultures
        within 7 days of the screening visit and not treated with antibiotics to which the organism
        is sensitive Presence or suspicion of active and untreated systemic bacterial infection
        that, in the opinion of the Investigator confounds an accurate diagnosis of aHUS or impedes
        the ability to manage the aHUS disease Pregnancy or lactation Unresolved systemic
        meningococcal disease Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the
        investigator, could increase patient's risk by participating in the study or confound the
        outcome of the study Patients receiving chronic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 8
        weeks unless for unrelated medical condition (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia) or chronic
        rituximab therapy within 12 weeks of the screening visit Patients receiving other
        immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (mTOR), (e.g.,
        cyclosporine or tacrolimus) are excluded unless: [1] part of an established post-transplant
        anti-rejection regimen, or [2] patient has confirmed anti-Complement Factor Antibodies
        requiring immunosuppressive therapy or [3] steroids are used for a condition other than
        aHUS (e.g., asthma) Prior eculizumab use, hypersensitivity to eculizumab, to murine
        proteins or to one of the excipients Inclusion in any other investigational intervention
        trial except this study
