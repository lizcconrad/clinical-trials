      A Phase 2b, open-label extension (OLE) study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients designed
      to collect long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy, and immunogenicity data of the proposed
      new adalimumab formulation.

    <textblock>
      All participants who completed Study NCT01712178 had an opportunity to enroll into the study
      and to receive the new adalimumab formulation at a dose of 40 mg every other week (eow) for
      an additional 24 weeks.

    <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C-reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Study NCT01712178 Week 0 Visit), Weeks 36 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is 0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has completed the preceding Study M13-390 for rheumatoid arthritis and has not
             developed any discontinuation criteria from that study.

          2. If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) or is of childbearing potential and is practicing an
             approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 150 days after last dose
             of study drug. Examples of approved methods of birth control include the following
             (see local informed consent for more detail):

               -  Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD);

               -  Hormonal contraceptives for 90 days prior to study drug administration;

               -  A vasectomized partner.

          3. Subjects must be able and willing to self-administer subcutaneous (SC) injections or
             have a qualified person available to administer SC injections.

          4. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the Principal
             Investigator based upon the results of medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory profile performed at Baseline.

          5. Subjects must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply
             with the requirements of this study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing infections at Week 0 that have NOT been successfully treated. Subjects with
             ongoing infections undergoing treatment may be enrolled BUT NOT dosed until the
             infection has been successfully treated.

          2. Subject currently uses or plans to use anti-retroviral therapy at any time during the
             study.

          3. Subject plans to use any live vaccine during the study.

          4. Positive pregnancy test at Baseline (Week 0).

          5. Subject is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study.

Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C-reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is 0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5.</description>
