    <textblock>
      Clonidine as an adjuvant to local anaesthetics prolongs the postoperative analgesia. It is
      predominantly an alpha 2 agonist, but does have some alpha 1 activity. Clonidine alone
      produces analgesia. When administered centrally its effects are predominantly due to its
      alpha 2 activity. When administered peripherally it prolongs the analgesia through its
      vasoconstrictor effects and by reducing the clearance of local anaesthetic. Another
      possibility is that it prolongs analgesia of peripheral nerve blocks due to a
      hyperpolarisation current .Clonidine has been used successfully both for upper and lower limb
      blocks. Studies of clonidine for lower limb blocks have produced equivocal results . A major
      concern with the lower limb blocks is the risk of falls associated with prolonged motor
      blockade during early mobilisation. Clonidine has been shown to intensify and prolong the
      motor blockade produced by long acting local anaesthetics. Lidocaine when used in combination
      with clonidine can increase the duration of analgesia to 8-18 hrs. Greater doses of clonidine
      are associated with longer analgesia but with more side effects. Clonidine in a dose of 90
      mcg administered with local anaesthetics can produce analgesia for up to 10 hrs with minimal
      side effects. The aim of this study is to compare lidocaine 2% + clonidine 1.5mcg/kg with
      bupivacaine alone in terms of block selectivity for combined sciatic -saphenous nerve block
      in patients under going semi elective foot/ankle procedures.

    <description>After completion of the two blocks the effect will be assessed every 5 minutes for onset time defined as the time from withdrawal of needle (t0) to complete loss of sensation in the sensory dermatomes of both sciatic and saphenous nerve.
The sensory level will be assessed on toes and forefoot due to post operative cast restricted access to full tibial and peroneal nerve dermatomes.
Motor block assessment will carried out using bromage and modified bromage scale for tibial and peroneal nerve</description>
