  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to quantify the impact of the use of the HEART risk score on patient
      outcome and on costs in patients with chest pain presenting at the emergency room, as
      compared to not using the score.

    <textblock>
      During 14 months, patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency Department (ED) of
      participating hospitals will be included in the study. First, all hospitals will apply 'usual
      care' to all patients, i.e. risk assessment and subsequent management without application of
      the HEART score. Then, during a 14 month period, each 1,5 month 1 randomly allocated hospital
      will sequentially start to apply the HEART score in all chest pain patients (intervention
      period); during this intervention period patients with a HEART score 0-3 will not be admitted
      to the hospital (in accordance with the results of our validation studies), and patients with
      a HEART score above 3 will be treated according to current guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients presenting with chest pain to the (cardiac) ED of ten participating Dutch
             hospitals, older than 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (age &lt;18 years) are excluded from study participation. Subjects who are (for
             whatever reason) not able to fill in questionnaires are excluded from study
             participation. Legal incapacity of every patient will be assessed by the attending
             doctor, according to the guidelines of legal incapacity. In case of doubt,
             consultation of the cardiologist (primary local investigator) will be possible.
