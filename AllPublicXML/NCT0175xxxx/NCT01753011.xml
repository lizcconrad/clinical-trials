      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study of women with surgically-correctable
      stress urinary incontinence who undergo a TOT-sling operative procedure. Data will be
      collected from preoperative urogynecological testing and medical histories. Outcome data will
      be collected 1-3 days and 6 months after procedure.

    <description>The primary outcome of the TOT procedure will be assessed using a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Patients with a negative stress test, a negative 1-h pad test (less than 2 g) and the degree of subjective suffering improving to over 90% (VAS score of 0-1) at 6 months follow-up evaluation are classified as cured. All other patients are classified as treatment failure even if one aspect shows marked improvement from the preoperative condition.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has objective demonstrable signs of stress urinary incontinence (SUI),
             including patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). Objective testing
             includes: standing stress test, urodynamics evaluation, or pad test.

          2. Patient is age 18 or older.

          3. Patient agrees to participate in the study, including completion of all study-related
             procedures and evaluations, and documents this agreement by signing the Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)/Ethic commission (EC)-approved informed consent.

          4. Patient is able to fill in all questionnaires (on judgement of investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has an associated or suspected neurological disease.

          2. Patient has an active lesion or present injury to perineum or urethra.

          3. Patient has a urethral obstruction.

          4. Patient has significant pelvic organ prolapse (Grade III/IV) requiring surgical
             treatment.

          5. Patient currently has an urinary tract infection.
