  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study divides patients into two groups when they ask for medicine to help relieve the
      pain of contractions. One group will be selected to receive an epidural and another group
      will be selected to receive both a spinal dose and an epidural. The investigators will then
      measure how long it takes to deliver the baby. The investigators think that the group that
      has the combination spinal and epidural will have a faster labor.

      In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate conventional continuous
      lumbar epidural analgesia compared to the combined spinal-epidural analgesia. The primary
      outcome of interest will be duration of the active phase of the first stage of labor.
      Secondary outcomes include the cesarean delivery rate, operative vaginal delivery rate,
      analgesia requirements, maternal and neonatal safety profiles (incidence of maternal
      hypotension, post puncture dural headache, fetal acidemia and NICU admissions, respectively),
      Adequacy of maternal pain relief will also be measured using visual analog scores (VAS). The
      investigators hypothesize that the instantaneous pain relief that is achieved with combined
      spinal-epidural analgesia reduces catecholamines quickly and to a greater degree than the
      conventional epidural, leading to a more effective uterine contraction pattern thus
      decreasing the duration of the active phase of the first stage of labor.

    <description>After verification of being in the intrathecal space with free-flow of cerebral spinal fluid, 1 mL of 0.25% bupivicaine along with 20 mcg of fentanyl will be injected into the intrathecal space. Subsequently, a B/Braun Perifix FX closed tip multiorifice flexible epidural catheter will be threaded 4 cm into the epidural space. After obtaining a T6 dermatomal level of sensory blockade, a standard solution consisting of 0.125% bupivicaine with 2 mcg of fentanyl/mL of solution will be started at 10 mL/hour with a patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) option of 8 mL every 45 minutes. If a patient requires redosing, 5-10 mL of 0.25% bupivicaine will be injected slowly through epidural catheter with a goal dermatome level of T6. No systemic opioids will be given.</description>

    <description>After identifying the epidural space with the loss of resistance technique, a standard flexible epidural catheter will be threaded 4 cm into the epidural space. A standard test dose of 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 will be given through the catheter. If positive for vascular or intrathecal placement, procedure to be repeated at different interspace. If negative, catheter will be secured and slowly dosed with 5-10 mL of 0.25% bupivicaine through epidural catheter with a goal dermatome level of T6. After obtaining the dermatome level of sensory blockade, a standard solution consisting of 0.125% bupivicaine with 2 mcg of fentanyl/mL of solution will be started at 10 mL/hour with a PCEA option of 8 mL every 45 minutes. If a patient requires redosing, 5-10 mL of 0.25% bupivicaine will be injected slowly through epidural catheter with a goal dermatome level of T6. No systemic opioids will be given.</description>
