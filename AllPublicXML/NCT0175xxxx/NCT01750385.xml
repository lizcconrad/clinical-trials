    <textblock>
      Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) is a novel, promising endoscopic technique for achalasia
      because it is safer and more effective than traditional Heller's myotomy. However, the issue
      of antibiotic prophylaxis in POEM has evoked considerable controversy recently. Therefore, we
      conduct this study to elucidate the status of POEM-related bacteremia and procalcitonin
      levels in order to preliminary observe whether antibiotic prophylaxis is needed.

      Objective: To elucidate the status of POEM-related bacteremia and procalcitonin levels in
      order to preliminary observe whether antibiotic prophylaxis is needed.

      Interventions: Patients with achalasia diagnosed by symptoms, endoscopy and barium swallow
      eligible for POEM are randomized to either use antibiotic prophylactically or not.

      Main outcome measurements: Blood culture positive incidence; secondary outcomes are
      procalcitonin levels, C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell counts and so on.
