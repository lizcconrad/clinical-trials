      Huatuo Zaizao Pills is a pure natural preparation from plant origin and consists of
      Chuanxiong rhizome, Evodia fruit and etc. Most of its ingredients are not opened and reserved
      by the National Commission for Science and Technology and the State Food and Drug
      Administration.

      Huatuo Zaizao Pills was approved for marketing as a drug over several decades for treating
      and preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and their sequela. It is used to
      symptoms induced by blood stasis or stagnation of phlegm-wetness, such as stroke and
      paralysis, stiffness and numbness, deviation of the eye and mouth and dysphasia.

      Based on the history of Huatuo Zaizao Pills for the treatment of cerebral infarction and
      hemorrhagic stroke, investigators will perform a phase IV, double blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized and multi-Center clinical trial in China to determine the efficacy of Huatuo
      Zaizao Pills in improving neural function and life quality in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke in China.

      The study was designed with a target sample size of 1100 patients and the investigators will
      perform 200 patients in the first period. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      Huatuo Zaizao Pills or placebo at dose of 12g each time, twice daily.

      The investigators hypothesis that this study might offer based medicine evidence to test and
      verified the efficacy of Huatuo Zaizao Pills in improving the neural function and life
      quality in patients with ischemic stroke.
