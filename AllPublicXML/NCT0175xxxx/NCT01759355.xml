    <textblock>
      This is a two arm, single center feasibility study of 20 patients with non-metastatic
      cervical cancer managed with surgery and/or chemoradiation therapy at UNC Hospitals. Subjects
      will undergo PET/MRI scans before, during (chemoradiation group only), and after treatment.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining complete and
      interpretable hybrid PET/MR images for patients diagnosed with cervical cancer.
