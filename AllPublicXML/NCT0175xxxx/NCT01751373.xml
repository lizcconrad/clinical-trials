  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the first year after stroke, approximately 38% of stroke survivors experience an
      increased resistance to movement, also called spasticity. One type of treatment that is
      approved for stroke survivors in Canada that could reduce spasticity is the injection of
      Botulinum toxin (BTX) into the affected muscle. While BTX reduces spasticity, there is
      limited evidence to show that BTX administration leads to functional improvements. This may
      occur because the outcomes aren't sensitive enough to detect change, some people may have
      better responses to BTX, or because BTX hasn't been paired with the right exercises to
      improve function. The aims of this research are: i) to determine if there is a way of
      improving the markers that measure change in response to treatment; and ii) to identify the
      ideal type of exercise that should be paired with BTX to allow the drug to have it greatest
      effect.

      There are two primary research questions: a) What are the measures that will indicate whether
      a person with post-stroke spasticity will benefit from BTX therapy? It is hypothesized that
      EMG latency and amplitude, for those who best respond to BTX, will differ from those who
      demonstrate a weaker response to BTX; b)What is the ideal training approach for improving
      muscle function in stroke survivors receiving BTX injections? It is hypothesized that a
      training protocol that focuses on optimizing specific muscle activation patterns will
      demonstrate better outcomes than a training program designed to improve function.

    <description>The proposed study uses a longitudinal, within-subject, pre/post intervention, cross-over design. All participants will complete each of 4 study phases (each 12 weeks long). These include: a) focal BTX injections in combination with either Standard Therapy or Optimal Muscle Activity Therapy; b) a three-month period where no treatment is given; c) focal BTX injections in combination either Standard Therapy or Optimal Muscle Activation Therapy; d) another three-month period where no treatment is given. The order of treatment phases will be counter-balanced across participants.</description>
