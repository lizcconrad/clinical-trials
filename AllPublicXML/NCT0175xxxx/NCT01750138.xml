  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal tract has many functionsÍ¾ it provides nutrition, produces hormones,
      performs a barrier function, maintains a stable gastrointestinal micro flora and plays an
      important role in the inflammatory process as it is the largest producer of cytokines
      (proteins associated with inflammation). This gut function is impaired after colorectal
      (bowel) surgery. There is evidence to suggest that impaired gut function is associated with
      increased complications. Hence if gut function is preserved, it should equate with better
      outcomes. As a result, there has been increasing interest in treatments called Gut Specific
      Nutrients (GSN), which specifically target gut function. Most notable of them is Glutamine, a
      conditionally essential amino acid and preferred fuel source for intestinal cells. Research
      has shown that glutamine promotes cell growth, increases clearance of harmful organisms from
      the blood, and reduces the surgical stress response. In other words, glutamine has a
      favourable influence on gut function.

      Recent studies from our unit using intravenous glutamine in critically ill patients have
      shown an early return of gut function, which in turn is associated with attenuation of the
      inflammatory response and improved outcomes. It is not known whether oral glutamine is
      associated with a similar outcome. A recent pilot study at our unit suggests an association
      between oral glutamine and early return of gut function. The aim of this research is to
      determine if giving oral glutamine results in an early return of gut function and whether
      this is associated with an attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response.
