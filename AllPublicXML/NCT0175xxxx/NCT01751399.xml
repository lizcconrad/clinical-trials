      The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

        -  To evaluate how much of the study drug (LY2605541) is in the blood of participants with
           varying degrees of liver impairment compared to those with normal liver function

        -  To assess the safety of LY2605541 and any side effects that might be associated with it
