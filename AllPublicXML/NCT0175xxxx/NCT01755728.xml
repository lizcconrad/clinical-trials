  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a report that acetaminophen may have a role in pharmacological closure of PDA
      (Patent arterial duct) in preterm infants.

      The investigators conducted this open label non randomized and non control study to try to
      support that report.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-uteri, the arterial duct connects between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery, thus
      bypassing the lungs. Since the high pulmonary pressure and the low systemic pressure, the
      shunt trough the arterial duct in that time is right to left.

      After birth, systemic pressure rises and pulmonary pressure declines. As oxygen saturation
      rises, and prostaglandin secretion, the arterial duct closes, usually. In preterm infants,
      the arterial duct may remain open after birth. At this tume the shunt would be left to right,
      that would cause pulmonary congestion, and systemic hypoperfusion.

      Ibuprofen is the treatment of choice for PDA in preterm infants. Yet, ibuprofen is not
      effective after two weeks of age. Moreover, there are situations that prevent treatment with
      ibuprofen, such as thrombocytopenia or renal failure. Surgical closure of arterial duct is an
      alternative treatment, if ibuprofen is contraindicated, or if it fails.

      Lastly, there was a report that acetaminophen may have a role in pharmacological closure of
      PDA in preterm infants.

      The investigators conducted this open label non randomized and non control study to try to
      support that report.
