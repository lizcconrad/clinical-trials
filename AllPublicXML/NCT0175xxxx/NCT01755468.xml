  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive
      deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce
      and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the
      body). The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine whether
      intermittent intensive insulin therapy is an effective therapeutic strategy that can preserve
      pancreatic beta-cell function and maintain glycemic control early in the course of type 2
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, eligible patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomized to either
      intermittent insulin therapy or continuous metformin therapy, after both arms have first
      undergone a short course of intensive insulin therapy. The hypothesis under study is whether
      intermittent insulin therapy can better preserve beta-cell function.

    <description>ISSI-2 is an established measure of beta-cell function. ISSI-2 is defined as the product of (i) insulin secretion measured by the ratio of the area-under-the-insulin-curve to the area-under-the-glucose curve and (ii) insulin sensitivity measured by the Matsuda index.</description>
