      This is a prospective study to determine the accuracy of the Masimo Pronto Non-Invasive
      Hemoglobin Monitor and associated Rainbow® probes in the detection of hemoglobin
      concentration in critically ill children. Data from at least 30 patients admitted to the
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over a period of 2 months will be collected and analyzed
      for this study.

      Note, that this device would not lead to deviations in routine patient care; specifically,
      the non-invasive monitor placed on the patient's finger is FDA approved. The proposed
      monitors are identical macroscopically to monitors, which are currently used to measure
      oxygen saturation at this institution. Clinical decisions, additional blood draws or
      alterations to the plan of care will not be made based on study data. The objective is to
      compare the validity of the hemoglobin values determined from non-invasive technology with
      measured laboratory values for hemoglobin utilized as standard of care.

    <description>We will obtain measurements using the Masimo Pronto device prior to the standard lab draw at the following time points: post admission to PICU, 12-48 hours. We will then perform analysis using Bland Altman methods to determine the degree of agreement.
Data analysis will occur 1 year after enrollment completion.</description>
