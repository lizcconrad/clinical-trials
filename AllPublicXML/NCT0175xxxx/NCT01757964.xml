  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to see if Bacteriotherapy (also referred to as stool
      transplantation) improves the symptoms and decreases inflammation in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Examples of IBD are Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.
      Additionally, researchers want to learn whether this experimental therapy delays the need for
      starting additional medications to treat pediatric IBD.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Responded to Stool Translplantation By 2 Weeks as Determined by Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)/Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) Scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is based on estimating the responder rate. This is defined as the proportion of patients with response to therapy by a drop of 10 or more points in PUCAI/PCDAI scoring. PUCAI/PCDAI are validated activity indexes for pediatric Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, respectively. PUCAI scoring ranges from 0 to 85, with disease remission less than 10, mild disease activity between 10 - 35, moderate disease activity from 35 - 65, and severe disease activity above 65. PCDAI scoring ranges from 0 to 100; with remission being less than 10, mild disease from 10 to 30, and moderate to severe disease greater than 30.</description>

Study subject recipients also receive Omeprazole (1mg/kg orally) on the day before and morning of procedure. Transplant recipient also MiraLAX for 2 days prior to FMT. For the FMT, a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed. Approximately 30g of donor stool was mixed with 100ml of normal saline and blenderized until a homogenous texture was achieved Post Transplantation follow-up: Study subject recipients were called 2 days after transplantation. Study subject recipients had clinical follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Standardized questionnaires, PUCAI, were completed during each study visit.</description>
