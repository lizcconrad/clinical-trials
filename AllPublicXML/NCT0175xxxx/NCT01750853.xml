    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY3045697 after a
      single dose, and to determine how long LY3045697 remains in the body. Two cohorts (groups) of
      9 participants each will participate in 3 dosing periods. These participants will receive
      placebo in one period only. A third cohort of 9 will participate in 2 dosing periods and
      participants will receive either 2 dose levels of LY3045697 or 1 dose level of LY3045697 and
      placebo by the end of both periods.

          -  Are non-smokers or smoker of 5 or less cigarettes/cigars/pipes per day as determined
