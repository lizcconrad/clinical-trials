    <textblock>
      This Phase IIa within-subject, cross-over pilot study will evaluate the effects of ABT-089
      (an experimental medication not approved by the FDA) when administered as 40mg oral once
      daily dose for 10 days, compared to placebo, on the following: abstinence-induced cognitive
      deficits, smoking withdrawal, smoking urges, smoking reward, and a brief, monitored quit
      attempt (~4 days). The key cognitive domains include: working memory, sustained attention,
      and response inhibition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, phase IIa, double-blind, within-subject, cross-over, human laboratory
      study. Subjects will be healthy, treatment-seeking female and male adult smokers, ages 18 to
      65 years old. Subjects deemed eligible for participation after an Intake Visit (~Day -7) will
      complete baseline assessments and receive period 1 medication (ABT-089 or placebo) at the
      Baseline Visit (Day 0). Subjects will take 40mg of ABT-089 or placebo, based on random
      assignment, every day for two identical 10-day study treatment periods.

      Subjects will begin period 1 study medication on Day 1. On Days 3 and 5, subjects will
      complete in-clinic medication run-up and monitoring assessments. On Day 5, subjects will
      begin a ~24-hour period of mandatory abstinence from smoking. Day 6 is conducted in two
      parts. Part 1 will consist of confirmation of smoking abstinence, testing for
      abstinence-induced cognitive deficits and the collection of subjective assessments. Part 2
      will begin with a programmed smoking lapse, after which the subjective rewarding value of the
      programmed lapse cigarette will be assessed. Before leaving the clinic on Day 6, subjects
      will receive brief cessation counseling and be instructed to try to remain abstinent from
      10pm that evening until after the final Observation Visit on Day 10.

      During the ~4-day monitored abstinence/observation phase, subjects will complete in-clinic
      observation visits (subjective assessments, medication adherence, etc.) on Days 7, 8, and 10.

      After a ~3-week medication washout period and Period 2 Medication Pick-up Visit on ~Day 31,
      subjects will begin study medication (either ABT-089 or placebo; but will always be the
      opposite of the assigned study medication in period 1) and participate in period 2 of the
      study following the same procedures as period 1.

    <measure>Change in Abstinence-induced Cognitive Deficits (N-Back Accuracy)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Test Day (Days 6 &amp; 37)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess whether ABT-089 ameliorates the cognitive deficits due to smoking abstinence.
To assess, all subjects will complete a computerized N-Back task during the Testing Day Session (Days 6 &amp; 37) in each study medication period. Each Testing Day session occurs after 24 hours of abstinence from smoking. During one study medication period, subjects will take active ABT-089; during the other period, subjects will take a matched placebo.
Each of the task conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back) will be administered in a pseudorandomized counterbalanced order. Each difficulty level will consist of one block of 50 trials, preceded by a practice block of 20 trials. The primary dependent variables for this task are total number of correct responses (out of 60) and reaction time (milliseconds).
All computerized neurocognitive tasks are completed in a quiet, standardized environment in our clinic.
NOTE: Each PPT completes 1 Baseline (no tx.) and 2 Testing Days (ABT/Placebo)</description>

    <measure>Effects of ABT-089 on Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 6 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), a 20-item Likert-format self-report measure, was used to assess Positive Affect (PA; 10 items, e.g., enthusiastic, strong) and Negative Affect (NA; 10 items, e.g., distressed, upset), two dominant and generally orthogonal dimensions of affect. Scores for the 10 items on each subscale were summed to create summary scores (range: 10-50); higher scores indicate greater intensity of mood (i.e., more positive or more negative affect). Higher ratings of positive affect and lower ratings of negative affect are considered better outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 6 and 37</time_frame>
    <description>MNWS: The Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale - Revised version captures the current state of nicotine withdrawal. The scale assesses 15 items of nicotine withdrawal (including 7 DSM-IV items) such as: dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain. Subjects will rate the intensity of their symptoms on the following scale: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. A &quot;withdrawal discomfort score&quot; was calculated as the sum of the first 9 items (possible range: 0-36) and is a well-validated measure of nicotine withdrawal; a higher score indicates more severe withdrawal.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria.

        Eligible subjects will be:

          1. Male and female smokers who are between 18 and 65 years of age and self-report smoking
             at least 10 cigarettes (menthol and/or non-menthol) per day for at least the last 6
             months.

          2. Healthy as determined by the Study Physician, based on relevant medical history,
             physical examination (including vitals), and basic screening tests (CBC, CHEM7,
             AST/ALT).

          3. Smokers who wish to quit smoking in the next 2-6 months (treatment-seeking), because
             our prior work suggests that motivated subjects are more sensitive to medication
             effects on smoking behavior. Using a scale from 0 to 100 (100, being extremely
             interested), subjects must rate their interest in quitting smoking within the next 6
             months greater than 50.

          4. Able to communicate fluently in English (speaking, writing, and reading).

          5. Plan to live in the area for the next 2 months.

          6. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the combined consent and HIPAA form.

        Exclusion Criteria.

        Subjects who self-report and/or present with the following criteria will not be eligible to
        participate in the study:

          1. Smoking behavior.

               1. Current enrollment or firm plans to quit smoking and/or enroll in a smoking
                  cessation program within the next 2 months.

               2. Current and/or anticipated use of any nicotine substitutes and/or smoking
                  cessation treatments/medications within the next 2 months.

               3. Provide a Carbon Monoxide (CO) reading less than 11 parts per million (ppm) at
                  Intake.

               4. Provide a CO reading of 10 ppm or greater at either Testing Visit (Days 6 and
                  37). If the CO reading is greater than or equal to 10 ppm, but there is a 50%
                  reduction from the CO reading collected at the Baseline/Period 1 Medication
                  Pick-Up Visit, this will be sufficient and the subject may continue as scheduled.

               5. Self-report smoking during the mandatory abstinence period at either Testing
                  Visit (Days 6 and 37).

               6. Regular use of chewing tobacco or snus.

                  at least 6 months or greater.

               2. Current alcohol consumption that exceeds 25 standard drinks/week.

               3. Provide a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) reading of greater than or equal to
                  0.01 at Intake, Baseline/Period 1 Medication Pick-Up, or Testing Visits (Days 6
                  and 37).

                  at Baseline/Period 1 Medication Pick-Up, Period 2 Medication Pick-Up, and
                  Observation Visits on Days 10 and 41. By signing the combined consent and HIPAA
                  form, women of childbearing potential agree to use an approved method of
                  contraception during the study.

               2. Men who do not agree to use an approved method of contraception during the study.
                  Men who are sexually active must be surgically sterile (vasectomy) or using a
                  barrier method (condom) of birth control for the duration of the study. By
                  signing the combined consent and HIPAA form, men agree to use an approved method
                  of contraception.

                  Intake), which correlates with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised
                  (WAIS-R) Estimated IQ Test.

               9. Serious or unstable disease within the past 6 months (i.e., heart disease,
                  liver/kidney failure).

              10. Recent history (last 6 months) of abnormal heart rhythms, tachycardia, and/or
                  cardiovascular disease (stroke, angina, heart attack) may result in
                  ineligibility. These conditions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the
                  Study Physician.

              11. Clinically significant abnormalities determined by physical examination and

        <title>Change in Abstinence-induced Cognitive Deficits (N-Back Accuracy)</title>
        <description>We will assess whether ABT-089 ameliorates the cognitive deficits due to smoking abstinence.
To assess, all subjects will complete a computerized N-Back task during the Testing Day Session (Days 6 &amp; 37) in each study medication period. Each Testing Day session occurs after 24 hours of abstinence from smoking. During one study medication period, subjects will take active ABT-089; during the other period, subjects will take a matched placebo.
Each of the task conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back) will be administered in a pseudorandomized counterbalanced order. Each difficulty level will consist of one block of 50 trials, preceded by a practice block of 20 trials. The primary dependent variables for this task are total number of correct responses (out of 60) and reaction time (milliseconds).
All computerized neurocognitive tasks are completed in a quiet, standardized environment in our clinic.
NOTE: Each PPT completes 1 Baseline (no tx.) and 2 Testing Days (ABT/Placebo)</description>

        <title>Effects of ABT-089 on Mood</title>
        <description>PANAS: The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), a 20-item Likert-format self-report measure, was used to assess Positive Affect (PA; 10 items, e.g., enthusiastic, strong) and Negative Affect (NA; 10 items, e.g., distressed, upset), two dominant and generally orthogonal dimensions of affect. Scores for the 10 items on each subscale were summed to create summary scores (range: 10-50); higher scores indicate greater intensity of mood (i.e., more positive or more negative affect). Higher ratings of positive affect and lower ratings of negative affect are considered better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Effects of ABT-089 on Withdrawal Symptoms</title>
        <description>MNWS: The Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale - Revised version captures the current state of nicotine withdrawal. The scale assesses 15 items of nicotine withdrawal (including 7 DSM-IV items) such as: dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain. Subjects will rate the intensity of their symptoms on the following scale: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. A “withdrawal discomfort score” was calculated as the sum of the first 9 items (possible range: 0-36) and is a well-validated measure of nicotine withdrawal; a higher score indicates more severe withdrawal.</description>

        <title>Change in Abstinence-induced Cognitive Deficits (N-Back Correct Response Time)</title>
        <description>We will assess whether ABT-089 ameliorates the cognitive deficits due to smoking abstinence.
To assess, all subjects will complete a computerized N-Back task during the Testing Day Session (Days 6 &amp; 37) in each study medication period. Each Testing Day session occurs after 24 hours of abstinence from smoking. During one study medication period, subjects will take active ABT-089; during the other period, subjects will take a matched placebo.
Each of the task conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back) will be administered in a pseudorandomized counterbalanced order. Each difficulty level will consist of one block of 50 trials, preceded by a practice block of 20 trials. The primary dependent variables for this task are total number of correct responses (out of 60) and reaction time (milliseconds).
All computerized neurocognitive tasks are completed in a quiet, standardized environment in our clinic.
NOTE: Each PPT completes 1 Baseline (no tx.) and 2 Testing Days (ABT/Placebo)</description>
