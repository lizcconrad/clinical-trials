  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at ways to help young people with chronic health conditions take better
      care of their health and find an adult doctor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing targeted transition-related
      skills through interventions with varying degrees of intensity (from the low intensity Basic
      intervention group, to the mild intensity Group Intervention group, to the high intensity
      Full Intervention group) results in improved transition readiness and self-care skills and
      improved successful transition to adult-based services for young adults with chronic health
      conditions. Secondary objectives include determining if the transition interventions enhance
      transition-related satisfaction among participants, their caregivers and the involved
      pediatric and adult providers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful transition to an adult provider</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is successful transition to an adult provider, as evidenced by at least 1 visit with an adult provider within 10 months of the baseline visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased self-care and transition related skills</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-care and transition related skills will be measured pre- and post- intervention with the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). The TRAQ is a validated 33-item self-administered tool that measures skills needed to progress towards independence in key areas of life like education and work as well as skills needed to successfully transition from pediatric to adult healthcare. The TRAQ will be completed over the phone or via an online survey with young adult participants and their caregivers at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up visit.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported satisfaction with the intervention will be assessed at 6-months post-baseline via a phone interview or online survey.</description>

    <intervention_name>REACH for Independence</intervention_name>
    <description>REACH for Independence is a transition and self-care skill-building peer support group led by a social worker. It is comprised of two 2.5-hour group sessions where participants participate in activities designed to teach self-care, self-advocacy and improve transition to adulthood skills.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transition Consult</intervention_name>
    <description>The transition consult is a 1-on-1 visit with an MD and social worker. At the consults, participants will receive individualized information related to their unique medical and psychosocial needs and support related to issues relevant to their gaining healthcare independence and finding an adult doctor, such as accommodations, transportation, insurance and finances. After the consult, this group will have access to a transition coordinator who can help with any transition-related problems that may occur.</description>

    <description>The Study Materials include a Care Binder, a Resource list, an Adult Doctor List and a Wallet Card. The Care Binder is an organizational tool to help patients with special healthcare needs manage and track important information related to their health and medical care. The Resource list has information about important community resources. The Adult Doctor List provides information about finding an adult primary care provider. The Wallet Card is a sheet for tracking important medical and personal information.</description>
