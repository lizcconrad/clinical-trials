  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction between
      multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and a single dose of metformin. The safety and
      tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.

      This study is an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned
      treatment), fixed sequence (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days),
      single and multiple-dose study to determine how metformin (a blood glucose-lowering agent
      used to treat patients with diabetes) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects
      the drug) and the pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of canagliflozin (a
      drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus). The effect
      of canagliflozin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin will also be
      evaluated. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment
      phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in the study
      for approximately 39 days.
