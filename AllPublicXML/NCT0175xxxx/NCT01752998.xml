      Individuals will be recruited by posted advertisements in the waiting rooms of the PCP
      offices and by physician referral. After an initial phone screen, research staff will meet
      with interested individuals in their PCP offices for informed consent, baseline interview and
      randomization. Participants will be randomized into a Health Education study arm, and receive
      7 individual sessions on general health education, or an Intervention study arm, and receive
      7 individual sessions of the Treating Opioid Patients' Pain and Sadness (TOPPS) intervention.
