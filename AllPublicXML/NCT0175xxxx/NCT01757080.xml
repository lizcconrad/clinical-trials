      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of lipid control during a cardiorespiratory exercise test
      in two subgroups. DESIGN: Parallel trial study. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 40
      elderly people, male and female, divided into two groups: 20 hypertensive (G1; 68.50 ±5.85
      years) and 20 diabetic-hypertensive (G2; 68.95 ±6.79 years). MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional
      status; glucose and lipid controls - postprandial glucose (PPG), triglycerides (TG), total
      cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-C),
      high density lipoprotein (HDL-C); blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory performance. The
      significance level was set at p&lt;0.05.

    <measure>Physical activity level assessment performed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was validated in a Brazilian population and in an interview approach. It contains questions regarding frequency and duration of physical activities, classifying the elderly in four categories: very active, active, irregularly active, and sedentary. The physical activity level was investigated considering two variables: Sedentariness and &quot;Time of moderate intensity activities&quot; (TMIA). The presence of sedentariness was established in those subjects who were classified as sedentary and all other classifications were grouped as absence of sedentariness. The TMIA referred to the time self-reported by the subjects, weekly, in minutes spent in performing moderate intensity activities , calculated according to the answers to questions 2a and 2b from IPAQ, as follows: TMIA = (n days) x (time in min).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of functional capacity was quantitatively analyzed based on the scores obtained in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has as maximum score 27 points, with the following classification: (27-26 points), partially dependent (25-10 points) and dependent (&lt;10 points). The presence of functional decline was seen in those patients who had complete or partial dependence on IADL.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of biochemical determinations</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein early in the morning in a fasting state and assessed by a biochemical laboratory. The measured parameters included: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile (serum triglycerides _ TG, serum total cholesterol _ TC, serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol _ LDL-C, serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol _ HDL-C). Serum biochemistries were performed by automated enzimatic method, under routine laboratory procedures. The LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald formula [22]. The normal values for parameters FPG, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C used in this research were defined by the revised National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).</description>
