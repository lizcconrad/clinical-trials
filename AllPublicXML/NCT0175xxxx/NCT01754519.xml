    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy works in treating post-menopausal
      women with early stage breast cancer undergoing surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x
      rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. For select patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing wide local excision followed
      by single fraction radiation therapy (SFRT), we will evaluate rates of observer-rated
      toxicity, cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction, objective measures of toxicity and
      quality of life as well as delivery of intended dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Locoregional control reported at five years.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo wide local excision breast surgery and SFRT over 60-100 minutes once
      negative margins are obtained.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
