      The purpose of this study is to compare the surgical treatment for sportsman's hernia in our
      department to the current literature. Our hypothesis is that combined solution for the two
      major problems that cause pain in this syndrome - repair the weakness in the posterior wall
      of the inguinal canal with &quot;tension free&quot; technique (mesh repair) and reducing the muscle
      strain on the abdominal wall by cutting, partially, the tendon of the external oblique
      muscle, will shorten the time to return to full physical activity in soccer players.
