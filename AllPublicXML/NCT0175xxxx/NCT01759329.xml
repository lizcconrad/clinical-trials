  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have indicated a positive health impact of coffee. Nevertheless,
      intervention studies testing the effect of daily coffee consumption over a longer period are
      lacking so far. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge about the properties of different
      coffees and their influence on weight development. Therefore, we tested the effect of two
      coffees differing in their alkyl pyridine content over a period of 3 months on weight
      development.

      Participants were randomly associated to two groups, a test coffee group and a control coffee
      group. After coffee abstinence of 1 months, participants in both groups got a coffee machine
      and coffee pads for three months. Clinical data have been assessed before and after coffee
      abstinence and after 3 months of coffee consumption.
