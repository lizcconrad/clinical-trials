  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this pilot study is to determine if a woman who experiences pain during sexual
      intercourse has a higher risk of complications during labor and delivery secondary to pelvic
      floor dysfunction, anxiety and intolerance towards pelvic examinations. Furthermore, it is
      unclear whether women with prepartum dyspareunia experience an improvement following vaginal
      delivery. While physicians may expect that vaginal birth improves dyspareunia due to the
      stretching effect on pelvic floor, to date, there is insufficient evidence to support this
      claim. The Investigators plan to prospectively study 200 patients at our Institution, collect
      information regarding birth and follow them, via questionnaires, regarding their dyspareunia
      postpartum.

    <description>The Investigators will record the mode of delivery (vaginal, instrumental or cesarean section), length of the second stage of labor, use of anesthetics, perineal tears and\or episiotomies, and newborn's birth weight. The evaluation will be done prospectively, comparing data with matched controls without a history of dyspareunia.</description>
