  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single dose, single period study. Approximately 14 subjects will
      receive one dose of 250 mg of non-enteric coated SB-659032 following a low-fat breakfast.
      This study will evaluate whether SB-659032 has an effect on platelet function as determined
      by platelet aggregation tests using the agonists ADP and collagen. Blood samples for PK
      analysis and measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity will also be collected

          -  Body weight greater than 50 kg (110 pounds) and body mass index (BMI) between 19 and
             30 where: BMI = weight in kg (height in meters)2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment,
             laboratory examination or ECG

          -  History of asthma, anaphylaxis or anaphalactoid reactions, severe allergic responses

          -  History of smoking within six months of the study and/or has a positive urine cotinine
             at screening

          -  History of alcohol consumption exceeding, on average, 7 drinks/week for women or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of
             hard liquor) within 6 months of the first dose of study medication

          -  Positive urine drug or alcohol at screening

          -  Use of aspirin, aspirin-containing products, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or
             any antiplatelet medication within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication
             (a list of these drugs will be reviewed with the subject at screening and provided to
             them to take home)

          -  Use of prescription (including hormone replacement therapy) or non-prescription drugs
             and vitamins within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             administration of study medication. An exception is acetaminophen which is allowed at
             doses of less than and equal to 2g/day for up to 48 hours prior to dosing

             to agree to one of the methods of contraception listed in the protocol from screening
             until the completion of follow-up procedures. Hormonal contraceptive methods (e.g.
             oral contraceptive pill, implant) for female subjects are not permitted. At least a
             one week interval between screening and first study drug administration will be
             observed for the pregnancy tests.

          -  For male subjects, an unwillingness to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant
             or lactating women or an unwillingness to use a condom and another form of
             contraception (e.g., IUD, birth control pills taken by female partner, diaphragm with
             spermicide) if engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman who could become pregnant
             until discharge from the study Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days
             prior to dosing

          -  Full ADP- and/or collagen-induced aggregation (greater than and equal to 40%) at all
             three concentrations of one or both agonists, as assessed on Day -1

          -  No ADP- or collagen-induced aggregation (&lt;40%) at the highest concentration of either
             agonist, as assessed on Day -1
