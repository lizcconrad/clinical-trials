  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is primarily to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LigaSure Advance™ Pistol
      Grip and LigaSure™ Blunt Tip using the Force Triad™ Energy Platform during Roux-en-Y and
      gastric reduction procedures (sleeve gastrectomy or placation), respectively. Also, Economic
      value of using LigaSure in gastric surgeries will be appraised.

      In this prospective case series, 60 patients previously scheduled to undergo a Roux-en-Y or
      gastric reduction procedure (sleeve gastrectomy or placation) will have hemostasis controlled
      with LigaSure Advance ™ Pistol Grip or LigaSure™ Blunt Tip, respectively. All subjects
      undergoing Roux-en-Y or gastric reduction procedures (sleeve gastrectomy or placation)
      procedure at Durham Regional Hospital will be recruited.

      Data Analysis will be performed using the data collected in the software program titled
      MetaBar at Duke University Medical Center. Categorical variables will be summarized as
      proportions for each category; continuous measures will be summarized by mean and standard
      deviation or median and range as appropriated for the data distribution. Procedure-related
      risks are those typically associated with gastric procedures and general anesthesia including
      intra-operative bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs and structures. Device
      related risks include those normally associated with the use of electrosurgery including
      intra-operative bleeding, unintended tissue burns, electrical shock, and electrical
      stimulation of muscles and nerves.

    <description>In this prospective observational study, 60 patients scheduled to undergo a Roux-en-Y or gastric reduction procedure (sleeve gastrectomy or plication) will have hemostasis controlled with LigaSure Advance ™ Pistol Grip or LigaSure™ Blunt Tip, respectively. Both devices are regularly used at Duke in the Bariatric Surgery division. The surgeon will select which device is used. There will be no randomization. The device decision tree will be based upon the procedure. Cases that require enterotomy will utilize the AdvanceTM pistol grip. Cases which don't need enterotomy will utilize the 5 Blunt Tip. The LigaSure AdvanceTM pistol grip and LigaSureTM Blunt Tip are used exclusively with the Force TriadTM Energy platform. There is no simultaneous use.</description>
