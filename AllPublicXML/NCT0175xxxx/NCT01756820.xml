  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Single-portal Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel
      Release (Agee technique, SmartRelease™, MicroAire) and mini-open technique (Knifelight®,
      Stryker) are equally effective and safe surgical options for the treatment of primary Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome.
