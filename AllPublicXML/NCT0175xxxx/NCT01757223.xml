  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Phase I/II clinical trial will be used to determine the safety and toxicity of
      direct administration of the vector AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic myocardium and to generate
      preliminary evidence regarding whether direct administration of AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic
      myocardium will induce growth of collateral blood vessels and improve cardiac function. This
      is a three-part, multinational/multi-center, placebo controlled study.

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of heart failure, a major cause of
      death and disability throughout the world. Although prognosis of patients with CAD has been
      greatly improved by advances in cardiovascular treatment, it is still the first cause of
      death in the USA. Treatment options for CAD include diet, exercise, medication, balloon
      angioplasty with or without stenting, atherectomy and bypass surgery. For many patients,
      however, the disease is diffuse and stenting or bypass surgery is not an option. A new
      strategy to treat these patients is to use gene therapy to induce new networks of new blood
      vessels to bypass the arterial system that is blocked, thus providing circulation to deliver
      oxygen needed by the tissue. By administering a gene coding for vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) to the myocardium, new networks of blood vessels can be created using the
      genetic material for VEGF. In experimental animal studies, VEGF is effective at treating
      ischemia of organs and is safe. The most direct method of transferring genes to myocardium is
      by injection under direct vision during a minimally invasive thoracic surgery. For the
      present study, the VEGF gene will be delivered to the myocardium using a modified adenovirus
      (Ad) as a carrier. The study is designed to test the safety and efficacy of AdVEGF-All6A+.
