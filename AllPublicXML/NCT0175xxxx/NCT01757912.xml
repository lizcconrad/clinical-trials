  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endotracheal tube secures free airway in patients undergoing surgical procedures or
      mechanical ventilation. The extraluminal airway needs to be sealed by a cuff. The cuff needs
      to be adequately inflated with air. The cuff pressure should be between 20 and 30 cm H2O. A
      cuff pressure in excess of the target range is associated with a risk of tracheal injury,
      whereas a cuff pressure below the lower limit includes a risk of micro-aspiration of
      subglottic secretions, with risk of subsequent ventilator-associated pneumonia. It is unknown
      whether the cuff pressure changes following changes in body position of the patient. The
      objective of this study is to investigate to which extent - if any - cuff pressures change
      after body position changes of the patient.

    <description>Cuff pressure measurement will be executed with a universal pressure monitor.The patient will be positioned in 16 distinct body positions, immediately after correct positioning, the cuff pressure is measured during an end-expiratory ventilator hold. Cuff pressure is evaluated in the following 16 body positions: anteflexion of the head, hyperextension of the head, left lateral flexion of the head, right lateral flexion of the head, left rotation of the head, right rotation of the head, semirecumbent position with a 45° head of bed elevation, recumbent position with 10° head of bed elevation, horizontal backrest, trendelenburg 10°, left lateral position over 30°, 45° and 90°, and right lateral position over 30°, 45° and 90°.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria are age 18 - 70 years, oral intubation with a taperguard EVAC
        endotracheal tube (Covidien®), conventional mechanical ventilation, adequate sedation
        (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale -5) and analgesia (Behavior Pain Scale 3 to 4).

        Exclusion criteria are factors with potential influence on the cuff pressure or factors
        that disturbed the safety or well-being of the patient: pregnancy, palliative care,
        difficult intubation, decreased mobility of the neck, history of neck surgery, temperature
        of &lt;35°C or &gt;37.5°C, morbid obesity (body mass index &gt;35) and every potential
        contra-indication for position changes such as unstable spinal cord injury or hemodynamic
        and/or respiratory instability.
