      The objective of this study is to collect wound exudate (fluid) swab samples from Subjects
      who have wounds that show clinical signs of infection, as well as from Subjects who have
      wounds that do not show clinical signs of infection. Swab samples will be collected from
      acute and chronic wounds of different etiologies and these will be analysed for bacteria
      types and markers of infection.

    <description>Wound exudate (fluid) swab samples from different etiologies of wounds will be collected. Subjects who have wounds that do not show clinical signs of infection, as well as Subjects who have wounds that do show clinical signs of infection will be enrolled. a maximum of four (4) swab sample from Subjects from whom Informed Consent has been obtained. The swabs will be subjected to various tests methods that may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) quantitative bacterial cultures (for aerobic and / or anaerobic bacteria), 2) &quot;for research use only&quot; testing on test formats currently in development by the sponsor (note: this data will not be used to support regulatory filings, such as CE marking or FDA submissions for U.S. market clearance), 3) molecular microbiology, and 4) protease analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has presented to participating study site with a wound(s) suspected to be
             infected, as determined by the Investigator and/ or study staff - defined as one that
             through clinical judgment has questionable infection status, and /or shows three or
             more of the NERDS or STONES signs of infection);

          -  Subject has presented to participating study site with a wound(s) suspected not to be
             infected, as determined by the Investigator and/ or study staff - defined as one that
             does not show three or more of the NERDS or STONES signs of infection.

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject agrees to complete all aspects of the study and provides Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is less than 18 years of age.

          -  Target wound contains a malignancy

          -  Subject has hypersensitivity of the wound or painful wound surface which prevents
             touching/swabbing of the wound surface.

          -  Subject is confirmed to be positive for HIV or hepatitis.

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.

          -  Subjects deemed inappropriate for the study by the site's Principal Investigator.
