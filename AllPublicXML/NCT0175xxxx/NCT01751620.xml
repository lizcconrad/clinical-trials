  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a two-group randomized repeated measures design that will examine the
      efficacy of Project ACCEPT (Adolescents Coping, Connecting, Empowering and Protecting
      Together) to improve engagement in care among youth newly diagnosed with HIV at five AMTU
      sites across the United States. Youth will be randomized into one of two study arms; Project
      ACCEPT, the intervention, or HEALTH, the health education attention-controlled comparison
      condition. Both arms consist of two individual sessions followed by six group sessions and a
      final individual session which is expected to take approximately nine weeks after which youth
      will have four follow-up visits at the following time points:

        -  post intervention (immediately after the last session);

        -  3 months post the last session;

        -  6 months post the last session; and

        -  12 months post the last session. The trial will be repeated in up to three waves.

    <description>Conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of Project ACCEPT compared with an attention-controlled health education comparison intervention (HEALTH). The goals of the intervention are to improve engagement in care, decrease psychosocial barriers to care, and decrease sexual risk for youth newly diagnosed with HIV.</description>
