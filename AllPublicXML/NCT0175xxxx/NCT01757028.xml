    <textblock>
      Improving maternal and infant mortality are key priorities in Kenya and internationally. This
      study aims to establish a hospital-based surveillance system for pregnant women so that the
      contribution of risk factors (HIV and other infections, maternal nutrition, sepsis, malaria
      and anaemia) to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality can be accurately assessed. All
      mothers who are admitted to Kilifi District Hospital will be invited to enrol in the study.
      Routine clinical data from maternal admissions for delivery will be systematically collected
      using a standardised admissions procedure. Analysis will be carried out for the risk factor
      effects of HIV, maternal nutrition, malaria infection, bacterial infection, and anaemia on
      maternal and infant outcomes after adjusting for other factors (mode of delivery, age, and
      parity etc). Subsequent morbidity and survival of mothers and infants, and the later
      consequences to children's health will be monitored through the Kilifi epi-DSS. Samples for
      research purposes will be collected for detailed future studies of particular pathogens and
      risk factors, such as malaria parasite strain, bacterial species and HIV-induced
      immunological impairment. This will be the first prospective study in sub-Saharan Africa
      (sSA) to assess the effect of these risk factors on both maternal and infant health together,
      and that considers both short and long term outcomes. Information generated by the study will
      be used by the maternity department in a rolling audit that will help improve care. The study
      will therefore improve care of new mothers and infants attending the Kilifi District Hospital
      as well as informing health planning so that future interventions for maternal and child
      health are targeted more effectively.
