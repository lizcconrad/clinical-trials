  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical hepatic resection represents one of the treatment options offering a prospect for
      cure with 5-year survival rates up to 50%. However, unintentionally, quite a proportion of
      these &quot;radical resection&quot; actually turned out to be non-radical in nature. For these patients
      who actually received non-radical resection, their by year survival rates were much lower
      than those who received radical hepatectomy. In this prospective, non-interventional,
      multi-center study, we are planning to observe the patient characteristics of Hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) patients who have residual disease after resection with curative intent, as
      well as treatment pattern, safety and effectiveness of sorafenib for these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed HCC and have residual disease after resection
             with curative intent and for whom a decision to treat with Sorafenib has been made.

        The definitions of non-radical resection are as follows:

        Liver tumor rupture or adjacent organ invasion, confirmed by intra-operative or
        post-operative pathology; Positive resection margin, confirmed by post- operative
        pathology; Lymph node metastasis confirmed by intra-operative or post- operative pathology;
        Residue lesion confirmed by post-operative digital subtraction angiography (DSA);
        Macroscopic/microscopic tumor thrombi of vein and/or bile duct, confirmed intraoperative /
        post-operative pathology; Number of tumors &gt;=3, confirmed by preoperative radiographic
        inspection (CT, MRI or BUS), intraoperative BUS, or post-operative pathology.

        AFP alpha fetoprotein(AFP) remains higher than Upper Limits of Normal (according to local
        lab's range), confirmed by local laboratory test at least 2 months after surgery.

          -  Confirmation of complete response (no visible residual tumor), on the eligibility scan
             (CT or MRI) by local radiological review, performed &gt;2 weeks after surgery;

          -  Patients must be followed up regularly after surgery (time interval and method based
             on physician's daily practice), have no documented tumor recurrence by eligibility
             scan (CT or MRI) before Sorafenib treatment;

          -  Patients must have physically/mentally recovered from surgery and considered to be
             able to tolerant Sorafenib therapy, by investigator's judgment;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The approved local product label must be followed for the exclusion criteria
