      The investigators will generate pressure-flow loops and pressure-volume loops from aortic and
      left ventricular pressure waveforms and Doppler (desc. aorta) flow waveforms and compare left
      ventricular to arterial pressure-flow and pressure-volume loops as well as to cardiac power
      from the USCOM 1A device. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that non-invasive
      estimates of cardiac pressure-volume work (derived from ultrasound-based measurements)
      correlate with invasive estimates.

    <textblock>
      Extensive animal work by Suga et al. in the 1980s clearly demonstrate a relationship between
      left ventricular pressure volume area (PVA) and myocardial consumption of oxygen (MVO2).

      PVA can be measured by combining radial artery pressures with ultrasound-derived estimates of
      aortic blood flow. Because the aorta and peripheral artery compartments are separated from
      the left ventricle by the aortic valve, the peripheral arterial pressures cannot perfectly
      approximate left ventricular pressures. However, because the majority of variation in the
      pressure volume loops is made up of changes in height and width (changes in the left
      ventricular end-diastolic curve are, by contrast, relatively small), both of which can be
      readily detected by changes in the peripheral arterial blood pressure tracing, this loss of
      information may be clinically insignificant.

      USCOM, has developed a portable suprasternal Doppler probe (model 1A) capable of estimating
      left ventricular stroke volume; a unique feature of this device is its ability to utilize
      both stroke volume, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure in an attempt to measure cardiac
      power. This device has not been validated against invasive estimates of cardiac power.

      Knowledge of MVO2 would be a useful clinical variable but is not widely available. The
      ability to non-invasively estimate MVO2 intraoperatively would give anesthesiologists the
      ability to measure the effect of hemodynamic interventions on myocardial consumption of
      oxygen and, when combined with stroke volume, estimate myocardial efficiency. Non-invasively
      estimates of MVO2 may also allow cardiologists a novel means of assessing the myocardium of
      patients with cardiovascular disease.

    <description>The primary hypothesis of this study is that the slope of the regression line between left ventricular pressure volume area (PVA, as determined by simultaneous measurement of aortic outflow and left ventricular pressures) and aortic PVA (as determined by simultaneous measurement of aortic outflow and radial artery pressure) is not zero. The null hypothesis is that the probability that the slope of the regression line is different from a line with a slope of 0 is greater than 5%.</description>
