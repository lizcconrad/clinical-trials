      The purpose of this study is to see if using a form of imaging during surgery helps the
      doctors to guide the placement of radiation catheters more accurately.

      This method, called &quot;image-guided surgical navigation&quot; may allow the doctors to deliver
      radiation to the tumor that the patient needs and decrease the amount of radiation delivered
      to the nearby areas.

    <description>This pilot study is an investigation into the use of Ir-192 high dose rate (HDR) afterloader-based brachytherapy with catheter placement using image-guided surgical navigation techniques for patients with painful/symptomatic metastatic or recurrent lesions in the spine and/or pelvis that have been maximally treated with external beam radiation therapy.</description>

    <description>Patients will be followed at 2 months (+/- 2 weeks) post-treatment and then approximately every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) until approximately 11 months of follow up. They will be evaluated for pain referable to the treated site, clinical and radiographic evidence of local progression, and treatment related toxicity. Thereafter, patients will be followed as clinically indicated.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologic proof of a malignancy suitable for radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must have received prior external beam radiation therapy to the region
             proposed for HDR brachytherapy treatment; evaluation of doses previously delivered to
             spinal cord/cauda equine, pelvis, and other critical structures (bowel, kidneys,
             rectum) will be taken into consideration.

          -  If repeat irradiation would exceed any normal tissue constraint set by MSKCC Radiation
             Oncology Department dose constraint criteria, the patient will potentially be
             eligible.

          -  If the total prior radiation dose to the cord or pelvis exceeds 100 Gy BED equivalent,
             the patient will be potentially eligible, where a total of 100 BED Gy equivalent is
             determined by the biological equivalent dose (BED) calculation; BED = nd(1 + d/α/β),
             where n = number of fractions and d = dose per fraction; α/β is the constant for
             spinal cord late effect and equals 2. [Rades 2005, Nieder 2005, Sahgal 2012]

          -  KPS ≥ 60

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who may receive therapeutically effective doses via an external beam approach
             to the lesion of interest as specified by MSKCC Radiation Oncology Department dose
             constraint criteria.

          -  Patients with kyphoplasty cement or hardware that would preclude effective catheter
             placement.

          -  Patients with paraspinal extension of disease with visceral involvement.

          -  Abnormal complete blood count. Any of the following:

          -  Platelet count &lt; 75,000/ml

          -  Hb level &lt; 9gm/dl

          -  WBC &lt; 3.5/ml

          -  Abnormal coagulation profile: INR &gt; 2.5 and/or PTT &gt; 80

          -  Patients who are on anticoagulation medication that may not be safely held for the
             procedure (≥ 5 days for antiplatelet agents and warfarin; ≥ 24 hours for low-molecular
             weight heparin formulations) will be excluded.

          -  Contraindications to general anesthesia

            <description>This pilot study is an investigation into the use of Ir-192 high dose rate (HDR) afterloader-based brachytherapy with catheter placement using image-guided surgical navigation techniques for patients with painful/symptomatic metastatic or recurrent lesions in the spine and/or pelvis that have been maximally treated with external beam radiation therapy.
Ir-192 high dose rate (HDR): Patients will be followed at 2 months (+/- 2 weeks) post-treatment and then approximately every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) until approximately 11 months of follow up. They will be evaluated for pain referable to the treated site, clinical and radiographic evidence of local progression, and treatment related toxicity. Thereafter, patients will be followed as clinically indicated.</description>
