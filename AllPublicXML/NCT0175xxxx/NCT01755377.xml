  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America, and is of emerging importance in non-endemic
      countries because migration of people infected with T. cruzi. Current methods for diagnosis
      of T. cruzi infection are not ideal. Existing drugs for treatment are very limited, produce
      severe side-effects, and their effectiveness cannot be properly evaluated. Reliable
      biomarkers for prognosis, early diagnosis and effectiveness of treatment will be
      investigated.
