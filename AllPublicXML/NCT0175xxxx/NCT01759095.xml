      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit of patients using a multidrug blister
      packs after discharged from an university hospital to their homes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typical adherence rates for oral prescription medications are approximately 50-76%.
      Insufficient adherence causes an increase in morbidity, mortality, and costs, and decreases
      quality of life of patients. Multidrug blister packs are recommended to improve adherence and
      are widely used in Switzerland. However, evidence is poor and patient-relevant endpoints are
      seldom measured. This study was designed to compare patient-relevant outcomes in patients
      with medication repackaged in multidrug blister packs versus patients with medication
      dispensed in commercially available packages. Adherence of the intervention group will be
      monitored electronically and feedback will be given to the patients. The intervention will
      take place in a study pharmacy. Follow-up visits will take place at the study pharmacy at 3,
      6, and 12 months for all patients. Study duration will be 12 months.

    <description>At hospital discharge, patients will get their prescribed drugs repackaged in an electronic multidrug blister pack with 7x4 cavities. The electronic film affixed on the rear side measures the date and time when a loop is broken, i.e. when a cavity is emptied. Patients will get feedback on their adherence profiles at the community pharmacy.</description>
