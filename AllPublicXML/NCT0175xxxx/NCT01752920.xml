    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2, dose escalation and signal finding study of ARQ 087
      administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations, including
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) with FGFR2 gene fusion. The study is designed to
      explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
      efficacy of ARQ 087 and to define a RP2D of ARQ 087.

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive ARQ 087 orally at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 25 mg every other day (QOD) and will escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28 day) intervals until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment will be permitted.</description>
