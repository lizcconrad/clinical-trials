    <textblock>
      Deciding about prolonged life support for critically ill patients can be very difficult.
      Therefore, the investigators are doing a study to see if an internet-based decision aid can
      improve the quality of decision making for substitute decision makers of patients who are in
      the intensive care unit (ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The process of making a decision about whether or not to provide prolonged life support is
      seriously deficient among clinicians and the surrogate decision makers for critically ill
      patients. To address this problem, we propose a randomized, controlled trial to determine if
      an innovative web-based decision aid compared to usual care control can improve the quality
      of decision making (defined as clinician-surrogate concordance for prognosis, quality of
      communication, and medical comprehension), reduce surrogates' psychological distress
      (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder (PTSD) symptoms), and
      reduce patients' health care costs over 6-month follow up. We will enroll 410 surrogate
      decision makers for 273 patients (expected average of 1.5 surrogates per patient). This study
      has the potential both to improve how clinicians and surrogates interact in intensive care
      units and to increase the likelihood that life support decisions are aligned with patients'
      values.

        Inclusion Criteria (Patient characteristics required for surrogate inclusion)

          -  age ≥18

          -  ≥10 days of mechanical ventilation interrupted by &lt;96 continuous hours of unassisted
             breathing (including invasive and non-invasive ventilation)

          -  no anticipation of imminent (24 hours) death or extubation by the attending.

        Exclusion Criteria (Patient characteristics that will exclude surrogates from study
        enrollment):

          -  possession of decisional capacity

             interviews

          -  imminent organ transplantation

          -  chronic neuromuscular disease
