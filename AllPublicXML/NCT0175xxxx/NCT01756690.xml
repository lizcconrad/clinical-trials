  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A certain molecule floating in the blood may represent a risk of lung injury after a
      transfusion. We are determining whether detection of this molecule on a simple blood clotting
      test will predict the development of lung injury due to transfusion in bleeding patients with
      chronic liver disease.
