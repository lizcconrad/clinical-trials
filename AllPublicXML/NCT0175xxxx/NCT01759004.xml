  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of lipoedema and obesity are often mixed up, unclear stated and often there is
      a misdiagnosis. The primary aim is to investigate whether there is a difference in muscle
      strength between women with lipedema and women with obesity. The secondary aim is to
      investigate whether there is a difference in physical fitness between women with lipedema and
      women with obesity.

    <textblock>
      Lipedema is a genetically mediated disorder of adipose tissue that occurs exclusively in
      women. Lipedema is an under-recognized condition, often misdiagnosed as lymfedema or
      dismissed as simple obesity. The diagnosis of lipedema is a clinical diagnosis and may be
      challenging to determine among patients who are obese. Measurements of muscle strength and
      physical fitness may give more clarity to differentiate between lipedema and obesity. This
      may lead to improvements in the criteria of diagnosing lipedema. The research question of the
      study is: Is there a difference in muscle strength between adult women with lipedema and
      adult women with obesity?

      In this study 40 patients will be studied; 20 patients in every group. Besides the general
      data as length, weight, age, abdominal circumference, volume of the legs additional muscle
      strength and physical fitness of women with lipedema and women with obesity will be measured
      and analysis.

      This study doesn't involve a negligible risk for participants. The study will not have direct
      benefit for the participants, but may be useful in giving more clarity in defining the
      phenotype for patients with lipedema.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main determinant of this study is a muscle strength test of the Quadriceps muscle of the left and right leg measured with the MircoFET.</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2013</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength will be measured with the MicroFET. This test is performed when de patient is sitting. The patient is instructed to perform knee extension three times for each leg. The test result is de average score of each leg. The MicroFET has been shown to be a valid measurement with the break-method.14,15 Schaubert et al.15 and Bohannon et al.14 looked at the reliability of MicroFET measurements and found a good Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values of 0.807-0.97115 and ICC&gt;.097014 respectively. The test procedure of the break-method is described in Appendix 1).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>walking capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2013</time_frame>
    <description>After performing the muscle strength test, the participants will be asked to perform a test for physical fitness, knowing the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Walking capacity will be measured with the 6MWT. This standardized test is performed on a 30 meters course where every five meter is marked. The patient will be instructed to cross a maximum distance in six minutes with a possibility to stop or rest if necessary.16 The result is the walking distance in meters (m) after six minutes (with five meter exactness). The 6MWT is a good test for functional activity. De walking distance performed with the 6MWT gives a good sight in the amount of activities in daily living (ADL) of the performer.17 Rjeski et al.17 found a good validity and correlation with the VO2max (r=0.64) for participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The test-retest reliability of this test is good (ICC 0.94).18</description>
