  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the predictive value of rapid virological response
      (RVR) and early virological response (EVR) on sustained virological response (SVR) by stage
      of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 initiated
      on treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (ribavirin). Patients will be
      followed for 48 weeks of treatment and up to 24 weeks of follow-up.
