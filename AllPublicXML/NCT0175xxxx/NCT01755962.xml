  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is prompted by the urgent public health need to identify novel strategies to
      prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The higher prevalence of CVD,
      T2D, and metabolic syndrome in obese individuals is a major healthcare concern. Therefore,
      finding optimal intervention strategies to combat these growing epidemics is imperative.

      At present, the extent to which dietary components can modify endothelial function, monocyte
      inflammation and glycemic variations is not well defined, although different carbohydrates
      are known to vary in their abilities to induce plasma glucose and insulin responses.
      Epidemiologic work suggests that high dietary glycemic load (GL) is associated with increased
      concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction markers, and increased risk
      of T2D and coronary heart disease (CHD). We are examining using randomized control trials low
      vs. high-GL diet to determine if low-GL diets induce improvements in endothelial function or
      monocyte inflammation. Furthermore, resistance training is an alternate form of exercise from
      conventional aerobic training. Resistance Training has the potential to improve endothelial
      function or monocyte phenotype, but there is very little data in this area. We hypothesize
      that resistance training may augment the beneficial effects of a low-GL diet in improving
      metabolic health.

    <description>Monocytes will be isolated from subject whole blood and will be phenotyped in 2 ways: 1) as pro- or anti-inflammatory based on flow-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of monocyte-specific markers TLR-4, CD14 and CD16.
Serum-Stimulated Cell Culture. Subject serum will be incubated with L6 cells as we have previously performed in monocytes and adipocytes as well as endothelial cells 18, 130. Following 48 hr incubation, cellular insulin-stimulated glucose transport will be assayed as described 129 and conditioned medium assayed for myokine levels (ex. IL-15, 1L-6, etc).
Fasting plasma (and conditioned media where appropriate) will be taken to determine a panel of adipokines and hormones (e.g. insulin, adiponectin, HSP-72, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, CRP, 8-iso PGF2α) will be measured using the Millipore Multiplex assay kit or with specific ELISA kits</description>
