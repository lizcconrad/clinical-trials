  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) need to receive medications that treat
      both diseases safely and effectively. This study will enroll infants and children infected
      with HIV and TB and evaluate the safety and tolerance of an antiretroviral (ARV) treatment
      regimen for HIV that contains raltegravir when administered with a TB treatment regimen that
      includes rifampicin. Study researchers will also determine the most effective dose of
      raltegravir for infants and children when it is taken with rifampicin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with HIV are also at risk for becoming infected with TB, particularly
      in many resource-limited settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa. Rifampicin is a medication
      commonly used to treat TB. There is a need for HIV treatment regimens that contain newer ARV
      medications that are well-tolerated and have minimal interactions with rifampicin-containing
      TB medication regimens. This study will enroll HIV-infected infants and children who have
      never taken any ARV medications or who have not received ARVs for at least 30 days prior to
      study entry and who are infected with TB and are taking or will be starting a TB medication
      regimen that includes rifampicin. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerance of raltegravir-containing ARV regimens to treat HIV when administered with a
      rifampicin-containing regimen to treat TB in infants and children. Study researchers will
      also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the medications (i.e., how medication is absorbed and
      processed in the body) and determine the most effective dose of raltegravir when it is
      administered with a TB regimen that contains rifampicin.

      During the study, researchers will continuously monitor participant data for safety and other
      factors. Researchers may adjust the dose of raltegravir given to participants prior to
      enrolling additional participants.

      At study entry, participants will undergo a medical and medication history review, physical
      examination, medication adherence assessment, blood collection, and urine collection.
      Participants will receive chewable raltegravir tablets twice daily, and they will also take
      their TB medications, including rifampicin, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) ARV medications that will be chosen by participants' doctors. This study
      will provide raltegravir to participants; all other medications will be prescribed by
      participants' own doctors.

      At a study visit at Days 5 to 8, participants will remain in the clinic for about 12 hours.
      They will take part in the same study procedures that occurred at the entry visit, but they
      will also have small amounts of blood collected several times throughout the 12 hours to
      measure the amount of medication in the blood. After the Day 5 to 8 visit, participants will
      begin receiving a fourth ARV medication chosen by their doctor, in addition to the other
      medications. Participants will continue receiving raltegravir until they stop taking their TB
      medications. They will continue to take the third ARV medication and the other two ARV
      medications for 3 months after they stop receiving raltegravir and the TB medications.

      Additional study visits will occur at Day 14, Weeks 4 and 8, every 4 weeks until the
      participant stops receiving raltegravir and the TB medications, and 4 and 12 weeks after
      stopping raltegravir and the TB medications. These study visits will include the same study
      procedures that occurred at study entry. Participants will be enrolled in the study for a
      total of about 4 to 9 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 4 weeks to less than 12 years at entry

          -  Weight greater than or equal to 3.5 kg at entry

          -  Confirmation of HIV-1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples
             collected at different time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or
             plasma. For studies conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND), all test
             methods should be Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved if available. If
             FDA-approved methods are not available, test methods should be verified according to
             good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) and approved by the IMPAACT Laboratory
             Center. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  ARV treatment naïve or has not received ARVs for at least 30 days prior to entry.
             Note: Participants with prior exposure to ARVs for prevention of mother-to-child
             transmission (PMTCT) or treatment - regardless of duration - are eligible provided the
             participant has not received ARVs for at least 30 days prior to entry. The reasons for
             interruption could include drug toxicity, poor adherence, or treatment failure that
             preceded enrollment and has not been imposed by study staff. ARVs should not be
             withheld for the purposes of enrollment into the study and against the participant's
             best interest.

          -  ARV treatment eligible as defined by:

               1. Country-specific guidelines OR

               2. World Health Organization (WHO) pediatric treatment algorithm
                  (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/208825/1/9789241549684_eng.pdf?ua=1)

          -  Diagnosis of pulmonary TB or TB adenitis. More information on this criterion can be
             found in the protocol.

          -  Participant has initiated at least a 2-drug TB regimen containing rifampicin, and has
             tolerated at least 1 week of the TB drug regimen prior to initiation of raltegravir.
             Note: TB treatment may be started after being diagnosed by the site investigator.
             Treatment regimens may include isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin in
             addition to rifampicin. ART should ideally be started within 2 weeks of starting TB
             treatment. A patient who has started therapy for TB elsewhere but has not yet been
             started on ART is eligible for enrollment provided they have not had greater than 20
             weeks of TB therapy. Delay between starting TB treatment and ART is not encouraged,
             and local or international guidelines should be followed for managing TB and HIV
             coinfection in infants and children.

          -  Female participant who is of child bearing potential and sexually active has agreed to
             use two reliable methods of contraception, including a medically accepted barrier
             method of contraception (e.g., female/male condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with a
             cream or gel that kills sperm (excluding nonoxydyl-9), intrauterine device [IUD],
             others) together with another reliable form of contraception while on study and for 4
             weeks after stopping RAL

          -  Parent, legal guardian, or designated guardian according to country-specific
             guidelines able and willing to provide signed informed consent and to have the
             participant followed at the clinical site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to Grade 2 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) at screening, which must be within 30 days of entry. Note:
             Participants can be re-screened provided that they will have at least 4 weeks of TB
             treatment remaining at the time of entry.

          -  Any greater than or equal to Grade 4 clinical toxicity or laboratory result at
             screening except fever, chills, fatigue or malaise, unintentional weight loss, and
             dyspnea or respiratory distress that could be associated with TB

          -  Acute, serious infections other than TB requiring active treatment (e.g., Pneumocystis
             jirovecii [previously Pneumocystis carinii] pneumonia [PCP], cryptococcal meningitis,
             etc.). Infants and children diagnosed with acute bacterial pneumonia at time of
             diagnosis of TB may be included. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections will be
             allowed.

          -  Diagnosis of Kwashiorkor (less than 80% expected weight-for-age with the presence of
             edema and hypoalbuminemia)

          -  Known or suspected MDR or XDR TB, including contact with a documented MDR or XDR TB
             source case, as these may require longer duration of therapy or non-rifampicin
             containing regimen. Note: Participants found to have MDR or XDR TB before or during
             the study will be informed of their illness and referred for appropriate care as
             determined by local guidelines.

          -  Current TB regimen containing rifabutin, macrolides, and any other anti-mycobacterial
             agents with known interactions with raltegravir

          -  Any clinically significant diseases (other than HIV and TB infection) or clinically
             significant findings during the screening medical history or physical examination
