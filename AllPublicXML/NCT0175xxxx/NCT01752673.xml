  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical reasoning is a form of inquiry that examines the thought processes involved in making
      medical decisions. When physicians are faced with patients' symptoms or signs, their thought
      processes follow either direct shortcuts to suspect a diagnosis or go into a deeper and more
      analytic process to reach a diagnosis. The second pathway is less prone to biases and errors.
      This study explores whether the use of an interactive visual display of probabilities of
      pulmonary embolism generated from positive or negative test results will increase the
      adherence to evidence based guidelines in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
