  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the outcome of a combined bone marrow and kidney
      transplant from a partially matched related (haploidentical or &quot;haplo&quot;) donor. This is a
      pilot study, you are being asked to participate because you have a blood disorder and kidney
      disease. The aim of the combined transplant is to treat both your underlying blood disorder
      and kidney disease. We expect to have about 10 people participate in this study.

      Additionally, because the same person who is donating the kidney will also be donating the
      bone marrow, there may be a smaller chance of kidney rejection and less need for long-term
      use of anti-rejection drugs.

      Traditionally, very strong cancer treatment drugs (chemotherapy) and radiation are used to
      prepare a subject's body for bone marrow transplant. This is associated with a high risk for
      serious complications, even in subjects without kidney disease. This therapy can be toxic to
      the liver, lungs, mucous membranes, and intestines. Additionally, it is believed that
      standard therapy may be associated with a higher risk of a complication called graft versus
      host disease (GVHD) where the new donor cells attack the recipient's normal body. Recently,
      less intense chemotherapy and radiation regimens have been employed (these are called reduced
      intensity regimens) which cause less injury and GVHD to patients, and thus, have allowed
      older and less healthy patients to undergo bone marrow transplant. In this study, a reduced
      intensity regimen of chemotherapy and radiation will be used with the intent of producing
      fewer toxicities than standard therapy.

      Typical therapy following a standard kidney transplant includes multiple lifelong medications
      that aim to prevent the recipient's body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney.
      These are called immunosuppressant drugs and they work by &quot;quieting&quot; the recipient's immune
      system to allow the donated kidney to function properly. One goal in our study is to decrease
      the duration you will need to be on immunosuppressant drugs following your kidney transplant
      as the bone marrow transplant will provide you with the donor's immune system which should
      not attack the donor kidney.
