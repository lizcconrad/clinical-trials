  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the
      drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of increasing doses of
      canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy obese volunteers.

      This study will be a single-center, randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance),
      double-blind (neither investigator nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned
      treatment), placebo-controlled (one of the study medications is inactive), ascending multiple
      dose study (increasing doses of study medication) to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus) in otherwise healthy obese volunteers. The study will consist of 3
      phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and an end of study (or follow-up)
      phase. Volunteers will be assigned to 5 cohorts (groups) made up of 16 otherwise healthy
      obese men and women. Within each group, 12 volunteers will be given canagliflozin once or
      twice daily and 4 volunteers will be given placebo (inactive medication) once or twice daily
      for 14 days. The dose of canagliflozin will be different for each of the 5 groups and the
      second group will not begin treatment until at least 21 days after the first group start
      treatment. This 21-day gap will be applied to all subsequent groups. Each volunteer will
      participate in the study for approximately 58 days.

    <time_frame>Day -2 up to Day 17</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) scores will be obtained from the VAS questionnaire. In the VAS questionnaire, volunteers mark a point on a line (drawn between 2 statements) to indicate how they feel about the statements. The statements about hunger are as follows: &quot;I am not hungry at all&quot; and &quot;I have never been hungrier&quot;. Other statements relate to satiety (feeling satisfied), feeling full and prospective food consumption. Scores will be compared following escalating doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754).</description>

    <measure>Renal threshold for glucose excretion</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 17</time_frame>
    <description>The point at which glucose starts to appear in the urine is known as the renal threshold. The way in which the renal threshold varies in relation to the dose of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) will be calculated.</description>
