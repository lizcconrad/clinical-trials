    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that there will be a significant increase of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12) in the stool of healthy
      humans following daily consumption of a probiotic supplement containing these specific
      strains of probiotic bacteria.
