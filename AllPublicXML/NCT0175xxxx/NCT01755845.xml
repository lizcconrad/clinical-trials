    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of consolidation
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus cisplatin (2 cycles per 3 weeks) following radical
      hysterectomy and adjuvant chemoradiation (2 cycles per 4 weeks) for high risk early stage
      cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. Early stage
      cervical cancer can be treated effectively with either radiotherapy or radical hysterectomy
      plus pelvic lymph node dissection. However, several pathological risk factors, such as lymph
      node metastasis, the involvement of vaginal resection margin, and the parametrial invasion,
      have been identified to compromise the patient prognosis.

      Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment
      for patients with cervical cancer. However, many patients with pathological risk factors
      treated with concurrent radiotherapy plus single agent cisplatin still suffered from the
      local or distant relapse. How to improve the treatment outcome of these patients is a very
      important issue and requires further clinical investigation.

      Paclitaxel has been demonstrated to be a good radiosensitizer. In addition,
      paclitaxel/cisplatin combination chemotherapy was demonstrated to have superior
      progression-free survival than platinum alone in some phase Ⅱ studies. In addition, it is not
      yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with
      consolidation chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer.

      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of
      postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy with
      consolidation chemotherapy in high-risk patients with early-stage cervical cancer following
      radical hysterectomy.

    <description>Patients in this arm will postoperatively receive paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 d1 and cisplatin 25mg/m2 d1-3 intravenously every 4 weeks with radiation. Radiotherapy consisted of 46-50 gray (5 x 2.0 gray/week) on pelvic area. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 d1 and cisplatin 25mg/m2 d1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
