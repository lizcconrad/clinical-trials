  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess changes in breast appearance, graft retention and quality of
      life over one year in patients who have received direct autologous adipose tissue injection
      for the treatment of objectionable post-surgical breast deformities. These patients have
      undergone the resection of breast tissue to treat either benign or malignant breast disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the past decade there has been increased awareness of the potential of free adipose
      cell grafting to treat a variety of problems in both reconstructive and cosmetic plastic
      surgery. There have been encouraging reports describing the use of autologous fat grafts (fat
      tissue harvested by standard liposuction techniques in a given patient and then re-injected
      at another site) for treating breast deformities in the setting of benign and previously
      treated malignant breast problems.

      There has been a corresponding large scale laboratory investigation effort into the potential
      of adipose derived stem cells (ADSC's) harvested during liposuction and induced to
      differentiate into various cell types in the mesenchymal cell line. The potential clinical
      utility of these cells in the treatment of patients who present with a breast deformity after
      segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy) and radiation therapy has been described, but not studied
      in rigorous prospective manner.

      The investigators believe that the clinical use of these autologous fat cell grafts have
      unique advantages in the treatment of breast deformities. The technique is minimally
      invasive, easily repeated and is associated with minimal surgical morbidity (indeed it may
      have the advantage of improving the appearance of both the breast deformity and the area from
      which they are harvested), it typically displays a rapid recovery, a complication rate that
      is no greater (and probably less than ) established and currently used surgical treatment(s)
      of these breast problems, and is oncologically safe.
