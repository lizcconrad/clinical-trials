    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of AMG 151 on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and glucose levels in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are on a stable regimen of metformin alone,
      metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4), metformin and a thiazolidinedione
      (TZD), or metformin, a DPP4, and a TZD for a minimum of 3 months prior to randomization.
