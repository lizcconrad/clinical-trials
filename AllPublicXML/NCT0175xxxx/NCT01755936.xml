  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common adult valvular heart disease in the western world. Heart
      failure and sudden cardiac death are complications associated with aortic stenosis. In
      symptomatic individuals, valve replacement is often the only effective treatment. However,
      there are no good markers to identify patients who may benefit from early surgery before
      symptoms developed. The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that the presence
      heart muscle scarring on the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may predict a worse outcome
      in patients with aortic stenosis, and thus may be helpful in identifying patients for early
      valve replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death are associated complications of aortic
      stenosis. Currently, the indications for valvular replacement are based on the valvular
      severity evaluated by echocardiography and the presence of symptoms. There is some evidence
      to suggest the presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with a poor outcome in patients
      with aortic stenosis. The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the prognostic
      implications of myocardial fibrosis in patients with aortic stenosis. The presence of
      myocardial fibrosis will be identified by delayed enhancement with the cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging at 3T. We will also be evaluating the application of T1 mapping techniques
      to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis.
