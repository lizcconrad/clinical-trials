      capsule for sinus bradycardia complicated with ventricular premature beats.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ventricular contractions is one of the most common symptomatic arrhythmia.
      Antiarrhythmia drugs for premature ventricular contractions, such as beta-blockers and sodium
      channel blockers, can cause bradycardia. For sinus bradycardia patients complicated with
      premature ventricular contractions, it's hard for doctors to make decision. The purpose of
      the study is to assess the effects of Chinese medicine Shansong Yangxin capsule for sinus
      bradycardia complicated with ventricular premature beats, which based on the numbers of
      premature ventricular contractions and average hear rate in 24-hour ambulatory
      electrocardiogram (ECG) after 8 weeks treatment as the primary endpoint of the study.
      Secondary endpoints are evaluation of the Shensong Yangxin capsule on quality of life. This
      study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center trial. Sinus
      bradycardia patients(average heart rate 45-59 beat per minute) associated with premature
      ventricular contractions (PVC number &gt;10000 / 24h), are involved in the study. Patients are
      randomly assigned into Shensong Yangxin capsule group or placebo group, with the capsule
      administration of 4 granules t.i.d.for 8 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory ECG, are observed at
      baseline,4 weeks and 8 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcomes are the numbers of
      premature ventricular contractions and average heat rate in 24-hour ambulatory ECG, and the
      secondary outcomes is Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ).
