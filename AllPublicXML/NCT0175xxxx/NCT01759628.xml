      The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of helicobacter pylori eradication on liver
      function tests, lipid profile, homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) index, and
      anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference)in subjects with
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) antigens have been found in the liver of individuals with benign and
      malignant liver diseases. The role of HP in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) is controversial.

      This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in dyspeptic patients with positive
      antibody to HP and the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other
      causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to
      have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and positive urea breath
      test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or
      lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy (omeprazole,
      amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was performed in two
      weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Fasting serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase,
      aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, cholesterol, high and
      low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-IR, and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist
      circumference) were checked at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve weeks from the beginning of
      study.
