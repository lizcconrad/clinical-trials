    <description>After 45 and 90 days using Propolis or chlorhexidine at home, the individuals will return for a clinical evaluation. Alterations in gingival conditions will be analyzed ,both points of comparison products will be based on the Plaque Index of Quigley-Hein and modified gingival index of Loe-Silness modified as scores for the corresponding gravity, being a non-parametric distribution, will be compared by analysis of covariance, by Friedman test for those data to be obtained and analysed the use efficacy after 45 and 90 days.</description>

    <description>Twenty-five subjects, both male and female, were chosen after signing the terms of agreement.. The criteria for selection stated that subjects should be from 18 to 60 years old, should present good health, a minimum of 20 teeth and not be pregnant or breastfeeding.The subjects went through a dental prophylaxis before starting rinse. They were then instructed to rinse twice a day for a minute, immediately after brushing (morning and night), using the 10 ml of the MGP 5%. After 45 and 90 days using the product the individuals returned for a clinical evaluation which considered changes in the soft and hard oral tissues and involved collecting plaque and gingivitis indexes. On their last appointment the subjects answered a questionnaire about their level of appreciation and acceptability of the mouthwash</description>
