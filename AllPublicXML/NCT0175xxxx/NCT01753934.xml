      About the Study: This research study is being conducted to see if diabetic ketoacidosis has
      any impact on learning, behavior and development in children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
      If there is an impact, is it transient or persistent? Sixty to 80 children between the ages
      of 4 to 17 years with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will have neuropsychological testing and a
      non-sedated MRI scan of the head performed. The investigators will compare this to a control
      group of 30-40 children between the ages of 4 to 17 years without Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
      The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will not have any changes made to their current
      diabetes regimen. The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus should continue to check blood
      glucose values as required by your doctor and bring their meter(s) for downloading to each
      visit. The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus should also tell your doctor about the
      frequency of severe low and high blood glucose values.

      Participant Schedule:

        1. One visit for 3-4 hours at the Stanford Medical Center to complete neuropsychological
           testing and to become familiar with the MRI scanner.

        2. Subjects who need to become more familiar with the MRI scanning process will view a
           video tape at home.

        3. One visit for 1-2 hours at Stanford Medical Center to have the MRI scan of the head
           completed.

        4. Subjects between 10 and 17 years of age will also be asked to complete two additional
           abbreviated neuropsychological tests at one week and one month from enrollment.

        5. Subjects may have the complete neuropsychological testing and MRI scan repeated 15
           months from time of enrollment.

      There is no intervention. All subjects with DM and controls get neurocognitive testing and an
      MRI of the brain. We want to see if the scores are different but no changes in therapy will
      be done.
