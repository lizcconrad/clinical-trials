    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 (MenACWY-TT) co-administered with Cervarix as compared to
      MenACWY-TT and Cervarix administered alone and the co-administration of MenACWY-TT with
      Cervarix and Boostrix as compared to MenACWY-TT administered alone and Cervarix
      co-administered with Boostrix.
