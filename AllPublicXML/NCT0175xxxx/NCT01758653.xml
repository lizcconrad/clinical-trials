  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this biorepository is to collect blood from patients at the time of CO
      poisoning and at follow-up visits months to years later. These samples can be used in the
      future to learn more about how CO damages the heart and brain and whether blood tests could
      predict which patients will have problems after CO poisoning.

      The investigators propose to establish a biorepository for storage of serum, plasma, and DNA
      collected from patients with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Participants will also be
      evaluated for clinical outcome. The biorepository will include serum and plasma from
      CO-poisoned patients drawn at the time of injury as well as from blood drawn at clinical
      follow-up visits. The biorepository will also bank DNA from these participants.

      These specimens can be analyzed in the future to elucidate potential inflammatory and
      immunological mechanisms that cause brain and heart damage and identify possible biological
      and genetic predictors of poor outcome.

        Study population includes patients who present to LDS Hospital or Intermountain Medical
        Center with symptomatic carbon monoxide poisoning and documented exposure to carbon
        monoxide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic carbon monoxide poisoning (headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue,
             muscle aches, slowed mentation, confusion, loss of consciousness, etc.).

          2. Documented exposure to carbon monoxide and no other reasonable explanation for their
             signs and symptoms.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Age &lt; 18 years

          3. Unable to obtain informed consent

          4. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study or are unsuitable for any reason. The investigator and the
             Sponsor, prior to enrolling the subject on a case-by-case basis, must approve and
             document any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria.

          5. Anemia requiring blood products within the last 4 months or hematocrit less than the
             laboratory normal reference range
