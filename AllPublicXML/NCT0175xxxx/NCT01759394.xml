    <description>Avatrombopag maleate 40 mg (2 x 20 mg tablets- all doses are expressed as avatrombopag, the amount of free base) given with 240 mL water in three single oral doses, one during each of three treatment periods. Participants randomized to one of three treatment sequences:
Fed, Fed, Fasted; or
Fed, Fasted, Fed; or
Fasted, Fed, Fed
During the Fasted period, participants must have fasted for at least a 10-hour overnight fast and to refrain from eating for 4 hours.
During the Fed period, participants were allowed approximately 30 minutes to eat a low-fat breakfast and required to take the drug within 15 minutes of completion of breakfast.
Randomization Phase consists of three single-dose treatment periods:
Treatment Period 1 and 2 separated by a 7-day washout interval. Treatment Period 2 and 3 separated by a 28-day washout interval. Treatment period 3 and the Follow-up/ Termination Visit will be separated by a 30-day (+1 day) washout interval.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Healthy male and female subjects (aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, at the time of
             informed consent)

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m2 and ≤ 32 kg/m2 at Screening

          3. Platelet count between 120 x 109/L and 300 x 109/L inclusive at Screening, Baseline
             Period 1, or Baseline Period 3

          4. Platelet count below the upper limit of normal at Baseline Period 2

          5. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG] test with a minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of β-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before
             the first dose of study drug.

          6. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all
             with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

          7. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, a nonhormonal-based intrauterine device, a
             double barrier method [such as condom plus spermicide or diaphragm plus spermicide],
             non-estrogen-based hormonal therapy, progesterone-only contraceptive
             implant/injection, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.
             If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as
             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation. The use of estrogen-based hormonal contraceptives is
             not allowed because of a potential increase in the risk of venous thrombosis.

             All females who are of reproductive potential and have been using estrogen-containing
             oral contraceptives must have discontinued the contraceptive product for at least 30
             days before dosing, throughout the entire study period, and for 30 days after study
             drug discontinuation, and have been using use the aforementioned methods.

          8. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 90 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
             study period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

          9. Provide written informed consent

         10. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

         14. Use of prescription drugs within 4 weeks or within five times the drug's half-life (if
