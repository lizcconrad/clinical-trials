    <measure>TWSTRS Total Score at Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 (12 - 16 weeks duration each)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean TWSTRS total scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS total scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

    <measure>TWSTRS Total Scores at Pretreatment Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 (12 - 16 weeks duration each)</time_frame>
    <description>The pretreatment baseline scores were defined as the TWSTRS measurement before Dysport® treatment in Study 169 for subjects who had received Dysport® in Study 169 and Day 1 of Study 170 for those subjects who had received placebo. Mean TWSTRS total scores for pretreatment baseline and for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS total scores from pretreatment baseline scores at Week 4 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline for Studies 169 and 170 and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Response in Treatment Cycle 3 Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 Treatment Cycle 3</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response was defined as a reduction in the TWSTRS total score of at least 30% from pretreatment baseline to the Week 4 visit in Treatment Cycle 3. The pretreatment baseline scores were defined as the TWSTRS measurement before Dysport® treatment in Study 169 for subjects who had previously received Dysport® in Study 169 and Day 1 of Study 170 for those subjects who had previously received placebo. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline for Studies 169 and 170 and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle. The proportion (percentage) of subjects who were treatment responders at Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 3 are presented.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was an open label extension (OLE) study for study A-TL-52120-169 (Study 169). First subject enrolled: 14 March 2013; last subject completed: 13 October 2015. A-TL-52120-170 (Study 170) was conducted in 36 centres in the United States that had participated in Study 169 and enrolled adult subjects with cervical dystonia (CD).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who completed Study 169 and had no on-going Adverse Events (AEs) or whose Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score between Weeks 4 and 8 was reduced by ≤15% from baseline were invited to participate in this OLE study. 112 of the 134 subjects in Study 169 were enrolled into Study 170 (signed informed consent).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Total Dysport®</title>
          <description>Subjects received up to 3 doses of Dysport® 500 Units (U)/vial, 2 millilitre (mL) dilution on Day 1 of up to 3 treatment cycles. Subjects who were botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>Mean TWSTRS total scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS total scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

          <title>TWSTRS Total Score at Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</title>
          <description>Mean TWSTRS total scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS total scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>
          <population>The safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, regardless of the amount of study treatment administered, and who had at least 1 safety record post-treatment or attended a post-treatment visit.</population>

        <title>TWSTRS Total Scores at Pretreatment Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</title>
        <description>The pretreatment baseline scores were defined as the TWSTRS measurement before Dysport® treatment in Study 169 for subjects who had received Dysport® in Study 169 and Day 1 of Study 170 for those subjects who had received placebo. Mean TWSTRS total scores for pretreatment baseline and for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS total scores from pretreatment baseline scores at Week 4 and Week 12 of each treatment cycle are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline for Studies 169 and 170 and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

            <description>Subjects received up to 3 doses of Dysport® 500 U/vial, 2 mL dilution on Day 1 of up to 3 treatment cycles. Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Treatment Response in Treatment Cycle 3 Week 4.</title>
        <description>Treatment response was defined as a reduction in the TWSTRS total score of at least 30% from pretreatment baseline to the Week 4 visit in Treatment Cycle 3. The pretreatment baseline scores were defined as the TWSTRS measurement before Dysport® treatment in Study 169 for subjects who had previously received Dysport® in Study 169 and Day 1 of Study 170 for those subjects who had previously received placebo. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The score was assessed by the investigator prior to study treatment at baseline for Studies 169 and 170 and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle. The proportion (percentage) of subjects who were treatment responders at Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 3 are presented.</description>

Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>Mean TWSTRS severity subscale scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS severity subscale scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The severity subscale gives a score from 0 to 35, with higher values indicating a worse outcome of physical findings of CD. The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

          <title>TWSTRS Severity Subscale Score at Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</title>
          <description>Mean TWSTRS severity subscale scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean differences in the TWSTRS severity subscale scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The severity subscale gives a score from 0 to 35, with higher values indicating a worse outcome of physical findings of CD. The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>
          <population>The safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, regardless of the amount of study treatment administered, and who had at least 1 safety record post-treatment or attended a post-treatment visit.</population>

The mean difference in the TWSTRS disability subscale scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The disability subscale is a 6-item scale and each item is rated on a 6-point scale with higher values indicating the highest degree of disability. The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

        <title>TWSTRS Pain Subscale Score at Week 4 and Week 12 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3.</title>
        <description>Mean TWSTRS pain subscale scores for Week 4 and Week 12 of treatment cycles 1, 2 and 3 are presented. The mean difference in the TWSTRS pain subscale scores from treatment cycle baseline (defined as Day 1 in each cycle) at the Week 4 and Week 12 visits for Treatment Cycles 1, 2 and 3 are also presented. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects, and comprises 3 subscales: severity, disability and pain, each of which is scored independently. The total score from the 3 subscales gives the TWSTRS total score with a value from 0 to 85 (best to worst). The pain subscale gives a score from 0 to 20, with higher values indicating greater pain experienced. The score was assessed by the investigator at baseline and at all post-treatment visits of each treatment cycle.</description>

        <population>The safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, regardless of the amount of study treatment administered, and who had at least 1 safety record post-treatment or attended a post-treatment visit.</population>

            <title>Total Dysport®</title>
            <description>Subjects received up to 3 doses of Dysport® 500 U/vial, 2 mL dilution on Day 1 of up to 3 treatment cycles. Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

      <time_frame>In Study 170 AEs were collected from Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 1 up to the end of study (Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3)/early withdrawal. For subjects who received Dysport® in Study 169, AEs were collected over 4 Dysport® dosing cycles; 1 Dysport® dosing cycle from Study 169 and 3 Dysport® dosing cycles from Study 170 (period of up to 49 weeks). For subjects who received placebo in Study 169, AEs were collected in 3 Dysport® dosing cycles from Study 170 (period of up to 36 weeks).</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious and non-serious treatment emergent AEs are presented for all Dysport® dosing cycles in Study 169 and Study 170. The safety population consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment regardless of the amount of study treatment administered and who had at least 1 safety record post-treatment or attended a post-treatment visit.</desc>

          <description>Subjects received up to 3 doses of Dysport® 500 U/vial, 2 mL dilution on Day 1 of up to 3 treatment cycles. Subjects who were BoNT treatment naïve at the start of Study 169 received a starting dose of 500 U/2 mL Dysport®, and subjects who were non-naïve to BoNT treatment received the same dose they had received on Day 1 of Study 169. Subjects received Dysport® by intramuscular injection into the same neck muscles that had been used for injection in Study 169. Retreatment occurred every 12 to 16 weeks, dependent on the investigator's clinical judgment. Follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 4 and 12 of each treatment cycle. Subjects were determined to have completed the study at Week 12 of Treatment Cycle 3. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>
