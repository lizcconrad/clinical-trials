      The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of dengue infection in children and
      adults in geographically distinct locations of Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to generate dengue disease burden data including estimates of
      incidence rates, prevalence data and the clinical presentation of dengue across different age
      groups.

      The study will be conducted in at least three cities: Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Manaus.
      This study will also prepare potential sites for future clinical trials, by setting up the
      logistics and training staff on site to enroll a cohort of subjects perform dengue
      surveillance and other study procedures.

      Households will be randomly selected from communities where a registry system is implemented.
      All individuals in the household will be eligible for participating in the study. This study
      will be sponsored by GSK and co-funded by GSK and Fiocruz. As study sponsor, GSK will
      delegate some activities to Fiocruz, according to the provisions in their Cooperative
      Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).
