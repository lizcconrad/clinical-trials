      The objectives of this study is to investigate if pre-treating the skin with an ablative
      fractional laser that creates small micropores in the skin:

        1. Increases the uptake of Methylaminolevulinat (MAL) in the skin.

        2. Decreases the required incubation time of MAL when performing photo dynamic therapy.

      12 healthy male individuals were included.

      On the back, 25 areas measuring 2.8x2.8 cm were marked, plus one control area. We tested 2
      variables.

      1) Density of laser channels. 2) Methylaminolevulinat (MAL) concentration

        1. Laser - Each area was randomized to receiving:

             -  no treatment

             -  1% laser channel density

             -  2% laser channel density

             -  5% laser channel density

             -  10% laser channel density

             -  15% laser channel density

        2. MAL - Each density was assigned to 4 areas. Within each density category, the four areas
           were randomized to receive:

             -  vehicle

             -  4% MAL

             -  8%MAL

             -  16%MAL

      The uptake of MAL was evaluated by fluorescence intensity measured with a florescence camera
      at t=

        -  0min

        -  30min

        -  1h

        -  1.5h 2h 2.5h 3h
