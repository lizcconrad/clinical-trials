  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of the variation in systolic
      pressure indices measured at the toe and ankle after a walking test in healthy volunteers.

      Our secondary objectives are:

        -  to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure
           indices measured at the toe after a walking test (healthy volunteers)

        -  to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure
           indices measured at the ankle after a walking test (healthy volunteers)

        -  to evaluate the concordance of the variation in systolic pressure indices measured at
           the toe and ankle during the recuperation phase after a walking test (5 and 10 minutes
           after end of walking test) in healthy volunteers

    <description>Brachial blood pressure on both the left and right (BBP-LR) sides is measured, as well as at the left and right ankles (BPA-LR).
A 15 minute walking test (WT) is performed.
BBP-LR and BPA-LR are re-measured.
2 hours of rest.
BBP-LR and the blood pressure at the left and right big toes (BPT-LR) are measured.
WT is reperformed.
