  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory motor-coupling has been shown to induce neural-entrainment that can synchronize
      walking-pace with sonic tempo. The extent to which acoustical-motor entrainment can induce
      longer-term changes to physical activity behaviours remains unclear.

      Cardiac rehabilitation is essential and is associated with irrefutable mortality benefits for
      patients following an acute cardiac event. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a
      25-50% improvement in survival as compared to controls; however, as many as 50% of patients
      will dropout of such programs prior to completion, which undermines these morbidity and
      mortality benefits (37; 54). Research exploring ways to improve compliance to such programs
      has suggested that the incorporation of music and other such holistic, patient-centered
      interventions into a rehabilitation/exercise program is associated with improved motivation,
      endurance and satisfaction amongst cardiac rehabilitation participants. The MAINTAIN study
      has been designed to conduct a feasibility evaluation on the effects of a preference-based
      music intervention on adherence to the cardiac rehabilitation program at Toronto
      Rehabilitation Institute. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility
      of the implementation of such a protocol within the context of the program.

      This is a two-arm, block 2:1 randomized trial. 35 patients participating in cardiac
      rehabilitation at Toronto Rehabilitation: Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention
      Program will be recruited and participants will be randomized into: 1) control (standard,
      usual care); and, 2) music intervention. The randomization process employed will be a blocked
      2:1 strategy, whereby subjects are randomized to the music treatment arms 2:1. All those
      patients randomized into arm 2 will be equally randomized into either (2) preference-based
      music intervention, (3) preference-based music enhanced with RAS. The primary outcome measure
      will be weekly physical activity over a 3 month duration as measured using tri-axial
      accelerometers. We will also analyze the impact of a preference-based music intervention
      based on audio playlist utilization, self-reported sitting times ,exercise-times, on-site
      attendance to the cardiac rehabilitation program (attendance), peak oxygen uptake (VO2)
      (stress-test), and self-efficacy levels (self-efficacy questionnaires). These measures will
      be collected and analyzed throughout the course of the intervention (3 months).

Those with higher VO2max values are more fit and can exercise more intensely, indicating a greater functional capacity than those with lower VO2max values.</description>

    <description>Patients that have been randomized into arms 2 and 3 will be blinded to the intervention they are receiving (i.e. preference-based playlist vs. preference-based playlist that has been edited to include Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). RAS drives synchronous neural oscillation (entrainment) and functions in two ways: (1) facilitates pace and heart-rate synchrony and (2) facilitates brain state dominance (getting into the zone). RAS will be accomplished through: (1) sequencing of subject self-selected music based on tempo, (2) accentuation of the rhythmic driving pulse with added percussive-type sounds, (3) addition of binaurally detuned pitches to follow bass lines at brain-state target frequencies (e.g., 8 Hz alpha, or 16 Hz beta), and (4) the addition of binaurally detuned &quot;background&quot; sounds (e.g., low frequency hum) at target Hz frequencies. RAS is implemented as inherent and natural to the music and may remain imperceptible to most.</description>
