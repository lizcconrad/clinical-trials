      This study seeks to compare aortic dimension changes during cardiac cycle in patients with
      and without aortic valve calcification and to evaluate its correlation with aortic valve
      calcium score in former group.

      The study population comprised 104 patients referred to three cardiac imaging centers for
      coronary multislice computed tomography, including 52 patients with aortic valve
      calcification as the study group and 52 subjects without evidence of calcification in their
      aortic valve, who served as a control group. Data were reconstructed at each 10% of
      RR-interval during the cardiac cycle and reconstructed images at 30-35% and 70-75% of R-R
      intervals were obtained, representing systole and diastole, respectively. For diastolic
      phase, in most cases images at 70% were acquired. Thereafter, acquired images were
      transferred to a single remote workstation for post-processing and subsequent off-line
      analysis.

    <description>Detailed information about aortic root dimension changes during cardiac cycle has become of utmost interest especially after introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as an alternative therapeutic procedure in patients with severe aortic stenosis, in that paravalvular regurgitation and procedural failure will ensue from errors in selecting the appropriate prosthesis size</description>
