    <textblock>
      Gefitinib, the first EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the world was examined as
      monotherapy in two phase Ⅱ studies called IDEAL trials. Response rate with doses of 250mg and
      500mg/day were similar, ranging from 10% to 18%. Posterior analysis demonstrated that
      patients with EGFR mutation had an improved response rate (RR) to gefitinib compared to
      wild-type patients (46% versus 10%). The early trials that evaluated EGFR-TKIs for the
      second- and third-line settings of advanced NSCLC did not select patients on the basis of any
      EGFR marker. The IEESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer (ISEL) trial evaluated the role of
      second-line gefitinib 250mg/day in 1692 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with EGFR
      mutations had higher RR than patients without (37.5% versus 2.6%). From the above results,
      the response rate in patients without EGFR gene mutation was obviously different (10% versus
      2.6%). The methods used for detecting EGFR gene mutation was different, which might
      contribute to the difference of response rates. In IDEAL trial, EGFR gene mutation was
      detected by sequencing. But in ISEL trial, EGFR gene mutation was detected by ARMS. As we
      know, ARMS was more sensitive than sequencing in detecting EGFR gene mutation. That is to
      say, in IDEAL trials some EGFR mutant patients were misdiagnosed as wild-type patients, so
      the response rate was higher. Recently, Wu Yi-Long et al reported that relative abundance of
      EGFR mutations predicted benefit form gefitinib treatment for advanced non small cell lung
      cancer. The study cohort was all Chinese. In this study, the objective response rate in
      patients without EGFR mutation detected by ARMS was 16.1%, which was significantly higher
      than the response rate of docetaxel. But in 2012 American society of clinical oncology (ASCO)
      annual meeting, the Tailor study in which Italian NSCLC patients were enrolled demonstrated a
      clear superiority of docetaxel over erlotinib as second line treatment for patients without
      EGFR mutations in exons 19 or 21. So we wonder if the racial difference is the determinant
      factor. So the purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of gefitinib with
      docetaxel as second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic Chinese NSCLC patients with
      wild-type EGFR.

      The adoption of docetaxel as a standard second line therapy was based on data from two phase
      Ⅲ trials. In the first trail, docetaxel (75mg/m2, every 3 weeks) significantly prolonged
      median and 1-year survival duration compared with best supportive care (median survival, 7.5
      months versus 4.6 months; P=0.010; 1-year survival, 37% versus 12%), although the response
      rate was low (5.5%). In the second study the 6-months and median survival rates were similar
      for docetaxel and vinorelbine or ifosfamide. However, the 1-year survival rate was
      significantly greater with docetaxel than ifosfamide or vinorelbine (32% versus 19%,
      P=0.025). In both studies docetaxel significantly improved some parameters of quality of
      life. Since these two pivotal studies, new potential second-line drugs were compared with the
      docetaxel standard of care. With regards to the therapeutic results of the docetaxel arm of
      these studies, it must be emphasized that response rates and survival data were highly and
      significantly reproducible.
