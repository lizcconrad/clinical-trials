  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine wether wound infiltration brings additional
      analgesia effect after cesarean section with optimal standard postoperative analgesia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous wound infiltration with local anaesthetic has been shown as a safe and
      opioid-sparing analgesic method after caesarean section with minimal standard analgesia. We
      aim to evaluate if this benefit remains when an optimal analgesia is used.

      Primary outcome is morphine consumption. Secondary outcomes is pain scores, maternal recovery
      including breastfeeding, side effects of morphine, nurse workload and maternal satisfaction.

      Patients scheduled for caesarean delivery will be eligible for the study.

      Patients with emergency caesarean delivery, contraindication to analgesic drugs, hemostasis
      disorder, ongoing infection, diabetes treated with insulin or chronic opioid use will be
      excluded from the study.

      One group will receive standard analgesia including celecoxib and intravenous morphine for 24
      hours with Patient Controlled Analgesia pump. The other group will receive the same standard
      analgesia with additional levobupivacaine initial bolus followed by a continuous subfascial
      infiltration of 1.25 mg/ml at 5 ml/h for 48 hours through a multiperforated catheter
      connected to an elastomeric pump.

      Total morphine consumption, pain and any associated complications will be recorded for 72
      hours. Women wil be asked to fulfill a questionnaire on the second day after cesarean
      section, assessing recovery, satisfaction and breastfeeding comfort.
