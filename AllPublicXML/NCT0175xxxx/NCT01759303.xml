    <time_frame>4 months from the beginning of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the 4-month PFS (with demonstrated increase in tumor doubling time) of eligible subjects treated with pazopanib according to RECIST version 1.1 guidelines.
Tumor growth rate will be calculated by measuring growth at the specified intervals for the single, longest dimension of the tumor(s) (RECIST) and by calculating the area of the tumor(s), which will be the product of the longest dimension of the tumor(s) multiplied by its longest, perpendicular dimension (WHO).
Progressive disease (PD) for target lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study, and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
PD for non-target lesions is defined as unequivocal appearance of one or more new malignant lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the 4-month PFS (with demonstrated increase in tumor doubling time) of eligible subjects treated with pazopanib according to RECIST version 1.1 guidelines. The study statistician will calculate tumor growth rate per WHO criteria based on bidimensional tumor measurements (i.e., longest dimension of the tumor(s) and its longest perpendicular dimension) at each imaging time point.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib to define correlation of minimal drug concentrations with PFS, RR, duration of response, OS, and safety. Samples will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 for plasma pazopanib trough PKs to assess the population of subjects with concentration greater than the target of 15 µg/mL.</description>

    <description>The time origin for PFS will be Cycle 1, Day 1. Repeat radiological imaging will be conducted after every 2 cycles of treatment (approximately 8 weeks)to evaluate disease status per RECIST v.1.1 and WHO criteria.
