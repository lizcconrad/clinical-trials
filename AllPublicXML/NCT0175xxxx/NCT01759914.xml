  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular hypertension and glaucoma are eye conditions associated with abnormally high fluid
      pressure in the eye (called intraocular pressure or IOP). If left untreated, the elevated IOP
      may eventually cause damage to the nerve of the eye and potential impairment of vision.

      The use of certain drugs has been identified as a risk factor for raised IOP, including
      various forms of administration of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can also lead to
      cataract, which is clouding of the lens in the eye that can affect vision.

      In this research study, we would like to find out whether the use of corticosteroids in our
      dermatology clinic leads to raised IOP, in order to identify patients at risk and to allow
      them to be more closely monitored than others. It is important to identify those patients who
      have a corticosteroid-induced pressure rise early enough to prevent them from permanent
      glaucomatous visual loss.
