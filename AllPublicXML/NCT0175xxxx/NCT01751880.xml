  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is a major health issue and one of the most common malignance in Korea. With
      the popularization of cancer screenings and increasing the average lifespan, the number of
      gastric cancer patients is increased. In the past, most of the research were concerned with
      survival and recovery after cancer surgery. However, as the medical technology had been
      developed and recovery rate and survival rate of cancer patients had risen, the patients
      wanted to return to a daily life and desire for participation for leisure. In other words,
      the patients who underwent surgery wants to maintain a high quality of life(QOL) level as
      like prior to cancer surgery.

      There are many reports on the effect of the exercise program after cancer surgery. In
      addition, exercise program was associated with improving the QOL and functional recovery,
      decreasing a mood of depression, maintaining a muscle mass and improving the survival rate.

      However, the subject patients of previous studies were Western people. Therefore, The results
      were not disclosed whether the exercise program suited to the body characteristics of Korean
      people. Furthermore there was no exercise program studies for the gastric cancer patients.

      Medical service for cancer patients care should include not only diagnosis, treatment as like
      surgery but efforts on enhancing the quality of life. In other words, post-management
      education and management program as like exercise program are necessary for the cancer
      patients after surgery. So, the research about how to practice the exercise program and how
      to evaluate the effect on the recovery is needed.

    <description>Exercise program is scheduled to be conducted in three phases. Phase I is in-hospital exercise program. This program will be conducted in hospital during 1 week after surgery. Phase II is home-exercise program that will be performed at home during 1 week after discharge. Phase III is main-exercise program that will be conducted the fitness center nearby hospital during 8 weeks after phase II program. Main-exercise program is focused on the functional recovery.</description>
