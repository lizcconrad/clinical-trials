    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies supportive care for patients with hematological
      malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant. Supportive care may improve quality of
      life in this patient population.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pilot a supportive care intervention that begins prior to transplantation and continues
      through the acute peritransplant period.

      II. Determine the proportion of patients who enroll and the level of comfort / distress of
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients who meet with the supportive care team.

      III. Pilot data collection mechanisms and cost retrieval in preparation for a randomized
      clinical trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo supportive care consultation before transplantation and at least once
      monthly while they remain at the transplant center.
