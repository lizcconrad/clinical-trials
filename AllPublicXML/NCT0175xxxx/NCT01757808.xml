      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of ranolazine in people with pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH) and who are receiving 1 or more background PAH therapies:
      ambrisentan, sildenafil,tadalafil, epoprostenol, treprostinil (IV, SC, inhaled), or iloprost.
      The primary objective is:

        -  To estimate the effect of ranolazine administration on acute hemodynamics.

        -  To assess safety of ranolazine acutely over 6 hrs in the catheterization lab and after
           12 weeks of therapy

        -  To assess changes in right ventricular function after 12 weeks of therapy.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a medical disorder in which pressure in the blood vessels
      going from the right side of the heart to the lungs is higher than normal. The increased
      blood pressure in the lungs places a strain on the heart. This strain causes the heart to
      pump less blood into the lungs, causing physical symptoms of shortness of breath and
      tiredness. The added strain to the heart can cause physical symptoms of swelling in the feet
      and abdomen. These symptoms can get worse over time due to the decreased pumping ability of
      the heart.

      This study will use a drug called ranolazine. This drug has been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) to treat chronic angina (chest pain). However, since it has not
      been approved for use in PAH its use in this study is considered experimental.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects age 18-72 yrs will have a diagnosis of PAH. PAH as defined as idiopathic
             PAH, heritable PAH or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease, congenital heart
             disease (repaired), or anorexigen use. A history of PAH as defined by hemodynamics at
             diagnosis by right heart catheterization defined as: mean PAP &gt;25 mmHg with a normal
             PCWP &lt; 15 mm Hg at rest and a PVR &gt;3 Wood units.

          -  Baseline 6MW &gt;150 meters

          -  Patients will be receiving FDA approved PAH monotherapy or dual therapy medications:
             including, ambrisentan (5,10mg), sildenafil (60-240mg), tadalafil (40mg),
