      This Phase IIa international multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study will evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) in pediatric participants with
      severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Participants
      will receive rituximab 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenously (IV) on Days 1,
      8, 15 and 22.
