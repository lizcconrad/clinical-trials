  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strengthening Families Coping Resources (SFCR) Open Trials completes the second stage of the
      National Institute on Drug Abuse's intervention development model by testing a new family,
      skills-based intervention involving pre-post evaluation of families participating in
      multi-family groups. The purpose of this study is to gather practice-based evidence on the
      effectiveness of the manualized treatment, on the dynamics involved in the group format, and
      on implementation fidelity and feasibility. Analyses will involve initial exploration of the
      following hypotheses: 1) Families will show a significant increase in the constructive use of
      family coping skills and in general family functioning. 2) The target child will show a
      reduction in trauma-related symptoms and behavior problems. 3) Families will engage and
      participate in the treatment. 4) Providers will implement SFCR with fidelity.

      Other outcomes of interest are the process measures that will be collected to monitor
      participation in the groups, cultural sensitivity and acceptability, clinician competence,
      and intervention integrity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strengthening Family Coping Resources (SFCR) is a manualized, trauma-focused, skills-based
      intervention that uses a multi-family group format. SFCR is designed for families living in
      traumatic contexts with the goal of reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and other trauma-related disorders in children and adult caregivers. Since most
      families living in traumatic contexts contend with on-going stressors and threats, SFCR is
      also designed to increase coping resources in children, adult caregivers, and in the family
      system to prevent relapse and re-exposure. SFCR provides trauma treatment within a family
      format. SFCR includes additional therapeutic strategies designed to improve the family's
      ability to cope with on-going stress and threats of re-exposure. Specifically, SFCR builds
      the coping resources necessary to help families boost their sense of safety, function with
      stability, regulate their emotions and behaviors, and improve communication about and
      understanding of the traumas they have experienced. The model includes family work on
      storytelling and narration, which builds to a family trauma narrative. SFCR is currently
      being implemented at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), at sites that are part of
      the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), and at community agencies within the
      Baltimore Metro area and beyond.

      500 families will participate in a multifamily version of the intervention. Multiple groups
      of 5-6 families will be conducted with pre-post data collected in addition to information on
      the feasibility of the intervention. Prior to beginning each group, families will be assessed
      using a structured assessment. This assessment will be repeated at the end of group (all
      groups) and approximately one year following the completion of the group (for UMMC groups
      only).

      One child in each family will be designated as the research subject. The target child will be
      chosen according to age, aged 1 through 17 years old, and referral for services. If more than
      one child in the family meet these criteria, the primary caregiver will be given the option
      of how many children s/he would like to be assessed for inclusion in the study. Data on the
      parents will only be collected from mothers or female caregivers. If no female caregiver is
      available, the primary caregiver will complete the assessments.

    <measure>Pre-post Treatment Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>This is a large open-ended sample involving collection of practice-based evidence of intervention effectiveness related to broad dissemination. The sample size is not being constrained by a specific research question.
Data analysis: Indications of change were assessed using pre-post measures. Post-intervention change will be assessed with t-tests for dependent samples. Cohen's d will be used to calculate effect size. Comparison of pre-post scores for the target child will be assessed on PTSD symptoms (UCLA-PTSD Reaction Index Parent and Child Versions) and on behavior problems (CBCL). Comparison of pre-post scores on standardized measures of family functioning (Family Assessment Device), family coping (F-COPES), and parental stress (PSI_SF), and scores on the Family Mealtime Q-Sort will be made.</description>

    <measure>McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>The McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) (Epstein et al., 1983; Miller, Epstein, Bishop, &amp; Keitner, 1985) is a 60-question, Likert scale instrument designed to measure family functioning based upon the McMaster Model. Items are scored on a 4-point scale from 1 &quot;healthy&quot; to 4 &quot;unhealthy.&quot; The instrument provides scores for seven scales, including problem-solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behavior control, and overall functioning.</description>

    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL/1Â½-5 and 6-18 (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001)requires a caregiver to rate, on a three-point scale from 0 (not true) to 2 (often true), each of 118 problems as they are perceived to reflect the child's behavior over the past six months. The instrument has 8-9 subscales that can be collapsed into broadband scales: Internalizing, Externalizing, and a Total Score.</description>

    <measure>UCLA PTSD Reaction Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument measures exposure to and symptoms of trauma in school-age children and adolescents. Symptoms assessed are tied to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The UCLA PTSD-RI can be used as either a self-report or clinician-administered instrument. Reliability and validity are fairly robust (Steinberg et al., 2004). It has been used in many research designs and, importantly for the purposes of this study, among children exposed to community stress and violence.</description>

    <measure>Parent Symptoms of PTSD</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD (Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, &amp; Domino, 2015). The PCL-5 was developed to assess symptom change during and after treatment, to screen for clinically significant PTSD symptoms, and to make provisional PTSD diagnoses.</description>

    <measure>Family Mealtime Q-Sort</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of 10 or 15 week group</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Mealtime Q-Sort provides a methodology for examining mealtime practices. The results of formative research on the measure demonstrate that coders could rate family mealtimes with adequate inter-rater reliability, construct validity was satisfactory, and family mealtimes could be compared to an independently derived, culturally appropriate standard.</description>
