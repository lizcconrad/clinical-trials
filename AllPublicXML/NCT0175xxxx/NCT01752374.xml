    <textblock>
      We compared the prophylactic anti-emetic efficacy of ramosetron, a newly developed 5-HT3
      antagonist, granisetron and ondansetron in patients at high-risk for postoperative nausea and
      vomiting after laparoscpic abdominal surgery.

      This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of three 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the
      prevention of PONV for laparoscopic surgery in patients receiving PCA IV.

    <textblock>
      Occurrences of nausea and vomiting, the severity of nausea (VAS), rescue antiemetic drug use,
      and amount of PCEA infusion and rescue pethidine were monitored after the end of surgery
      during four time periods: 0-2 h; 2-6 h; 6-24 h; and 24-48 h. Nausea was defined as the
      subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit; vomiting
      included retching (defined as the laboured spastic, rhythmic contraction of the respiratory
      muscles without the expulsion of the gastric contents) and vomiting (defined as the forceful
      expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth) [11]. A complete response was defined as no
      PONV and no need for rescue anti-emetic drug. If two or more episodes of PONV occurred during
      the study period, a rescue anti-emetic (metoclopramide 10 mg) was given IV. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of nausea during the study period.

        The sample size was determined based on the ability to detect a difference in the primary
        outcome variable, the incidence of nausea. With 30 patients in each group there was 80%
        power at an a of 0.05 to detect a 30% difference in the number of patients with nausea up
        to 24 h after surgery.
