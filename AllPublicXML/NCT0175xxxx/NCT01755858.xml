  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effects of Bendavia on renal blood flow
      and renal function in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS), compared with placebo in
      patients with ARAS who receive one dose of study drug infused 30 minutes before and 3 hours
      after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the renal artery (PTRA).
