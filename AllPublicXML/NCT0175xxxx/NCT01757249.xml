  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a hormone dependent disease of women, in which endometrial tissue (the cells
      which line the uterus or womb) are found outside the uterus (womb). Some women with
      endometriosis may be infertile. However, treatments for infertility such as in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) or IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI) appear to be less
      successful, i.e. the pregnancy rates are lower, for women with endometriosis than for women
      who may be infertile for other reasons.

      Since endometriosis is hormone dependent, it has been suggested that suppressing the activity
      of hormones produced by the ovaries (which affect endometrial growth) may inactivate
      endometriosis and so increase the chances of pregnancy. Recently it has been proposed that
      taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for 6 to 8 weeks before IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment
      could be used for this purpose.

      For our study, which is a randomised controlled trial, women with endometriosis meeting the
      study criteria planning to undergo IVF or IVF-ICSI at the Oxford Fertility Unit will be
      recruited. Study participants will be randomised into 2 arms: experimental group and control
      group. The experimental group will be instructed to complete an 8 week course of OCP before
      beginning standard IVF treatment. The control group do not take any study medication before
      beginning standard IVF treatment. The IVF or IVF-ICSI treatment for both groups is not
      altered by participation in the study.

      The aim of the study will be to determine if pretreatment with OCP improves IVF or IVF-ICSI
      success rates, such as live birth and pregnancy rates, in patients who suffer from
      endometriosis. The study is funded by the Oxford Fertility Unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study.

          -  Female aged 18 to 39 years old.

          -  Intending to undergo treatment with a first, second or third cycle of IVF or IVF-ICSI.

          -  Diagnosed with any degree of endometriosis or endometrioma.

          -  Participants must meet World Health Organisation Group 1 or 2 eligibility requirements
             for Combined Oral Contraceptive use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The participant does not understand the English language, or has special communication
        needs. This is because it is impractical to provide, for this small scale study,
        information sheets and consent forms in other languages except English.

          -  The patient has already undergone 3 or more IVF or IVF-ICSI cycles.

          -  Patients who are already taking any medication to treat endometriosis such as
             progestins, OCP, Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone agonists, danazol, mirena, etc. or
             who have done so within the last 3 months.

          -  Participants who do not meet World Health Organisation Group 1 or 2 eligibility
             requirements for Combined Oral Contraceptive use.
