  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center pilot study of 40 patients with uT3N0 or uT1-3N+ rectal
      cancer receiving pre-operative chemoradiation. Subjects will undergo PET/MRI scans before and
      after surgery.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the negative predictive value of PET/MRI
      for determining pathological complete response from neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
