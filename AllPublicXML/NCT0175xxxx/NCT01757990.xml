    <textblock>
      The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of stevioside and
      rebaudioside on several variables related to caries development. Two approaches were
      performed: an in vitro evaluation of the growth of a culture of mutans streptococci and in
      vivo randomized study on the effect of a single rinse containing stevioside and rebaudioside
      on plaque-pH.
