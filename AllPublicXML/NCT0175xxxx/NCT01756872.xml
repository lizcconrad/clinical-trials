    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about tests used to estimate the number of eggs
      a woman has remaining in her ovaries (her 'ovarian reserve'). It is thought that women who
      have a greater number of eggs or ovarian reserve may have a better chance of successful in
      vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment than those who have a smaller number of eggs. Accurately
      predicting the likely outcomes of IVF would be of great benefit for counselling patients
      before they go through expensive and demanding treatments such as IVF and IVF with
      Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVFICSI).

      Over the past two decades, many endocrine and ultrasound markers have been designed and are
      now used as indicators of ovarian reserve. A number of screening tests are utilized to
      measure these markers, either by ultrasound scanning techniques or taking blood samples.
      However it is not yet known which, if any, best predict the outcome of IVF treatment. We
      would like to investigate these various measures of ovarian reserve to determine which are
      most accurate, particularly for predicting live birth rates, as up to now only poor to
      moderate quality evidence has been available for this outcome.

      This will be a prospective cohort study of 300 women who already intend to undergo
      IVF/IVF-ICSI treatment. Study participants will have one extra blood sample and ultrasound
      examination, for the purposes of measuring markers of their ovarian reserve, at the start of
      their IVF/IVFICSI treatment cycle. No other interventions will be required and their
      treatment cycle will not be affected by their participation in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Female, aged 18 years or above.

          -  First cycle of ovarian stimulation.

          -  Suitable for standard 'long protocol' IVF/IVF-ICSI cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant does not understand the English language, or has special communication
             needs. This is because it is impractical to provide, for this small scale study,
             information sheets and consent forms in other languages except English.

          -  Patients unsuitable for standard 'long protocol' IVF/IVFICSI cycle

               -  Presence of endometrioma or any other kind of ovarian cyst &gt; 20mm diameter.

               -  Presence of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
