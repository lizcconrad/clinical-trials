      Study Objectives The study is to identify prevalence, demography and clinical characteristics
      of patients with resistant hypertension among hypertensive patients who have been treated in
      general hospitals in Korea from Jan 2012 to Jun 2012.

        -  Diagnosis of resistant hypertension: In case of clinic blood pressure exceeding the
           boundary of systolic blood pressure at 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at 90mmHg
           (hereinafter refer to as 140/90mmHg) (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or
           chronic renal disease) despite triple antihypertensive therapy at optimal dose may be
           diagnosed as resistant hypertension. Antihypertensive medications used include
           diuretics. Resistant hypertension may also be diagnosed when clinic blood pressure has
           reached the target value but quadruple or more of antihypertensives are used.

        -  Diagnosis of controlled hypertension: Patients whose clinic blood pressure equals to
           140/90mmHg (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease) or
           less with the administration of antihypertensives at optimal dose may be diagnosed as
           controlled hypertension.

      Primary Objective:

      Prevalence in patients with resistant hypertension among hypertensive patients who have been
      treated in Korean general hospitals

      Secondary Objectives:

      Analysis of correlation in patients with resistant hypertension and patients with controlled
      hypertension who received triple antihypertensive therapy in terms of demography, clinical
      characteristics and other factors

        1. Demographic data (age, sex, and body mass index)

        2. Clinical characteristics

             -  Vital signs

             -  Lifestyles (history of drinking, smoking, and exercise)

             -  Family history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular
                disease, renal/adrenal disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease)

             -  Concurrent diseases (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease,
                renal/adrenal disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and others)

             -  History of antihypertensive therapy (past and present)

             -  Medication compliance of antihypertensives

             -  Concomitant medications
