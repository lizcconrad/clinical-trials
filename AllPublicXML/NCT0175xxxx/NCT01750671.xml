  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is established that the surviving patients after a stay in the ICU are characterized by
      frequent malnutrition and morbidity and mortality. The main goal of this work is to study the
      relationship between nutritional statuses during ICU hospitalization, whatever its
      determinants, and quality of life, morbidity and mortality at one year.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the presence of under nutrition is responsible for a 10%
      increase in crude mortality at one year (which would be respectively 30% for malnourished
      patients and 20% for non-malnourished patients).

      This is a multicenter cohort study of a 30-month follow-up on patients after a stay in ICU.

      Nutritional parameters and evaluation of the quality of life will be collected during
      hospitalization and output during a visit to the Clinical Research Associate at 6 months and
      one year. Survival will be also noted. These parameters will be studied in comparative
      patients malnourished and non-malnourished.
