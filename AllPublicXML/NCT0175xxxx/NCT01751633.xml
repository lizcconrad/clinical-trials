  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar fractures are the most common spinal fractures with an average annual incidence
      between 18 and 30 per 100'000 inhabitants. The majority of these fractures are AO type A3
      (&quot;burst fractures&quot;). Although patients with burst fractures report a reduced quality of life
      and chronic pain, there is no clear evidence whether surgical or conservative treatment offer
      better functional and back-pain related outcomes. The indications for the selection of an
      ideal treatment for these fractures without neurological deficits remain controversial. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients with thoracolumbar fractures without
      neurological deficit being surgically treated show faster recovery and better improvement of
      function than patients being conservatively treated.

        140 subjects patients with thoracolumbar fractures will be assigned to ei-ther conservative
        or surgical treatment depending on the surgeon's decision. Patients will be treated at each
        institution per standard of care. Surgeons will use their expertise and preferences to
        determine the method of surgical or conservative intervention.
