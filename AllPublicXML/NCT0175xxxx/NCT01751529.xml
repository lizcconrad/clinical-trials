  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound when used to evaluate renal lesions in two different populations; patients with
      known renal tumors (Cohort 1) and patients with a risk factor for renal malignancy in whom
      their screening ultrasound shows an indeterminate or possibly malignant renal mass (Cohort
      2).

      This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound using microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid; Definity®) when used to
      evaluate renal lesions in two different populations; patients with known renal tumors (Cohort
      1) and patients with a risk factor for renal malignancy in whom their screening ultrasound
      shows an indeterminate or possibly malignant renal mass (Cohort 2).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of using contrast-enhanced ultrasound in diagnosing renal malignancy in patients with known renal disease (Cohort 1) and in patients with a risk factor for renal malignancy diagnosed with suspicious or indeterminate lesions (Cohort 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary analyses will include 1) estimating the sensitivity of contrast enhanced ultrasound in Cohort 1 using the pathological outcome or biopsy result from ablative therapy as gold standard and 2) estimating sensitivity in Cohort 2 using pathology and follow-up results as gold standard (when tissue biopsy is not indicated nor surgery planned the truth standard diagnosis will be based on 12 month follow-up data of disease status). Exact 95% confidence intervals for sensitivity estimate will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of comparing the sensitivity and specificity of contrast enhanced ultrasound to traditional imaging techniques (CT and MRI) in detecting renal lesions in patients already diagnosed with a renal malignancy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The estimates obtained in Cohort 1 will be compared to the published figures of the conventional CT and MRI method. For Cohort 2 patients who undergo surgery, the percentage of subjects who are correctly diagnosed (benign and malignancy) will be reported along with exact 95% CI. Frequency tables will be used to describe associations. Appropriate descriptive summary statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation of tumor measurement will be provided to quantify and characterize renal masses.</description>

          4. Cohort 1:

               -  Be eligible for radical or partial nephrectomy or ablative therapy based upon at
                  least one renal lesion identified during previous contrast enhanced CT or MR.

             OR

          5. Cohort 2:

               -  High risk group (patient recommended for routine surveillance screening for renal
                  malignancy)

                  screening US, CT, or MR exam

        Exclusion Criteria:
