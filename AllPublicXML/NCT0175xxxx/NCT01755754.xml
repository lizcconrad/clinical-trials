    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period, crossover non-inferiority trial, conducted over
      4.5 months at two research centers in the USA among 81 healthy, monogamous, heterosexual,
      sexually active couples to assess the functionality of female lubricated, nitrile condoms
      during vaginal intercourse in the presence and absence of a silicone elastomer placebo
      vaginal ring.

          6. Agree to use only the female condoms provided by trial personnel during the time of
             participation and not to use male condoms during the trial. Additional lubricant will
             be provided; use of non-study lubricants will not be allowed;

          7. Agree to not use genital jewelry or other vaginal products, except menstrual

          2. Female with positive pregnancy test;

          3. Either partner allergic or hypersensitive to vaginal lubricants such as Astorlige ®

          4. Either partner not willing to refrain from wearing genital piercing jewelry for the
             duration of the study

          5. History by self-report of recurrent or a recently-treated (within past 2 weeks)
             sexually transmitted infection (e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia) or HIV(+);

          8. Either partner with a self-reported or clinically diagnosed urogenital condition (e.g.
             itching, burning, irritation, etc.) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             affect use of the study condoms or ability to interpret trial data;

          9. Females, based on findings from a pelvic examination, who are not suitable candidates
             for wearing the vaginal ring (anatomical condition, current vaginal infection, etc.)

         10. Current participation in a study or other research involving a drug, device or other
             product;

         11. Any condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with
             adherence to trial requirements or evaluation of the trial objectives.
