  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial among 100 men and women aged 60 or older
      with hyperkyphosis to an exercise intervention that includes kyphosis-specific spinal muscle
      strengthening exercises compared to a usual care control group. The study will be conducted
      in five waves,with 10 participants in the exercise intervention and 10 participants in the
      control group in each wave.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental interventions will be provided in small groups meeting three sessions per
      week for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months after the intervention, we will measure kyphosis,
      physical function, spine muscle strength and density, and quality of life. We will assess the
      effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified Physical
      Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will also assess
      the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and health-related
      quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded Standing, Six-Minute
      Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global Health and physical
      function and PACE questionnaires. Furthermore, we will investigate whether changes in
      kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the intervention on
      change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups will continue their
      usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the intervention at 1-year
      follow-up.

    <description>Investigator developed the intervention protocol (Kyphosis-specific spinal exercises) of targeted spine exercises during our pilot study based upon the literature and clinical experience.We standardized the protocol with a written script and a video. Each exercise session will be preceded by light aerobic activity, ended with cool-down and stretching the neck, chest and all extremities. All participants will be carefully monitored to ensure that all exercises will be performed slowly, with correct body alignment and technique to minimize risk of injury.</description>
