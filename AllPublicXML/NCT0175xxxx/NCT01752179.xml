  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kinesio taping is a novel method which recently has emerged as a viable option to treat of
      various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular deficits. The application of tape to injured soft
      tissues and joints provides support and protection for these structures. Many different
      techniques are used for injury prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, proprioception and
      sport. Elastic adhesive tape may be used to unload Myofacial Trigger Points (MTrPs), A
      trigger point can be located in fascia, ligaments, muscles, and tendons; however, MTrPs are
      also found in skeletal muscles and/or their fascia. An MTrP is a hyperirritable spot,
      associated with a taut band of a skeletal muscle that is painful on compression or stretch,
      and that can give rise to a typical referred pain pattern as well as autonomic phenomena. The
      use of tape along muscle to unload affected soft tissue seems to be effective in the
      treatment of trigger points by inhibiting overactive muscle, changing the orientation of
      fascia and a proprioceptive effect. The purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of
      Kinesio taping application on trigger point of piriformis muscle.

      Piriformis syndrome is a peripheral neuritis of the sciatic nerve caused by an abnormal
      condition of the piriformis muscle. Some investigators consider it as a form of Myofacial
      pain syndrome which defined as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a palpable
      taut band of muscle. Trigger points are able to produce referred pain, either spontaneously
      or on digital compression. Although myofascial trigger points are a widely recognized
      phenomenon in clinical practice, there remains much to be elucidated with regards to their
      pathophysiology. Conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAID), muscle relaxants, and physical therapy modalities such as heat therapy, cold
      therapy, ultrasound, electrical current and stretching were traditionally used in the
      treatment of trigger points.

      The utilization of Kinesio taping regarding to the proposed mechanisms including 1) restoring
      correct muscle function by supporting weakened muscles, (2) reducing congestion by improving
      the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing pain by stimulating neurological
      system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm (5) enhancing
      proprioception through increased stimulation to cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be helpful in
      restoring muscle function in patients with Myofacial trigger points . However, there are not
      many controlled studies that have analyzed the effects of the Kinesio taping in their
      treatment. Therefore, the purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of KT application as
      an easy and appropriate method on trigger point of piriformis muscle.

    <description>Change in pain intensity measured based on visual analogue scale at baseline, immediately after kinesio taping application and three day follow up . To measure the pain intensity in patients, a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) is used. Score 0 corresponds to &quot;no pain at all&quot; and score 100 to &quot;the worst imaginable pain&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in hip internal rotation immediately after kinesio taping application and Change from baseline in hip internal rotation at three day follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Three days</time_frame>
    <description>Hip internal rotation is measured in the prone situation at baseline, immediately after kinesio taping application and three day follow up. Patients was asked to bent knee to 90, the axis of goniometer was placed at center of knee joint and the arms of the goniometer were aligned parallel to long axis of tibia then patient moved her leg outwardly as far as she could without allowing the pelvis movement, the stationary arm was hold in the start point while moving arm was aligned to long axis of tibia at the end range of internal rotation, this range was recorded as internal rotation of hip joint.</description>

    <description>In the experimental group, Kinesio taping application of piriformis according to Kenzo Kase in 2003 is modified by using unloading technique (Macdolanld, 2004). Size and Shape of Tape is Width 5cm ,Length 35cm Y shape.
Taping method include :
stretches the piriformis muscle in side lying position ,the affected leg is upper most with hip in flexion, adduction and internal rotation.
puts the base of tape over the contralateral of sacrum with no tension.
attaches the superior tail on the buttock over the upper part of piriformis and ends at the greater trochanter of the femur.
attaches the lower tail by lifting up the soft tissue and ends at the greater trochanter of the femur.
This is an origin to insertion application.</description>
