  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms of
      action of fingolimod in patients with Relapsing remitting multiple Sclerosis to collect data
      on biomarkers after initiation of fingolimod treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After treatment with fingolimod the blood of the patients will be collected at different time
      points to examine the changes of T cells, B cells and biomarkers.

    <measure>Reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells (CCR7+ CD45RA+) and central memory T cells (CCR7+CD45RA-), and an elevation of effector memory T cells (CCR7- CD45RA-) by examining the blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 28, Day 84, Day 168, Day 336, Day 504, Day 672 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoints are the reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells (CCR7+ CD45RA+) and central memory T cells (CCR7+CD45RA-), and an elevation of effector memory T cells (CCR7- CD45RA-)in the blood, and to study the effect of Fingolimod on Th17 cells by studying their signature cytokines (IL-17, IL-21, IL-22) as well as signature transcription factors (ROR-gamma-t, ROR-alpha, STAT3, Runx1) in peripheral venous blood over 2 years versus baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate changes from baseline in B Lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells in the blood after treatment with fingolimod</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 28, Day 84, Day 168, Day 336, Day 504, Day 672 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate changes from baseline in B Lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells in the blood after treatment with fingolimod. This will be assessed by studying surface markers by FACS analysis for B lymphocytes (CD19, CD20, CD69), monocytes (CD14), NK cells (CD56).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the biomarkers BDNF, NGF, CNTF and LIF in the blood during treatment with fingolimod</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 28, Day 84, Day 168, Day 336, Day 504, Day 672 after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The exploratory endpoints are the change from baseline in the biomarkers BDNF, NGF, CNTF and LIF in the blood. The changes in mRNA expression and serum protein levels will be analysed in peripheral blood as a result of fingolimod treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent from patients capable of giving or withholding full informed
             consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed in this trial.

          2. Male or female subjects aged 18-65 years.

          3. Subjects with relapsing remitting forms of MS defined by 2010 revised McDonald
             criteria (see Appendix).

          4. Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a disease modifying therapy
             (≥ 1 relapse in the previous year, ≥ 9 hyperintense T2 lesions or ≥1 Gd-enhancing
             lesion or &quot;non-responding&quot; which could be defined as unchanged or increased relapse
             rate or ongoing severe relapses compared to previous year) or patients with rapidly
             evolving severe RRMS (e.g. ≥ 2 relapses with disease progression in one year and ≥ 1
             Gd-enhancing lesion or with a significant increase in T2 lesions compared to a recent
             MRI).

          5. Patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-6.5 (see Appendix).

          6. Sufficient ability to read, write, communicate and understand

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a manifestation of MS other than relapsing remitting MS.

          2. Patients with a history of chronic disease of the immune system other than MS, which
             requires systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or a known immunodeficiency syndrome.

          3. History or presence of malignancy (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix) in the last 5 years

          4. Diabetic patients with moderate or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy and uncontrolled diabetic patients with HbA1c &gt; 7%.

          5. Diagnosis of macular edema during Baseline Visit (patients with a history of macular
             edema will be allowed to enter the study provided that they do not have macular edema
             at the ophthalmic baseline visit).

          6. Patients with active systemic bacterial, viral or fungal infections, or known to have
             AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C infection or to have positive HIV antibody, Hepatitis B
             surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody tests.

          7. Negative for varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies at Baseline.

          8. Have received any live or live attenuated vaccines (including for varicella-zoster
             virus or measles) within 1 month prior to baseline.

          9. Patients who have received total lymphoid irradiation or bone marrow transplantation.

         10. Patients who expect to be treated with any disease modifying drugs (DMD) during the
             study (i.e. IFN-β, glatiramer acetate); however no washout is needed for DMDs prior to
             baseline.
