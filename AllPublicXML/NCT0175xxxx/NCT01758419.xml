  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helical tomotherapy nowadays provides the most precise data on radiotherapy (RT) dose
      delivered to each region of the heart in left-sided breast cancer therapy, which allows
      greater sparing of the heart from doses associated with increased complications. However,
      heart disease shows a wide spectrum of pathologies, and multiple risk factors related. The
      damage of the myocytes may lead to not only myocardial perfusion defects, but also in
      functional deterioration, or even in biomarkers. In this study, we will monitor
      cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, metabolism, biomarkers, myocardial perfusion defect
      patterns, and cardiac functional parameters, in order to delineate of RT-related effects and
      clinical impacts.

      Objective: The pilot study aims to investigate the correlation of post-tomotherapy
      cardiovascular effects with myocardial perfusion and cardiac functional studies.

      Methods: The study plans to enroll female breast cancer patients who will undergo local RT
      after their surgery. Patients will receive global risk scoring assessment (Framingham Risk
      Score, FRS), blood sampling for basic biochemistry, inflammatory biomarker, and myocardial
      perfusion image (MPI) at the time points of before and after RT. The results of MPI will be
      analyzed in qualitative visual interpretation of perfusion patterns, and functional
      quantitative data for cardiac functional parameters as well. The patients will be regular
      followed-up in CV OPD. The association between baseline and follow-up MPI, biomarker and
      clinical presentation will be further investigated.

      Blood sampling

      Myocardial perfusion study- Patients referred for SPECT MPI for evaluation of CAD underwent a
      1-day Tl-201 stress/rest MPI protocol, as daily practice in FEMH. Pharmacological stress was
      induced by standard dipyridomale infusion. Tl-201 of 2 mCi was injected after 7 min of
      induced stress. Each scan will be performed on an ultrafast CZT camera (Discovery 530 NMc, GE
      Healthcare). CZT images were reconstructed on the workstation using a dedicated iterative
      algorithm with maximum likelihood expectation maximization. Perfusion images in standard axis
      (short axis, vertical long axis, horizontal long axis) and polar maps of the left ventricle
      were obtained. Scans from CZT was analyzed in consensus by two experienced readers blinded to
      any information on patient identification.

      The software package with a 17-segment model for the left ventricle. Automated analysis of
      gated acquisitions from high-dose (rest) scans was performed to determine left ventricular
      ejection fraction. Integrated clinical information, follow-up and nuclear medicine cardiac
      scans performed in the time points of before &amp; after RT will be collected and analyzed.

    <description>By literature reviewing, cardiovascular functional status in patients received helical tomography has not been fully investigated yet. And the post-therapeutic heart disease tends to show a wide spectrum of pathologies and multiple risk factors. We will monitor risk factors of underlying disease, family history, metabolism, biomarkers, myocardial perfusion defect patterns, and cardiac functional parameters, in order to delineation of RT-related effects and clinical prognosis.</description>
