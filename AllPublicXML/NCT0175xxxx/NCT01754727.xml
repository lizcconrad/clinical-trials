    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the proportion of AS patients achieving treatment
      response to adalimumab therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing observational study (PMOS) was performed in a multi-country,
      multi-center, single-arm format. Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively. Adult
      patients with diagnosis of AS who were assigned for treatment with adalimumab (Humira®) were
      eligible for participation. Each patient included in this study was to be observed during
      his/her adalimumab treatment for a maximum of 12 month period. During this period four
      follow-up visits were planned for observation of the patient and documentation of data.
      Ideally, these visits should have been performed approximately 3 (V1), 6 (V2), 9 (V3) and 12
      (V4) months after the baseline visit (V0).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 (baseline) and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI score was determined using a simple, self-reported questionnaire that consists of 6 questions on disease activity. Each question is scored from 0 to 10 (0 = no symptoms, 10 = very severe symptoms). The BASDAI 50 score captures patients with 50% reduction in the BASDAI score compared to baseline as observed.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Higher scores indicate higher disease activity. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 2.0 units.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a numeric rating scale that uses self-reported patient evaluations to measure physical function impairment caused by AS. It is a ten questions, each question was scored on a numerical rating scale that ranged from 0 (no functional impairment) to 10 (maximal impairment). The mean of the ten questions was the total BASFI score. A higher score indicates more severe impairment of functioning.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving At Least 2.0 Score Decrease in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (ASDAS) Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Higher scores indicate higher disease activity. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 2.0 units.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (ASDAS) Score</title>
        <description>The ASDAS tool is a self-administered questionnaire plus an objective laboratory evaluation. The questionnaire covers disease activity, back pain, and peripheral pain/swelling assessed on a visual analogue scale (from 0 (normal) to 10 (extreme pain or disability) cm) and duration of morning stiffness on a numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10, with 0 being none and 10 representing a duration of 2 hours or longer). The laboratory parameter is a measurement of C-reactive protein (mg/L) (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h) (ESR). Data from five variables (disease activity, back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling, and either CRP or ESR values) are combined to yield a score ranging from 0 to no defined upper limit. Higher scores indicate higher disease activity. Remission is defined as ASDAS score &lt;1.3. Clinically important improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 1.1 units, and major improvement is defined as a change &gt;= 2.0 units.</description>
