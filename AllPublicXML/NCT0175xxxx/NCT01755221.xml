  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether information obtained from
      a pH probe can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to the medication that
      is prescribed for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). The current treatment given to individuals
      who are diagnosed with LPR is a course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication. Subjects
      who agree to participate in this study will have a small flexible tube (about the width of a
      piece of cooked spaghetti) placed in their throat. This tube measures the pH in the throat
      over a period of 24 hours and helps physicians study the relationship between pH level, LPR
      symptoms, and the effectiveness of PPI therapy. This study may help physicians find out if
      certain symptoms or characteristics can help them predict if the PPI medication will be
      effective for each patient. After probe removal, subjects will receive compensation. They
      will return to the clinic at their regularly scheduled follow-up visit with the physician, 8
      to 12 weeks after starting the PPI medication. At that time, subjects can choose to
      participate in an optional probe placement.

      The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether information obtained from
      a pH probe can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to the medication that
      is prescribed for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). The current treatment given to individuals
      who are diagnosed with LPR is a course of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication. This
      medication reduces the amount of gastric acid that is produced and generally leads to symptom
      relief. In order to study whether the pH probe can help physicians predict if the patient
      will respond to PPI therapy, the physicians will measure the pH level of patients' throats
      before they start PPI medication. Subjects who agree to participate in this study will have a
      small flexible tube (about the width of a piece of uncooked spaghetti) placed in their
      throat. The physician will place the tube through the nose until the tip is in the back of
      the throat, high enough so that the patient will not feel it when they talk, eat, drink, or
      swallow. This tube measures the pH in the throat over a period of 24 hours and helps
      physicians study the relationship between pH level, LPR symptoms, and the effectiveness of
      PPI therapy. This study may help physicians find out if certain symptoms or characteristics
      can help them predict if the PPI medication will be effective for each patient. After probe
      removal, subjects will receive compensation. They will return to the clinic at their
      regularly scheduled follow-up visit with the physician, 8 to 12 weeks after starting the PPI
      medication. At that time, subjects can choose to participate in an optional probe placement.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting for evaluation for symptoms classically associated with LPR with a
             Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) of greater than or equal to 13. The most common symptoms
             associated with LPR include hoarseness, throat clearing, globus sensation, nocturnal
             laryngospasm, postnasal drip, chronic cough, and dysphagia.

          -  Symptom duration of greater than 1 month

          -  Ages 18-89

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing PPI therapy for any indication within two weeks of Dx-pH probe placement
             visit

          -  Presence of findings of alternative diagnosis explaining symptoms e.g.: laryngeal
             mass, objective post nasal drainage

          -  Contraindication to PPI therapy (i.e.: atrophic gastritis, liver problems, severe
             bloody diarrhea from antibiotics, osteoporosis, broken bone) or unwillingness to
             initiate PPI therapy

          -  Pregnancy: There is no contraindication for the Restech pH probe and pregnancy;
             however, PPI use in pregnant women is contraindicated and thus pregnant women would be
             ineligible to participate in this study because they would be unable to complete a
             course of omeprazole.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to undergo 24 hour pharyngeal pH probe monitoring (for
             example, oxygen wearing requirement that prevents probe placement or anatomical
             preclusions like septal perforation).

          -  Bleeding disorder and/or unable to stop use of anticoagulants such as aspirin,
             Coumadin (warfarin), and/or Plavix (clopidogrel)
