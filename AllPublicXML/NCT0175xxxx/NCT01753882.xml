  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed clinical trial is to investigate the combined effects of
      walking training and monoaminergic agents (SSRIs and TIZ) on motor function of individuals in
      sub-acute (2-7 mo) human motor incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), with a primary emphasis
      on improvement in locomotor capability. We hypothesize that the use of these drugs applied
      early following SCI may facilitate independent stepping ability, and its combination with
      intensive stepping training will result in improved locomotor recovery following incomplete
      SCI. Loss of descending control via norepinephrine inputs following spinal cord injury can
      impair normal sensorimotor function through depressing motor excitability and impairing
      walking capacity. Replacing these inputs with drugs can alter the excitability and assist
      with reorganization of locomotor circuits. Assessment of single-dose administration of these
      agents has been tested in patients with motor incomplete spinal cord injury; only limited
      changes in walking performance have been noted. The resultant onset of weakness and increase
      in involuntary reflexes following motor incomplete SCI may partly be a result of damage to
      descending pathways to the spinal cord that control the release of serotonin. In models of
      SCI, for example, application of agents that simulate serotonin has been shown to change
      voluntary motor behaviors, including improvement of walking recovery. In humans following
      neurological injury, the effects of 5HT agents are unclear. Few previous reports indicate
      improved motor function following administration of agents which enhance the available
      serotonin in the brain, although some data suggests that increased serotonin may be
      beneficial. In this application, we propose to study the effects of clinically used agents
      that increase or decrease intrinsic serotonin activity in the brain on strength and walking
      ability following human motor incomplete SCI. Using detailed electrophysiological recordings,
      and biomechanical and behavioral measures, we will determine the effects of single or chronic
      doses of these drugs on voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors during clinical measures
      and walking measures. The novelty of this proposed research is the expectation that agents
      that increase serotonin activity may increase abnormal reflexes in SCI, but simultaneously
      help to facilitate motor and walking recovery. Despite potential improvements in voluntary
      function, the use of pharmacological agents that may enhance spastic motor behaviors
      following SCI is in marked contrast to the way in which drugs are typically used in the
      clinical setting.

      This is a phase I double blinded randomized control clinical trial. The procedures for
      participation in both Aims of the study are described below in chronological order.

      Aim 1 and 2: Explanation of the consent form and study procedures/protocol will be performed
      in the Neurolocomotion laboratory (room 1382), with subjects and their families provided
      ample time for questions. Subjects are provided substantial time to choose to participate,
      and are provided the laboratory phone numbers/emails to contact the PI and research personnel
      with any potential questions. In situations where the subject is unable to be transported to
      the laboratory, the PI will explain the consent form at a time and location convenient for
      the subject and/or their family. Subjects will then undergo a screening procedure to
      determine if they are eligible to participate in the study based on inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      Aim 1:

      Modified Ashworth scale (mod Ash, no units) will be used to detect velocity-dependent
      resistance to passive muscle stretch/joint rotation. The modAsh will grossly assess
      spasticity at bilateral knee extensors and knee flexors, with scores from 0-5 (1+ scores will
      be converted to 2 and higher scores increased accordingly).

      Spinal Cord Assessment Tools for Spasticity (SCATS, no units) will be employed to assess
      flexor and extensor spasms and clonic activity of the plantarflexors (Benz et al. , 2005).

      Independence in walking ability will be assessed at each assessment period using the Walking
      Index for SCI II (WISCI II, which is a 21 point (0-20) ordinal scale which assigns a score
      based on amount of physical assistance, bracing, and assistive device used to ambulate.
      Notably, subjects will not be allowed to ambulate with braces extending above the knee. Six
      minute walk test (m) will be assess walking around a continuous hall-way at subjects'
      self-selected velocity, with distance determined each minute and summed over the entire six
      minute duration (van Hedel et al. , 2005). Subjects will be asked to &quot;walk at your (their)
      normal, comfortable pace&quot; with minimal physical assistance and bracing/devices as needed This
      measure is significantly association with measures of community walking in subjects with
      incomplete SCI (Saraf et al. , 2009).

      BERG balance test will be administered. Gait Mat testing will be performed to guage
      spatiotemporal aspects of walking. 6 minute walk test will be performed. Lower Extremity
      Motor Score, Peak treadmill speed (m/s)

      Aim 2:

      Same as above including strength evaluations : Ankle, knee, hip flexors/extensors tested
      bilaterally (Biodex®).

      Subjects in Aim 2 will be tested at initial evaluation, after four weeks of initial training,
      and will be repeated after each four weeks of training on either the placebo or study
      medication.

      Subjects in Aim 2 will additionally be requested to return for follow up testing after one
      year.

      Subjects will be offered to participate in audio, videotaping and/or photography.

      Women who are of childbearing age and are contemplating becoming pregnant will be required to
      submit a pregnancy test and must notify the principal investigator immediately.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A) Subjects with motor incomplete SCI (AIS C or D) of 1-9 mo. duration will be selected,
        with anatomical lesions between C1-T10.

        B) Subjects will be between 18 and 75 years of age . Note: grant application states 16-75,
        however, we will be only including subjects 18-75.

        C) All subjects must be previously ambulatory with passive range of motion consistent with
        normal walking, and must include: ankle dorsiflexion ankle to 10° and plantarflexion to
        30°, knee flexion from 0 to 90°, hip flexion/extension to 90° - -10°.

        D) Subjects will be medically stable with medical clearance to participate, with absence of
        concurrent severe medical illness, including unhealed decubiti, existing infection,
        significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise participation,
        significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures following injury), active
        heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known history of peripheral nerve
        injury in lower legs, history of known traumatic head injury, and history of pulmonary
        complications, including significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases.

        E) Individuals who are undergoing concurrent physical therapy will not be excluded from the
        study population, secondary to the use of the cross-over design. Physical therapy records
        will be obtained to ascertain the amount and types of physical therapy services being
        provided.

        F) Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant or
        who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis
        restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects of the
        pharmacological agents on the developing fetus.

        G) Patients with known liver, renal, or other metabolic disease that may interfere with
        drug action and/or clearance will be excluded from the proposed study. These complications
        will be partially obviated by requiring all patients to undergo specific medical procedures
        (liver function tests, urinalysis) prior to admission.

        H)Men and women will be recruited for participation in the proposed clinical trial at rates
        consistent with national and local average of gender disparities of SCI (80% male, 20%
        women). Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are
        pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and
        pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects
        of the test agent (SSRIs) on the developing fetus. Women who use oral contraceptives will
        not be assessed for TIZ experiments and will be excluded from Aim 1.

        I) Individuals of different ethnicities will be recruited at rates similar to the national
        and local ethnicity rates. Current data since 2005 indicate that of the entire population
        of SCI, 66.1% are Caucasian, 27.1% are African American, 6.6% are of Hispanic origin, and
        2.0% are Asian. These populations closely resemble those at RIC and in our previous studies
        in human SCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A) Subjects who are ventilator-dependent will be excluded secondary to severely impaired
        respiratory capacity.

        B) Subjects with substantial orthopedic bracing to stabilize the cervical or thoracic
        vertebral column and are unable to fit in the safety harness without increased risk of
        injury are not eligible.

        C) Patients will also be excluded if they are unable to tolerate 10 minutes of standing
        without orthostasis (decrease in blood pressure by 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic);
        previous experience in the sub-acute population suggests that 10 minutes of standing is
        more than sufficient for tolerating 45 minutes of walking secondary to increased
        activity/muscle pump minimizing risk for orthostasis.

        D) Women who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to
        the trunk and pelvis restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the
        unknown effects of the pharmacological agents on the developing fetus.

        E) Subjects with height and weight limitations which restrict participation in Lokomat
        Training(LT) will be excluded. For height, subjects who are &gt; 78 inches or &lt; 60 inches tall
        may present with thigh/shank lengths that may limit use of the Lokomat. If subjects are not
        able to step independently on the treadmill and require use of robotic-assistance during
        treadmill stepping, attempts to fit all subjects in the robotic orthosis prior to
        enrollment and randomization. For weight, the maximum weight limit for use of the safety
        harness/counterweight system is 300 lbs.

        F) Individuals with concurrent severe medical illness, including unhealed decubiti,
        existing infection, significant cardiovascular or metabolic disease which limits exercise
        participation, significant osteoporosis (as indicated by history of fractures following
        injury), active heterotrophic ossification in the lower extremities, known history of
        peripheral nerve injury in lower legs, history of known traumatic head injury, and history
        of pulmonary complications, including significant obstructive and/or restrictive lung
        diseases will be excluded.

        G) Patients prescribed other anti-depressant medications, including specific monoaminergic
        agents, their precursors or their agonists, or other medications with known interactions to
        the SSRIs or TIZ will be excluded. With consultation and supervision of the patients'
        physician and the attending physicians for each individual patient, subjects will be
        required to wean of their medications on an appropriate and safe dosing schedule to
        minimize side effects of drug cessation or withdrawal. All subjects will be excluded from
        participation unless both attending physician and patient agree to cease all such
        medications during the evaluation and training period. A 14-day washout period for SSRIs
        and a 72 hour washout for TIZ will be utilized.

        H) All subjects prescribed anti-spastic medications will be excluded. Specific agents to be
        excluded include baclofen (Lioresal®) and benzodiazepines (Diazepam®). Selected agents used
        for pain modulation will be evaluated per subject to ascertain potential interactions with
        test agent. With consultation and supervision of the patients' physician and the attending
        physicians for each individual patient, subjects will be required to wean of their
        medications on an appropriate and safe dosing schedule to minimize side effects of drug
        cessation or withdrawal. All subjects will be excluded from participation unless both
        attending physician and patient agree to cease all such medications during the evaluation
        and training period. A 72-hour minimum washout period for all such medications will be
        utilized. (Note: exception to use of TIZ during training - see above).

        I) Women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant or
        who are considering becoming pregnant will be excluded due to the trunk and pelvis
        restraints required for use during locomotion, and secondary to the unknown effects of the
        test agent (SSRIs) on the developing fetus. Women who use oral contraceptives will not be
        assessed for TIZ experiments and will be excluded from Aim 1.
