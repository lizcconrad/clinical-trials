      Background: The connection between gut health and diabetes status is increasingly recognized.
      Gut microbiota composition in diabetic differs from non-diabetic individuals. Interestingly,
      the level of glucose tolerance was associated with specific microbiota that was rarely found
      in healthy individuals. Probiotics is one of the functional foods believed to mediate their
      health promoting activities through modulating the composition of the gut health. Ingestion
      of probiotics has been shown not only to influence gut microbiota composition but also the
      secretion of the gut hormones and insulin resistance in animal models with limited trials in
      human. Supplementation with probiotic has also been shown not only affect glucose
      homeostasis, but improved other diabetes related comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension,
      and hyperlipidemia.

      Objectives and hypotheses: To address this research gap, this Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT) is proposed to determine the efficacy of probiotic supplementations as adjuvant therapy
      to improve glucose homeostasis through modulating gut microbiota composition and gut hormones
      secretion in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the probiotic
      supplementations will improve blood glucose control as well as other diabetes related
      co-morbidities in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      Methodology: This is a double blind randomized parallel group control trial with 3 months
      probiotic supplementation or placebo. After screening the eligible subjects will be selected.
      Then, after consent taking, subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive probiotic or
      supplement for 3 months. Measurements of blood parameters including glycemic control related
      parameters, lipid profile, renal profile, and liver function tests as well as three day diet
      recall, and anthropometry measurements will take place at baseline, after 6 weeks and after
      12 months.

      Expected Outcomes: Probiotic supplementation as an adjuvant therapy would improve glucose
      homeostasis and gut health as compared to the placebo and eventually will beneficially affect
      other diabetes related conditions. This study would provide avenue to identify the
      possibility of probiotic supplementations as an adjuvant therapy in the management of type 2
      diabetes.
