      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of statin on the coronary
      microcirculation dysfunction measured after percutaneous coronary intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Development of peri-procedural myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) is not uncommon and affects long-term prognosis. Clinical studies have
      shown that pre-treatment with atorvastatin reduced peri-procedural myocardial infarction in
      patients with stable angina. The mechanism of peri-procedural myocardial infarction is
      presumed to be microvascular embolization. However the direct causal relationship between
      statin pretreatment and prevention of microvascular dysfunction has not been investigated
      yet.

      In this study, we will recruit symptomatic angina patients who have clinical indication of
      coronary angiography. At the time of enrollment, patients will be randomly assigned to
      pre-treatment group (atorvastatin 80 mg/d for 4 days) or control group. Percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) will be perfomed based on the result of diagnostic coronary angiography by
      decision of attending physician. When PCI is performed, fractional flow reserve (FFR) and
      index of microvascular resistance (IMR) will be measured before and after the procedure.
      Periprocedural myocardial infarction will be defined by post-PCI cardiac biomarker. All
      patients will be followed for adverse cardiac events for 1 year.
