    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases are associated with inflammation. The investigators postulate that
      Vitamin D may modulate inflammation. Thus the investigators will study the effect of Vitamin
      D replacement in patients with Hepatitis C infection and Vitamin D deficiency.

      Vitamin D appears to be a critical signaling molecule for macrophages because is needed for
      activation and differentiation of monocytes/macrophages. From our Preliminary Studies( VA
      Merit Review Grant), we propose that Vitamin D deficiency may alter the 'pro-inflammatory'
      ('classically activated') M1 macrophages , characterized by i] high expression of NOS2,
      TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-a, CXCL10, and CCL19; and ii] minimal expression of arginase 1
      and mannose R.

      The clinical relevance of these findings is suggested by the presence of activated M1
      macrophages in liver biopsies from patients with severe drug-induced liver injury
      (unpublished observations).

      Prospective vitamin D supplementation studies with appropriate endpoints are needed to define
      the role of vitamin D on inflammation in patients with chronic liver diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women aged 18 or older

          -  Total 25-OH Vit D &lt; 25 ng/mL

          -  Infection with HCV genotype 1 (subjects infected with multiple genotypes are not

          -  HCV-infected subjects na√Øve to treatment: subjects who either have never been treated
             for HCV infection or who previously received HCV treatment ending &gt; 3 months prior to
             enrollment (including, any IFN-Alpha with or without ribavirin, or other anti-HCV
             antiviral medication).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients with Sarcoidosis, Histoplasmosis, Lymphoma, Primary Hyperparathyroidism or

          -  Known active gastrointestinal disease that could interfere with the absorption of the
             test article.

          -  Laboratory determinations at screening as follows:

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL .

          -  Serum creatinine that is not within normal limits. However, such subjects may be
             enrolled if the Cockroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is &gt; 50 mL/minute.

          -  Unstable hypertension, cardiac disease or type 2 diabetes requiring changes in
             treatment with medications 4 weeks prior to screening or during the screening period.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 4 weeks before the screening visit or during the
             screening period.

          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressants (including systemic, oral, or intravenous
             corticosteroids) or immunomodulating agents within 4 weeks before the screening visit
             or during the screening period.
