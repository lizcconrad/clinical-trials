  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 4 study is being performed to examine the effects of Acthar for the indicated use
      of treatment of SLE. This study will enroll patients with steroid-dependent, persistently
      active SLE with arthritic and/or cutaneous involvement. The study will involve two phases: a
      double-blind phase, to provide placebo-controlled safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic data,
      and an optional open-label phase, to examine the prolonged effects of Acthar maintenance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of the study is an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group add-on pilot study exploring the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of
      Acthar in SLE patients with a history of persistently active disease with arthritic and/or
      cutaneous involvement despite standard of care, which includes chronic/stable prednisone use
      for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients will be randomized to one of four
      possible treatment groups (Acthar [low dose (40 U [0.5 mL]) or high dose (80 U [1.0 mL])] or
      equivalent volumes of Placebo [low or high 'dose']) in a 2:1:2:1 ratio
      (Acthar:Placebo:Acthar:Placebo). In Weeks 1-4, patients will administer study medication via
      subcutaneous (SC) injection 0.5 mL daily or 1.0 mL every other day based on randomization. In
      Weeks 5-8, patients will taper the study medication. Patients will continue on their stable
      steroid regimen during this phase of the study.

      After completion of Week 8 in the double-blind phase, patients may choose to participate in
      the optional open-label phase where they will receive an Acthar maintenance regimen for 44
      weeks. The initial Acthar regimen will be assigned based on the study medication regimen the
      patient received at the completion of the double-blind phase (Visit 6, Week 8). Acthar
      regimen may be adjusted based on the Investigator's judgment with the goal of achieving a
      stable Acthar regimen no later than Week 28. Once the stable Acthar regimen is achieved, the
      Investigator should consider tapering the steroid regimen to a low daily dose or completely
      discontinue.
