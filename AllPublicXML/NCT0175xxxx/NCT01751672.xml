      The purposes of this study are to: 1) implement a high fidelity Screening, Brief Intervention
      and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol with computerized screening technology into three
      primary care clinics in urban Philadelphia; 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      determine if an expanded SBIRT (SBIRT+) will help patients attend more specialty substance
      abuse treatment sessions and reduce substance use compared to SBIRT; 3) conduct a process
      evaluation of SBIRT+ at the three collaborating clinics consisting of focus groups and
      structured interviews to assess implementation barriers and workforce attitudinal shifts; and
      4) provide an excellent clinical research training environment for undergraduate and graduate
      students from Lincoln University.

      This project has several specific aims. First, investigators plan to implement a high
      fidelity Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol with
      computerized screening technology into three primary care clinics in urban Philadelphia, and
      to train three Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) in an expanded brief intervention
      protocol (SBIRT+). Second, investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      address the following hypotheses: 1) patients assigned to SBIRT+ will attend more specialty
      substance abuse intervention and treatment sessions (excluding SBIRT+ sessions) over the 12
      month follow-up than patients assigned to SBIRT; 2) patients assigned to SBIRT+ will
      demonstrate larger reductions in drug use by point prevalence urine samples and by reported
      days using over the 12-month follow-up compared to patients in SBIRT; 3) SBIRT+ will have
      positive net social benefits relative to SBIRT alone (i.e., will be cost-effective); 4)
      patients assigned to SBIRT+ will demonstrate improved medical, employment, legal, and
      psychiatric functioning, as well as reduced HIV risk over the 12-month follow-up compared to
      patients in SBIRT. Thirdly, investigators will also determine whether SBIRT and SBIRT+ are
      sustainable in primary care clinics as research funding for behavioral health consultants is
      phased out in Year 4 of the project. Investigators will also conduct a process evaluation of
      SBIRT+ at the three collaborating clinics consisting of focus groups and structured
      interviews to assess implementation barriers and workforce attitudinal shifts. This will
      inform methods to further disseminate SBIRT or SBIRT+, should the trial prove it is
      sustainable and cost-effective. Finally, investigators will provide an excellent clinical
      research training environment for undergraduate and graduate students from Lincoln
      University; this experience will balance hands-on clinical data collection and didactic
      training.
