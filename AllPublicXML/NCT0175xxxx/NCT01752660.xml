  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade physical exercise has become an accepted and integrated part of
      rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, no studies have evaluated
      whether the most severely disabled patients can tolerate and benefit from exercise therapy.
      The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the feasibility of endurance training in
      severely disabled patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been advised not to participate in
      physical exercise. This advice was given in part because some patients were reported to
      experience symptom instability during exercise as a consequence of increased body
      temperature. A further argument was that avoiding exercise would preserve energy and thereby
      result in less fatigue, leaving more energy for activities of daily living. During the last
      decade, it has been more common to recommend exercise for MS patients, because of its
      recently proven beneficial effects in these patients.

      Resistance- and endurance training constitutes the two extremes of basic physical exercise.
      To gain insight into the effects of exercise it therefore makes sense to understand the
      extremes. In mild to moderately impaired MS patients endurance training is well tolerated and
      providing beneficial effects. However, this exercise modality has not yet been tested in
      severely disabled patients, and it is therefore unclear if endurance training is feasible and
      beneficial in these patients. The investigators have, therefore, designed a feasibility study
      evaluating the effects of 4 weeks of endurance training in severely disabled MS patients
      (Expanded Disability Status Scale score &gt; 6).

      Patients are inpatients at one of the national MS hospitals and endurance training is added
      to the usual care, and compared to usual care only (control group). Exercise frequency is 3
      times per week, and intensity is controlled by HR measurements during exercise.
