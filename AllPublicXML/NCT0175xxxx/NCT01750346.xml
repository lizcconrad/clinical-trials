    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Blepharospasm is caused by excessive contraction of the muscles that close the eye. One
      treatment is botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), which works by weakening those muscles. Like BoNT,
      acetyl hexapeptide-8 (AH-8) works to weaken the muscles, but is available as a skin cream.
      AH-8 is the active ingredient in a number of cosmetic creams used to treat wrinkles.
      Researchers thought that AH-8 cream could be used to treat blepharospasm, but the original
      dose studied was not very effective. They want to try a higher dose of AH-8 in a cream to see
      if it can be a more effective treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To see if AH-8 cream can improve the symptoms of blepharospasm.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have blepharospasm that is severe enough to
      require treatment.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve up to eight study visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer
           questions about their symptoms. They will also have a blink test to see how severe the
           blepharospasm is. At this visit, participants will receive one of three types of cream.
           One cream will have a low dose of AH-8, one will have a higher dose of AH-8, and the
           other will be a placebo (no AH-8).

        -  One month later, participants will have a followup visit, with tests similar to the
           first visit. They will also receive more of the cream.

        -  One month later, participants will have another visit with the same tests. They will be
           videotaped at this visit to study their facial movements. Those who have responded to
           the treatment will continue to use the cream. Those who have not responded will be
           offered the chance to have BoNT injections, and will stop taking the cream.

        -  One month later, participants who had BoNT injections will have a final visit to check
           for possible side effects. Those who continued to take the cream will continue on the
           study.

        -  The fifth and sixth visits will involve the same tests as before. At the seventh visit,
           remaining participants will be offered the chance to have BoNT injections, and will stop
           taking the cream.

        -  The final visit will check for any side effects from the cream or the injections.

      OBJECTIVE:

      Test the efficacy of topical AH-8 in blepharospasm treatment.

      DESIGN:

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study, phase II single center clinical
      trial. Patients with primary blepharospasm at least 4 months off BoNT therapy with no benefit
      from last BoNT injection by history and self assesment will be included. We will use 3 study
      arms placebo and 2 different doses (as concentrations of the AH-8 active substance in the
      topical preparation). An extension phase is planned after the initial phase.

      The patients will have a baseline screening visit, including measurement of the outcome
      variables, then begin the study intervention. They will have 2 subsequent visits at month 1
      and month 2. After this visit, the patients who do not have significant benefit and wish to
      have an alternative therapy (GROUP 1) will receive BoNT injections according to best practice
      standards. These patients will then be assessed 1 month later (peak effect of BoNT therapy)
      and the effect will be compared with the AH-8 effect. The patients who have significant
      benefit (GROUP 2) will continue therapy for another 4 months (total of 6 months), and will
      have another assessment at that point. Afterwards the patients will be offered BoNT
      injections according to best practice standards, similar to Group 1 above, and another
      assessment will be made one month later (month 7) to compare the effects with AH-8 effects.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Primary outcome variable: the Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale at month 2.

      Secondary outcome variables:

        -  the Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale at month 1

        -  the Blepharospasm Disability Scale at month 1

        -  the Blepharospasm Disability Scale at month 2

        -  the difference in JBRS at month 3 time point (after BoNT injection) in patients
           receiving BoNT

        -  JBRS score at 6 months for patients not receiving BoNT at month 2 (Group 2)

        -  the difference in JBRS between month 6 and month 7 time point (after BoNT injection) in
           Group 2 patients

        -  Blink reflex measures at month 2

      Non-parametric comparison (Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test) of the primary and secondary variables
      before and after the intervention will be used for statistical analysis. Additional
      multivariate analysis will explore the influence of other factors (age, gender, disease
      duration).

      Interventions and Duration

      Twice daily application of active substance or placebo. Two active substance concentrations,
      0.025% and 0.05% AH-8 will be used.

      Each subject will be in the study a total of at least 3 months, followed by additional up to
      4 months in the second phase for the group 2 patients.

      Sample Size and Population

      There will be 8 patients per arm, for a total study population of 24. The power calculation
      for a power of 80%, for a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05, to be able to detect a change of 2 points
      on the JBRS requires 8 patients per arm. This calculation was based on independent
      calculation for each dose of the active agent against placebo.

      The subjects included will be patients with primary blepharospasm, not currently treated with
      BoNT (de novo diagnosed patients), but who subjectively express a wish for treatment
      intervention, with at least one year history from symptom onset, without perceived active
      change in symptoms by history. Patients with blepharospasm as part of a generalized dystonia
      or due to a different neurologic condition will be excluded.

      Randomization and blinding to be performed by the NIH research pharmacy.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale (JBRS) at 2 months from the start of the study drug or placebo. The JBRS is a clinical scale measuring the severity and frequency of blepharospasm. Severity and frequency are rated on a 5-point scales ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 4 indicates the most severe or frequent symptoms (Severity: severe, incapacitating spasm of eyelids and possibly other facial muscles; Frequency: Functionally &quot;blind&quot; due to persistent eye closure (blepharospasm) more than 50% of the waking time.) A total score is obtained by adding the severity and frequency subscale scores with total scores ranging from 0 to 8.</description>

The BDS is a scale which measures the impact of blepharospasm on the activities of daily living, i.e., need to wear sunglasses (1 or 2) and the impact on the following activities: driving (1 to 5), reading (1 to 3), watching tv (1 to 3), watching movies (1 to 3), shopping (1 to 3), walking about (1 to 4) and housework or job (1 to 3). Patients self-report disability in all areas for a total score between 0 to 26, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 26 indicates severe disability.</description>

        <description>The Jankovic Blepharospasm Rating Scale (JBRS) was measured at 3 months from the start of the study drug or placebo. The JBRS is a clinical scale measuring the severity and frequency of blepharospasm. Severity and frequency are rated on a 5-point scales ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 4 indicates the most severe or frequent symptoms (Severity: severe, incapacitating spasm of eyelids and possibly other facial muscles; Frequency: Functionally &quot;blind&quot; due to persistent eye closure (blepharospasm) more than 50% of the waking time.) A total score is obtained by adding the severity and frequency subscale scores with total scores ranging from 0 to 8.</description>
