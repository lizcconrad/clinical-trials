      A computerized registry of cardiovascular disease patients in a large health maintenance
      organization in Israel. The registry is aimed to be used by health professionals to identify
      cardiovascular disease patients and to follow the courses of their illnesses and risk
      factors.

      The registry was initiated in 1998 by Maccabi Healthcare services, which is the second
      largest publicly funded HMO in Israel,serving 24% of the total population with a nationwide
      distribution.

      The registry uses advanced information technology that integrates personal computerized
      community and hospital records, data from laboratory tests, dispensed medications,
      physiological signals, radiological images, and reports from investigations and procedures.
