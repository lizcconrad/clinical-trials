      This is a feasibility study of a WrapAround Case Management Program for Youth Injured by
      Violence. Youth (aged 10-24) who have been injured by violence and visit the emergency
      department will be offered a support worker who will provide WrapAround Case Management. This
      study is designed to assess the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment and follow-up.

    <description>Youth Injured by Violence will be paired with a support worker who has extensive experience working with youth affected by violence.It is important to note that the wraparound concept involves individualized care planning and management. As such, the specific care plan will be different for each participant. Through early intensive meetings, they will develop a mentoring relationship. They will work with the youth to develop a support team, which may include family, teachers, child welfare workers and truly anyone the youth has decided can help them in their path to making positive choices.</description>
