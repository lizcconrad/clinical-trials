  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous leg ulcers (CVU) represent a medical problem associated with significant
      morbidity, increased work absenteeism and earlier retirement as a consequence of disability.
      This strongly affects the patient's quality of life and has a significant economic impact on
      healthcare systems.

      Reports of studies with animal models show that treatment with bone marrow-derived stem cells
      has a beneficial effect in healing chronic skin wounds.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility of cell therapy
      with bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) as a complementary healing therapy in chronic venous
      leg ulcers, and in addition to evaluate its effectiveness. The knowledge gained in the pilot
      study will be used to refine the clinical protocol procedures of a subsequent randomized
      study.

      Patients with venous legs ulcers meeting eligibility criteria and providing appropriate
      written informed consent will be enrolled for study participation. Enrolled patients will
      receive Autologous BMDC implantation at de venous ulcer in conjunction with standard of care
      (SOC) treatment.

      During follow up, adverse events will be assessed by ulcer clinical examination.
      Effectiveness of the experimental treatment will be assessed by evaluating ulcer healing
      (reduction of the ulcer area) and pain reduction over a six-month period.

    <description>An autologous bone marrow derived cell concentrate is obtained by bone marrow harvest (300 ml) from the iliac crest and subsequent processing using 6% hydroxyethyl starch to concentrate nucleated cells. The cells are injected using a 27 Gauge needle, in aliquots of 0.2 ml, along the venous ulcer edge. SOC treatment consisting of advanced wound management plus pressure therapy is administered simultaneously.</description>
