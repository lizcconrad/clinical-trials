  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the Doppler effect, Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) uses the interaction of light with
      moving erythrocytes to visualize perfusion in the microcirculatory system.

      The new device to be used in this study have been adapted specifically for the application,
      facilitating its use in clinic. It has been designed to take a standard white light image of
      the area under inspection simultaneously with the perfusion image to facilitate clinical
      assessment.

      Port-wine stain (PWS) birthmarks are congenital, low-flow vascular malformations of the skin
      found in approximately 0.3% of children. They are commonly found on the face and neck and may
      cause serious psychological consequences.

      Lasers are the modality of choice for the treatment of PWS birthmarks. The use of PDL is very
      effective in PWS in closing the blood vessels and diminishing therefore the redness of the
      skin. Repeated laser treatment is necessary to achieve the desired clinical outcome.

      Actually, the efficacy of the treatment of PWS by the laser is obtained by clinical
      inspection and digital photography.

      By measuring the activity and intensity of the microcirculation present in and under the
      skin, the Laser-Doppler (LDI) will be capable of measuring the effect of Pulsed dye laser
      (PDL) treatment for port-wine stains.
