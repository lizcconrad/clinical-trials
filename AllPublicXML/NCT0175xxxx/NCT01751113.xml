  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on lung function of a combination of
      ADOAIR 50/250mcg twice daily plus tiotropium bromide 18mcg once daily compared with the
      individual treatments (tiotropium bromide 18mcg once daily alone and ADOAIR 50/250mcg twice
      daily alone) in Japanese subjects with COPD. The study will utilize a three-way cross-over
      design with a 2-week wash-out period between each 4-week consecutive treatment period. The
      aim is to support the rationale for &quot;triple combination&quot; therapy by demonstrating that
      treatment with both ADOAIR and tiotropium can potentially produce improved, clinically
      relevant effects compared with either treatment alone.

      This study will utilize a range of lung function measures in order to fully assess the
      benefits of triple therapy. The primary endpoint will be based on airways conductance
      measured using plethysmography (sGaw measured over 4hours post dose (AUC 0-4hr) on Day 28).
      Secondary endpoints will include lung function measures based on plethysmography and
      spirometry. The lung function measures will be supported by measurement of the use of relief
      salbutamol .

    <measure>Area Under the Curve Calculated From 0 to 4 Hours (AUC[0-4hr]) Specific Conductance (sGaw) After the Morning Dose of Study Medication at Day 28 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 of each treatment period (up to 35 days)</time_frame>
    <description>sGaw is a measure of airways conductance and is intimately related to the diameter of the airways and consequently the level of bronchodilation. Plethysmography was performed to assess sGaw. The AUC was determined by using the trapezoidal rule and then dividing by the relevant time interval. A natural logarithmic transformation was applied and the data was analyzed by a mixed model including treatment, period and Baseline sGaw fitted as fixed effects and participants fitted as a random effect. Treatment ratios of all statistical comparisons were calculated by taking the anti-log of the difference between the Least Square (LS) means.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can forcibly be blown out after a full inspiration. FEV1 and FVC data was obtained by spirometry measurements. IC is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort; it is equal to the vital capacity (VC) plus the residual volume (RV). RV is defined as the volume of air remaining in the lungs. after a maximal exhalation. Thoracic gas volume at functional residual capacity (TGV) is defined as the volume of intrathoracic gas at the time the airway is occluded for the plethysmographic measurement at the end of a normal expiration. Trough values were the values taken pre-dose.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve Calculated From 0 to 4 Hours (AUC[0-4hr]) Specific Conductance (sGaw) After the Morning Dose of Study Medication at Day 28 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>sGaw is a measure of airways conductance and is intimately related to the diameter of the airways and consequently the level of bronchodilation. Plethysmography was performed to assess sGaw. The AUC was determined by using the trapezoidal rule and then dividing by the relevant time interval. A natural logarithmic transformation was applied and the data was analyzed by a mixed model including treatment, period and Baseline sGaw fitted as fixed effects and participants fitted as a random effect. Treatment ratios of all statistical comparisons were calculated by taking the anti-log of the difference between the Least Square (LS) means.</description>

        <title>Post-dose sRaw at 30, 75, 120 and 240 Minutes Post Dose at Day 28 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>sRaw is a measure of airways resistance and is intimately related to the diameter of the airways and consequently the level of bronchodilation. Plethysmography was performed to assess sRaw. A natural logarithmic transformation was applied and the data was analysed by a mixed model including treatment, time, period, a treatment by time interaction and Baseline sRaw fitted as fixed effects and participant fitted as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Inspiratory Capacity (IC), RV, TLC, and TGV at Each Clinic Visit Prior to the Morning Dose and Before the Use of Rescue Medication at Day 28 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can forcibly be blown out after a full inspiration. FEV1 and FVC data was obtained by spirometry measurements. IC is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort; it is equal to the vital capacity (VC) plus the residual volume (RV). RV is defined as the volume of air remaining in the lungs. after a maximal exhalation. Thoracic gas volume at functional residual capacity (TGV) is defined as the volume of intrathoracic gas at the time the airway is occluded for the plethysmographic measurement at the end of a normal expiration. Trough values were the values taken pre-dose.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can forcibly be blown out after a full inspiration. FEV1 and FVC data was obtained by spirometry measurements. Trough values were the values taken pre-dose.</description>

        <title>Post-dose FEV1, FVC, IC, RV, TLC and TGV (Measured at Trough) at Day 28 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can forcibly be blown out after a full inspiration. FEV1 and FVC data was obtained by spirometry measurements. IC is defined as the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort; it is equal to the vital capacity (VC) plus the RV. RV is defined as the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. Thoracic gas volume at functional residual capacity (TGV) is defined as the volume of intrathoracic gas at the time the airway is occluded for the plethysmographic measurement at the end of a normal expiration.</description>
