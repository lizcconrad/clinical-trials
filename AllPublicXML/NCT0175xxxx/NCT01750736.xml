  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Manual therapy and exercise have shown to be beneficial for people with neck pain, however it
      is not clear how outcomes following a general exercise program compare to specific exercises
      intended to augment a specific manual/hands-on intervention. This study will compare outcomes
      following manual therapy and a specific exercise program with manual therapy and a general
      exercise program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if specific neck exercises intended to augment
      specific manual therapy treatments result in better outcomes than standard neck exercises in
      people with neck pain. Clinical tests and measurements as well as patient questionnaires will
      be completed and compared between groups.

      A secondary purpose is to determine if self report of activity is correlated with functional
      improvements. We hypothesize that a specifically applied home exercise that augments the
      effects of the manual therapy intervention will lead to improvements in outcomes in patients
      with neck pain. We hypothesize that higher reports of self activity will be correlated with
      improvements in outcomes.

    <description>A specialized tool is used to measure sensory threshold; it is a hand-held sensor with a small vibrating tip held against the skin.
This device measures how the nerves react to vibration. The procedure is non-invasive. Little or no discomfort should be felt during the test.</description>
