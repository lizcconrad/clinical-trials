    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of immediate hormonal treatment after
      Radical Prostatectomy in Chinese and Russian patients with high risk prostate cancer. To
      reach this target, the trial will compare a group of patients treated with triptorelin at 8
      weeks after the surgery and for a duration of 9 months (3 injections) versus another group
      (called &quot;active surveillance group&quot;) who will be not receiving triptorelin. Both groups will
      be followed every 3 months to monitor any sign of disease progression during a minimum of 36
      months

      This trial is a phase IV (in Russia and China) as approved indication is locally advanced or
      metastatic prostate cancer in both countries.
