  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate clinical outcome for patients receiving treatment of suspected premalignant and
      malignant gastrointestinal lesions at Interventional Endoscopy Services. The primary outcome
      is curative endoscopic resection. Secondary outcomes include resection technique utilized,
      rates of en bloc resection and adverse event rates, including infection, bleeding,
      perforation and death, and one-year survival rates.
