  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of two continuous glucose monitoring
      devices (the Dexcom G4 Platinum and Medtronic Enlite systems) in patients with type 1
      diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use two CE marked Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems; Dexcom G4
      Platinum CGM CE-marked 2012 (Dexcom, USA) and the Medtronic Paradigm Veo system with Enlite
      Sensor CE-marked 2011 (Medtronic, USA). Both the Dexcom G4 Platinum and the Medtronic Enlite
      sensors will be obtained through normal commercial channels rather than directly from the
      manufacturer. The two CGM sensors will be worn concomitantly by the participant during the
      visit to the Clinical Research Center (CRC). This visit will have a duration of 6 hours.
      Blood will be drawn for the determination of glucose levels. The patient will receive his
      usual breakfast and an increased insulin bolus (180% of the patient's calculated mealtime
      dose) will be administered to correct the breakfast glucose excursion with the aim of
      inducing a period of minor hypoglycaemia. Blood sampling will continue until the end of the
      admission. At the end of this CRC part, the patient will continue to wear the two sensors at
      home. In the case of sensor failure before the CRC session on the third day into the study,
      patients will be instructed to insert a new sensor per the manufacturer's instruction for use
      and to notify study coordinators of the event. Sensors will be worn until the end of the six
      day study duration. Patients will be asked to perform at least 6 fingersticks per day for
      blood glucose measurements with the study glucometer. The study will end on the 6th day after
      initial sensor insertion. Patients will return to the CRC to have the sensor removed and
      their CGM sensor and blood glucometer data downloaded from the devices. In case of failure of
      both sensors after the CRC session but before the scheduled six day study duration, patients
      will return to the CRC for sensor removal and for data download.
