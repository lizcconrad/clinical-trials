      The specific aim of the study is to determine the excess urinary fluoride and its time course
      after administration of an application of Premier Enamel Pro Varnish to the teeth of 12-15
      month old infants. From these data the investigators can estimate the bioavailable (more
      precisely the equivalent) dose of sodium fluoride and the peak serum fluoride concentration
      that will allow an estimate of the margin of safety of the procedure.

      Fluoride varnish painted on the teeth is the standard method dentists use to prevent tooth
      decay (cavities) in preschool children in the United States. Fluoride varnish is not FDA
      approved specifically for prevention of cavities, but dentists may legally use it for this
      purpose. We want to study how much fluoride appears in the urine after the painting procedure
      to improve our knowledge of how the varnish works and its safety. The fluoride varnish is
      being used for research purposes for this study by permission of FDA (IND #110869).

      Premier Dental Product Company's Enamel Pro Varnish will be used. Up to six children aged
      12-15 months will be enrolled in this study. We measured urinary fluoride for 5 hours after
      application of fluoride varnish to teeth. Baseline levels were measured on a separate day.
