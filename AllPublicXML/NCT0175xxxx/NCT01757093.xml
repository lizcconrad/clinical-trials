    <textblock>
      Patients is going to submit to the 2 spontaneous breathing trial ( Automatic tube
      compensation plus continuous positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure
      without automatic tube compensation. The oxygen consumption and energy expenditure is going
      to measure during the spontaneous breathing trial by indirect calorimetry.
