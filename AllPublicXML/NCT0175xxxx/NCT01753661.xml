  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed exploratory research protocol is to investigate the feasibility
      and efficacy of Project ASPIRE, a parent-directed intervention aiming to increase parental
      skills and enrich children's early language environments and ultimately improve child
      outcomes in children with hearing loss from low-income backgrounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test the curriculum's efficacy in increasing parental knowledge and skills with a
      pilot study funded by a U.S. Department of Education Institute for Education Sciences Goal 2
      grant. We hypothesize that parents who complete the ASPIRE curriculum with an Early
      Intervention therapist will demonstrate enhanced understanding of their child's listening and
      language needs. This deeper understanding will support behavior changes that improve the
      language-learning environment through increased parental engagement and linguistic input.
      Knowledge increase and changes to the language environment will be apparent in comparative
      pre- vs. post-intervention assessment scores. In addition, child outcomes will demonstrate
      improved listening and spoken language trajectories.

      To encourage behavior change and help parents track their progress, the curriculum will be
      coupled with &quot;linguistic feedback&quot; gathered by the Language Environment Analysis (LENA)
      recorders and software. With linguistic feedback, EI therapists and parents will be able to
      track the family's progress through skill building and set goals for behavior change. This
      feedback and goal setting will allow parents to translate their knowledge into behavior
      changes that enrich their child's early language environment.
