      We hypothesize that Autologous bone marrow derived stem cells which would be expanded into
      culture and their subsequent transplant into the pancreas of patients with T2DM, aged 30 - 70
      years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent failure and on insulin(&gt;0.4 U/ kg body weight/day)
      will lead to abolition or reduction of insulin requirement by more than or equal to 50% in
      these patients over a period of 6 months. It is assumed that stem cell in these patients
      leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of various cytokines and upregulation of
      pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a
      micro-environment which supports beta cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.
