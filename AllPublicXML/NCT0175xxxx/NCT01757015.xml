  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate if add-on treatment with inhaled NVA237 (50 µg) once daily (o.d.)
      via single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) further improves lung function and health status
      and is well tolerated compared to placebo in symptomatic COPD patients with moderate to
      severe airflow limitation who are already receiving maintenance therapy with inhaled
      fixed-dose-combination of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (50/500 µg) twice daily (b.i.d.)
      via multi-dose dry powder inhaler (MDDPI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or ex-smokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years (e.g., 10

          -  COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) patients with moderate to severe airflow
             limitation (Spirometry classification: GOLD 2 or 3) at Visit 2:

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) ≥30% and &lt;60% of the
             predicted normal, and,

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70

          -  Patients who have not achieved an acceptable spirometry result at run-in (Visit 2) in
             accordance with American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)
             criteria for acceptability and repeatability.

          -  Patients who have had a COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics or
             oral corticosteroids or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to screening (Visit 1).

          -  Patients with allergic rhinitis who use an H1 antagonist or intra-nasal
