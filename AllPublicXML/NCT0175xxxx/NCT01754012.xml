  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NU-AGE is a large multidisciplinary consortium (31 partners, from 17 EU countries) involving
      nutritionists, bio-gerontologists, immunologists and molecular biologists from the most
      prestigious institutions in Europe, 5 large food industries, 8 traditional food companies and
      1 biotech SME, SPES GEIE and CIAA, covering the SME Food Industrial Associations of 13
      European countries and the European Confederation the food and drink industry. NU-AGE aims
      are: 1. to counteract the physical/cognitive decline occurring in the elderly as a
      consequence of the progressive alteration of different organs/systems (immune and
      cardiovascular systems, bone, brain, muscle and intestine) by one year elderly-tailored whole
      diet intervention on 1250 healthy elderly men and women aged 65-79 years (half diet, half
      control) from 5 different EU regions; 2. to assess the effect of the newly designed food
      pyramid specific for 65+ EU citizens on the different organs/systems using a large set of
      biomarkers related to nutrition and aging, with particular attention to the low grade,
      chronic, systemic inflammatory status named inflammageing, a major risk factor for common
      age-related diseases; 3. to perform in a subgroup of 120 subjects in depth studies and high
      throughput &quot;omics&quot; to identify cellular/molecular targets/mechanisms responsible for whole
      diet effect; 4. to perform genetic and epigenetic studies to assess the role of individual
      variability on the response to diet; 5. to adopt an integrative comprehensive approach
      (systems biology) to analyze the whole set of data. The results of dietary intervention will
      be used to develop elderly-tailored prototypes of functional foods and to improve traditional
      foods. The research activity will be accompanied and followed by a strong activity of
      dissemination and industrial exploitation to support EU strategies on nutritional
      recommendations, thus contributing to the implementation of legislation related to
      nutritional and health claims for elderly in Europe.
