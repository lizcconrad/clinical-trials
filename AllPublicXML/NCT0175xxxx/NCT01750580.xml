  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability, characterize the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and
      identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-986015 given in combination with
      ipilimumab in subjects with select advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid tumors.
