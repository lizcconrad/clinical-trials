    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort trial was planned to assess the feasibility of establishing a lung
      cancer screening program in Russian Federation using low-dose CT scanning in asymptomatic
      patients with at least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low dose computer tomography (LDCT) showed promising results in recently published studied.
      Lung cancer screening programs with fluorography introduced in USSR in 70s-80s showed shift
      to earlier stages with no data on mortality. No other studies or programs on lung cancer
      screening were introduced in Russia since then.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of establishing a lung cancer
      screening program in Russian Federation using LDCT scanning in asymptomatic patients with at
      least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. This cohort prospective study is planned
      to enroll at least 500 current or former smokers.

      Patients will be screened by LDCT scan at baseline with recommendation to perform follow-up
      in case of any positive result. For nodes more than 10 mm full clinical examination is
      recommended. For nodes 3-9.9 mm follow-up scans in 1, 3 or 6 months is recommended. For nodes
      smaller than 3 mm and negative results annual LDCT is recommended. Patient with positive
      results will be followed until final clinical diagnosis.

      Secondary outcomes include:

        -  Lung cancer diagnoses

        -  Lung cancer and overall mortality

        -  Quality of life assessment

        -  Complications of diagnostic and surgical procedures following a positive result.

        -  Comparison of independent radiological evaluation of scans.

    <description>Primary outcome measure is to assess the feasibility of establishing a lung cancer screening program in Russian Federation using low-dose CT scanning in asymptomatic patients with at least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. The main concern comes from the possibility to recruit participant for screening as small amount of information is available about lung cancer screening options for high-risk population and general practitioners in different regions of the country.</description>
