  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot drop deformity is a life limiting condition characterized by loss of ankle dorsiflexion
      and eversion. Main condition leading to drop foot condition include irrecoverable muscle and
      nerve injuries, poliomyelitis, drug poisoning, strokes, cerebral palsy, Charcot - Marie -
      Tooth disease, meningomyelocele, club foot, Friedreich's ataxia and Leprosy (1-4).

      Anterior transposition of Posterior tibialis tendon (PTT) is the gold standard for surgical
      restoration of functional dorsiflexion of a permanently paralyzed foot (1, 4-10). Two methods
      of rerouting the posterior tibialis tendon have been reported, one through the interosseous
      membrane i.e. Interosseous route (7, 10) and second subcutaneously around the medial side of
      tibia i.e. Extramembranous or circumtibial route (11-13). Both these techniques have been
      widely described in literature (4-16) and are being extensively used in surgical management
      of foot drop. The selection of technique depends on surgeon choice and patient factors.

      There is a clinical equipoise with regards to these two techniques of Tibialis posterior
      tendon transfer and through our study we aim to compare the clinical and functional outcomes
      of these two techniques. There are no studies in literature which compare the clinical and
      functional outcomes with regards to both these methods. Although there are many studies to
      demonstrate the functional and clinical effectiveness of the respective procedures, there is
      a paucity of clinical trials comparing these two surgical techniques with regards to clinical
      and functional outcomes. Furthermore there are no head to head clinical trials to compare the
      outcomes with regards to these two methods of Tibialis Posterior tendon transfer (Medline
      search dated 03/03/ 2012)

      we propose to compare the clinical and functional outcomes with regards to the two techniques
      i.e extra membranous and Interosseous technique of Tibialis Posterior tendon transfer
      performed in patients with foot drop as a result of nerve palsy.

      Through our prospective randomized trial we aim to answer the research question, whether one
      method has any superior outcome over the other?

    <textblock>
      Foot drop deformity is a life limiting condition. This has far reaching consequences in
      patients of all age groups. Anterior transfer of tibialis posterior tendon is now regarded as
      the gold standard treatment as this allows walking without wearing an orthosis and thus
      substantial improvement in quality of life. This equally applies to developing and developed
      world.

      The rationale for our study is that that there is a clinical equipoise with regards to these
      two techniques of Tibialis posterior tendon transfer and through our study we aim to compare
      the clinical and functional outcomes of these two techniques. Both these techniques have been
      widely described in literature (References attached) and are being extensively used in
      surgical management of foot drop. The selection of technique depends on surgeon choice and
      patient factors.

      There are no studies in literature which compare the clinical and functional outcomes with
      regards to both these methods. Although there are many studies to demonstrate the functional
      and clinical effectiveness of the respective procedures, there is a paucity of clinical
      trials comparing these two surgical techniques with regards to clinical and functional
      outcomes. Furthermore there are no head to head clinical trials to compare the outcomes with
      regards to these two methods of Tibialis Posterior tendon transfer (Pub med search dated
      12/03/2012)

      This study is of great interest to health care professionals managing foot drop both in
      developing and developed world. The answer to our research question; whether one surgical
      technique has better clinical, functional and quality of life over the other, will greatly
      impact the future surgical management of foot drop.

    <description>The Stanmore score is unique, as being the only score to evaluate the results specific to tendon transfers for foot drop. Though this score is not validated but has been widely used as an outcome measure in various studies on tendon transfers. One of the secondary aims of the study will be to validate the Stanmore score.</description>

Both these techniques have been widely described in literature and are being extensively used in surgical management of foot drop.
