      Study treatments:

        -  Artemether-lumefantrine

        -  Artesunate-amodiaquine

        -  Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine

      Location:

      Maradi, Niger

      Principal Objective:

      To measure the clinical and parasitological efficacy of the three artemisinin combination
      therapies over a period of 42 days from the start of treatment and with polymerase chain
      reaction assay (PCR) adjustment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the blood concentration of the non-artemisinin component of the treatment
           (lumefantrine, desethylamodiaquine or piperaquine) at day 7

        -  To assess the incidence of adverse events during the follow-up period;

        -  To measure speed of parasite clearance

      Methods:

      In vivo non comparative study as for WHO standardised protocol. The study also measure the
      concentration of the non-artemisinin component.

      Target population:

      Children under 5 years of age consulting the integrated health centres of Andoumé and
      Dix-sept portes in Maradi.

      Sample size:

      221 patients per study treatment; 663 patients in total.

      Treatment allocation:

      Random.

      Outcomes:

        -  Early treatment failure,

        -  Late clinical failure,

        -  Late parasitological failure,

        -  Adequate clinical and parasitological response.

      Analysis:

        -  Cumulative success or failure rate (Kaplan-Meier analysis).

        -  Proportions of early treatment failures, late clinical failures, late parasitological
           failures, and adequate clinical and parasitological response (called also Per-protocol
           analysis).
