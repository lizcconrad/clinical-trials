  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic medications frequently cause metabolic side-effects, such as abdominal obesity,
      high blood pressure, cholesterol abnormalities, and blood sugar dysregulation, all of which
      can lead to what is known as the Metabolic Syndrome and serious long-term cardiovascular
      health problems. Therefore, it is important that metabolic issues be addressed as part of a
      holistic approach to the mental health treatment of these patients.

      As with the general population, improving metabolic health involves lifestyle changes - i.e.,
      addressing daily habits regarding eating, physical exercise, stress and sleep management, and
      lifestyle habits such as smoking. However, there is growing recognition in the medical field
      that education is not enough for people to create meaningful and sustained lifestyle change.
      The emerging field of Integrative Health Coaching addresses this issue and provides a
      clinical framework for helping people successfully develop and achieve personalized lifestyle
      goals. The investigators have therefore decided to investigate whether health coaching
      techniques may have benefit in addressing metabolic health issues in people with psychosis
      disorders. The intent is to complement usual psychiatric and medical care, and also promote
      patient engagement in managing one's overall health.

      This study will investigate whether Integrative Health Coaching is a useful clinical tool to
      facilitate healthy lifestyle behaviour and thereby improve metabolic health in people with
      psychosis disorders.

      Antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat not only psychosis but an increasing number of
      other psychiatric indications. The prevalence of antipsychotic drug use in British Columbia
      is increasing at a high rate, especially in youth. Second generation (&quot;atypical&quot;)
      antipsychotic drugs, while bereft of the neurological side-effects of their predecessors,
      commonly cause metabolic syndrome. This includes hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin
      resistance, weight gain and hypertension - a cluster of side-effects that puts patients at
      strongly increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders such as Type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease. Drug therapies to reduce metabolic dysregulation have provided
      limited benefits. It is recognized that lifestyle changes that address daily habits regarding
      eating, physical exercise, stress and sleep management, and lifestyle habits such as smoking,
      represent a complementary approach to additional drug therapy. The emerging field of
      Integrative Health Coaching addresses this issue and provides a clinical framework for
      helping people successfully develop and achieve personalized lifestyle goals. This study will
      investigate whether Health Coaching is a useful clinical tool to facilitate healthy lifestyle
      behavior and thereby improve metabolic health in people with psychotic illness.

      HYPOTHESIS: In a first-episode psychosis population that have recently begun treatment with
      atypical antipsychotic drugs, the inclusion of an Integrative Health Coaching goal-setting
      model will significantly improve patients' attitudes towards, and increase the frequency of
      behaviours related to healthy living, as indicated by the Short-Form 36, the Three-Factor
      Eating Questionnaire, and the Health Value Scale.

      RESEARCH PLAN: The investigators will conduct a non-blinded clinical trial of the efficacy of
      Integrative Health Coaching techniques in 40 subjects who are being treated at the
      Vancouver/Richmond Early Psychosis Intervention program, which provides specialty care to
      patients with suspected or newly diagnosed psychotic disorders. All subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups (n = 20 subjects per group). In the first group,
      subjects will receive treatment for psychosis based on the current standard of care, which
      includes psychosocial training, education and pharmacological treatment. The second group of
      subjects will receive not only the standard of care treatment for psychosis, but additional
      Health Coaching to improve physical health. Subjects in both treatment groups will be given
      questionnaires to assess health attitudes and behaviours, and will receive routine blood work
      to monitor metabolic dysregulation, at baseline and months 1, 2, 3 and 6 from when they enter
      the study. Data will be collected and analyzed for differences between the two groups at the
      end of the study. Results will be analyzed based on intent-to-treat analysis, and comparison
      of metabolic and other health indices compared between the two groups using t-test and
      chi-square analyses.

    <description>Health Coaching sessions are 2 hours long. Participants individually receive a physical assessment, and recent blood work and medications are reviewed. When everyone has been assessed, the group reconvenes to watch a video about the importance of making healthy lifestyle choices, participates in a 10 min. fitness activity, and receives training on making SMART goals (SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely). Each participant individually creates a SMART goal for him/herself, and this goal is reviewed as a group. Each participant rates the importance of this goal, and rates their level of confidence in succeeding. Progress is tracked in subsequent sessions, and metabolic health is continually monitored through routine blood work.</description>
