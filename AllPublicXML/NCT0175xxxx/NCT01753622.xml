    <textblock>
      Obesity and overweight have become an epidemic in the world and its prevalence between
      pregnant women is especially dangerous. Having a high Body Mass Index (BMI) is also
      associated with depression disorders and its serious complications during this period.

    <description>Supervised physical conditioning program of three 55—60 minute sessions per week during whole pregnancy (from week 9 to 38). Each session consists of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, 10 minutes of specific exercises (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvic floor muscles training.
Aerobic activity was prescribed at light to moderate intensity, aiming for 55-60 of maximal heart rate. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar FT7) during the training sessions to ensure that exercise intensity was light to moderate.</description>
