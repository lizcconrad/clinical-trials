  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the biologic and chemical differences that cause the greater
      incidence, and severity of asthma in women as compared to men. Severe asthma affects boys
      more than girls, while severe asthma in adults is predominantly a disease of women. The
      investigators aim to identify the processes that occur in the body that are behind the onset
      of severe asthma in young women during the teenage years, and the resolution of severe asthma
      in boys. To further evaluate gender influences on asthma, asthmatic women at different stages
      of their menstrual cycle (period) will be also studied. The investigators aim to use
      biomarkers to develop testing procedures that will identify different types or
      characteristics of asthma in men and women; and to follow patients over time to uncover
      relevant clinical outcomes of biomarkers. The investigators anticipate that they will 1)
      develop clinically relevant tests to identify unique types or characteristics of asthma and
      severe asthma; 2) determine outcomes over time of biochemically-defined types of asthma; and
      3) identify the reasons for why adult women are affected more than men with severe asthma.

      This scientific site-specific project is part of a larger network of asthma studies, the
      Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). The mission of SARP is to improve the understanding of
      severe asthma to develop better treatments.
