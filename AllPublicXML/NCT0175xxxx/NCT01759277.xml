  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients typically experience moderate-to-severe pain following knee arthroplasty that is
      usually treated with a combination of oral and intravenous analgesics and enhanced by
      continuous peripheral nerve blocks. There are currently two locations to place a perineural
      catheter to provide analgesia following knee arthroplasty: a femoral nerve catheter and an
      adductor canal catheter. Both have been demonstrated to be effective following knee
      arthroplasty. However, it remains unknown if one location is superior to the other; or, more
      accurately, what the relative benefits are to each technique.

      While femoral CPNB has many benefits, one of the challenges of using this technique is that
      there is a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength which can be a limiting factor for
      rehabilitation. In contrast, the adductor canal catheter affects only the vastus medialis.
      This block may lessen block-induced quadriceps weakness following knee arthroplasty compared
      with a femoral infusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared with femoral perineural local anesthetic
      infusion, an adductor canal infusion is associated with a shorter time until four discharge
      criteria are met: (1) adequate analgesia; (2) independence from intravenous analgesics; (3)
      ability to ambulate 30 m; and (4) ability to stand, walk 3 m, and return to a sitting
      position without another's assistance.

      Of importance: The primary investigation involves 80 evaluable subjects (with primary
      endpoint data) having tri-compartment knee arthroplasty. In addition, the investigators will
      enroll up to 70 subjects having uni-compartment knee arthroplasty as a pilot study in
      preparation for a subsequent larger, definitive trial. These two groups will not be analyzed
      together--they represent two distinct studies: one a definitive RCT for tri-compartment knee
      arthroplasty; and, one a pilot study for uni-compartment knee arthroplasty.
