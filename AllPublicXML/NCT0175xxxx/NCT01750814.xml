             requirements for the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity, especially anaphylactic reactions to egg,
             egg proteins, chicken or components of vaccine such as gentamicin, gelatin, and
             arginine

          -  Subjects with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome

          -  Subjects with severe chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases without
             controllable hypertension, hemoglobinopathy, respiratory, metabolic, and renal
             disorders) who are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study

          -  Subjects previously treated with anti-coagulant therapy or hemophiliac patients who
             may be at risk of severe hemorrhage after an intramuscular injection

          -  Subjects who have had an acute febrile (at least 38.0°C) episode at some time during
             the 72 hours before enrollment

          -  Subjects who have received a vaccination within 7 days before enrollment or who are
             scheduled for another vaccination (excluding the study vaccine) during the study

          -  Immunocompromised subjects with immunodeficiency diseases or those who are receiving
             immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy, e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporin,
             interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus

          -  Subjects who have received high-dose corticosteroids in the 3 months before
             vaccination or who will be administered a cumulative dose of 700 mg of corticosteroids
             during the study. Inhaled, intranasal, and local application of corticosteroids is
             permitted, regardless of dosage, and corticosteroids such as prednisolone at a maximum
             dose of 15 mg/day are allowed

          -  Subjects who have been administered immunoglobulins or blood-derived products 3 months
             before enrollment or who are scheduled for the administration during the study

          -  Subjects who have received an influenza vaccine within 6 months of enrollment

          -  A female subject who is pregnant or who is breast-feeding. Subjects of childbearing
             potential without an appropriate contraceptive measure within 30 days before
             enrollment and who do not agree to use a clinically acceptable method of birth control
             during the study (e.g., oral contraceptives, condom, diaphragm or intrauterine device,
             or vasectomy of male partner)

          -  Subjects who have participated in any other clinical trials within 30 days of the
             administration of the study vaccine

          -  Individuals with other clinically significant medical or psychological condition who
             are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study
