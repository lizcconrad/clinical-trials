    <textblock>
      Little is known about the effect of fMRI navigation in the intracranial arteriovenous
      malformation surgery. The investigators aim to perform a multicenter prospective randomized
      single -blind clinical trial to assess the effect and safety of fMRI navigation in the brain
      arteriovenous malformation surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital lesions that consist of
      multiple arteries and veins, connecting as a fistula without an intervening normal capillary
      bed. Surgical removal is thought as a major treatment option for AVMs. However, compared with
      stereotaxic radiosurgery and endovascular embolization, microsurgery of AVMs is regarded with
      high mortality and morbidity, particular for high level classification AVMs .

      Blood oxygen level dependent fMRI can be used to mapping the motor and language regions of
      the brain noninvasively. It has been one of the most advanced functional imaging techniques
      and it has quickly grown to be a vital tool for clinical and cognitive neuroscience research.
      Many clinical researches have been reported about the utility of fMRI in brain tumor surgery.
      However, the effect of fMRI navigation for neurofunction protection in the intracranial
      arteriovenous malformation surgery was unclear.

      We aim to perform a multicenter prospective randomized single -blind clinical trial to assess
      the safety and effect of fMRI navigation in the intracranial AVMs surgery. We hypothesize
      that application of blood oxygen level dependent fMRI is able to improve long term prognosis
      of patients.
