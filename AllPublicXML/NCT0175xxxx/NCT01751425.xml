  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study. The goal of the first part of this clinical research study is to find
      the highest tolerable dose of ruxolitinib that can be given with a TKI that you are already
      taking (such as gleevec, sprycel or nilotinib) as part of your standard of care treatment.
      The goal of the second part of this study is to learn if this drug combination can help to
      control CML. Although you have a good response to therapy, the disease is still detectable at
      low levels (this is called &quot;minimal residual disease&quot;). Researchers believe that eliminating
      all detectable evidence of disease may decrease the chances that the leukemia will ever come
      back. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied in both parts.

      Ruxolitinib is designed to block a protein called Jak2 that may help keep some leukemia cells
      alive even with TKI therapy. Blocking this protein may cause the cells to die.

      This is an investigational study. TKIs are approved for the treatment of CML and are given as
      part of your standard of care, even if you do not participate in this study. Ruxolitinib is
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. The
      combination of these drugs to treat CML is investigational.

      Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will continue receiving the
      same TKI at the dose you had been receiving for the last 6 months.

      You will also receive ruxolitinib by mouth 1 or 2 times daily. The dose level and how often
      you take the drug will depend on when you enter the study. The study staff will give you more
      detailed instructions about how often you will take the drug and what you should do if you
      vomit or miss a dose of study drug.

      In the first part of the study, you will be assigned to a dose level of ruxolitinib based on
      when you join this study. Up to 3 dose levels of ruxolitinib will be tested. At least 3
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of ruxolitinib is found. This is called the Dose Escalation Group.

      After the highest tolerated dose has been found, an extra 30 participants will receive
      ruxolitinib at that dose level. This is called the Dose Expansion Group.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may have had and to list any
      drugs you may be taking.

      Every 1-2 weeks for 8 weeks, then at Month 3 (+/- 3 weeks) and every 3 months after that,
      blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test your kidney and liver
      function.

      Every month for the first 3 months, then every 3-6 months for the first year, then every 6-12
      months after that, blood (about 1 tablespoon) drawn for molecular testing.

      Every 3-6 months for the first year, then every 6-12 months after that you will have a bone
      marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease.

      At Weeks 1 (+/- 3 days) and 4 (+/- 1 week), Months 3 and 6 (+/- 1 month), then every 6-12
      months after that, you will have a complete physical exam.

      If the study doctor decides that this is in your best interest, you may be able to stop
      taking the study drug and/or your TKI. If you stop the study drug and/or TKI, every 4 weeks
      for the first 6 months after you stop treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months,
      and then every 6 months after that , blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for molecular
      testing. Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 2 years as long as the doctor thinks it is
      in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed both the
      end-of-treatment and follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visits:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will be called or you will come in to the clinic
      within 30 days and you will be asked about any side effects and/or symptoms you may be
      having. If you are contacted by phone, the call should last about 2-3 minutes.
