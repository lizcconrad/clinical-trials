    <textblock>
      This project aims, through pharmaceutical care in patients with Bipolar I Disorder, improve
      compliance and adherence rate, associated with greater effectiveness and safety of drug
      therapy to help achieve therapeutic goals, and finally to improving the quality of life of
      patients.

      The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of the Dader Method for
      pharmaceutical care in the reduction of the use of health care services and the increase in
      the effectiveness and safety of treatment in patients with Bipolar I Disorder who are
      discharged or referred for outpatient clinic St John of God-La Ceja. Primary objective: To
      assess the effectiveness of the Dader method for pharmaceutical care on achieving in reducing
      the number of hospital readmissions, in the increase of the effectiveness and safety of
      treatment in patients discharged from the Clinic of Saint John of God -La Ceja - Antioquia
      with bipolar disorder.

      A randomized controlled trial. 200 patients will be randomized to group of control or
      intervention. Post-randomisation, patients will be required to attend the clinic routinely
      every 3 months during one year. Every 3 months will be evaluated on the criteria of
      effectiveness and safety of the treatment. Intervention's group will be following through
      pharmaceutical care. In the development of the study will be a record of the use of health
      care services (rehospitalizations, care emergency and outpatient, additional to those
      scheduled).

    <description>The Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36): It is a questionnaire to measure quality of life, exploring the physical and mental health. Contains 36 topics that explore 8 dimensions of health: physical function; social function; limitations of the role: physical problems; limitations of the role: emotional problems; mental health; vitality; pain and general health perception. Each of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 scores range between 0 and 100 values. 100 being a result indicating optimal health and 0 would reflect in a very bad state of health. The questionnaire allows the calculation of 2 scores summary, physical component summary (PCS) and mental (MCS), by combining each dimension scores</description>

The CGI-BP-M, is a scale for the assessment of manic, hypomanic, depressive or mixed symptoms, and long-term outcome of bipolar disorder. Assesses the current gravity, the short and long term of the disease course. It consists of three subscales, composed of a single item, evaluating the severity of the acute symptoms of depression, mania and disease in general (refers to the longitudinal disease severity). It has a Likert intensity scale of 7 degrees of freedom ( 1 normal, 7 very severe).</description>

          <description>Because there is no blinding, there is no ‘placebo’ treatment. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed about the study and they will be registered after their signed authorization. The control group (patients and their families) will receive usual care as well as verbal and written information provided by the pharmacist (routine dispensing, including oral counseling regarding drugs). The written material is about mental health (MH) and BD, with information focusing on the importance of adhering to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to achieve treatment goals. Randomization will take place during week zero (baseline) and patients will meet again with the pharmacist every three months (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). At each appointment, variables related to the primary (number of hospitalizations, emergency service consultations, unscheduled outpatient visits) and secondary outcomes (effectiveness, safety, adherence, and quality of life) will be assessed.</description>

          <title>Intervention Group: the Dader Method for Pharmaceutical Care</title>
          <description>The Dader Method for pharmaceutical care is a systematic process developed by the Research Group of Pharmaceutical Care at the University of Granada, Spain [16]. The intervention is based on the use of pharmacotherapy records, evaluation of an assessment form that includes BD-I and the drugs used to treat this medical problem, and their assessment on a specific date. This assessment is used to identify: (1) any potential or actual patient health outcomes that are not consistent with the objectives of pharmacotherapy and are associated with the use of medicines (negative outcomes associated with medication (NOM)); and (2) situations in which the use of medicines caused or may cause the appearance of a NOM (drug-related problems (DRP)) [14]. Once the relevant problems are identified, the necessary interventions to patients or to physicians are carried out to solve the identified NOM and are followed by a subsequent assessment of the achieved outcomes.</description>

Contains 36 topics that explore 8 dimensions of health: physical function; social function; limitations of the role: physical problems; limitations of the role: emotional problems; mental health; vitality; pain and general health perception. Each of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 scores range between 0 and 100 values. 100 being a result indicating optimal health and 0 would reflect in a very bad state of health. The questionnaire allows the calculation of 2 scores summary, physical component summary (PCS) and mental (MCS), by combining each dimension scores</description>
