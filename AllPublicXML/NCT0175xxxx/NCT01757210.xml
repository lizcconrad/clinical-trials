  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aprepitant was approved in 2003. The drug works to lessen the amount of nausea and vomiting
      that cancer patients experience after treatment. Aprepitant has been well-studied in adults,
      but not in children. Data from adult studies has shown aprepitant to be safe. It has also
      been shown to be effective in lessening the amount of nausea and vomiting that adult patients
      experience. Because aprepitant has been shown to be safe and effective, the investigators
      have been using it in pediatric patients at this hospital as standard of care. The
      investigators will be surveying patients already receiving aprepitant for prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting to determine the amount of nausea and vomiting they
      experience. The investigators will also be surveying these patients to determine what their
      appetite is like and if they experience any disruptions in activities of daily living. The
      investigators are also going to be assessing any side effects these patients experience from
      receiving aprepitant.

      This will be a prospective, observational study conducted at WVU Children´s Hospital. The
      study will be conducted over a one—year period until data from 20—40 patient encounters is
      obtained. There will be no randomization and no control group. Information will be collected
      from all patients who meet the study´s inclusion criteria. Patients will be given a survey to
      complete at baseline, on all days of chemotherapy, and for five days after the conclusion of
      chemotherapy using the BARF Scale and a 4—point Likert scale. The information collected from
      the survey will include the incidence and severity of nausea and emesis, evaluation of
      appetite, activities of daily living, and rescue medications used for acute CINV. The
      specific chemotherapy regimen that each patient receives will be recorded. Any data
      identifying the patient will be de—identified after all pertinent data is collected.
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze data.
