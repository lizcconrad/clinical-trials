  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the way doctors close the skin during cesarean section is different between
      surgeons and there is little evidence to support the use of one kind of closure over the
      other. At the Mayo Clinic Family Birth Center, skin is currently closed using an absorbable
      suture (or stitch), placed within the top layer of skin. At other institutions, a metal
      staple is often used to close the skin.

      There is a new technique that uses special absorbable staples just beneath the skin. This
      technology may be equal to, or possibly better than, current skin closure techniques.
      However, there is currently little data to show how it compares. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the absorbable staple to the currently used absorbable suture. The data from this
      study will then be used to help determine the best technique for skin closure.

    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide. In
      the United States, the proportion of deliveries by cesarean has increased from approximately
      21% in 1996 to 32.8% in 2010. Ultimately, the rising incidence of cesarean delivery results
      in increased surgical morbidity; including pain, blood loss, and surgical site infections,
      which leads to an increase in overall hospitalization days and healthcare costs. This volume
      of surgical procedures also carries the risk of blood and body fluid exposures to surgical
      staff. Suture needles contribute to 43.4% of all sharps injuries in surgical settings and
      51.5% of sharp injuries to surgeons alone. Additionally, it was discovered that 20% of blood
      borne pathogen exposures on the Mayo Clinic Rochester campus in 2011 occurred in the
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Therefore, any quality improvement measure regarding
      cesarean sections has the potential to significantly impact overall surgical morbidity,
      bloodborne pathogen exposure, and healthcare costs at our institution. Reviews of current
      literature show a lack of evidence for many of the surgical steps during cesarean procedures.
      Thus, there is an urgent need to define evidence-based surgical techniques for each step,
      from incision to closure.

      The optimal skin closure technique is simple, quick, cost-effective, and provides adequate
      tissue approximation with a good cosmetic outcome while minimizing the risk of infection,
      dehiscence, and pain. Ideally, needlestick injuries would also be eliminated. It is currently
      unknown which skin closure method is superior with regard to these outcomes.

      The INSORB 20 (Incisive Surgical) is a new, single-use device for skin closure that aims to
      combine the speed of a staple with the cosmetic outcome of a subcuticular suture, while
      eliminating the need for staple removal. Additionally, it should reduce the incidence of
      needlestick injury. INSORB also claims to result in a &quot;low maintenance wound&quot; with less
      surgical site infection, lower inflammation, and increased patient comfort and satisfaction.
      However, data is limited comparing INSORB to the current standards of care (either staples or
      suture).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the new absorbable subcuticular staples (INSORB)
      improves outcomes compared to the current standard absorbable subcuticular suture for skin
      closure in cesarean sections.

    <description>Patient satisfaction was measured by questionnaire at the time of dismissal from the hospital and at their 6 week postpartum/postoperative exam. There were 4 questions: How satisfied are you with the appearance of your skin incision? How willing are you to recommend this same skin closure to a friend? How willing are you to have this same skin closure for your next cesarean section? What is your overall satisfaction with your surgical procedure, including the skin incision? For reporting purposes, possible answers for each item were grouped into negative (not at all, not very, or no opinion), or positive (somewhat or extremely).</description>

    <description>Surgeon satisfaction was assessed by a 3-question questionnaire immediately after performing the procedure. The questions were: How satisfied are you with the appearance of the skin incision?&quot; &quot;How willing are you to recommend this skin closure (whether it was staples or suture) to a patient?&quot; &quot;How willing are you to use this skin closure (whether it was staples or suture) for your next cesarean section?&quot; There were 5 possible responses to each question (not at all, not very, no opinion, somewhat, extremely), with &quot;not at all,' &quot;not very,&quot; and &quot;no opinion&quot; being a negative response, and &quot;somewhat&quot; and &quot;extremely &quot; being a positive response. Categories reported were negative, (including no opinion), and positive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 6 week postoperative appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The cosmetic outcome will be assessed by patients and a blinded observer at the 6 week postpartum/postoperative exam using the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The POSAS consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically. Each item of both scales has a 10-point score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The lowest score is '1', and corresponds to the situation of normal skin (normal pigmentation, no itching etc), and goes up to the worst imaginable. Besides the six items the 'Overall Opinion' of the scar quality is scored separately of both patients and observers. Again, a 10-point scale is used in which 10 corresponds to the worst imaginable scar.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction</title>
        <description>Patient satisfaction was measured by questionnaire at the time of dismissal from the hospital and at their 6 week postpartum/postoperative exam. There were 4 questions: How satisfied are you with the appearance of your skin incision? How willing are you to recommend this same skin closure to a friend? How willing are you to have this same skin closure for your next cesarean section? What is your overall satisfaction with your surgical procedure, including the skin incision? For reporting purposes, possible answers for each item were grouped into negative (not at all, not very, or no opinion), or positive (somewhat or extremely).</description>

        <title>Surgeon Satisfaction (Per Procedure)</title>
        <description>Surgeon satisfaction was assessed by a 3-question questionnaire immediately after performing the procedure. The questions were: How satisfied are you with the appearance of the skin incision?&quot; &quot;How willing are you to recommend this skin closure (whether it was staples or suture) to a patient?&quot; &quot;How willing are you to use this skin closure (whether it was staples or suture) for your next cesarean section?&quot; There were 5 possible responses to each question (not at all, not very, no opinion, somewhat, extremely), with &quot;not at all,' &quot;not very,&quot; and &quot;no opinion&quot; being a negative response, and &quot;somewhat&quot; and &quot;extremely &quot; being a positive response. Categories reported were negative, (including no opinion), and positive.</description>

        <population>A satisfaction survey wasn't completed for all of the procedures (103 per arm), so the reporting population is 91 for the suture arm, and 96 for the staple arm.</population>

        <title>Cosmetic Outcome</title>
        <description>The cosmetic outcome will be assessed by patients and a blinded observer at the 6 week postpartum/postoperative exam using the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The POSAS consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically. Each item of both scales has a 10-point score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The lowest score is ‘1’, and corresponds to the situation of normal skin (normal pigmentation, no itching etc), and goes up to the worst imaginable. Besides the six items the ‘Overall Opinion’ of the scar quality is scored separately of both patients and observers. Again, a 10-point scale is used in which 10 corresponds to the worst imaginable scar.</description>
