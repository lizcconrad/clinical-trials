      The objectives of this study are to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      efficacy of alemtuzumab for infusion for the treatment of CIDP. Eligible subjects will be
      treated with alemtuzumab at the beginning of the study and then followed for three years.
      During the three year period, subjects will under go monthly safety evaluations consisting of
      blood and urine testing, symptom surveys and examination. Detailed neurological testing
      including nerve conduction testing, Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (CIDP/RODS) and
      Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) assessments will be performed every six months
      for three years.

      The study will also investigate and compare the responsiveness of the outcome measures being
      used.

      This is an open-label multi-center trial of alemtuzumab in the treatment of Chronic
      Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). The study will have 4 phases.

      Approximately 16 eligible participants will receive at least one cycle of alemtuzumab (5 days
      of drug infusion). Additional cycles of alemtuzumab (3 days of drug infusion) may be provided
      at the discretion of the participants' treating physician such as if clinical worsening
      occurs.

      Phase 1: Screening Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and having
      signed the informed consent document will enter the screening phase and undergo baseline
      evaluations.

      Phase 2: Drug Infusion Participants will receive alemtuzumab by infusion using a standardized
      protocol. Participants will be maintained on their prior CIDP therapy during the drug
      infusions and then followed at regular intervals.

      Phase 3. Alteration of CIDP therapy CIDP therapy may be altered at the discretion of the
      treating physician - either taper, discontinuation, or increase of current or additional
      medications. For those participants on chronic corticosteroid therapy, following pulse IV
      methylprednisolone and alemtuzumab cycle, corticosteroids will be tapered as rapidly and as
      far as possible according to according to the investigator's discretion. While the aim will
      be to discontinue corticosteroids, it is recognized that some participants will have a
      suppressed pituitary-adrenal axis and complete discontinuation may not be possible.

      Phase 4: Extended Follow-up Each participant will be followed per protocol for a minimum of
      36 months. All participants will undergo safety assessments and monitoring for at least 36
      months after the last cycle of alemtuzumab. Additional cycles of alemtuzumab may be provided
      at the discretion of the participants' treating physician with at least a 12 month interval
      between cycles.

      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 16 participants will join this study.

          3. Diagnosis of CIDP made by a consultant neurologist with a special interest in
             peripheral neuropathy. CIDP may be diagnosed in the presence of diabetes or
             IgG(immunoglobulin- G), IgA and IgM paraproteins without anti- MAG (myelin associated
             glycoprotein) antibodies. Documentation of the initial diagnosis including definite
             neurophysiological criteria proposed by INCAT (lnflammatory Neuropathy Cause and
             Treatment) or EFNS/PNS (European Federation of Neuroscience/Peripheral Nerve Society)
             must be available for review.

          4. Ongoing treatment(s) for CIDP to include IVIg (Intravenous immune globulin) or
             corticosteroids only. Other treatments for CIDP including plasma exchange,
             azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate must be washed out for 3 months.
             Cyclophosphamide, rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies must be washed out for 12
             months.

          5. Duration of CIDP &gt; 6 months prior to the date the ICF is signed.

          6. Treating neurologist and participant in agreement that alemtuzumab is an appropriate
             treatment and documents this is in clinical notes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with alemtuzumab.

          2. Participation in a controlled trial of an investigational medicinal product within the
             past 12 weeks. The duration of required washout will be established based on the known
             biological and pharmacokinetic properties of the investigational drug (prior treatment
             with herbal medications or nutritional supplements is permitted).

          3. Intolerance of pulsed corticosteroids.

          4. Alternative cause of peripheral neuropathy such as drug or toxin, hereditary
             neuropathy or concomitant diseases such as HIV infection, Lyme disease, chronic active
             hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, IgM paraprotein with anti-MAG (myelin
             associated glycoprotein) antibodies, vasculitis, thyroid dysfunction, hematological
             and non- hematological malignancies.

          5. Presence of neurogenic sphincter disturbance.

          6. Multifocal motor neuropathy (fulfilling EFNS/PNS (European Federation of
             Neuroscience/Peripheral Nerve Society) criteria).

             involvement.

          8. Active infection, e.g., deep-tissue infection that the Investigator considers
             sufficiently serious to preclude study participation.

          9. In the Investigator's opinion, is at high risk for infection (e.g., in-dwelling
             catheter, dysphagia, decubitus ulcer, history of prior aspiration pneumonia or
             recurrent urinary tract infection).

         10. Known infection with or seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         11. Previous or present infection with hepatitis C virus.

         12. Previous or present infection with hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B serology).

         13. Prior history of invasive fungal infections.

         14. Latent tuberculosis, unless effective anti-tuberculosis therapy has been completed, or
             active tuberculosis

         15. Cervical high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity or abnormal cervical cytology
             other than abnormal squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). The
             participant may be eligible after the condition has resolved (e.g., follow-up HPV
             (human papilloma virus) test is negative or cervical abnormality has been effectively
             treated).

         16. CD4+ (cluster of differentiation - 4), CD8+ , or CD19+ cell count (i.e., absolute
             CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, or CD19+/mm3) cell count &lt;lower limit of normal (LLN) at
             Screening. If abnormal cell counts return to within normal limits, eligibility may be
             reassessed.

         17. Absolute neutrophil count below the LLN at screening. If abnormal cell counts return
             to with in normal limits, eligibility may be reassessed.

         18. Confirmed platelet count &lt;LLN of the evaluating laboratory at Screening or documented
             at &lt;100,000/μL within the past year on a sample without platelet clumping.

         27. Unwilling to agree to use a reliable and acceptable contraceptive method throughout
             the study period (all participants of reproductive potential). Reliable and effective
             contraceptive method(s) include: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal-based
             contraception, surgical sterilization, abstinence, or double- barrier contraception

             ability to understand the participant information, to give informed consent, to comply
             with the trial protocol, or to complete the study.

         30. Immunocompromise of any type which would in the view of the investigator make the risk
             of alemtuzumab treatment unacceptable.
