      Assessment of safety and feasibility of using a nasopharyngeal cooling technique to provide
      targeted brain cooling during percutaneous implantation of aortic valves. Was it possible to
      obtain brain temperatures below 34° within a reasonable time interval (max of 1hr) without
      delaying the procedure of valve implantation.

      OCCTAVI-I Protocol

      6 patients selected for Transcutaneous Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)-procedure will be
      subjected to intra-operative transnasal cooling (RhinoChill) ; cooling will be started after
      induction of anesthesia until tympanic temperature achieves 34° (cooling will be continued
      until 33°C of tympanic temperature, below 33°C active cooling will be stopped)

      No intra-aortic catheter will be inserted before tympanic temperature reaches 34°

      The aim of this study is to test the safety (as referring to routinely used neuromonitoring :
      ForeSight cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) monitoring; and as referring to
      cardiovascular stability : blood pressure &amp; heartrate) and feasibility (as referring to
      temperature characteristics) of brain cooling during TAVI (cerebral (or tympanic) cooling
      rate, differential tympanic-rectal cooling rate, rectal cooling rate, time needed to obtain
      tympanic temperature below 34°)

      Patients will be monitored with FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter (regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation, sensors placed on patient's forehead) and BIS VISTA (bilateral continuousEEG).

      Tympanic temperature will be measured every 5 minutes while oesophageal and blood temperature
      will be continuously measured.

        -  Neuromonitoring (Fore-Sight, Bispectral Index (BIS) Vista) will be started before
           induction of anesthesia and cooling

        -  Transnasal cooling will be started after induction of anesthesia until a target tympanic
           temperature of 34°C

        -  Core temperature will not be monitored by esophageal (caveat interaction TEE probe), but
           by rectal and blood temperature

        -  TAVI-procedure will be started at a tympanic temperature of 34°C

        -  Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) will be checked every 30 minutes intra-operatively
           (target=normocapnia) by arterial blood gas analysis to maintain strict normocapnia

        -  and the end of the TAVI-procedure, patient will be rewarmed at a max rate of 0.8°/h by
           total body bair hugger

        -  when patient reaches tympanic and systemic (rectal) temperature of 35.5°C, extubation
           can be performed

    <measure>Primary outcome is the brain temperature obtained after initiation of nasopharyngeal cooling. Safety-outcome includes local or systemic side-effects of used cooling technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1: start of cooling until brain temperature above 35.5°C</time_frame>
    <description>By the use of nasopharyngeal cooling, brain temperature will be decreased. Time to brain temperature below 34° will be recorded. Local side effects could occur due to the use of this specific nasopharyngeal cooling technique and systemic side effects (especially cardiovascular) could occur due to the initiation of hypothermia</description>

    <measure>changes in cerebral oxygenation (NIRS Fore-Sight technology) induced by targeted brain cooling</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: start of cooling until brain temperature above 35.5°C</time_frame>
    <description>NIRS (or Near-infrared Spectroscopy) enables non-invasive monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation during TAVI procedure and during the installation of targeted brain cooling. NIRS will be used as cerebral monitoring technique during this study protocol</description>

    <measure>Influence of targeted brain cooling on systemic core temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: start of cooling until brain temperature above 35.5°C</time_frame>
    <description>Induction of nasopharyngeal cooling and targeted brain cooling will result in systemic hypothermia. Systemic temperature (rectal temperature) will be recorded to assess the influence of nasopharyngeal cooling on systemic body temperature</description>
