  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives:

      The efficacy of the therapeutic decision taken by respiratory polygraphy (RP) against
      polysomnography (PSG) using the Epworth scale;

      Secondary Objective:

        1. the cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and therapeutic decision valued using the Epworth
           Scale and EuroQol 5D.

        2. effectiveness of the therapeutic decision by means of: 1) quality of life tests, 2)
           adherence and compliance to treatment, 3) blood pressure MAP, 4) biochemistry
           determinations. Design: prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel of
           non-inferiority. 440 patients will be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based
           on the RP or the PSG. The follow-up will last 6 months with 4 assessments. Statistical
           analysis: We will compare the change in the Epworth scale between both arms of treatment
           through analysis of covariance. The premise of non-inferiority is -2 at the lower limit
           of 95% IC. Secondary variables will be analyzed using differences in independent means
           (or non-parametric equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables. Cost-effectiveness:
           costs generated by one and another method will be evaluated against the effectiveness of
           the primary variable using Bayesian techniques

      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel noninferiority. 440 patients will
      be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based on the PR or PSG generating four groups:
      two treated and two untreated with CPAP. The latter did not undergo self-certification home.
      The monitoring will be 6 months and 4 assessments. Statistical analysis: compare the change
      of the scale Epworth before and after the intervention between both treatment arms using
      analysis of covariance. The premise is non-inferiority of -1.6 at the lower limit of 95%.
      Secondary variables were analyzed by independent means differences (or nonparametric
      equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables. Cost-effectiveness: the costs generated by the
      two methods will be measured against the effectiveness of the primary endpoint using Bayesian
      techniques
