      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      XRP6258 when given as a weekly 1-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion for the first 4 consecutive
      weeks of each 5-week treatment cycle (Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of each 5-week treatment
      cycle).

      Secondary Objectives :

        -  To define the safety profile of the drug

        -  To establish the recommended dose and time interval for future Phase II trials

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of XRP6258 in man

        -  To assess the absolute oral bioavailability of XRP6258 at the i.v. recommended dose
           (following Protocol Amendment No. 2)

        -  To look for evidence of antitumor activity

      The duration of the study will include the following periods:

        -  Pretreatment: 28 to 7 days before first infusion

        -  Treatment: Weekly for the first four consecutive weeks during 5-week treatment cycle

        -  Post-treatment: 3 - 4 weeks after last infusion.

      Treatment may be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient
      refusal.

Oral bioavailability part:
XRP6258 administered at the dose of 8.4 mg/m² as an oral administration on Day 1 Cycle 1 and as a weekly 1-hour i.v. infusion at the subsequent weeks of treatment.

          2. Histologically proven cancer at the first diagnosis. At study entry, it was desirable
             but not required to have histological or cytological proof of metastasis in the case
             of a 1 single metastatic target lesion.

          3. Advanced neoplastic disease that was refractory to conventional treatment or for which
             no standard therapy existed

          4. Progressive disease
