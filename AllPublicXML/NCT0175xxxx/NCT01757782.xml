      The purpose of this study is to to study the role of oral Sildenafil in Persistent Pulmonary
      Hypertension of Newborn (PPHN) secondary to Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS) in newborns
      and to study risk factors of MAS developing into PPHN.

    <description>Patients were randomized into two groups. Placebo was prepared with distilled water. In group A, newborns received oral Sildenafil solution through feeding tube which was prepared by crushing a 50 mg tablet of sildenafil in distilled water to make a concentration of 5 mg/ml. In group B, newborns received placebo. The protocol for dosing was (1) first dose of 1 mg/kg/dose within 30 minutes admission or within 12 hours of delivery (whichever earlier), (2) Dosing every six hours for a maximum of 8 doses, (3) Dose was doubled if the oxygenation index (OI) or SpO2 did not improve (If OI continued to be &lt;10% of previous value and SpO2 was not increasing &gt;5 of previous value) and blood pressure remained stable</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newborns were diagnosed with MAS if any of the two of the following three criteria
             were present. (1) Meconium staining of liquor or staining of umbilical cord or skin or
             nails. (2) Respiratory distress, within one hour of birth. (3) Radiological evidence
             of aspiration pneumonitis (atelectasis and/or hyperinflation). Newborns with MAS
             diagnosed with clinical PPHN were enrolled in the study for drug trial. PPHN was
             determined either clinically by loud P2(second component of second heart sound), 10%
             or greater pre-/post ductal difference in arterial oxygenation (obtained by acid base
             gas analysis) or upper limb- lower limb SpO2 difference (obtained by pulse oximetry).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (a) babies with congenital heart disease (b) congenital anomalies particularly those
             which were incompatible to life or which was the cause for respiratory distress e.g.
             diaphragmatic hernia (c) Respiratory morbidities such as hyaline membrane disease,
             congenital pneumonia (d) Babies with PPHN secondary to MAS admitted after 12 hours of
             delivery (e) Non availability of consent of guardian for interventional procedures
