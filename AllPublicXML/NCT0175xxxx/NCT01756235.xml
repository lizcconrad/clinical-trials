  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing observational study was conducted in a multi-country, multi-center and
      single-arm format. Data were collected prospectively. Adult participants with diagnosis of RA
      who were assigned for treatment with adalimumab (Humira®) were eligible for participation.
      During this period four follow-up visits were planned for observation of the participant and
      documentation of data. Ideally, these visits should have been performed approximately 3 (V1),
      6 (V2), 9 (V3) and 12 (V4) months after the baseline visit (V0).

    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12 and Month 12 LOCF</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores range from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Physical Activity SQUASH Scores and Individual Physical Activity Categories’ SQUASH Scores in Participants in Remission or LDAS</title>
        <description>This outcome analyses the quantitative SQUASH score and individual SQUASH scores by DAS28 categories. The quantitative SQUASH score (ranging from 0 to 17010.000) is calculated as the sum of subscores that capture physical activity related to commuting activities (SQUASH-A), leisure time activities (SQUASH-B), household activities (SQUASH-C) and activity at work and school (SQUASH-D). The SQUASH score and its subscores has non-negative values. Higher values indicate a higher individual activity level. DAS28 categories being assessed are remission (defined as DAS28 of less than 2.6) and LDAS (defined as DAS28 of less than 3.2).The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Tender joint counts and swollen joint counts across 28 joints, C-reactive protein (CRP), and general health assessed via the visual analog scale (VAS) are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Physical Activity SQUASH Scores and Individual Physical Activity Categories’ SQUASH Scores in Participants Those Who Did Not Attain Remission or LDAS</title>
        <description>This outcome analyses the quantitative SQUASH score and individual SQUASH scores by DAS28 categories. The quantitative SQUASH score (ranging from 0 to 17010.000) is calculated as the sum of subscores that capture physical activity related to commuting activities (SQUASH-A), leisure time activities (SQUASH-B), household activities (SQUASH-C) and activity at work and school (SQUASH-D). The SQUASH score and its subscores has non-negative values. Higher values indicate a higher individual activity level. DAS28 categories being assessed are remission (defined as DAS28 of less than 2.6) and LDAS (defined as DAS28 of less than 3.2).The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Tender joint counts and swollen joint counts across 28 joints, C-reactive protein (CRP), and general health assessed via the visual analog scale (VAS) are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores range from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
          <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores range from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from baseline in the overall score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The SQUASH and its subscores are instruments to measure the physical activity level, whereas the DAS28 measures disease activity. In order to evaluate the relationship between physical function and disease activity (as measured by the two scales), Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the SQUASH scores and the DAS28. A decrease in physical functioning is likely to be connected to stronger disease activity.</description>
