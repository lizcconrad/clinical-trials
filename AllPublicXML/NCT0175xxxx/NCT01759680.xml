  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tiredness, lack of motivation and low compliance can be observed in nursing home residents
      during the practice of physical activity. Because exercises should not be too vigorous, whole
      body vibration could potentially be an effective alternative.

      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of 3-month training
      by whole body vibration on the risk of falls among nursing home residents.

      Patients were randomized into two groups: the whole body vibration group which received 3
      training sessions every week composed of 5 series of only 15 seconds of vibrations at 30 Hz
      intensity and a control group with normal daily life for the whole study period.

      The impact of this training on the risk of falls was assessed blindly by three tests: the
      Tinetti Test, the Timed Up and Go test and a quantitative evaluation of a 10-second walk
      performed with a tri-axial accelerometer.
