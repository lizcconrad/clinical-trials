  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of specialized white cells from the donor at
      different doses. They are called WT1 sensitized T cells. They have been grown in the lab and
      are immunized against a protein. The protein is called the Wilms' tumor protein, or WT1. The
      multiple myeloma cells make and express this protein&quot;. The investigators want to learn
      whether the WT1 sensitized T cells will attach to the protein and kill the myeloma cells. The
      investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the patient and
      multiple myeloma.

    <description>DLT will be defined as a grade III or greater toxicity developing within 3 weeks of the T cell infusion, as graded by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 or new development of grade II-IV acute GVHD within 3 weeks of the T cell infusion that requires treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids. Patients will be evaluated for 21 days for grade III or greater toxicities.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will also be monitored for secondary or immune-mediated graft rejection and or onset of grade II-IV acute GVHD following the administration of WT1-specific T-cell infusions. Because patients may still have transplantation associated cytopenia or may have residual disease that may be associated with cytopenias, hematologic toxicity will be excluded in assessing DLT. All patients will be observed for a minimum of 3 weeks after the first WT-1 peptide sensitized T-cell infusion before the dose can be escalated.</description>

    <description>In addition, patients will be monitored for serologic responses of their myelomas. The time at which the response was achieved will be recorded for all patients and summarized by dose level. The data derived from these studies will provide an initial assessment of the effects of the T cell infusions.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo a preparative regimen with busulfan, melphalan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and a T cell depleted stem cell transplant from a histocompatible related or unrelated donor. Hematopoietic stem cell donors for this trial will include individuals who are 10/10 HLA matched or one antigen or allele mismatched at the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 or DQB1 locus, as defined by high resolution methods .Donors who are 8/10 HLA matched with an antigen or allele mismatched at HLA-DQB1 and at one other locus will also be eligible for the trial. The administration of WT1-specific cytotoxic T cells (WT1 CTLs) post transplantation is integrated to induce complete remissions in patients with residual disease and to decrease the rate of relapse following the allogeneic transplant.</description>
