  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will explore interventions to promote medication adherence
      using a novel electronic device that can track daily pill use. 500 subjects will be
      randomized into 4 arms of the experiment. In addition to a control arm, our three arms will
      be: reminders, financial incentives, and reminders and financial incentives.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study simple &quot;behavioral economics&quot; interventions that rely on
      consumer engagement to overcome cognitive and motivational barriers to medication adherence.
      Our goals are threefold: (1) to analyze which interventions are most effective in promoting
      medication adherence; (2) to analyze which interventions are most effective in promoting
      long-term habits that persist even when the interventions are removed; and (3) to understand
      how various patient characteristics (e.g. age or risk preferences) predict adherence or
      treatment receptivity. The investigators plan to track daily adherence of patients to a
      prescribed chronic disease drug using a new technology that electronically monitors when a
      pill bottle has been opened. In our control condition, patients will be monitored but not be
      provided with any reminders, adherence information, or incentive to adhere to their
      medication. Our three additional treatments will be either: (1) provide the patient with a
      daily email, text message, or phone call reminder to take the pill; (2) pay patients for each
      day that they take their pill (3) provide the patient with a daily email, text message, or
      phone call reminder to take the pill and pay patients for each day that they take their pill.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control Arm</arm_group_label>
    <description>Arm 1 will be the Control arm, in which subjects will be instructed to use the GlowCap for their chronic disease medication but will not be provided with any specific incentive for taking the medication or with any aid in remembering to do so.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Reminder Arm</arm_group_label>
    <description>Arm 2 will be the Reminder arm with daily email, text message, or phone call reminders for intervention. Subjects will be told that to aid in daily adherence to the medication, they will be provided with reminders for the first three months of the study and possibly again later in the study. At the start of the study, subjects will be given the option to receive daily email reminders, text message reminders, or daily (automated) phone call reminders to take their pill, each at a time of day that they choose. The default setting will be for subjects to receive both text and email reminders at 8AM each day. Subjects will be instructed on how to change their settings if they would like to receive a different set of reminders at different points in time.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Incentives Arm</arm_group_label>
    <description>Arm 3 will be the financial incentives arm, in which subjects will be paid for adherence. Their total earnings will be administered at the end of the experiment through the WTH platform.</description>

    <description>Arm 4 will be the financial incentives and reminders arm, in which subjects will be paid for adherence. Their total earnings will be administered at the end of the experiment through the WTH platform. They will also receive daily email, text message, or phone call reminders for intervention.

    <intervention_name>GlowCap</intervention_name>
    <description>The main research instrument is an electronic pill bottle called GlowCaps (by Vitality) that has the ability to transmit adherence data to the Way to Health (WTH) web portal. The investigators will measure adherence by counting the number of properly taken doses during the final four weeks of the study. Each time the pill bottle is opened, a date- and time-stamped wireless signal is sent to the Vitality server via the AT&amp;T cellular network which will then be uploaded to the Way to Health portal for aggregation.</description>
