  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition inducing an inflammatory
      response of the ocular surface. Common symptoms include ocular discomfort, visual impairment
      and instability of the tear film with potential damage to the ocular surface.

      The rationale of the present study is to compare signs as assessed with new methods such as
      measurement of tear film thickness, tear film osmolarity and scattering of the tear film with
      well established methods for assessment of the severity of DES (Break up time, staining of
      the cornea with fluorescein). Additionally, impression cytology and determination of tear
      cytokines/chemokines will be performed to obtain information about inflammatory processes on
      the ocular surface.
