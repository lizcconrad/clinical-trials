      The purpose of this prospective study is to investigate denervation (ie. surgical cutting of
      autonomic nerves) and re-innervation (ie. growth of autonomic nerves) in heart transplant
      recipients. More specifically, we focus on:

        1. The physiological consequences of denervation, in particular its consequences for
           clinical symptoms, orthostatic tolerance (ie. the ability to stand upright) and exercise
           capacity. We hypothesize that denervation has negative consequences for all these
           factors.

        2. The pathological consequences of denervation and reinnervation, in particular its
           association to acute rejection and coronary artery disease (cardiac allograft
           vasculopathy, CAV). We hypothesize that reinnervation protects against acute rejection
           and development of CAV

        3. Donor and recipient factors associated with the reinnervation process. We hypothesize
           that characteristics of the surgical procedure (such as aorta cross-clamp time) as well
           as the rehabilitation process of the recipient (such as physical activity) impacts on
           the reinnervation process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is annually offered to more than 3500 patients worldwide. In Norway,
      the number is approximately 30/year, and all transplants are carried out at one single
      hospital (Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet).

      Normally, the heart function is intimately controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS),
      but all nervous connections are lost during the surgical transplantation procedure, and the
      transplanted heart thus becomes denervated. In time, regrowth of nerves may cause partial
      reinnervation of the new heart.

      Some evidence suggests that reinnervation improves exercise capacity and reduces episodes of
      acute rejections and the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The purpose of this
      study is further to investigate the changes over time with respect to all parts of the
      autonomic nervous system (the sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensoric part), and the
      associated physiological and pathological consequences.

      The study may provide knowledge which ultimately could help us improve health and quality of
      live for heart transplant recipients.

        This study is to enroll 50 Heart Transplant Recipients (HTRs) and 50 healthy control
        subjects.

        HTRs are consecutively invited to participate. Baseline investigations are carried out 7-12
        weeks after transplantation surgery. Follow-up investigations are scheduled to 6 months and
        1, 2 and 3 years after transplantation

        Healthy control subjects will be recruited to matcht the distribution of age and gender
        among HTRs. The will be examined at one time point only; thus, the healthy controls are not
        subjected to prospective follow-up.
