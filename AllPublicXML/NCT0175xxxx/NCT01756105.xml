  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GD) is defined by a hyperglycemia discovered during pregnancy, leading
      to fetal and maternal complications which may be prevented by reaching very strict glycaemia
      targets. Prevalence depends on patient's ethnic group and is about 6 to 14%. This prevalence
      is increasing due to increased GD risk factors (obesity, pregnancy over 35) and also because
      criteria of screening have been strengthened after the results of last studies. Usual
      treatment is diet and in case of failure insulin therapy with multiple injections which may
      lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain and is very difficult to manage for patients. Some
      studies have shown the comparable effect of metformin and insulin in about 50% of GD obese
      patients. The aim of our study is to evaluate efficacy of metformin, outcomes in mother and
      fetus and baby of metformin. In case of metformin failure, insulin will be added in order to
      obtain glycaemia in desired goals.Oxidative stress will be assessed in mother blood, baby
      umbilical cord blood, baby umbilical cord and placenta in 90 women and the oxidative stress
      compared between insulin and metformin alone treated patients.
