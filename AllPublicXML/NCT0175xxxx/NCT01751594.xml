  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study aims to conduct a culturally-based secondary prevention
      intervention targeted toward HIV-positive Black young men who have sex with men (B-YMSM) to
      explore (1) feasibility and acceptability (Trial 1 and Trial 2) and (2) evidence of potential
      efficacy (Trial 2). The primary outcomes will be health promotion behaviors (i.e., treatment
      adherence, sexual risk reduction, reduction in substance use behaviors, and HIV status
      disclosure). Psychosocial factors (i.e. self-esteem, critical consciousness, and
      socio-political awareness) will be examined as secondary outcomes.

      First, the protocol team will finalize the development and manualization of Health 4 Life
      (H4L) a comparison intervention, which will serve as the basis of comparison for Mobilizing
      Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE), the treatment intervention. H4L will be a health promotion
      and life skills intervention to account for time and attention. Following this the protocol
      team will then implement Trial 1. In this trial, the intervention specialist and a &quot;peer
      buddy&quot; (intervention co-facilitator) from one AMTU will conduct one wave of both MOVE and
      H4L. The team will then conduct an analysis of the process data and revise the two
      interventions (MOVE and H4L). Upon revising the interventions, the protocol team will
      implement Trial 2. In this trial, the protocol co-chairs and the interventionist from Trial 1
      will train interventionists and peer buddies from four new AMTUs; these interventionists and
      peer buddies will run the revised MOVE and H4L interventions. Each site will be designated as
      either a treatment or comparison site, and they will conduct two waves of their assigned
      intervention. The team at that time will conduct data analyses and then modify and manualize
      the final version of MOVE and H4L.

    <description>To finalize and manualize Mobilizing Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE) resulting in an intervention with evidence of potential efficacy in reducing sexual risk and substance use behaviors and promoting treatment adherence and HIV status disclosure, as well as self-esteem, critical consciousness, and socio-political awareness. At the same time a non-critical consciousness intervention Health 4 Life (H4L) which will be used as comparison will also be finalized and manualized. H4L is primarily a health promotion and life skills intervention for HIV-positive B-YMSM.</description>

    <description>MOVE involves four sessions. Sessions 1 and 2 occur over a two-day time frame and are each one day long (approximately 8 hours in length). They will: lay the groundwork for the intervention; provide HIV and other sexual health-related information; introduce critical consciousness; Sessions 1 and 2 will begin the enhancement of critical consciousness and the action-reflection-action cycle. Sessions 3 and 4 are also one-day sessions each (approximately 8 hours in length) and will be administered at one month intervals following the completion of sessions 1 and 2. These sessions will be used to provide continued enhancement of critical consciousness and guided support, feedback, and social reinforcement for behavior change and self-efficacy related to increasing health-promoting behaviors and reducing HIV-related health risk behaviors.</description>
