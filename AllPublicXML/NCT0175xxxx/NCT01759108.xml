  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is a major distressing symptom in Sjőgren's syndrome(SS). Preclinical and clinical
      studies have demonstrated an increase in saliva volume following rebamipide administration.We
      thus hypothesize that rebamipide may be efficacious in the treatment of dry mouth symptoms
      related to Sjőgren's syndrome.We will recruit SS patients in a randomized placebo-controlled
      trial for 12 weeks. The main outcome measure that will concern us is patient-assessed
      improvement of dry mouth symptoms and increase in salivary secretion Safety and efficacy was
      assessed at each visit.

    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is a major distressing symptom in Sjőgren's syndrome (SS). Persistent dryness of
      the mouth causes oral pain, discomfort and significantly interferes with the quality of life.
      Rebamipide, in addition to its gastro-protective effect has displayed various
      anti-inflammatory actions including inhibition of neutrophilic leukocyte activation.
      Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in saliva volume following
      rebamipide administration.

      The aim of the present study is to assess efficacy of rebamipide in the treatment of dry
      mouth symptoms related to Sjőgren's syndrome.

      Methods: Fifty-five patients with American European Consensus Criteria Group (AECG)-based
      diagnosis of SS will participate in this randomized placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion
      criteria will include SS patients with dry mouth symptoms. Patients with dry mouth due to
      other conditions will be excluded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 300mg/d
      (100mg x3/day) of rebamipide or placebo for 12 weeks together with their usual therapy.
      Outcome measures will include patient-assessed improvement of dry mouth symptoms and increase
      in salivary secretion (evaluation of unstimulated saliva; questionnaires including the visual
      analogue scale (VAS) for Sicca-syndrome VAS 0-100mm). Subjective and objective findings of
      dry mouth will be recorded at baseline, two, four, six, eight, ten and twelve weeks. Safety
      and efficacy will be assessed at each visit.
