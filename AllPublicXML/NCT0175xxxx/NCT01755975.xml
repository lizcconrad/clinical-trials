  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatments used to treat lymphoma and multiple myeloma sometimes do not always work well
      or they may only work for a short period of time. This is why new treatments are being
      tested.

      This study will test a new combination of two drugs that are already approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for treatment of certain kinds of blood cancers. These drugs are
      romidepsin and lenalidomide. Both these drugs by themselves have been used to treat lymphoma
      or multiple myeloma. However, while these drugs are routinely used alone, this is the first
      time they will be tested together. The mechanism of action of both drugs is not well
      understood but both have been shown to to be effective by themselves in lymphoma and multiple
      myeloma.
