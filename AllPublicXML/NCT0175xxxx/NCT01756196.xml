    <textblock>
      Many systemic reactions occur commonly after spinal steroid injections, especially in
      patients, and may be associated with underlying disease, such as hypertension and diabetes
      mellitus, as well as steroid dose and repetition of spinal steroid injection.

      Evaluate the incidence and types of systemic reactions after spinal steroid injections and to
      investigate the association of spinal steroid injection with patient demographics, history of
      previous injections, type and dose of steroid, and method and site of previous and current
      injections.
