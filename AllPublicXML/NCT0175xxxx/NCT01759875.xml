  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of a natural supplement (betaine
      hydrochloride) to affect the absorption of atazanavir in healthy volunteers. The
      investigators predict that betaine hydrochloride will increase the absorption of atazanavir
      in volunteers pre-treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).

    <measure>Area-Under-the Concentration Curve from zero-to-twenty two hours (AUC,0-22) of Atazanavir</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be atazanavir area-under-the-concentration curve (AUC) values from zero-to-twenty two (0-22) hours. Values from Experimental Arms of the study (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole; Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>

    <measure>Area-Under-the Concentration Curve from zero-to-infinity (AUC,0-inf) of Atazanavir</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be atazanavir area-under-the-concentration curve (AUC) values from zero-to-infinite time (0-inf). Values from Experimental Arms of the study (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole; Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Concentration of Atazanavir</measure>

    <description>The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will also be measured. Values from Experimental Arms of the study (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole; Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (Ritonavir-boosted Atazanavir alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>
