  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung disease is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with
      80% of deaths resulting directly or indirectly from pulmonary disease. Abnormal airway
      clearance causes retention of mucus resulting in frequent chest infections. Physiotherapists
      use different techniques to help clear mucus from the lungs of patients with CF. Inhaled
      medications and airways clearance techniques (ACTs) are central to a CF patient's daily
      treatment and are often coordinated.

      Burden of treatment is a common reason for non-adherence in this patient group, and
      streamlining of treatment timings is sought to optimize adherence whilst ensuring efficacy to
      an often complex daily regimen of inhaled bronchodilators, nebulizers and ACTs. A gap in the
      research exists as to the optimal timing of Hypertonic Saline (HTS) and ACT within the daily
      regimen. A study to show whether the timing of HTS around ACT is significant, can better
      inform patients and potentially allow more flexibility around their treatment regimen.

      Lung Clearance Index (LCI) has shown good sensitivity to abnormalities in lung function
      compared with spirometry and has demonstrated a treatment effect in other trials. LCI may be
      a suitable tool therefore, to assess intervention strategies aimed at airways clearance in
      CF. This study aims to compare the effects ACTs after HTS inhalation versus ACTs during HTS
      inhalation as measured by LCI.

      It is a randomized, crossover trial of ACTs after HTS inhalation compared with ACTs during
      HTS inhalation in adult CF patients during day 10-14 of a hospital admission for treatment of
      a pulmonary exacerbation. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of the treatment session
      options on the first day and the reverse on the second day.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in LCI (a measure of lung
      function) at 90 minutes post treatment with ACTs after HTS inhalation compared with ACTs
      during HTS inhalation in adult CF patients.
