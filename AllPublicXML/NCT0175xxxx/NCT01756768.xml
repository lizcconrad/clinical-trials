  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-center study to evaluate the mass-balance and
      pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in approximately 6 healthy male subjects receiving a single
      oral 125 mg dose of PD-0332991 containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C]-PD-0332991.
      Subjects will be checked in to the research unit from approximately 12 hours prior to dosing
      and remain in house until greater than 90% of the administered radioactivity is collected
      from bodily excreta or until less than 1% of the administered radioactivity is recovered from
      excreta on consecutive days. This study will investigate the extent of involvement of the
      renal and hepatic systems in the elimination of PD-0332991 and will seek to identify the
      compound's major metabolites.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
