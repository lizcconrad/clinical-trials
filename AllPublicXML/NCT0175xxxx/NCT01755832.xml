  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of heated pool group exercises for
      patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases with regard to symptoms (pain, fatigue,
      stiffness and ability to carry out daily activities).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients receive text messages on mobile phones twice a week for circa 40 weeks. The text
      messages ask for pain, fatigue, stiffness and ability to carry out everyday activities. The
      patients should respond with a number from 0 to 10, where 0 is no symptoms/no hindering of
      activity and 10 is worst symptoms/worst hindering of activity.
