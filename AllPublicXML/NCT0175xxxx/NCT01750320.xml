    <description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the concordance of Koning Breast CT-guided Biopsy (KBCT-GBx) results to diagnostic work-up imaging (at least mammographic) and KBCT imaging and to verify that the localization and guidance accuracy of KBCT-GBx is at least equivalent to stereotactic-guided biopsy to validate the localization and guidance accuracy of KBCT-GBx.</description>
