  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of two doses of GSK
      Biologicals' candidate TB vaccine against pulmonary TB, as compared to placebo. The efficacy
      will be evaluated in adults living in TB endemic countries and aged 18 - 50 years because
      pulmonary TB occurs frequently in these countries and age range. In addition, the safety and
      immunogenicity of the candidate tuberculosis vaccine will be evaluated in a subset of
      volunteers.

      Case Definitions:

      • First case definition: A subject with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB disease, with MTB
      complex identified from a sputum specimen, taken before initiation of TB treatment, by Xpert
      MTB/RIF and/or microbiological culture and confirmed HIV-negative at the time of TB
      diagnosis.

      • Second case definition: A subject with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB disease, with MTB
      complex identified from a sputum specimen, taken before initiation of TB treatment, by Xpert
      MTB/RIF and confirmed HIV-negative at the time of TB diagnosis.

      • Third case definition: A subject with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB disease, with MTB
      complex identified from a sputum specimen, taken up to four weeks after initiation of TB
      treatment, by Xpert MTB/RIF and/or microbiological culture and confirmed HIV-negative at the
      time of TB diagnosis.

      • Fourth case definition: A subject with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB disease, with MTB
      complex identified from a sputum specimen, taken up to four weeks after initiation of TB
      treatment, by Xpert MTB/RIF and/or microbiological culture.

      • Fifth case definition: A subject for whom a clinician has diagnosed TB disease and has
      decided to treat the patient with TB treatment.
