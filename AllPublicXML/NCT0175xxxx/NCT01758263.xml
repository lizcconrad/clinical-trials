  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective data analysis of patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) who
      took metoprolol for a minimum of 6 months who then switched to taking nebivolol for a minimum
      of 6 month to treat hypertension. These patients will be identified from a large medical
      claims database. This study tests the hypothesis (alternative, higher or lower) that average
      patient monthly health care administrative cost changes after switching from metoprolol to
      nebivolol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be at least 18 years old at initiation of metoprolol (or first date on metoprolol
             treatment between 2007 and 2011)

          -  Received nebivolol treatment continuously (defined as supply gap &lt;30 days) for at
             least 6 months after initiation

          -  Received metoprolol treatment continuously for at least 6 months prior to switching to
             (initiation of) nebivolol (defined as metoprolol was discontinued whereas a
             prescription for nebivolol was filled)

          -  Had at least 12 months of continuous enrollment (as verified using enrollment file): 6
