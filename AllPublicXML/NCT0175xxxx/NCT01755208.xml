    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies light-scattering spectroscopy in finding disease in
      patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as light-scattering
      spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether light-scattering spectroscopy can reliably
      distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast
      cancer and those without breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to standard
      of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.
