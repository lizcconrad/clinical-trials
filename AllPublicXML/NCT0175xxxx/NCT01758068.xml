  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin of newborn infants is immature and ineffective as a barrier. Preterm skin exhibits
      even more vulnerability to the environment due to poor self regulatory heat mechanisms,
      paucity of fatty tissue and its thinness. Most preterm babies lose up to 13% of their weight
      as water loss from their skin during the first week of life. Many strategies have been
      utilized by neonatologists to decrease this water loss. Edible coconut oil application on the
      skin acts as a non permeable barrier and can help in achieving this. Hence the investigators
      decided to undertake this study to objectively assess the reduction in water loss from skin
      after oil application.

    <description>Skin Condition Score was measured using 'Lane and Drost' Score.This score has 9 scores from 1 to 9, 1 depicting the best skin state and 9 the worst with erythema, blistering &amp; oozing over the entire area.</description>

    <description>The oil (coconut oil) was applied by the trained nurse to the entire body surface of infant except the face two times a day started as early as possible Four ml of coconut oil was applied using both hands of the caregiver in four strokes starting from the level of clavicles over the chest and abdomen till the groin, from the front of thighs, knee, leg and upto the sole, from above the shoulders over the arm and forearm till the palm continuing medially over the forearm and arm till the axilla and the final stroke was used for the back reaching over the back of the thighs till the heel. Just prior to the first application, and thereafter prior to the subsequent applications the TEWL was recorded using the portable closed chamber evaporimeter. The oil application was continued twice daily (every 12 hrs at the same time as the hour of birth e.g. 11 am and 11pm) till the completion of the seventh day (168 hrs of life)..</description>
