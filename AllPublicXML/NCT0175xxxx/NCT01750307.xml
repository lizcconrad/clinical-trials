      Brief summary

      The aim of the study is to provide preliminary data on the relationship of Essential Fatty
      Acids (EFAs) to cognitive and electrophysiological measures of brain and behavioural
      functions in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. This
      main aim will be achieved in two ways. First the investigators will measure the relationship
      of the various measures to blood levels of EFAs in ADHD cases and controls. Secondly, the
      potential effects of dietary supplementation with EFAs on cognitive-electrophysiological and
      behavioural measures in ADHD cases will be investigated. We will evaluate the extent to which
      changes in neuronal activity and cognitive performance are related to behavioural and
      functional measures over time. This is to be carried out by conducting a randomised
      controlled trial of fish oil supplementation in adults with ADHD (The OCEAN study: Oils and
      Cognitive Effects in Adult Neurodevelopment).

      The study design will be a 6-month double blind placebo control study with a group of 80
      adults with a diagnosis of ADHD. The group will be divided into 40 participants who receive
      EFA dietary supplements and 40 who receive placebo, over a 6-month period. Allocation to EFA
      dietary supplementation and placebo groups will be randomly allocated and blind to both the
      investigator and participants. In addition a sample of 30 controls will take part in baseline
      levels of assessment and be used for case-control comparisons to investigate the links
      between EFA blood levels and cognitive-electrophysiological function at one time point.

      The study design will enable preliminary data to address the following hypotheses:

        1. Changes in cognitive and electrophysiological function (neuronal activity) will be found
           following supplementation with dietary EFAs.

        2. Changes in cognition and/or brain activity will be related to blood levels of EFAs.

        3. Changes in cognitive performance and electrophysiological parameters will correlate with
           behavioural function, affective regulation or functional impairments.

        4. At baseline, case-control differences in EFA blood-levels will be found which will be
           linked to cognitive and electrophysiological function.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brain function will be measured using direct current (DC) electroencephalography (EEG) in participants first while they are at rest and second during 4 cognitive tasks. Behavioural function will be measured through assessment of reading and spelling, emotional lability, ADHD symptoms and other self-ratings of behaviour (such as executive function). These measures will be related to the effect of dietary supplementation and blood levels of EFAs in adults with ADHD.</description>
