  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PAD is caused by an increased flow resistance in atherosclerotic ischemic limbs. The
      investigators hypothesize that reducing blood viscosity (through controlled phlebotomy),
      thereby increasing the deformability of red blood cells, should reduce the flow resistance
      and improve tissue perfusion leading to improved clinical function and a reduction in
      symptoms.

      Preliminary data demonstrates that phlebotomy causes a measurable change in blood viscosity
      as measured by the home-made rheologic method.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of changes in blood viscosity, obtained through controlled
      phlebotomy, as a therapy to improve functional status associated with atherosclerotic
      ischemic limbs in pre-amputation patients.

      The first study is a pilot study and will act as proof of principle. This first study will
      include 20 patients divided into 2 groups on the basis of a randomized controlled trial: 10
      patients in the control group receiving conventional treatment and 10 patients receiving
      therapeutic phlebotomy to lower blood viscosity. The objective is to evaluate the effect of
      controlled phlebotomy in patients with Grade 3, Category 5 or 6 chronic critical limb
      ischemia having tissue loss on Rutherford classification (Fontaine stage IV), end-stage
      peripheral vascular disease resistant to maximal medical therapy and where revascularization
      therapy (both percutaneous and surgical) has either proved insufficient or is
      contra-indicated or declined by the patient, usually resulting in amputation.

      The primary outcome parameters will be: the salvage rate of the limb as compared with the
      salvage rate of the limb with conventional therapy.

      Objective classification of improvement in perfusion of the distal extremities using
      ankle-brachial index (ABI), visual analogue pain scale, and photos.

      Subjective classification of improvement in pain scale on critical limbs.

      The relationship between alteration in outcome parameters (i.e., the end point is a reduced
      amputation rate) and blood viscosity will be evaluated as measured by the home-made rheologic
      methods.

    <description>â€¢ This control group is the patients who had Rutherford classification Grade 3, Category 5 or 6 (Fontaine stage IV) treatment-resistant chronic critical limb ischemia having tissue loss. They were treated with conventional standard treatment including revascularization operative procedure if feasible, maximum medical treatment with anticoagulation (heparin, low molecular weight heparin, etc), acetylsalicylic acid, cilostazol, and prostaglandin E1, dextran, and pain analgesia with opioid, and finally major amputation.
We records all control arms' amputation, day to amputation, mortality, etc. We will compare amputation and mortality between control and treatment groups.
Non phlebotomy arm has no phlebotomy treatment.</description>

Procedures for therapeutic phlebotomy
Inject heparin 5000 units to prevent blood clot during phlebotomy
