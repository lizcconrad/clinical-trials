  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficacy of abiraterone in
      participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and who have not
      received prior chemotherapy (treatment of disease, usually cancer, by chemical agents).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), single-arm study to investigate safety and efficacy of
      abiraterone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (consists of 14 days before
      study commences on Day -1); Treatment phase (consists of 28-daily dosing cycles wherein
      abiraterone 1000 milligram [mg] once daily along with 5 mg prednisolone twice daily will be
      given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed); and Follow-up phase
      (up to 5 years or until survival after the first dose of study drug). Abiraterone will be
      orally administered daily as at least 1 hour before the meal or 2 hours after the meal. Dose
      reduction will be allowed at the Investigator's discretion but not lower than 500 mg per day.
      Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression unless, in the
      Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit
      from abiraterone. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific
      antigen (substance in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 12 weeks of
      therapy. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response up to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response will be evaluated according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criterion, which is, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline up to 12 weeks after the first dose of study drug, which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement that is at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 4, 7 and 10, and thereafter every third cycle until first documented disease progression or up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with radiographic objective response is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response based on reconciled radiographic disease assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0. The CR is disappearance of all lesions. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

    <description>Clinical Benefit is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST Version 1.0. The CR is disappearance of all lesions. The PR is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. The SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease since treatment started.</description>

    <description>The PSA-PFS is defined as time to first PSA failure (that is, two consecutive increases in PSA of 50 percent and greater than or equal to 5 nanogram per milliliter, as per Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group [PSAWG]criterion) or death .</description>
