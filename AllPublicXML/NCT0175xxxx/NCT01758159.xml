  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary feeding diet in developing countries cannot meet iron requirements of infants
      and young children. Iron supplementation is mostly used to treat iron deficiency whereas iron
      fortification is cost-effective strategy to control iron deficiency in developing countries.
      However, a recent study showed that iron fortification imposed negative impact on gut
      microbiota by increasing colonization of gut pathogen over beneficial bacteria. Gut
      microbiota plays essential roles in nutrient absorption, vitamin synthesis; intestinal
      mucosal barrier function and pathogen displacement. Iron is essential for growth and
      virulence of most gut pathogens and so iron supplementation might have similar negative
      impact on gut microbiota composition. Therefore, nutrition interventions would not be
      justified by assessing micronutrient status alone ignoring any possible deterioration of gut
      microbiota. The investigators hypothesized that optimizing the nutrient intake from locally
      available foods according to complementary feeding recommendation (CFR) can improve the iron
      status of these children while maintaining healthy gut microbiota composition.

      A randomized, placebo-controlled, community-based, intervention trial will be conducted in
      Ayeyarwady division of Myanmar where childhood undernutrition is prevalent. The aim of this
      study is to compare the effect of optimized CFR to iron supplementation on iron status and
      gut microbiota composition of 1-2years old Myanmar children. Cluster randomization will be
      done at the village level to randomly allocate the villages into CFR or non-CFR villages.
      Individual randomization will be done to randomly assign each child into iron or placebo
      syrup so that individual children will receive one of 4 treatment groups (CFR, Fe, CFR + Fe,
      and Control) for a period of 24 weeks. Based on expected between-groups difference of
      hemoglobin 5g/L, at 80% power, 5% level of significance, 15% drop-out rate; after taking into
      account the cluster effect; required sample will be 109 per group (total = 436). A sub-sample
      of 15 children from each group will be randomly selected for gut microbiota assessment (total
      = 60). Blood samples for iron status and stool samples for gut microbiota assessment will be
      collected at baseline and endline. Anthropometric measurements, usual intake of iron and
      infectious disease morbidity will also be assessed.
