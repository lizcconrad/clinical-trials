      This is a 48 week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective cohort study of
      adolescents and young adults with HIV infection in the ATN who are currently being treated
      with cART that includes TDF as one component of the regimen that includes at least three Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ARVs for at least 180 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a 48 week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective cohort study of
      adolescents and young adults with HIV infection in the ATN who are currently being treated
      with cART that includes TDF as one component of the regimen that includes at least three Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ARVs for at least 180 days. Subjects must have at
      least one documented viral load that is below 200 copies/mL that is collected following
      initiation of TDF containing cART and greater than 90 days prior to randomization; no viral
      load above 200 copies/mL if measured within the 90 days prior to randomization; and an HIV
      viral load obtained at screening that is below 200 copies/mL.

      Treatment assignments will be balanced by subject sex at birth, age (&lt;20 years vs. &gt;=20
      years), and race (African American vs. other). Enrolled subjects will be randomized to
      receive vitamin D3 50000 IU or matching placebo, given orally every four weeks by DOT. In
      addition to the randomized study agent, all subjects will receive a MVI to be taken orally
      once daily. This &quot;standard&quot; MVI will contain ingredients not to exceed 600 IU of vitamin D3
      and 200 mg Ca.

      DXA measurement of whole-body BMC, and BMD at spine and hip, will be performed at baseline
      and study weeks 24 and 48. Blood and urine sampling to assess the Ca-PO4 axis,
      PTH-FGF23-vitamin D signaling, bone turnover, and renal glomerular and tubular function will
      occur at baseline and study weeks 12, 24, and 48 Blood samples to measure Gluc homeostasis
      will be drawn at baseline and week 48, and will be run by batch analysis.

      Safety, measured by SCa and SCr, will be monitored by subject's record review at study sites
      since these labs will generally be measured as a part of routine clinical care. The ATN109
      study will use the SCa and SCr values obtained within 10 weeks at the time of the visit
      beginning at the baseline visit. If these evaluations were not performed within the prior 10
      weeks they will be drawn at the time of the visit. Viral load and CD4 cell count results will
      be recorded for the ATN109 study at screening, baseline and study weeks 12, 24, 48, and
      Post-Week 48 provided the evaluations were done within the protocol specified timeframe. If
      the evaluations are not performed within the protocol specified timeframes they will be drawn
      at the time of the visit.
