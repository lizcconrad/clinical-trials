      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to further study the mechanism by which liraglutide, a
      relatively new anti-hyperglycemic medication, might lower blood pressure in patients with
      Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide health problem. As the reduction in blood pressure
      has been coupled to improvements in overall cardiovascular outcomes, the control of
      hypertension has become an important modifiable risk factor in the overall care of the
      patient with Type 2 Diabetes, in addition to glycemic control. Recently, several large-scale
      clinical trials evaluating the glucose-lowering effects of the anti-hyperglycemic agent,
      liraglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist), have demonstrated a modest yet
      persistent anti-hypertensive effect in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

      Study Objectives: Accordingly, the goal of this small study is to understand whether the
      blood pressure lowering effect of liraglutide is coupled to the release of vasoactive
      mediators which may stimulate natriuresis and/or diuresis and lower systolic blood pressure.

      Study Design: Randomized, double-masked, cross-over study with treatment of liraglutide or
      placebo for 3 weeks, with an intervening washout period for 3 weeks, and cross-over to
      identical treatment with placebo or liraglutide for 3 weeks.

      Study Patients: 20 patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Systolic Hypertension

      Endpoints: Change in vasoactive hormones, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, urinary sodium
      excretion patterns.
