      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Puff City web-based behavioral intervention of
      asthma management program in a clinical setting. This study also examines and evaluates the
      cost and efficiency of patient eligibility determination methods, patient recruitment, study
      monitoring (compliance with study regimen, participant retention and follow-up), and the
      collection of clinical endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma continues to be a major public health problem in the US with high economic and social
      costs. Vulnerable ethnic communities are disproportionately affected by asthma as
      demonstrated by higher morbidity and mortality for these groups. We have completed two
      school-based, randomized trials of a web-based, computer-tailored asthma management
      intervention that targets urban teens (Puff City).

      The current study, Puff City in the Clinic, will be evaluated as a clinical tool by
      initiating the web-based behavioral intervention of asthma management in a clinical setting.
      However, the current paradigm for conducting such a trial is costly with respect to patient
      recruitment, intervention delivery, and data collection and management. To address these high
      costs, the study utilizes comparative effectiveness research (CER) pragmatic approaches to
      design a randomized controlled trial for patient recruitment and determination of
      eligibility, study monitoring (compliance with study regimen, participant retention and
      follow-up), and collection of clinical endpoints.
