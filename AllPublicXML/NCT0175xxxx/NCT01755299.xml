  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The line of &quot;5-hour Energy&quot;® products are available over-the-counter as energy supplements.
      The appeal of these products involves ease of use, low caloric value, and the absence of
      sugar to prevent a &quot;crash&quot; later in the day. The definitive efficacy and potency of the
      products is unknown due to the lack of evidence-based clinical reports. It is suspected that
      the efficacy related to these products is due to the caffeine content, which was reported as
      138 mg per 2-ounce bottle in an online caffeine content chart. The purpose of this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, four way crossover study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of &quot;5-hour Energy&quot;®, &quot;5-Hour Energy Decaf&quot;®, caffeine, and placebo for perceived
      energy and wakefulness.
