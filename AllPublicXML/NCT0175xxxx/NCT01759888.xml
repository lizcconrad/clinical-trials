  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to access the utility of 18F-DTBZ PET imaging as an
      in vivo biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration of both PD mouse models and PD patients.
      Secondary, the investigators will analyze progression rate of genetic-proving PARK8 and PARK6
      patients who have homogeneous phenotype and genotype by 18F-DTBZ PET imaging.

    <textblock>
      Total of 60 patients, 20 LRRK2 G2385R, 20 PARK6, and 20 idiopathic PD, will be recruited.
      Subjects will be evaluated sequentially with 18F-DTBZ during a 36 month period. 18F-DTBZ PET
      scans will be performed twice, at baseline, and 24 (21~27) months following the start of
      their participation in the study. Subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of
      approximately 10 mCi 18F-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging. Whitney test will be used to
      compare the mean standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) values between groups. The decline rate
      of VMAT2 density will be calculated by comparing the SUVRs of age-matched healthy subjects
      from our previous studies. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3
      visits in each scan (total 6 visits in this study), as one screening visit, one imaging
      visit, and one safety evaluation visit.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

    <description>This study will compare the brain uptake of 18F- DTBZ in 60 PD patients, including 20 LRRK2 G2385R, 20 PARK6, and 20 idiopathic PD. Subjects will be evaluated sequentially with 18F-DTBZ during a 36 month period. 18F-DTBZ PET scans will be performed twice, at baseline, and 24 (21~27) months following the start of their participation in the study.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 10 mCi 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ (10 nmole FP-(+)-DTBZ) immediately prior to each scan.
The proposed dose for this study is based on our phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Both genders and 20~80 years old.

             before any of the study procedures.

          3. Twenty PD patients were proved carrying LRRK2 G2385R mutation by our genetic
             laboratory. Patients didn't have other mutations that may contribute to the
             parkinsonism, such as LRRK2 G2019S, LRRK2 R1628P, PARK2, PARK6, and SCA2.
