    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase I/II, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment
      with sorafenib versus treatment with sorafenib alone in subjects with metastatic
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The phase I aspect will assess the safety and efficacy of the
      concurrent treatments and the phase II aspect will utilize CT (computer-tomography) scans to
      assess overall tumor response rate and evaluate disease progression

    <textblock>
      Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a widely used alternative cancer treatment. This
      trial will study an intravenous Vitamin C treatment for persons with liver cancer that has
      spread, who are also receiving Sorafenib (a standard cancer drug), to see whether the
      combination of Vitamin C and Sorafenib is safe and well tolerated. Phase I will involve 6
      persons who will receive the Vitamin C for 8 weeks to more specifically assess the safety of
      getting Vitamin C in combination with Sorafenib. Phase II will be randomized to receive
      either Vitamin C plus Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone for 16 weeks. If Vitamin C has a
      beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or tumor
      markers. Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient.

             limit (if the creatinine is elevated, but ≤1.5X the ULN, a 24 hour creatinine
             clearance will be obtained); transaminase (AST/ALT) ≤2.0X upper limit of normal;
             bilirubin levels ≥ 2 mg/dL; ANC ≥1,500/mm3; Hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL; platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3
