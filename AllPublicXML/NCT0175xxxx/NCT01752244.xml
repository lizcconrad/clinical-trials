  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is a key component of the pathogenesis of insulin
      resistance. Mounting evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory characteristics for vitamin
      D. Although analogues of vitamin D3 have extensively been used in the treatment of various
      chronic inflammatory diseases, to our knowledge, no such research is conducted in regards
      with obesity. The aim of this double blind clinical trial study is to investigate whether
      alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects can affect the insulin resistance. Moreover, we
      will evaluate the pathways of Vitamin D receptor (VDR), Peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma (PPARγ) and eroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator-1 α (PGC1α)
      gene expressions which may lead to insulin resistance following treatment with either
      alphacalcidol or placebo.

      Increasing evidence from human population studies and animal research has established
      correlative as well as causative links between chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.
      The anti-inflammatory characteristics of vitamin D have been demonstrated in previous
      studies. In addition to its role in bone and calcium metabolism, vitamin D is demonstrated to
      be influential in the regulation of different immune system functions and glucose homeostasis
      pathways. Although low levels of vitamin D have shown to be in close correlation with
      obesity, whether vitamin D deficiency is the cause or the consequence of obesity remains
      unclear. It is noteworthy that several studies have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is
      associated with an increased resistance to insulin.

      The biologic effects of vitamin D are primarily mediated via the nuclear transcription
      factor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), which triggers the expression of vitamin D responsive
      genes. VDR is expressed on different immune cells such as monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and
      granulocytes. It is documented that VDR and PGC-1α show an overlapping pattern of expression.
      Furthermore, as the expression of PGC-1α and PPARγ are regulated via environmental stimuli
      such as diet, it could be suggested that the function of VDR function can also be altered in
      response to external stimuli. PGC-1α was demonstrated to be of a particular importance in
      amelioration of increased insulin sensitivity.

      Accordingly, to evaluate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects who generally
      suffer from a low state chronic inflammation could affect the insulin resistance, we designed
      the current double blind clinical trial study to compare the effect of alfacalcidol with
      placebo on serum glucose, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and lipid profile levels as well as
      Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)
      indexes as a markers of insulin resistance. Furthermore, to assess the possible cross talk
      between VDR and PPARγ, the gene expressions of these VDR, PPARγ and PGC1α were evaluated
      following a course of treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo.
