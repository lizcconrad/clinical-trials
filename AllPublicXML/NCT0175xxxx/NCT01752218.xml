      The purpose of this open, prospective study is to address the effectiveness and precision of
      the VICTUS™ Femtosecond Laser Platform-assisted astigmatic keratotomy after
      femtolaser-assisted cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal astigmatism after cataract surgery represents a considerable obstacle in the visual
      rehabilitation of patients. Up-to-date astigmatic keratotomy represents a standardized and
      effective procedure that allows decreasing of naturally occurring and surgically induced
      astigmatism. The shape and architecture of the Arcuate Incisions are pre-calculated based on
      a particular chosen nomogram. The different parameters of the Arcuate Incisions as radius,
      opening and position angle and cutting depth can be achieved precisely by the laser
      technology.

      The laser-assisted Cataract surgery and the Arcuate Incisions are performed by means of a
      femtosecond laser (VICTUS™ FEMTOSECOND LASER PLATFORM®, Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH,
      Munich, Germany) which is in the presented study under investigation and is already
      CE-approved.

      For this open, prospective data collection several selection criteria have been defined in
      order to obtain a data set of minimal 43 eyes and maximal 50 eyes. Depending on whether they
      will be treated unilateral or bilateral the number of subjects enrolled within this study
      sums up to 22-50 patients. The data is gathered in the Castrop-Rauxel Augenklinik and only
      from one experienced surgeon.
