  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A wide spectrum of immune abnormalities has been described by numerous studies involving
      β-thalassemic patients with multiple transfusions. The abnormalities observed are both
      quantitative and functional, and concern several components of the immune response.
      Flavonoids are phenolic compounds widely distributed in plants, which were reported to exert
      multiple biological effects, including antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities.
      Silymarin, a flavonolignan complex isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn),
      have been classified as cytoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and especially as
      hepatoprotective agents. Silymarin is already being used clinically for treatment of liver
      diseases.It is considered safe and well-tolerated, with reported adverse events similar to
      placebo. Several studies have also reported immunomodulatory actions of silymarin. It
      increases lymphocyte proliferation, interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 secretions
      by stimulated lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. It has been shown that in vitro
      treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with silymarin causes restoration of the
      thiol status and increases in T cell proliferation and activation. Because reactive oxygen
      species and iron overload play important roles in the pathophysiology of thalassemia,
      silymarin may be an effective therapy due to its antioxidant, immunomodulatory,
      cytoprotective and iron chelating activities. The present study designed to investigate the
      therapeutic activity of orally administered silymarin for treatment of β-thalassemia major, a
      well-known and prevalent disease in Iran, which is associated with oxidative stress, iron
      overload and immune abnormalities.
