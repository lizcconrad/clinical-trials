  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      Colonoscopy is often regarded as a painful and unpleasant procedure. Transcutaneous Electric
      Nerve Stimulation on Acupoints (Acu-TENS) is a non-invasive modality that has been used
      successfully to treat pain of various origins, but few good-quality studies have evaluated
      its role in treating pain and anxiety during colonoscopy.

      Objective:

      To investigate the efficacy of Acu-TENS in reducing procedure-related pain and the
      consumption of sedatives/analgesics during colonoscopy.

      Design:

      Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

      Subjects:

      One hundred and twenty eight consecutive patients undergoing first-time elective day-case
      colonoscopy without previous experience of acupuncture/Acu-TENS will be recruited.

      Interventions:

      Patients will be randomized to receive either 45 minutes of Acu-TENS or placebo-TENS before
      colonoscopy. The acupoints relevant to the treatment of abdominal pain and distension,
      including Zusanli, Hegu, Neiguan, Tianshu, and Dachangshu will be used. For the placebo-TENS
      group, a non-conductive plastic film will be placed between the acupoint and the electrode so
      that no current will be transmitted. Acu-TENS and placebo-TENS will be continued throughout
      colonoscopy. A mixture of Propofol and Alfentanil, delivered by a patient-controlled syringe
      pump, will be used for sedation/analgesia in both groups.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary outcome: doses of patient-controlled sedation/analgesia consumed. Secondary outcomes:
      pain and satisfaction scores according to a visual analog scale, cecal intubation rate/time,
      and episodes of hypotension/desaturation.
