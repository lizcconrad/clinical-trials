  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anaesthesia has become the cornerstone of multimodal analgesia. With the advent of
      ultrasound guided nerve blocks regional anaesthesia has achieved both greater efficacy and a
      better safety profile as the injection of local anaesthetic is performed under direct vision.
      This has allowed a reduction of the amount of local anaesthetic injected as compared to
      peripheral nerve stimulation technique . Blockade of sciatic nerve combined with saphenous
      nerve provides anaesthesia and analgesia for ankle/foot surgeries. Various combinations of
      local anaesthetics have been used to provide optimal blockade . A mixture of lidocaine with a
      long acting local anaesthetic is commonly used. This provides a rapid onset of blockade, but
      of a consistently shorter duration compared to a long acting local anaesthetic alone. We
      hypothesize that sequential perineural injection of lidocaine and bupivacaine provides
      similar onset but a longer duration of sensory block compared to the same dose and volume of
      local anaesthetic mixed in advance.
