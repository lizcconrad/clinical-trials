  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusion and the complexity of diagnosis and treatment make planning and delivering
      care challenging. Respiratory physiotherapy is recommended, and should be applied during the
      first weeks of treatment.The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      a respiratory physiotherapy protocol in patients with Pleural Effusion who attended a
      University Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.5 million patients are diagnosed with pleural effusion each year in the
      United States . Pleural effusion (PE) is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space that
      is classified as transudate or exudate according to its composition and underlying
      pathophysiology. The goal in the management of pleural effusion is to provide symptomatic
      relief by removing fluid from the pleural space and to allow the treatment of the underlying
      disease. While some authors (REF) propose respiratory physiotherapy, in the majority of the
      cases only the medical treatment combined with the pleural fluid removal by thoracentesis are
      the most common practice. The objective of this study is verify the effectiveness of
      respiratory physiotherapy in pleural effusion

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A spirometry is used to assess severity of individual patients respiratory disease and their response to therapy and is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. The following variables were recorded; forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume achieved in 1 second, and the forced expiratory flow over the middle one half of the forced vital capacity.</description>

    <measure>Severity in the pleural effusion repercussion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The chest radiograph has been the initial diagnostic tool for the detection and evaluation of pleural effusion. The severity was codified from 0(normal) to 10 (very severe) by a radiologist with more than 8 years of experience.</description>
