  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the clinical outcomes of transplants from
      family-mismatched/haploidentical donors (FMT) with transplants from 8/8-matched unrelated
      donor (MUT), which is a current gold standard donors when lacking of HLA-matched-siblings

        1. Primary objectives: Overall survival of FMT may be similar to that of MUT

        2. Secondary objectives:

           i. Comparison of disease-free survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, immune
           reconstitution cytomegalovirus infection, and acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease
           between FMT and MUT.

           ii. Investigation of possible biomarkers related with above events after transplantation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling, 8/8-matched unrelated donors are currently the
      &quot;gold standard&quot; for a donor, since outcomes after HLA-identical sibling have been compared to
      8/8-matched unrelated donors. Currently, there are three alternative graft sources, including
      mismatched unrelated donors, familial mismatch/haploidentical donors, and umbilical cord
      bloods. Compared with other sources, transplants from familial mismatch/haploidentical donors
      (FMT) have the benefit of an immediate availability of a donor, particularly for those
      patients who urgently need transplantation. Initial reports had characterized FMT to a poor
      engraftment and a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease. However, outcomes of FMT have
      significantly improved over the past decade in the optimization of conditioning regimen and
      graft selection to allow a stable engraftment across major HLA barriers, with promising
      leukemia-free survival in adults with acute leukemia. Despite the encouraging results and
      potential benefit of FMT, there have been few studies comparing clinical outcomes of FMT with
      other donor types, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a single disease. Since
      August 2008, we have been continuously performing FMT using unmanipulated donor cells and a
      less aggressive conditioning regimen in high-risk AML lacking an HLA-identical sibling, 8/8
      or 7/8-matched unrelated donors. We reported the feasibility of FMT using our novel
      reduced-intensity regimen without ex vivo T-cell depletion, showing early results similar to
      outcomes of transplant from 8/8-matched unrelated donors (MUT). This study will test the
      hypothesis that overall survival at 3 years after FMT is similar to overall survival after
      MUT.
