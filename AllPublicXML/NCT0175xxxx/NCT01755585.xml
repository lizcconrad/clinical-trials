  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) is used as an effective local treatment modality to inhibit cell
      proliferation, induce cell death and suppress tumor growth. To improve the treatment outcome,
      in terms of both locoregional control and survival, the concurrent use of chemotherapy during
      radiation therapy (CCRT) is now the standard treatment for various malignancies, especially
      locally advanced cancers. Among the drugs used to enhance RT effect, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is
      one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents of CCRT.

      In the past, RT was solely used as a local treatment and its effect was estimated by local
      effect model. However, growing evidence shows that irradiation has direct DNA
      damage-dependent effects as well as sending signals to neighboring cells. Recently, we
      reported that abdominal irradiation could significantly modulate the systemic
      pharmacokinetics of 5-FU at 0.5 Gy, off-target area in clinical practice, and at 2 Gy, the
      daily treatment dose for target treatment in an experimental rat model. Additionally, the
      results from a clinical investigation showed that colorectal cancer patients with lower AUC
      of 5-FU during adjuvant chemotherapy had lower disease-free survival. Taken together, these
      lines of evidence support the importance and necessity to search for the mediators
      responsible for the unexpected effect of local RT on systemic pharmacokinetics of
      chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-FU.

      In the present study, the investigators investigated whether the phenomena and mechanism of
      RT-PK is a fact for different anticancer drugs in human.
