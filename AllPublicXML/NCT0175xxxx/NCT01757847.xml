  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group
      intervention to an active control group in a sample of 154 overweight or obese binge eating
      Veterans who have completed the VA's national behavioral weight management program (MOVE!).
      This study anticipates that the ACT intervention will reduce binge eating and distress while
      improving functioning and maintenance of weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two-thirds of all adults and close to 75% of Veterans are overweight or obese,
      making obesity a national epidemic with significant impairments in physical and psychological
      functioning, increasing healthcare costs, and high mortality rates. A significant proportion
      of overweight and obese individuals binge eat in response to stress or negative emotions,
      further contributing to obesity. Obesity and binge eating are independently related to a
      number of physical and mental health co-morbidities such as diabetes, coronary heart disease,
      osteoarthritis, respiratory symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Although behavioral weight
      loss interventions have been partially effective, few show long-term maintenance of weight
      loss, especially for patients with binge eating behavior. Thus, a stepped-care approach that
      provides more intensive treatment to specifically address the emotional and behavioral
      factors associated with problematic eating and obesity may be necessary. Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically-supported intervention that is being rolled out
      nationally by the VA, has been effective in reducing distress, increasing quality of life,
      and improving other indices of health in a wide range of conditions from depression to
      diabetes. The investigator's preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT-based group
      intervention for patients with overweight or obesity can substantially reduce binge eating
      and distress, and improve functioning. This study proposes to test the efficacy of an ACT
      intervention for binge eating in conjunction with a standard behavioral weight loss
      intervention, Managing Overweight and/or Obesity for Veterans Everywhere (MOVE!), at the VA
      San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). Patients (N = 154) who are overweight or obese (body
      mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2) and meet the clinical criteria for binge eating will be randomized to
      receive either four 2-hour weekly ACT intervention groups or brief MOVE-II active control
      groups after their participation in MOVE!. This study hypothesizes that: 1) patients in the
      ACT intervention will experience significantly greater reductions in binge eating severity
      than patients in the brief MOVE-II active control group (primary outcome); 2) patients in the
      ACT intervention will experience significantly greater improvements in physical and mental
      health functioning, obesity-related quality of life, physical activity levels, caloric and
      nutrient intake, emotional distress symptoms, binge frequency, and other forms of emotional
      eating than patients in the brief MOVE-II active control group; 3) gains associated with the
      ACT intervention will be maintained longer than gains associated with the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; 4) at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups, patients in the ACT intervention
      will have greater decreases in body mass index compared to patients in the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; and 5) measures of acceptance and action will mediate treatment
      response in the ACT intervention on outcomes of interest. Given the significant physical and
      psychological sequelae of binge eating and obesity, a brief intervention that can reduce
      disordered eating, enhance the maintenance of weight loss, and improve functioning among
      patients who suffer from binge eating, could be critical in the comprehensive approach to
      patient care at the VA.

    <description>This measure contains 16 questions that describe both behavioral and emotional manifestations of a binge episode. This scale was specifically developed to assess binge eating severity and associated emotional distress in overweight and obese individuals. The total score for the measure ranges from 0-46 points with higher scores indicating greater problems with binge eating and lower scores indicating better outcome.</description>

    <description>The MOVE-II protocol was designed to reinforce the weight-loss principles that patients learn in MOVE! and to provide support in continued weight loss. This protocol includes a psycho-educational component that reinforces the key information from the medical, nutrition, and weight loss strategies modules of the MOVE! program. After review of the psycho-educational components, patients have the opportunity to share their challenges with binge eating and weight loss. Patients will then be able to receive support and feedback from other group members and the therapist. In addition, the active control group focuses on increasing self-esteem and self-efficacy by exploring patient strengths and maintaining therapeutic alliance and optimism. The brief MOVE-II active control group protocol will be delivered in four 2-hour weekly group sessions to patient with overweight or obesity who have completed the VA San Diego MOVE program.</description>

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), has been effective in reducing distress, increasing quality of life, and improving other indices of health in a wide range of conditions from depression to diabetes. The ACT protocol for this study focuses on reducing binge eating and distress and improving functioning in individual who are overweight or obese. The protocol focuses on a) thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations in the context of efforts to lose weight; b) limitations of efforts to control or eliminate negative thoughts or emotions, stress, or food cravings; c) changing expectations and goals from elimination of stress or cravings to living as well as possible with such feelings; d) mindfulness exercises to increase awareness; and e) identification of personal values and goals to achieve improved quality of life. The protocol will be delivered in four 2-hour weekly group sessions to patients with overweight or obesity who have completed the VA San Diego MOVE program.</description>

            <description>The MOVE-II protocol was designed to reinforce the weight-loss principles that patients learn in MOVE! and to provide support in continued weight loss. The brief MOVE-II active control group protocol was delivered in four 2-hour weekly group sessions. This protocol includes a psycho-educational component that reinforces the key information from the medical, nutrition, and weight loss strategies modules of the MOVE! program. After review of the psycho-educational components, patients have the opportunity to share their challenges with binge eating and weight loss. Patients will then be able to receive support and feedback from other group members and the therapist. In addition, the active control group focuses on increasing self-esteem and self-efficacy.</description>

          <title>Brief MOVE-II Active Control Group Intervention</title>
          <description>The MOVE-II protocol was designed to reinforce the weight-loss principles that patients learn in MOVE! and to provide support in continued weight loss. The brief MOVE-II active control group protocol was delivered in four 2-hour weekly group sessions. This protocol includes a psycho-educational component that reinforces the key information from the medical, nutrition, and weight loss strategies modules of the MOVE! program. After review of the psycho-educational components, patients have the opportunity to share their challenges with binge eating and weight loss. Patients will then be able to receive support and feedback from other group members and the therapist. In addition, the active control group focuses on increasing self-esteem and self-efficacy.</description>
