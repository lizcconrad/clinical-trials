    <textblock>
      Esophageal hypersensitivity/Functional heartburn are common among non-erosive reflux disease
      (NERD) patients who do not response to proton pump inhibitors. Whether tricyclic
      antidepressant improves NERD patient's symptoms remains unknown

      Aim of this randomized controlled trial study is to determine the efficacy of imipramine,
      which could increase esophageal pain thresholds in healthy volunteers, in comparison with
      placebo for treatment patients with esophageal hypersensitivity or functional heartburn
      evaluated by improvement of specific-symptom score and quality of life
