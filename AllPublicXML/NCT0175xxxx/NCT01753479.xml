    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most lethal of all major cancers with a five year survival rate
      of 5 %. While stage I and II tumors leads to an improvement in survival, almost all PCs are
      currently diagnosed at more advanced non-resectable stages since minimally invasive technique
      which is capable of screening early-stage PC does not exist. Serum CA19-9 is not recommended
      as a screening technique because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Imaging modalities
      such as MRI, CT, EUS and ERCP are more accurate but are not appropriate screening tools due
      to their high cost, discomfort and complications. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a
      screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity which is highly acceptable for the
      patient. The investigators would like to look at the spectroscopy technique for pancreatic
      cancer diagnosis via an upper endoscopy. A definite diagnosis of the patient is made with
      histology, cytology or imaging diagnosis. Therefore this study can be positioned as a
      feasibility study.
