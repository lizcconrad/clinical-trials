  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the most effective drugs to osteosarcoma include ADM,DDP,,HD-MTX,IFO and so
      on.The effective rate of single drug was about 30%, and if the chemotherapy contains HD-MTX,
      the survival rate can reach about 60%, so the HD-MTX is the most important component in
      patients of osteosarcoma.

      Studies have shown that, MTX efficacy and adverse reactions were associated with blood
      concentration level and duration, selecting the right time and dose to give CF is the
      critical point.
