    <textblock>
      ECOS is a cross-sectional, observational, longitudinal, multicenter study enrolling 100-200
      patients during a COPD exacerbation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be followed for 12 months. Information to be collected includes clinical,
      analytical, immunological, microbiological, hemodynamic, imaging, environmental, social and
      other blood markers of inflammation (IL-8, IL-6, TNF, TNF-alpha, endothelin-1, SLPI, IL10,
      TGF-beta and markers oxidative stress (TEAC)), and sputum (cell count, IL-6, IL-8, SLPI, ET
      1, IL10).

      Each center will collect clinical data, blood gas, microbiological and functional data for
      their patients, which will be centralized through the website of the Red Respira
      (www.redrespira.net).

      A frozen serum sample and another of frozen sputum supernatant will be sent to the
      coordinating center (Palma de Mallorca).

      Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation and range.
      Comparison of quantitative variables to be assessed using Student's t-test and ANOVA.
      Correlations between variables will be performed using bivariate analyzes (Pearson's linear
      correlation coefficient) and multivariate (multiple regression) analyses, among others.

    <description>From discharge of the current hospitalization, the time to a new COPD exacerbation will be estimated. The final aim of this study, descriptive, exploratory and hypothesis-generating, is to obtain a better understanding of the pathobiology of COPD exacerbations to eventually identify clinical correlations (biomarkers) that can help identify and diagnose them more accurately, and guide clinical practice for a more efficient way.</description>

    <description>COPD patients admitted in any of the participating ECOS hospitals due to a COPD exacerbation.
- External factors. The episodes of COPD exacerbations are associated to exogenous factors (pollution, change of ambient temperature, humidity, infections). The prevalence of environmental contamination and infections is higher than expected.
- Endogenous factors. These factors (hyperinflation, pulmonary embolism, cardiac dysfunction, mucus hypersecretion) are present in a proportion higher than expected
- During exacerbations of COPD serum markers of inflammation and autoimmunity are high relative to baseline in COPD and decrease progressively during the follow-up, after controlling the acute episode</description>
