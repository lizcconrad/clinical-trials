  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressants generally do not lead to an immediate relief of symptoms. Most people will
      not see a significant improvement for at least 4 weeks. Studies have generally shown that the
      full benefits of antidepressant therapy may take as long as 8 to 12 weeks. However, this
      timeline is variable among individuals.Curcumin is one of the main curcuminoids isolated from
      this perennial herb. It possesses a variety of pharmacological activities, including
      anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Curcumin has
      been found to possess antidepressant action in various animal models of depression. Chronic
      administration of curcumin has been reported to exert antidepressant-like action in olfactory
      bulbectomy model of depression in rats. Although the mechanism of the antidepressant effect
      of curcumin is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that it acts through inhibiting the
      monoamine oxidase enzyme and modulating the release of serotonin and dopamine.In randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study 40 patients will be randomized to receive either 500
      mg/day of curcumin or placebo together with antidepressants for 6 weeks.
