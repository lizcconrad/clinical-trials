  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging is a cause of functional
      impairment and disability, particularly in the older elderly (&gt;80 years). Respiratory
      function can be severely compromised if there is a decrease of respiratory (RM) strength
      complicated by the presence of comorbidities and physical immobility. In this context, the
      need for supportive services involves the need for long-term care and consequently the
      institutionalization.

      Previous studies have shown that the increase of RM strength has positive healthy effects,
      such as the increase in functional capacity, the decrease in RM fatigue, the decrease of
      dyspnoea and the improvement of quality of life, both in healthy people and patients.
      Therefore, specific RM training may be regarded as a beneficial alternative to improve RM
      function, and thus prevent physical and clinical deterioration in this frail population.

      Study hypothesis: The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) would improve respiratory muscle
      strength and endurance, exercise capacity and quality of life in an elderly population, who
      are unable to engage in general exercise conditioning.

    <measure>Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>MIP is probably the most frequently reported noninvasive estimates of inspiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal inspiration. The manoeuvre is generally performed at Residual Volume (RV).

    <description>MEP is probably the most frequently reported noninvasive estimates of expiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal expiration. The manoeuvre is generally performed at Total Lung Capacity (TLC).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV)</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>This ventilatory test is a non-invasive technique and is a measure of both inspiratory and expiratory muscle endurance. The MVV is the largest volume that can be breathed in and out of the lungs during a 12 -15 second interval with maximal voluntary effort. Reference: Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002;166:562-564.</description>

    <measure>Time performed to walk 10 m distance (10mWT).</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT) is a measure of gait speed. The walking course consist of 14 m in a hallway: a 2 m warm-up, 10 m use for the speed measurement, and 2 m for slowing down to stop. Participants can use the assistive device (eg, cane, walker) or orthotic device (eg, ankle-foot orthosis) that they use &quot;most often&quot; (if any) at each time point.

    <measure>Maximal heart rate achieved at the end of the incremental arm ergometry test.</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>The incremental arm ergometry test begins with a 3 minutes warm-up (50-70 rpm) and continues with an incremental power of 10 W each 2 minutes. The test concludes when the heart rate achieves 80% of maximum theoretical heart rate (220-age) and/or inability to maintain 50 rpm. Reference: Franklin BA.

    <measure>Health-related quality-of-life (CRQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 9).</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) is an designed instrument to evaluate the impact of interventions, including respiratory rehabilitation. The CRQ includes 20 items divided into four domains: dyspnoea (five items); fatigue (four items); emotional function (seven items); and mastery, a domain which explores how patients cope with their chronic illness (four items).
