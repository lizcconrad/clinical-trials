      This research study will access the using of a radiotracer, 18F-choline PET/CT and MRI for
      prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy. Patients receive MRI
      guided prostate biopsies and metabolomic profiling of prostate biopsy tissues.

      This is an explorative diagnostic basic research study to assess the value of 18F-choline
      PET/CT and multi-sequence MRI for prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate
      biopsy. Patients will receive image-guided (targeted) prostate biopsies and metabolomic
      profiling of prostate biopsy tissues to evaluate underlying metabolic changes in comparison
      with pathological Gleason grading.

    <description>Subjects will receive multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate and pelvis. This scan will take approximately 90 minutes.
In addition, a 18F-Choline PET/CT(Positron emission tomography/computed tomography) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is performed. This scan will take about 30 minutes. Subjects may receive an additional 30 minute scan, if needed.
Patients participating in an active surveillance program at the University of Michigan may receive yearly imaging followed by a prostate biopsy procedure.</description>

    <description>After imaging is completed, subjects will be scheduled for a prostate biopsy performed as part of their clinical care. If the imaging has identified suspicious lesions in the prostate, these regions will be made visible for the Urologist to be targeted for additional biopsies. These additional biopsies will undergo histological evaluation and further metabolomic testing to better understand metabolic differences between various grades of prostate cancer lesions.</description>
