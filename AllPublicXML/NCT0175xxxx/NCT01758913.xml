  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological closure of ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin (PG) inhibitors has been used
      for years. Previous studies indicated that ibuprofen has similar effect on ductal closure as
      indomethacin but has less adverse effects on renal function, cerebral blood flow and
      mesenteric blood flow.1-7 There are, however, very few studies being done specifically on
      extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant &lt; 1000 g. This group of infants has immature kidney
      and often has poor response to PG inhibitors and has high mortality and morbidity. We
      hypothesized that, in ELBW infants, the ductal and renal response to PG inhibitors may be
      different between indomethacin and ibuprofen.

      The aims of this study are to compare the efficacy, the side effects and the renal
      prostaglandin (PG) excretion between indomethacin and ibuprofen in extremely low birth weight
      (ELBW) infants. We enrolled one hundred and ten ELBW infants who had clinically significant
      and echo-evidence patent ductus arteriosus were assigned into 2 groups, 56 received
      indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg in 24 hours interval) and 54 received
      ibuprofen (10 mg/kg, 5mg/kg and 5 mg/kg in 24 hours interval). Serum electrolytes,
      creatinine, renal function (urine output, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional
      excretion of sodium and potassium, osmolar clearance and free water clearance), urinary PG
      excretion, pulmonary outcome and mortality were all evaluated.
