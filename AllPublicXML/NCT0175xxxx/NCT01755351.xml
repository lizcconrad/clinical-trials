  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An effective treatment adherence was a key to make the treatment success, some reports had
      shown that psychologicl factors impact patients adherence seriously,however, in China, the
      researches were only limited to depression and diabetes,diabetes distress was neglected. Some
      western studies had demonstrated the impact of diabetes distress on diabetes. Thus, we
      hypothesized that: 1.perhaps our present depression-oriented health education was inadequate
      to promote patients' adherence, diabetes distress might played a more important part than
      depression in patients' treatment adherence. 2. there might be a high prevalence of diabetes
      distress in Chinese type 2 diabetes; so, the comparative study between diabetes distress and
      depresion was conducted.

      Objectives: to explore the relationship of diabetes-related distress and depressionï¼Œand to
      compare the influence of diabetes distress and depression on treatment adherence in Chinese
      type 2 diabetes .

      Research design and method:we surveyed 200 type 2 diabetic patients from 2 third-class
      hospitals using the Diabetes Distress Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, and Revised
      Treatment Adherence in Diabetes Questionnaire (RADQ)simultaneously.
