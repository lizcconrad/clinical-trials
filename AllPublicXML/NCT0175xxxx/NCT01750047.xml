      Object: Every person's pain perception and possible postoperative pain is different. As the
      investigators know, they are affected by many factors. However, the investigators don't know
      whether the smoking factors, alcohol factors, surgery type, education background, etc. will
      affect individual pain perception and possible postoperative pain in Chinese population. This
      study was conducted to investigate the power of these possible affect factors. Method:
      Patients receiving elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited into this study.
      The investigators measured their preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain
      tolerance (PTO)and also investigated the patient's personal information of smoking factors,
      alcohol factors, surgery type, education background, etc. In addition, we retrospectively
      investigated the visual analog scale (VAS) during patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
      treatment 0 to 48 h after operation as well as the PCA press frequency and drug consumption
      of those patients who received PCA administration.
