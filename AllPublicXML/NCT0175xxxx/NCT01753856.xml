    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how teriparatide or denosumab affects the bone of
      postmenopausal women with osteoporosis after 3 months of treatment, as determined by a bone
      biopsy sample taken from the iliac crest (upper part of the pelvis).

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 3 Months in Mineralizing Surface (MS) /Bone Surface (BS) in the Cancellous Compartment (CC) of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post first dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>MS /BS is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of DEM or TET labeling, and calculated as the sum of the total extent of double label (DL) plus half the extent of single label (SL) divided by BS. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered (3 days on, 12 days off, 3 days on). 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered (same dosing schedule as DEM). Both DEM and TET temporarily bind to new bone and fluoresce under UV light. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation and a SL or no label (NL) suggested varying degrees of suppression of bone formation.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Tetracycline (TET) and demeclocycline (DEM) temporarily bind to new bone and are detected as different colors under ultraviolet light in bone biopsy samples. In this study, participants were administered DEM prior to randomization (baseline) and again with TET 22 days prior to bone biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 3 Months in Mineralizing Surface (MS) /Bone Surface (BS) in the Cancellous Compartment (CC) of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies</title>
        <description>MS /BS is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of DEM or TET labeling, and calculated as the sum of the total extent of double label (DL) plus half the extent of single label (SL) divided by BS. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered (3 days on, 12 days off, 3 days on). 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered (same dosing schedule as DEM). Both DEM and TET temporarily bind to new bone and fluoresce under UV light. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation and a SL or no label (NL) suggested varying degrees of suppression of bone formation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 3 Months in MS/BS in the Endocortical Compartment (EC), Intracortical Compartment (IC), and Periosteal Compartment (PC) of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies</title>
        <description>MS /BS is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of DEM or TET labeling and is calculated as the sum of the total extent of DL plus half the extent of SL divided by BS. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered (3 days on, 12 days off, 3 days on). 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered (same dosing schedule as DEM). Both DEM and TET temporarily bind to new bone and fluoresce under UV light. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation and a SL or NL suggested varying degrees of suppression of bone formation.</description>

          <title>MS/BS in the CC, EC, IC and PC of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies 3 Months Post First Dose of Study Drug</title>
          <description>MS /BS is a measure of the proportion of BS on which new mineralized bone is deposited at the time of DEM or TET labeling and is calculated as the sum of the total extent of DL plus half the extent of SL divided by BS. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered (3 days on, 12 days off, 3 days on). 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered (same dosing schedule as DEM). Both DEM and TET temporarily bind to new bone and fluoresce under UV light. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation and a SL or NL suggested varying degrees of suppression of bone formation.</description>

        <description>BMUs are local groups of osteoblasts and osteoclasts that act in concert to complete a single remodeling cycle. The label length is a measure of the extent of the mineralization front within each BMU in the CC, EC, IC and PC. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered. 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation, and a SL or NL suggested suppression of bone formation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 3 Months in Mineral Apposition Rate (MAR) in the CC, EC, IC and PC of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies</title>
        <description>MAR is a measure of the linear rate of production of mineralized bone matrix by osteoblasts and is measured by the mean distance between 2 consecutive labels divided by the time interval. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered. 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation, and a SL or NL suggested suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 micrometers per day (Âµm/day) or counted as missing. NL cases were reported as missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 3 Months in Bone Formation Rate/Bone Surface (BFR/BS ) in the CC, EC, IC and PC of the Iliac Crest Bone Biopsies</title>
        <description>BFR/BS is the volume of mineralized bone formed per unit surface of bone per unit of time [mm cubed per mm squared per year (mmÂ³/mmÂ²/year)]. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered. 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicates active bone formation, a SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. BFR = MAR * (MS/BS). SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 mcm/day or counted as missing. NL cases were assigned a value of zero.</description>

        <description>Ac.f is the probability of new remodeling cycles initiated on the BS per year. Ac.f = (BFR/BS) / wall thickness. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered. 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation and a SL or NL suggests suppression of bone formation. SL cases were imputed to a value of 0.3 Âµm/day or counted as missing. NL cases were assigned a value of zero.</description>

        <title>Average Length of DLs in the CC, EC, IC and PC of the Iliac Crest</title>
        <description>The length of TET DLs is a measure of the extent of bone formation in each compartment within individual remodeling units and is measured in mm. At baseline (18 days prior to randomization / study drug administration), DEM was administered. 22 days prior to the biopsy procedure (biopsy obtained 3 months post first dose of study drug), TET was administered. New bone in the biopsy was seen as the amount of bone between the 2 fluorescently DEM- or TET-labeled lines under a microscope. A DL indicated active bone formation.</description>
