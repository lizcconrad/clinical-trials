  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RSV bronchiolitis in children is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
      RSV infection results in increased mucus production, edema and inflammation at the lower
      airways and impaired mucociliary clearance. Infants and children under the age of 1 year are
      particularly vulnerable to complications such as atelectasis and secondary bacterial
      infection. These children often need non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Atelectasis is
      common in these children because of smaller airways and decreased cough strength. There is
      still much uncertainty about the treatment of RSV. Treatment consists primarily of supportive
      therapy such as tube feeding and additional respiratory support if necessary. There is also
      limited evidence about the use of nebulizers with beta-agonists and/or hypertonic saline.

      The cough assist is a mechanical in- and exsufflator used primarily in patients with
      neuromuscular diseases to augment cough capacity. In these patients, it was demonstrated that
      the use of assisted cough resulted in a significant decrease in the number of respiratory
      infections. Moreover, there is evidence that when used in the case of an acute respiratory
      deterioration such a massive atelectasis, the atelectasis can be corrected and intubation can
      be avoided. The aim of this study is to investigate if the use of the CoughAssist device in
      children with RSV bronchiolitis is associated with a better respiratory outcome.
