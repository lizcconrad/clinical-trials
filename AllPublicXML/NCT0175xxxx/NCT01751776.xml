    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BI 655064 administered
      subcutaneously in healthy volunteers (HVs) and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. To
      explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of multiple doses of BI
      655064 in healthy volunteers (HVs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. To assess clinical
      effect of BI 655064 in RA patients with prior inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) after
      12 weeks of treatment
