  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, 4-period, randomized, cross-over study conducted in healthy
      adult subjects. The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of orally
      administered losmapimod on the electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters with a focus on cardiac
      repolarization as measured by the corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, compared with placebo
      and moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin (Avelox) is a drug with a known potential to create a mild QTc
      interval prolongation; therefore, it will serve as a positive control to validate the ability
      of this study to detect a change in the QTc interval. All subjects will participate in 4
      study periods separated by a minimum washout period of 5 days. Each subject will receive one
      of 4 regimens (A = Losmapimod 7.5 milligram [mg] Twice daily [BID] x 5 days, B = Losmapimod
      20 mg Once daily [QD] x 5 days, C = moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 5, D = Losmapimod matched
      placebo and moxifloxacin placebo x 5 days) in each of the 4 planned study periods in a
      randomized, cross-over fashion. Subjects will be assigned to one of four treatment sequences
      following a Williams design (ABDC, BCAD, CDBA, DACB). Follow-up visit will occur 10 to 14
      days after end of Period 4
