  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the acute phase of stroke, dysphagia (difficulty/inability to swallow) is a common problem
      that can have serious consequences such as aspiration pneumonia, increased lenght of
      hospitalisation, and death. It would be interesting to enhance the therapeutic effect of
      swallowing retraining by means on non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS).

      Hypothesis: during the acute phase of stroke, applying tDCS over the brain during the
      revalidation and/or supervised feeding improves dysphagia significantly when compared to sham
      tDCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tDCS will be used in a double-blind, randomized control trial in acute stroke patients
      suffering from dysphagia.

      After informed consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated
      to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied during swallowing exercices/therapy or supervised
      feeding.

      Baseline and follow-up outcomes about dysphagia will be collected.

    <description>tDCS is a safe and painless transcranial stimulation that modulates brain activity and could improve stroke recovery. Electrodes in soaked sponges are placed over specific brain regions and held with an elastic band. Direct current is then applied through the electrodes. The patients may feel nothing or a slight tingling under the electrodes.</description>
