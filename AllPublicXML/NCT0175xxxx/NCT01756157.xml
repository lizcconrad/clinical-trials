    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      two doses of CINRYZE with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) administered by
      subcutaneous (SC) injection to prevent angioedema attacks.

    <measure>Normalized Number of Angioedema Attacks During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 1 (Week 1) up to Visit 16 (Week 8) during each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Angioedema attack was defined as the participant-reported indication of symptoms or signs such as swelling or pain at any location following a report of no swelling or pain on the previous day. Manifestations of an attack that progress from one site to another, prior to complete resolution, was considered a single attack. Attacks that began to regress and then worsened before complete resolution was also considered one attack. Participants who were dosed but did not have any attacks in the period were assigned a value of zero. The number of attacks was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Attack-severity During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 1 (Week 1) up to Visit 16 (Week 8) during each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative Attack-severity score was the sum of maximum symptom severity recorded for each angioedema attack, determined on the last day of symptoms and recorded as None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3 and summing over the unique attacks, yields a Cumulative Attack-severity score.
None: no angioedema attack symptom; Mild: the angioedema attack symptom was noticeable to the participant but was easily tolerated and did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate: the angioedema attack symptom interfered with work/school or the ability to participate in family life and social activities; Severe: the angioedema attack symptom significantly limited the participant's ability to attend work/school or participate in family life and social activities.
Cumulative attack-severity was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.
The scores ranged from 0 to 168 and higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Daily-severity During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 1 (Week 1) up to Visit 16 (Week 8) during each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative Daily-severity score was the sum of the severity scores recorded for every day of reported symptoms during the treatment period.
Severity scores were recorded as None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. None: no angioedema attack symptom; Mild: the angioedema attack symptom was noticeable to the participant but was easily tolerated and did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate: the angioedema attack symptom interfered with work/school or the ability to participate in family life and social activities; Severe: the angioedema attack symptom significantly limited the participant's ability to attend work/school or participate in family life and social activities.
Cumulative daily severity was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.
The scores ranged from 0 to 168 and higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative Symptomatic Days During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Visit 1 (Week 1) up to Visit 16 (Week 8) during each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative symptomatic days was defined as the sum of the symptomatic days of each angioedema attack reported during the treatment period. Participants who were dosed but did not have any attacks in the period were assigned a value of zero. Cumulative symptomatic days was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 24 sites (United States=20, Europe=4) between 04 February 2013 (first participant dosed) and 13 September 2013 (last participant contact). Of 52 screened participants, 47 were randomized and treated. Screen failure reasons were consent withdrawn by 1 participant and violation of eligibility criteria by 4 participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Due to emergence of, and unexpected incidence and titer of, non-neutralizing anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in some subjects after administration of CINRYZE+rHuPH20, sponsor decided to stop dosing subjects with rHuPH20 and thus close the study. However, the study was completed with collection of safety data as outlined in the protocol.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Normalized Number of Angioedema Attacks During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Angioedema attack was defined as the participant-reported indication of symptoms or signs such as swelling or pain at any location following a report of no swelling or pain on the previous day. Manifestations of an attack that progress from one site to another, prior to complete resolution, was considered a single attack. Attacks that began to regress and then worsened before complete resolution was also considered one attack. Participants who were dosed but did not have any attacks in the period were assigned a value of zero. The number of attacks was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.</description>

None: no angioedema attack symptom; Mild: the angioedema attack symptom was noticeable to the participant but was easily tolerated and did not interfere with routine activities; Moderate: the angioedema attack symptom interfered with work/school or the ability to participate in family life and social activities; Severe: the angioedema attack symptom significantly limited the participant's ability to attend work/school or participate in family life and social activities.
Cumulative attack-severity was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.
The scores ranged from 0 to 168 and higher scores represent worse symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Angioedema Attacks Requiring Acute Treatment During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Angioedema attack was defined as the participant-reported indication of symptoms or signs such as swelling or pain at any location following a report of no swelling or pain on the previous day. Manifestations of an attack that progress from one site to another, prior to complete resolution, was considered a single attack. Attacks that began to regress and then worsened before complete resolution was also considered one attack. Participants who were dosed but did not have any attacks in the period were assigned a value of zero. The number of attacks was normalized for the number of days participants participated in a given period and expressed as the monthly frequency.</description>
