  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a new and sophisticated method for assessment of retinal blood flow and retinal
      blood flow velocity profiles has become available. This technique is based on the combination
      of measurement of retinal vessel calibers with bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence
      tomography (FDOCT). The valid measurement of retinal blood flow is of significant importance,
      because it is known that major ophthalmic diseases, such as hypertensive retinopathy, are
      associated with alterations in blood flow.

      Hypertensive retinopathy is the most common manifestation of arterial hypertension in the
      eye. Elevated systemic blood pressure leads to generalized arteriolar narrowing caused by
      vasospasms and increased vascular tone. Further in the disease process, focal arteriolar
      narrowing, retinal haemorrhages, hard exudates and cotton wool spots can occur. Previous
      studies have shown that blood flow in the extraocular vessels and in the choroid is
      compromised in patients with arterial hypertension. However, data on the impact of arterial
      hypertension on retinal blood flow and retinal blood flow velocities are lacking.

      The present study sets out to compare total retinal blood flow and retinal velocity profiles
      in patients with hypertensive retinopathy and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Ocular
      perfusion pressure will be calculated based on measurements of blood pressure and intraocular
      pressure to allow for calculation of vascular resistance. In addition, velocity profiles at
      arterio-venous crossings will be measured. It is hypothesized that these velocity profiles
      are considerably modified in patients with stage 2 and 3 hypertensive retinopathy compared to
      healthy controls because of pronounced arterio-venous compression.
