  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) is the only clinical adverse event that commonly
      occurs with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin treatment and it warrants
      special attention because it is the most common dose-limiting toxicity. this study is
      designed to test the effectiveness of a henna treatment protocol in the management of
      capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin induced palmar-plantar
      erythrodysesthesia.

      This will be a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 80 cancer patients that
      will receive chemotherapy treatment with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.
      The selection of potential participants will be based on pre-determined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomly allocated either to the treatment group or the
      placebo group. Treatment will be delivered twice a week and assessments will take place at 0,
      3, 4 and 5 weeks.

      The intervention group will receive the application of henna to the hands and/or feet of the
      patients and the control group will receive the placebo.

      At both baseline and follow-up, patients in both groups will be assessed for their degree of
      palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, the Quality of Life, the need for dose-limiting due to PPE
      and Pain intensity using standardized rating scales. Data will be analysed with inferential
      and descriptive statistics.

    <description>Based on the treatment protocol for this study the patients will receive the henna treatment for 5 weeks (supervised treatment for first week and then unsupervised sessions twice a week). The treatment will include the application of the henna mixture (paste) (40gr natural henna and 40ml of purified water) to the affected areas (feet or/and hands) and wear socks or/and gloves. The treatment session will last for 2 hours and then the mixture will be rinsed with fresh water.</description>
