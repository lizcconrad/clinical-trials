    <textblock>
      Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one or two Ultherapy
      treatments on the cheeks, depending on their assigned study group. Follow-up visits will
      occur 14, 30 and 90 days post-treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, 30-60
      min post-treatment, and at each follow-up visit.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center clinical trial. The study will be
      conducted in two Phases. In Phase I, subjects will be assigned to one of two treatment
      groups. One study group will receive one dual depth Ultherapy treatment to a region on the
      cheeks, and one study group will receive two dual depth Ultherapy treatments to a region on
      the cheeks 14 days apart. Average pain scores will be obtained using a Numeric Rating Scale
      following each region of treatment and for each depth of treatment. In Phase II, based on
      observations of last follow-up visit in Phase I (at 90 days after treatment), subjects will
      be given the option to receive treatment of the affected area(s) for the protocol specified
      region, treated at the treatment depth showing the most efficacy in Phase I. Efficacy will be
      determined by improvement in Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea in the treatment area versus
      control (an untreated area) as determined by primary investigator assessment at the last
      follow-up visit in Phase I.
