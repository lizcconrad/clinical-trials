  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an imaging device called the Laser
      Optoacoustic and Ultrasonic Imaging System Assembly (LOUISA-3D) is effective in detecting and
      monitoring changes in breast tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the LOUISA-3D scan performed within 7
      days (+/- 2 days) after you have mammography or ultrasound scans.

      If you have a routine biopsy scheduled, the LOUISA-3D scan will be performed within 7 days
      (+/- 2 days) before that biopsy.

      For the LOUISA-3D procedure, you will lay down on a specially-designed breast exam table and
      you will place your breast in a bowl-like imaging cup. The imaging cup will be filled with a
      gel that will help send signals to the imaging machine.

      The procedure will produce 2 types of images. For the first type, the imaging cup will
      deliver light from a laser that will travel into your breast and tumor. The light is designed
      to detect acoustic waves which produce an image. Even though all light will be contained in
      the imaging cup, you will wear laser safety goggles during the procedure.

      For the second type of image, the imaging cup will deliver an ultrasound to your breast which
      will produce an ultrasound image.

      During the scans, the imaging cup will rotate around the breast to create 3-dimensional
      pictures. The scans may be repeated several times. The entire LOUISA-3D procedure should take
      about 30 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the LOUISA-3D imaging procedure is complete.

      This is an investigational study. The LOUISA-3D device is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. The use of the LOUISA-3D device to detect and monitor changes in breast tumors is
      investigational.

      Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to successfully obtain images from LOUIS 3D and assess pathology in order to guide image calibration and gain knowledge about LOUIS 3D capabilities. Pathology will provide useful information including but not limited to type of malignancy, tissue type, and other qualitative information that is necessary for image calibration.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of False Positive Rate of LOUIS-3D Compared to Ultrasound for Breast Cancer Detection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objective is to determine optimal scanning parameters by assessing certain machine parameters (e.g. illumination and detection conditions, laser pulse repetition rate, ultrasound emission characteristics, detection probe, coupling medium characteristics, software and firmware, etc.), anatomical information (speed of sound image, acoustic attenuation image, acoustic scattering image), and functional information (total hemoglobin distribution [THb] / image of angiogenesis density, image of blood oxygen saturation [SO2], and image of water distribution). Continuous variables summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Categorical variables tabulated by frequencies and the corresponding percentages.</description>

    <description>Part I Years 1-4: Years 1-4 to develop and calibrate the LOUIS-3D machine. The subject of this project is to successfully obtain diagnostic imaging of breast tumors with new imaging technology, laser Optoacoustic Tomography system.
Part 2 Year 5: Goal of part 2 to estimate and compare the false positive rate of LOUIS-3D compared to standard of care ultrasound. Patients will have had a positive standard of care ultrasound requiring a biopsy (gold standard). The LOUIS-3D images will be obtained within 7 days of the standard of care ultrasound.</description>
