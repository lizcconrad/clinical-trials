      Patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease are commonly involved in haemodialysis
      treatment, which is the most common treatment at this stage. Haemodialysis substitutes the
      renal function but is associated with several alterations that lead to decrease in functional
      capacity and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Many studies show that functional
      capacity, physical activity level and HRQoL is significantly worse than their healthy
      sedentary age - matched counterparts. It is unknown if low physical activity, uraemia or
      anaemia are responsible for the decreased functional capacity of this cohort. Physical
      performance tests are frequently used to assess haemodialysis patients since is a feasible
      and low-cost evaluation. The purpose of the present study is quantified how the functional
      capacity changes over a -6 months period in a group of haemodialysis patients. Additionally
      the investigators pretend to calculate values absolute and relative reliability that have not
      been yet reported (Short Physical Performance Battery, one-leg balance and Timed Up and go).

    <description>Assess lower extremity, which includes objective performance-based measure of balance (side-by-side, semitanden and tandem), endurance (4m gait speed) and strength (five chair stands). Each component was scored from 0 to 4 and when summed yielded SPPB scores between 0 (poor) and 12 (best).</description>
