  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) poses
      a particular dilemma for thromboprophylaxis. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a
      non-pharmacological approach to prevent cardiac embolism in NVAF. The risk-benefit ratio of
      LAAO in patients with NVAF after ICH is unknown. The aim of STROKECLOSE is to assess the
      effect of LAAO to reduce the incidence stroke, bleeding and cardiovascular mortality in
      patients with NVAF and prior ICH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods/design: A multicenter prospective randomized open-label clinical trial with blinded
      outcome evaluation (PROBE design) and blinded safety outcome assessment. The active
      comparison LAAO is tested against medical therapy in a 2:1 stratified randomization.

      Study population: Patients should have had an ICH within 6 months prior to enrollment and
      have NVAF with increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism, as indicated by a CHA2DS2VASc
      score &gt;2. In total 750 patients will be included. Active enrollment ensues over 3 years
      followed by 5 years follow-up and a long-term follow-up at 10 years.

      Intervention and control: The intervention group will be treated by LAAO, using the Amplatzer
      Amulet device. Implantation requires a catheterization procedure using venous access and
      transseptal puncture and is guided by angiography, fluoroscopy and transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Recommended post-implant
      antithrombotic therapy includes aspirin (ASA) therapy for at least 6 months, with or without
      clopidogrel for the first 45 days after implantation. The control group will receive medical
      therapy, delivered according to national standards and guidelines at the treating physicians'
      discretion. This may include oral anticoagulation (OAC) (vitamin-K antagonists, VKA), non-VKA
      OAC, antiplatelet therapy or no antithrombotic therapy at all.

      Main study outcomes: The primary outcome is the composite endpoint of stroke (ischemic and
      hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, life-threatening or major bleeding and all-cause mortality,
      assessed over at least two years. Secondary outcome examines various early and late safety
      outcome parameters.

    <description>The intervention is implantation of Amplatzer Amulet LAAO device within two months after randomization. Device implantation comprises a catheterization procedure using venous access and a transseptal puncture to obtain access to the left atrium (LA). Procedural imaging guidance is left to the physician's discretion and may include several techniques such as angiography/fluoroscopy, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and/or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Recommended post-implant antithrombotic therapy includes ASA therapy for at least 6 months, which may be combined with clopidogrel for the first 45 days after implantation.</description>

    <description>The optimal medical therapy of stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is not known. Therefore, it will be left to the discretion of the treating physician to decide if, when, and which pharmacological therapy will be prescribed. Available options include anticoagulation with oral anticoagulation (OAC) or novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC), antiplatelet therapy (including monotherapy and dual antiplatelet therapy) and no pharmacological antithrombotic therapy.</description>
