  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 15% to 30% of patients with venous leg ulcers have a peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      associated. The compression band is still a controversial issue in this context. It allows
      the reduction of venous hypertension and edema, but it could potentially degrade the arterial
      infusion of high levels of compression. The French High Authority for Health (HAS) defines
      mixed ulcers by IPS between 0.5 and 0.9. Investigators distinguish mixed ulcers blood
      predominance for IPS between 0.5 and 0.7; and mixed ulcers predominantly venous blood with
      moderate involvement for IPS values between 0.7 and 0.9.

      Several studies have shown that IPS&gt; 0.8 allowed a high compression, between 30 and 40 mmHg.
      In the case of mixed ulcers with IPS between 0.6 and 0.8, the HAS recommends using a lighter
      compression, bit by elastic bands (exercising low power compression at rest) under medical
      supervision, informing the patient to remove the bandage if pain or aggravation. It is
      therefore necessary to adapt the compression therapy in case of venous ulcers associated with
      arterial disease by providing a lower compression 30 mmHg short stretch. For HAS, IPS &lt;0.6
      against indicates compression.

      A recent study showed that compression bit elastic bands could not only improve venous
      return, but it would also increase the distal arterial flow in a patient population with
      mixed ulcers. In this study, 25 patients had between IPS 0.5 and 0.8; or for certain patients
      below the threshold of 0.6 indicates that against a compression according to HAS. To our
      knowledge this is the only study that has examined the effect of compression on blood
      perfusion.

      Objectives:

        -  Principal: Study the distal arterial infusion in a patient population with mixed ulcers
           under compression leg with little elastic bands

        -  Secondary: To evaluate the safety of the little compression elastic band in a mixed
           population of patients with leg ulcers

      Methodology :

        -  Study non-interventional prospective single-center that evaluates professional practice
           from 25 patients with mixed leg ulcers and followed in the vascular medicine department
           of St. Joseph Hospital Group Paris.

        -  Applying a bit compression elastic bandages to a pressure level between 30 and 40mmHg.

        -  Anonymous data reports on the grid standardized collection, by a numbering system from 1
           to 30 and then captured on a computer file

             -  Age, risk factors and cardiovascular history of the patients,

             -  Age, ulcer description

             -  Palpation of pulse

             -  morphological vascular profile of patients with arterial and venous Doppler dating
                less than a year,

             -  Series following data before installation, 10 minutes after application and 24
                hours after installation of the inelastic compression:

                o Evaluation of tolerance:

             -  measurement of pain numeric scale (NS)

             -  description of the skin condition of the leg by a dermatologist, seeking signs of
                suffering skin after application of compression: possible appearance of erythema,
                cyanosis, purpura. A search particularly in areas of bony prominences and the banks
                of the ulcer.

                o distal arterial pressures of the compression carrier leg:

             -  IPS (systolic pressure index): ankle and arm pressures will be measured with a cuff
                and a continuous Doppler. GPI is calculated by dividing the lowest pressure at the
                ankle (at the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) by the humeral pressure.

             -  Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure (TcPO2) o Measuring pressure exerted by low elastic
                bandages by Kikuhime® system.

      In case of bad tolerance of compression at any time after installation, the compression will
      be removed and the study stopped for the patient in question. Poor tolerance is defined by an
      increase in pain than or equal to 2 points on the digital scale.

      expected benefits for patients:

        -  Demonstration of good tolerance, defined as no worsening of the skin condition and the
           lack of increase in pain associated with inelastic compression.

        -  Demonstration of no worsening of arterial infusion by inelastic compression.

        -  Evidence of improved distal arterial hemodynamics (increased IPS and tcpO2) with a
           little elastic compression, which validate the results of the only study ever conducted
           on the subject.
