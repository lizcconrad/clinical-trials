  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to determine the effect of linaclotide on abdominal girth in
      irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) participants with the baseline symptoms of
      abdominal bloating and an increased abdominal girth.

    <description>Mean change in abdominal girth (as measured by AUC) determined by 24-hour abdominal inductance plethysmography (AIP) between the linaclotide and placebo groups.</description>

    <description>Mean change in abdominal girth (as measured by AUC) determined by 24-hour AIP, between the linaclotide and placebo groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Maximal Abdominal Distension at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum change in girth from the first hour, over the period from the 2nd hour to bedtime. The percentage change in maximum distension from baseline to 4 weeks will also be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of symptom severity (abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, and distension)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (Day 28±2)</time_frame>
    <description>Daily diary scores for each of the digestive symptoms and a composite score of these parameters will be averaged to obtain 'weekly' scores.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Digestive sensations (subjective bloating, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension and abdominal pain) at Weeks 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4, Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in each of the hourly measures of digestive sensations (as measured by AUC), between the linaclotide and placebo groups.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of Bristol Stool Form Scale at Weeks 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4, Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Daily diary BSFS scores will be recoded to represent discrepancies from a 'normal' stool type 4, daily average recoded BSFS scores for each subject will be computed. The following means will be calculated for each subject:
Baseline = mean (day -7 to day -1)
Week 1 = mean (day 1 to day 7)
Week 2 = mean (day 8 to day 14)
Week 3 = mean (day 15 to day 21)
Week 4 = mean (day 22 to day 28)</description>
