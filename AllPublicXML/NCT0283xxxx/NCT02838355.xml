  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how the End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitoring via nasal
      cannula (ETCO2-NC) device may allow for earlier detection of respiratory complications. This
      device will detect the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled with each breath and may better
      predict high levels of this than traditional monitoring. This may reduce the number and
      severity of respiratory issues. A convenience sample of 60 participants either scheduled for
      continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implant or who have been readmitted
      to an ICU with a CF-LVAD will be recruited and randomized to usual care or usual care plus
      ETCO2-NC throughout their stay in the ICU.

      The purpose of this proposal is to explore the relationships between End Tidal Carbon Dioxide
      (ETCO2) via nasal cannula (ETCO2-NC) and routinely measured physiologic and participant
      reported parameters in extubated participants who have received a continuous flow left
      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD), and to determine if the addition of ETCO2-NC monitoring
      to usual care is associated with decreased incidence and severity of respiratory issues.

      A convenience sample of 60 participants either scheduled for mechanical circulatory support
      device (MCSD) implant or who have been readmitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with a
      CF-LVAD will be recruited and randomized to usual care or usual care plus ETCO2-NC throughout
      their stay in the ICU.

      Investigators seek to examine the relationship between ETCO2-NC with traditional physiologic
      measures, clinical assessments, and participant reported symptoms in persons with a CF-LVAD.
      Additionally, this study intends to compare the respiratory outcomes of extubated persons
      with a CF-LVAD randomized to usual care to those receiving usual care plus ETCO2- NC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Distressed assessed by Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (RDOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RDOS is an ordinal level scale with eight observer-rated parameters: heart rate, respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, paradoxical breathing pattern, restlessness, grunting at end-expiration, nasal flaring, and a fearful facial display. Each parameter is scored from 0 to 2 points and the points are summed. Scale scores range from 0 signifying no distress to 16 signifying the most severe distress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea Rate assessed by the Dyspnea Visual Analogue Scale (DVAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DVAS is a self-reported scale that asks participants to indicate how much shortness of breath they are experiencing by marking on a line 100 mm in length between &quot;no shortness of breath&quot; and &quot;shortness of breath as bad as can be&quot;.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Respiratory Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is physiologic data abstracted from the medical record: respiration that has a rate below 12 breaths per minute or that fails to provide full ventilation and perfusion of the lungs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Respiratory Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physiologic data abstracted from the medical record: Severity of respiration depression will be collected via standard hospital code met and code blue forms. Respiratory compromise will be defined as respiratory rate increase or decrease by 20% or greater, an ETCO2 value greater than 20% above baseline values, or a SpO2 less than 90% for greater than 10 seconds.</description>
