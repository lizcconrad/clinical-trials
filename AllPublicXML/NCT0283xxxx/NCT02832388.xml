    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to identify and include all patients with Primary
      Aldosteronism (PA) diagnosed in the Western and Mid-parts of Norway, to describe the
      characteristics of these patients, to explore the cardiac effects of PA, and to identify the
      long-term patient outcome after treatment. A subgroup of the included PA-patients perform
      Cardiac MRI to assess myocardial function in rest and during stress, myocardial mass and
      myocardial fibrosis, compared to a group of healthy controls.

    <textblock>
      From June 2013, all newly diagnosed patients with Primary Aldosteronism (PA) either diagnosed
      at Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) or admitted to HUS for subtype testing with adrenal
      vein sampling, have been asked for inclusion in the study. All included patients have a
      base-line study visit where baseline blood samples ar collected. Until 2017, a 24h
      blood-pressure-monitoring and echocardiography was also performed. After start of definite
      medical or surgical treatment the patients are followed up with regularly new study visits.

      A subgroup of the included PA-study patients also perform a Cardiac MRI. Cine-MRI,
      velocity-encoded MRI, MRI images during continuous adenosine infusion and MRI images at after
      gadolinium contrast injection are performed, and compared to a group of age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls.
