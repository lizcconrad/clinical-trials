  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of Transcutaneous Vagus
      Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) in healthy controls. Tested in healthy subjects (HS) the
      physiological effects of tVNS at different stimulation parameters. The electrical stimulation
      variables will be pulse width, frequency, and current. This will be tested in a laboratory
      setting and will measure tVNS effects on heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and
      perceived pain. This is a feasibility and small safety study.

      Hypothesis: tVNS is feasible and safe
