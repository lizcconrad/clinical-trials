    <textblock>
      Typically a course of yoga therapy for stress management takes place over a week, however,
      investigators are often asked to provide a single session for workers. The aim of this study
      is to assess the benefits of a single session of an integrated yoga program compared with
      other relaxation techniques for the staff of schools.
