  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to collect the safety data of idarucizumab for patients treated with
      dabigatran who require rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in cases of
      uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding or when emergency surgery or urgent procedures are
      required.
