      We compared BIS values during propofol stepwise induction with or without concomitant
      sufentanil in patients ≥ 65 years .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bispectral index (BIS) is widely used to estimate the depth of anesthesia. In clinical
      studies, a large variability of BIS has been observed. Several factors may be responsible for
      this inconsistency. We were able to show that in elderly patients (average age 78 years)
      receiving increasing doses of propofol alone a BIS values at loss of consciousness (LOC) were
      about 30% higher compared with young patients (average age 35 years). We showed also that in
      young patients (average age 48 years) the BIS values at LOC were significantly higher in
      those receiving sufentanil concomitantly with propofol compared with those who had received
      propofol alone. It remains unknown, however, whether these data from young surgical patients
      are applicable to a population of elderly patients. It may be argued that in the elderly
      receiving propofol, the impact of advance age was so important that any addition of an opioid
      would not further disturb the sedation-monitor balance. Alternatively, it may be expected
      that in the elderly receiving an opioid added to propofol the impact of both drugs on
      sedation will be additive and that previous observations from younger patients will be
      further exaggerated. The impact of advance age and presence or absence of sufentanil during
      propofol induction on BIS values at LOC was investigated in this trial.
