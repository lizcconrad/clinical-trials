  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer (PC) affects 1 in 7 men. Nearly half of those diagnosed with PC will receive
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their treatment. ADT is good at managing PC but
      has many side effects. Researchers have shown that exercise, specifically one-on-one
      supervised exercise improves many of the side effects of ADT. However, exercise programs for
      men on ADT are not widely available. More questions need to be answered in order for exercise
      programs to become part of PC treatment. First, can programs that require fewer resources,
      such as group-exercise or home-based exercise, also improve ADT side-effects? Second, do
      exercise-related benefits continue beyond the structured exercise program? And what makes
      people continue exercising? Third, which exercise program is most cost-effective?

      In this study, the investigators will compare: (a) group supervised in-centre and (b)
      home-based supported exercise programs to see which program is most effective for men with PC
      on ADT. The investigators will also look at what motivates people to continue to exercise
      both during a structured program and after the program is complete and will examine which
      exercise program is most cost-effective.

      Participants (men with PC on ADT) will be recruited from one of the following cancer centres:
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, the
      Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket, and Scarborough and Rouge Hospital - Centenary
      Site in Scarborough. When a patient agrees to participate, patient will be randomly placed in
      1 of 2 exercise programs. All programs will include the same type of exercises (aerobic,
      resistance and flexibility) and all participants will exercise 4-5 days per week for 30
      minutes per day (as tolerated) for the length of the program (6 months). The investigators
      will look at how men with PC on ADT respond to the exercise program by measuring quality of
      life (QOL), fatigue and different physical measures before, during, and after the exercise
      program.

      Although the investigators know that supervised one-on-one exercise is most effective at
      improving ADT side-effects, it is unknown if other forms of exercise are just as beneficial
      and more financially responsible. This study will allow the investigators to begin to answer
      these questions so that structured exercise programs become a regular part of PC treatment.

    <description>This intervention arm will include 3 group, supervised sessions per week for 6 months with a certified exercise specialist. Supervised sessions will be delivered in a group format with 4-8 participants per group. Flexibility training will include stretching for 5-10 minutes at the beginning and end of each session. Aerobic training will involve 30 minutes of low-impact step aerobics. Resistance training will be conducted using resistance bands, a stability ball, and an exercise mat with 8 prescribed exercises that target the major muscle groups. Participants will be encouraged to perform exercises independently on additional days, for a total of 4-5 days per week of exercise.</description>

    <description>The same protocol and training frequency as the supervised programs described above will be followed. However, all exercises will be completed independently by participants. Specific exercises in the aerobic program may be modified to accommodate patient preference (same target heart rate range as the supervised group). Participants will be supported with smartphone technology and remote 'health coaches' during the intervention phase. This will help to ensure participant adherence, appropriate progression, and safety.</description>
