  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory response involves many players from the immune response, including B
      lymphocytes. These cells are responsible for the synthesis of immunoglobulins in response to
      the presence of an antigen. They are characteristic of chronic inflammation. There are
      several subsets of B cells characterized by specific membrane markers. Once activated, these
      cells express many factors contributing to tissue destruction seen in periodontitis and
      particularly in osteoclastogenesis (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand,
      tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î± and Monocyte
      Chemoattractant Protein-3).

      During the establishment of a periodontal disease, an important inflammatory infiltrate is
      observed in the gum. This infiltrate is characterized by the presence of many B lymphocytes.
      B cell subsets in the blood and the gum of patients with periodontitis have been little
      studied. However, the number of autoreactive B cells (cluster of differentiation (CD)19+,
      CD5+) has been reported to be higher in the blood of patients with periodontal disease. In
      the gum, the rate of B and T cells increases with the level of inflammation and is correlated
      with the severity of the inflammatory process. Activation of B cells is a prerequisite for
      the progression of gingivitis to periodontitis. B cell distribution could then be an
      indicator of disease progression, but also allow to study the response to treatment.

      The aim of this pilot study is to characterize B cell subsets in the blood and the gum of
      patients with periodontitis, according to disease activity. Analysis of B cells in the blood
      could highlight the association of a particular subpopulation with aggressive periodontal
      disease and evidence a particular biological profile of the host response. The investigators
      also wish to observe the evolution of this phenotype following an unconventional surgical
      therapy.

      This study would better understand the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and refine the
      diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of periodontitis, and thus participate in the development
      of personalized medicine. Biological monitoring of therapeutic effects may be initiated and
      allow more effectively prevent recurrence.
