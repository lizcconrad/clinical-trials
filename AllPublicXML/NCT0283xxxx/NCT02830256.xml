  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nociception in intensive care unit is frequently evaluated with some tools such as BPS
      (Behavioral Pain scale) and NCS (Nociception coma scale). These scales were not validated in
      intubated and brain injured ICU patients. The investigators propose to validate the NCS
      adapted for intubated patients (NCS-I) in comparison with the recommended scale (BPS) and the
      Pupillary response (videopupillometry) to noxious stimulation (common procedure of care).
