      Randomized Controlled Trial to monitor and increase the postoperative mobilization of the
      patients undergoing major visceral surgery by giving a continuous autofeedback of the step
      count using activity tracking wristbands.

      Patients undergoing elective open and laparoscopic surgery of colon, rectum, stomach,
      pancreas and liver for any indication will be included. Further inclusion criteria are: age
      between 18-75 years, ASA score &lt; 4, and a signed informed consent. Patients are stratified
      into two subgroups (laparoscopic and open surgery) and will be randomized 1:1 for an
      autofeedback of their step-count using an activity tracker wristband or for the control group
      without autofeedback. Sample size (n = 29 patients in each of the four groups, overall n =
      119) is calculated on an assumed difference in step-count of 250 steps daily (intervention
      versus control group). The primary study endpoint is the step-count during the first five
      postoperative days; secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients in the two groups, who
      master the predefined mobilization (step-count) targets, the assessment of additional
      activity data from the devices, the assessment of the preoperative mobility, length of
      hospital and intensive care unit stay, number of patients who receive physiotherapy, 30-day
      mortality, and the overall 30-day morbidity.

    <description>The intervention group receives an unblinded wristband. The handling of the activity trackers is explained to the patients and a predefined mobilization end-point (step-count) for the first five PODs is targeted. The target step-count was set at the 85% quartile obtained from a previous pilot study. The patients are assessed and monitored two times daily between 9 and 11 o'clock AM and between 3 and 5 o'clock PM by a surgical fellow or a study nurse throughout their hospital stay for read-out of the step count, assurance of the proper use and functioning, and for communication of the autofeedback.</description>
