    <textblock>
      In France, there is currently no data to directly estimate the number of bilateral upper limb
      amputations, their characteristics and therapeutic care.

      By extrapolation from the Regional Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR)
      Nancy in 2005, the number of new cases of amputated patients with prosthetic fitting of the
      upper limb was estimated at 355. Epidemiological data from the 2009-2010 Annual Report of the
      LIMBLESS STATISTICS database (collection of quantitative clinical data and demographic of
      amputees patients referred by orthopaedic centres in the United Kingdom , whose population's
      characteristics are similar to France) identified 395 incident cases of upper limb amputation
      with, 6 bilateral amputations observed. The causes are varied: traumatic, infectious or
      related to diabetes. The population was relatively young, aged between 15 and 54 year old.

      On this basis, the estimated number of new cases of bilateral upper limb amputations
      throughout France should therefore be about 40 incident cases over a 5-year period.

      This observational study is aimed at collecting comprehensive and high quality data to
      describe the French population of bilateral upper limb amputees.
