  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most efficacious transmission blocking drug
      regimen for seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mali. The primary outcome measure will be
      the proportion of mosquitoes infected pre and post-treatment, assessed through membrane
      feeding and measured by oocyst prevalence in mosquitoes dissected on day 7 post feed. Primary
      endpoint will be a within group comparison between the mean of the pretreatment infectivity
      (Day 0) and infectivity at 7 days post first dose.

    <measure>Safety measurements including hemoglobin and signs of hemolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The major safety endpoint is hemolysis. For this reason, hemoglobin and methemoglobin values will be measured before treatment, at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 post first dose. In addition, clinical review (including additional signs of hemolysis) will be assessed based on active and passive follow-up.</description>
