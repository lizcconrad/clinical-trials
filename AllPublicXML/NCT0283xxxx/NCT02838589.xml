    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial investigates the effect of a single dose of glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist on cerebral blood flow velocity and cortical oxygination
      in humans without cerebrovascular disease. This study serves as a control for a similar study
      investigating the effect in stroke patients (ref. to EGRABIS1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are widely used in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes due to their ability to mimic the incretin hormone, GLP-1. GLP-1 increases
      glucose-dependent insulin secretion and thereby reduces plasma glucose level. Over the past
      few years, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been investigated as possible therapies for
      neurological disorders, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier. Evidence of
      the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases has been growing especially in animal stroke
      models. GLP-1 receptors, which are located in the central nervous system on neurons and
      endothelium, are upregulated in the brain due to ischemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown
      anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, and they may protect the cell from oxidative
      stress and may protect the endothelium. The inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium,
      is an active component of the endocrine function. It affects the formation of blood clots and
      plays a role in the disease mechanisms of stroke. The current acute and prophylactic
      treatments of stroke are mainly target platelet function, but not endothelial function.

      This double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial investigates the effect of a single dose of
      the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, on cerebral blood flow velocity, cortical oxygation
      and endothelial function in subjects free of cerebrovascular diseases. To our knowledge, the
      effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cerebral blood flow velocity in healthy subjects has not
      yet been clarified, and this study serves as a control for a similar study investigating the
      effect on stroke patients (ref. to EGRABIS1).

      The primary endpoint is the change in mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries
      measured by transcranial doppler. The secondary endpoints are the effects on the peripheral
      endothelium, hereby: 1) changes in the reactive hyperaemia index measured by EndoPAT2000, 2)
      changes in the ankle-brachial index, and 3) changes in endothelial/inflammatory biomarkers in
      the blood. The primary and secondary endpoints are measured before and up till three hours
      after administration of exenatide.

      The overall hypothesis is that GLP-1 receptor agonists may represent a novel potential
      neuroprotective treatment in stroke.
