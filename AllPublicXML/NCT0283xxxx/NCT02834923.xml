    <textblock>
      The Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) and the Chronic Care Model (CCM) are complementary
      clinical intervention frameworks that are commonly invoked to support better type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) outcomes in primary care. Self-management Support (SMS) is a core component of both
      the PCMH and CCM, and focuses on the central role of patients in managing their illness by
      engaging with and adopting healthy behaviors that promote optimal clinical outcomes. Despite
      its recognized importance, SMS programs for diabetes continue to demonstrate limited
      effectiveness in the real-world of primary care.

      SMS is comprised of two complementary and interactive components: (1) patient engagement
      (e.g., the process of eliciting and responding to patients emotions and motivations related
      to health behaviors), and (2) behavioral change tools (e.g., selecting specific goals,
      creating action plans). While several sophisticated SMS programs have been developed for
      T2DM, the vast majority are designed with a narrow focus on behavioral change tools, largely
      ignoring unique aspects of the patient context that drive and maintain health behavior.
      Considerable clinical research suggests that the addition of a structured, evidenced-based
      program of patient engagement can maximize the effectiveness of SMS programs for patients
      with T2DM in primary care.

      To date there has been no systematic study of the degree to which fully integrating enhanced
      patient engagement as part of SMS will increase the initiation and maintenance of behavior
      change over time, and for which kinds of patients enhanced patient engagement is essential.
      To address this gap, the investigators will compare a state-of-the-art, evidence-based SMS
      behavior change tool program, called Connection to Health (CTH), with an enhanced CTH program
      that includes a practical, time-efficient patient engagement protocol, to create a program
      with an integrated and comprehensive approach to SMS, called &quot;Enhanced Engagement CTH&quot;
      (EE-CTH). The current study will directly test the added benefit of EE-CTH to CTH with regard
      to self-management behaviors and glycemic control in resource-limited community health
      centers, where vast numbers of patients with T2DM from ethnically diverse and medically
      vulnerable populations receive their care. The investigators will use an
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing the &quot;Reach Effectiveness Adoption
      Implementation Maintenance&quot; (RE-AIM) framework to test these two SMS programs for T2DM. This
      will provide critical information that will support dissemination and implementation of
      effective SMS programs in resource-limited primary care settings, serving diverse and
      medically vulnerable populations with much to gain from improved SMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, 14 month pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the added benefit
      of EE-CTH relative to CTH for patients with T2DM in primary care.

      Primary care practices (not patients) will be randomly assigned to receive and deliver CTH or
      EE-CTH in an innovative effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. Using the RE-AIM
      framework, the investigators will evaluate program effectiveness in a real world setting,
      while at the same time gathering information on program reach, adoption, implementation and
      maintenance. CTH and EE-CTH practice trainings and delivery will each follow separate and
      standardized protocols, with support provided to practices through staff training, ongoing
      supervision and case presentations, and a practice improvement team assisted by a practice
      facilitator to address issues of staffing and patient flow. Practice training and
      facilitation notes, in conjunction with feedback from patient advisory councils, will be
      captured and integrated to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation process
      and inform dissemination efforts. Beyond the requirements of the study, practices will be
      permitted to use EE-CTH or CTH with other patients as wished, which will enable the
      investigators to document the program's reach within the practice. Patients in both study
      arms will receive the intervention at a minimum of two primary care appointments (baseline
      and follow-up between 6 and 12 months).

    <description>CTH is a comprehensive SMS program that focuses on behavior change. CTH utilizes web-based interactive behavior change technology, based on a logic model of behavior and maintenance that is informed by social-cognitive and social ecological theories. Prior to diabetes visits with a clinician, health educator, or care manager, patients complete a pre-visit CTH assessment at their practice through a tablet computer or computer kiosk. CTH assesses multiple diabetes management behaviors (diet, physical activity, medication adherence, alcohol and tobacco use, stress, mood) using brief assessment measures, each with cut-points highlighting areas of deficit. Action planning plays a central role, through a web-based platform that allows the patient and health care team to select and set goals collaboratively.</description>

    <description>EE-CTH seamlessly integrates CTH with an efficacious, structured, motivational interview (MI)-informed protocol specifically designed to enhance patient engagement in SMS activities. Key components of MI have been incorporated into a practical and systematic engagement protocol that includes: (1) acknowledging the patient's point of view; (2) identifying and labeling the patient's ambivalence (both the good reasons for making the change and the good reasons for not making the change); (3) evaluating whether change is really worth the effort; (4) identifying, reflecting and labeling accompanying feelings and concerns about change; and (5) establishing a small and meaningful goal by the end of the encounter.</description>
