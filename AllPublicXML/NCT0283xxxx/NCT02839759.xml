  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT will have two arms: A control group that receives the standard of care from
      audiologists and an experimental group that receives both the standard of care and the
      at-home use of the TELLYHealth intervention. Subjects in each group will complete
      questionnaires at enrollment, mid-study and at the end of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HTM will develop the &quot;TELLYHealth (tm) system&quot; that will provide education on hearing aid use
      and maintenance. HTM will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to quantify the
      benefits of TELLYHealth to patients and audiologists including: reductions in hearing
      handicap, improved knowledge of hearing aid handling, use and communications strategies; and
      improved audiologist aftercare. The investigators will recruit 80 subjects (half in each
      group) and each subject will participate in the study for 12 weeks.
