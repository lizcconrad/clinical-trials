  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish preliminary evidence of the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of LB1148 for the treatment of post-operative ileus and intra-abdominal
      adhesions in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled,
      proof-of-concept, adaptive design, Phase 2 study to evaluate LB1148 for return of
      gastrointestinal function and reduction of post-operative ileus and intra-abdominal adhesions
      in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection surgery with or without a planned stoma.

             any elected indication.

          -  Has been informed of the nature of the study (either the subject or their legal
