      This study included 90 pregnant women during their first trimester who attended Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital antenatal clinic and admitted in the ward.

      Patients were divided into two groups: 46 cases of pregnant women with H.G and 44 healthy
      control pregnant women with no vomiting.

      Both groups were matched regarding the inclusion criteria which includes maternal age (18-40
      years), gestational age (&lt;16 wks), and signs and symptoms of H.G for cases (vomiting
      affecting the general condition, ketonuria, weight loss) and excluding cases or controls with
      multiple gestation, hyadatiform disease or maternal disease causes vomiting such as ;
      pyelonephritis, gastroenteritis, cholecystitis or hepatitis.

      The two groups were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination, routine
      laboratory investigations (urine analysis, CBC, liver, kidney function tests Na, k, PT, PTT &amp;
      INR) Abdominal ultrasound was done to assess fetal life and gestational age and to exclude
      gestational trophoblastic disease and multiple gestation pregnancy.H.Pylori infection was
      assessed by using One step H.pylori Stool Antigen Test.

      (CER TEST BIOTEC) pol. Industrial Rio Gallego II,Calle J, No 1, 50840, San Mateo de Gallego,
