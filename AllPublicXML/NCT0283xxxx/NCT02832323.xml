  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients under hemodialysis treatment are mostly treated by erythropoietin (EPO) through
      erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). The objective of ESA treatments is to maintain the
      hemoglobin level in a therapeutic target around 11g/dl. The EPO dose that is necessary to
      reach this target depends on numerous and imbricated factors such as age, associated
      pathologies, iron status, inflammation. As of today, there is no marker to predict the EPO
      response and Hemoglobin (Hb) level is currently the only and late tool to assess the
      efficacy.

      Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that are temporary present in the blood
      circulation. They are easily monitored on every automatic dosing machines. Nevertheless,
      among the dialysis population, they are seldom used and attempt to define a normal
      reticulocyte level, attesting a correct medullar response to the administrated EPO dose
      failed due to the timing of blood collection (corresponding to the Nadir day of
      reticulocytosis).

      In a preliminary study, it has shown that reticulocyte count kinetics depends on ESA's type,
      dose and administration frequency. Reticulocyte kinetics were compared in three groups of
      stable dialysis patients, depending on their ESA treatment. Reticulocyte curves under a
      monthly Mircera® treatment were different from the other ESAs, showing a high reticulocyte
      peak (av. 80 000 reticulocyte/ml) occurring on Day (D)8-D10 after Mircera® administration. On
      the contrary, at nadir's point (D20-D30 after injection), reticulocyte levels are low for all
      the patients, preventing from any interpretation of the reticulocyte level at monthly routine
      assessment. It looks as though it is the peak level of reticulocytes that should be used as a
      marker of ESA response.

      Therefore, monitoring of reticulocytes would support the therapeutic decision on the need to
      adapt the EPO dose.

      The study is design to determinated the interest of the reticulocyte peak in the daily
      practice
