    <textblock>
      Obesity promotes chronic kidney disease and is accelerating its shift to the stage of renal
      replacement. Bariatric surgery is a treatment for severe or morbid obesity whose renal
      benefit is currently unknown. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best parameter to
      define the kidney function. It can be estimated using formulas by assaying endogenous markers
      (creatinine, cystatin C) or measured with an exogenous tracer glomerular filtration (51
      Cr-EDTA).

      Bariatric surgery alters the production of endogenous markers and the extracellular volume
      (VEC) with 2 important consequences on the assessment of GFR: the formula to estimate GFR is
      not possible to compare renal function before and after surgery because of the variation in
      production of endogenous glomerular filtration markers in the same subject; decreasing VEC
      predicted decreased GFR after surgery, since these parameters are in part proportional to
      each other.

      Our working hypothesis is that bariatric surgery protects the kidneys of patients with
      chronic kidney disease. To demonstrate this, investigators propose to compare the ratio DFG /
      VEC before and after gastric bypass.

      Goals The main objective is to measure the effect of gastric bypass on the report DFG / VEC.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of gastric bypass on the albumin / urine
      creatinine and evaluate the performance of the main GFR estimating formulas in people with
      severe or morbid obesity.
