      The aim of this research was to develop a dysphagia screening measure and evaluate the
      prevalence of dysphagia and its clinical manifestation in different in age population groups.

    <textblock>
      The dysphagia screening questionnaire had the stages of validation - translation and back
      translation, a review of the translation and back translation committee, pre-test study (36
      persons) with monolingual individuals and the test re-test study (67 subjects included).

      The case - control study groups were tested using dysphagia screening questionnaire and
      clinical screening - water drinking test. Barthel index and nutrition questionnaire were used
      to identify the nutritional and functional state. M. D. Anderson dysphagia inventory
      questionnaire, sf-12 questionnaire were used to assess dysphagia effects on the quality of
      life.

      The research group consisted of two subgroups - 171 nursing home residents from 3 different
      nursing homes and 82 outpatients of the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences.
      The control group consisted of randomly selected 40 community-dwelling elderly healthy
      individuals.

    <measure>Dysphagia screening questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Lithuanian version of questionnaire consists of 16 questions about masticatory and swallowing functions and dysphagia consequences during patients last one year.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical water drinking test</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A subject takes one tablespoon of water. Then - a sip of water (about 60-70 ml). We assess: coughing, choking, voice changes. At least one symptom means dysphagia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel index</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel index was used to identify objectively the functional state. According to Barthel index 100 points mean - functional independency, 91 - 99 - little dependency, 61 - 90 - moderate dependency, 21 - 60 - almost total dependency, 0 - 20 - total dependency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutrition questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrition questionnaire was used to identify objectively the nutritional state. The maximal score of nutritional state questionnaire - 30. 24 or more points mean - good nutritional state, 17-23,5 - risk of insufficient nutrition, &lt; 17 - insufficient nutrition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>M. D. Anderson dysphagia inventory (MDADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment if dysphagia effects the quality of life. Questionnaire consists of 20 questions. The emotional, functional, physical and global subscales are measured. Scores of each item can be from 0 to 100, they are summed, a mean score is calculated. A higher MDADI score represents better functioning and better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12 questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the quality of life, general health status using 12 questions. Assess physical functioning, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems, mental health. Scores range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
