  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulants are increasingly prescribed and the are not discontinued for invasive
      cardiac procedures .

      Additional parenteral anticoagulation is necessary for these procedures (FA ablation and
      invasive coronary explorations).

      The unfractionated heparin doses are adapted on a monitoring test heparin, activated clotting
      time (ACT) with the aim of obtaining and maintaining an ACT &gt; 300-400 sec. This goal is the
      same whether the patient is on oral anticoagulant treatment or not, and regardless of the
      initial level of anticoagulation.

      The effects of oral anticoagulants on routine coagulation tests (PT, APTT, TT) are well
      documented, but few data have been published on the effects of heparin monitoring tests,
      particularly on the ACT.

      The aim of this stuy is to redefine the target values of ACT and unfractionated heparin doses
      to administer to optimize the efficacy / safety of invasive procedures in cardiology.
