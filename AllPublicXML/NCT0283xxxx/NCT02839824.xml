  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Publications of the use of bowel cleansers in usual clinical practice are lacking. Patient
      adherence to investigational products increases in the context of clinical trials. By the
      same token, efficacy of interventions may be overestimated in clinical trials.

      For this reason, an observational study to collect data on the effectiveness of several
      colonic preparations when these are used under usual clinical practice is proposed.
