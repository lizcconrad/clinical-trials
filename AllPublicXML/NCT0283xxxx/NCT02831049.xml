      Background:

      Sights, sounds, and smells can be associated with alcohol and tempt people to drink. The
      connection between encountering cues and wanting to drink might be reduced by behavioral
      techniques, like giving the cues at certain times, in certain circumstances.

      Objective:

      To see if visual imagery and behavioral techniques can reduce alcohol craving and drinking.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 21 65 who are mildly concerned about their drinking and have had these
      habits in the past 3 months:

      Women: More than 3 drinks any single day and more than 7 drinks per week

      Men: More than 4 drinks any single day and more than 14 drinks per week

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood tests, alcohol
      breath tests, hepatitis tests, and alcohol and drug use questionnaires.

      Participants will get a smartphone to carry throughout the study. They will use it to report
      on their drinking, moods, and activities daily. The phone s GPS will record their locations
      throughout each day.

      There will be 6 study visits over 4 weeks. Visits will last up to 4 hours, but the final
      visit lasts up to 7 hours. Visits include the following:

      Not drinking alcohol or using illicit or over-the-counter drugs at least 24 hours before each

      visit

      Providing urine and breath samples.

      Exposure to various cues. Participants reactions will be monitored by measuring heart rate,

      blood pressure, and skin temperature.

      Drinking alcohol or soft drinks. For visits with alcohol, transportation to and from the

      visit will be provided.

      About a month after the last visit, participants will be called to ask about their drinking
      and cravings.

      Objective: To evaluate alcohol memory retrieval-extinction, a novel behavioral procedure for
      reduction of craving and drinking, in problem drinkers.

      Study population: We will collect evaluable data from up to 75 participants. Participants are
      evaluable if they complete geographical momentary assessment (GMA, described below). All
      participants will be adult alcohol drinkers (men: &gt; 14 drinks/week or &gt; 4 drinks/day; women:
      &gt; 7 drinks/week or &gt; 3 drinks/day) whose drinking scores as hazardous on the Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test. Participants will not be seeking treatment for an alcohol-use
      disorder, be physiologically dependent on alcohol, or have other drug use disorders.

      Design: A randomized study with three groups. Participants will use smartphones to provide
      geotagged reports of alcohol craving and drinking in daily life (GMA reports) before,
      between, and after a series of laboratory sessions. During sessions, participants will drink
      an alcoholic beverage (individualized to produce a 0.06 g/dL blood alcohol content) or a soft
      drink. Participants will then be repeatedly presented with alcohol- or soft-drink-associated
      cues without further drinking. These are the memory retrieval and extinction portions,
      respectively, of memory retrieval-extinction. Previous studies suggest this procedure can
      robustly reduce Pavlovian associations between cues and responses such as craving. The
      mechanism seems to involve memory reconsolidation, in which freshly retrieved associations
      (e.g., drink cues and consumption - pleasant effects ) become more vulnerable to disruption
      by extinction.

      Three groups will be tested: (1) alcohol retrieval / alcohol extinction will be compared to
      (2) soft-drink retrieval / alcohol extinction and (3) alcohol retrieval / soft-drink
      extinction. Before and after retrieval-extinction, participants will be tested for alcohol
      craving and cue-induced physiological responses in laboratory sessions. Retrieval-extinction
      will be followed by 1 week of follow-up GMA reporting, with telephone contact 30 days
      thereafter.

      Outcome parameters: The co-primary outcome measures are: self-reported alcohol craving in the
      laboratory sessions before and after retrieval-extinction, and GMA reports of alcohol craving
      and drinking. Daily-life responses are important because the version of retrieval-extinction
      we will be using, with retrieval induced by drinking alcohol itself, rather than alcohol cues
      alone, may be especially likely to have effects that generalize from the laboratory to daily
      life. Secondary outcome measures are: (1) self-reported alcohol craving and drinking at
      30-day follow-up, (2) physiological reactivity during sessions, and (3) urine biomarkers for
      alcohol consumption.

               -  For women, more than 3 drinks on any single day per week or more than 7 drinks
                  per

               -  week, during at least 10 different weeks;

          -  For men, more than 4 drinks on any single day per week or more than 14 drinks per
             week, during at least 10 different weeks;

          -  a score greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 15 on the self-report
             version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), with endorsement of
             at least one item other than 1-3, because 1-3 assess only consumption, not concern or
             consequences;

          -  self-report of liking or having neutral feelings about the sight and smell of
             alcoholic beverages;

          -  for women, practicing an effective method of birth control before entry and throughout
             the study (or postmenopausal for at least one year, or surgically sterile); negative
             urine pregnancy test at each visit. Effective methods of birth control are those
             approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used as described in the FDA Birth
             Control Guide These methods are: (1) intrauterine device (IUD) copper; (2) IUD with
             progestin; (3) implantable rod; (4) contraceptive shot/injection; (5) oral
             contraceptives (combined pill, progestin-only pill, or extended/continuous-use
             combined pill); (6) contraceptive patch; (7) vaginal contraceptive ring; (8) diaphragm
             with spermicide; (9) sponge with spermicide; (10) cervical cap with spermicide; (11)
             male condom; (12) female condom; (13) male partner with a vasectomy. Abstinence from
             sexual intercourse is also an effective method of birth control.

             physician s judgment.

          -  currently trying to quit drinking, or planning to quit or reduce alcohol drinking via
             formal treatment or support-group attendance in the next six months;

          -  for women: pregnancy, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the
             experiment;

          -  current liver disease or dysfunction, assessed by physical examination and medical
             history; and hepatitis C, chronic hepatitis B, or other current liver disease or

             aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or gamma-glutamyltransferase
             (GGT)

          -  any other medical illness or condition that in the judgment of the investigators is
             incompatible with alcohol consumption;

          -  current use of prescription or over-the-counter medications or herbal products for
             which drinking alcohol is strictly prohibited. When the metabolic half-life of the
             medication/product is known, we will require at least 7 half-lives to have elapsed
             before any session involving alcohol consumption. If the half-life is not known (as
             might be the case for some herbal preparations), we will require at least 7 days to
             have elapsed since the last use before any session involving alcohol consumption;
