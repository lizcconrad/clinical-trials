      The purpose of the study is to measure the drug levels in the blood of HIV-infected
      individuals taking anti- HIV medication efavirenz 400 mg once daily in the presence of
      anti-TB medication rifampicin and isoniazid. The study is being run in two-stages - London
      (Stage 1) and Kampala (Stage 2).

      In London (Stage 1): HIV-1 infected patients (without tuberculosis infection) on established
      treatment with a combination based on 600 mg efavirenz dose will be recruited.

      In Kampala (Stage 2): Patients with both HIV-1 and tuberculosis infection being treated with
      600 mg efavirenz combination for HIV AND undergoing TB treatment with a dual therapy regimen
      contaning rifampicin and isoniazid will be recruited.

      Efavirenz-containing regimens are recommended as first-line therapy for HIV-TB co-infected
      patients. It has been shown there is a lack of a significant difference between efavirenz 400
      mg and efavirenz 600 mg, indicating that 400 mg efavirenz is non-inferior to the standard
      dose.

      The advantages of antiretroviral dose reductions may translate into greater benefits for more
      individuals infected by HIV globally, since they may allow access programs to reach higher
      numbers of infected patients and compensate for the finite global manufacturing capacity and
      increasing demand. For efavirenz, significant price reductions have been achieved through
      elimination of trade, logistics and manufacturing capacity barriers, and further price
      reductions could be achieved with a significant reduction in the cost of pharmaceutical
      ingredients. However, no data on the PK and effectiveness of efavirenz 400 mg once daily
      during TB treatment has been produced. Given that many patients on Efavirenz- based ART will
      need to be treated for TB during their lifetime and rifampicin is one of the most commonly
      used treatment for tuberculosis, it is important to study the reduced dose under carefully
      monitored conditions prior to roll out of a lower dose standard treatment. Therefore, we aim
      to investigate the PK of efavirenz 400 mg once daily in HIV-infected individuals in the
      presence of rifampicin and isoniazid in London, UK and in HIV/TB-co-infected individuals on
      dual anti-TB treatment in Kampala, Uganda

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the comparison of efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) Ctrough during combined treatment with efavirenz and rifampicin/isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis, versus efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) treatment alone. The efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) Ctrough from each patient will be compared between the two phases using geometric mean ratios (log10 transformed data). For this sequential design, a sample size of 25 patients would provide at least 80% power to detect a decrease in efavirenz Ctrough of 20% during the combined rifampicin/isoniazid-efavirenz (Sustiva/Stocrin) phase, compared to the efavirenz alone phase. This calculation assumes two-sided testing with a 5% significance level and a within-patient coefficient of variation in efavirenz levels of no more than 30%.</description>
