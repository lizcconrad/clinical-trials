  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that performing SLND (instead of complete lymphadenectomy) will
      decrease complications such as hemorrhage, lower extremity lymphedema and lymphocyst
      formation while enhancing quality of life in EC patients with low risk for nodal involvement.

      The investigators also hypothesize that SLND is an effective method of staging these
      patients. Studies have shown that SLN mapping identifies positive lymph nodes in women with
      newly diagnosed EC and this prognostic information obtained from SLND could guide selection
      of adjuvant treatment and improve overall survival.

      Using SLND as an alternative may also have additional medical and economic impacts. Prolonged
      hospitalization and associated costs can be avoided by shortening overall surgery duration.

      This is an interventional, prospective, and non-therapeutic study evaluating the clinical
      utility of SLND for detecting nodal metastasis of early stage endometrial cancer.

      Patients will undergo surgical staging for EC (sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) via
      laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery, ±hysterectomy, ±bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
      (BSO)). Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy may (or may not) also be performed in addition
      to SLND, at the discretion of the Surgeon.

      Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) will be removed; that is, all patients will have SLND. Pelvic
      washings may also be obtained. Pathology assessment of nodal metastasis will be performed in
      all nodes removed (SLN or any other enlarged or removed lymph nodes).

      Patients will be staged using International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)
      criteria and classified into risk strata (either low or high risk EC) as per the Modified
      Mayo Criteria. Based on the pathologic risk assessment and FIGO stage, patients may then be
      assigned to receive adjuvant treatment at the discretion of the treating Investigator and as
      per institutional guidelines; no per-protocol treatment is planned.

    <description>The rate of SLND positivity rate overall and by risk group in patients with clinically apparent early-stage EC. EC patients will be classified as high or low risk group based on the modified Mayo Criteria (Mariani A 2008, Milam 2012).</description>

    <measure>Rate of NPV and FNPV of the SLND Procedure in Study Participants Who Undergo Partial or Full Lymphadenectomy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of the negative predictive value (NPV) and its complement the false negative predictive value (FNPV) rate of the SLND procedure in the subset of patients who also undergo partial or full lymphadenectomy. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) will be calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the total number of patients with a negative SLN (false negatives and true negatives. False Negative Predictive Value (FNPV) rate will be calculated as the number false negatives divided by all patients without nodal metastasis (the number of false negatives and true negatives). FNPV rate is also known as the False Omission Rate (FOR); FNPV is the complement of NPV.</description>
