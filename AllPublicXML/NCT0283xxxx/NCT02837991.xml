      This is a study to determine the safety of CDX-014 and effectiveness (how well the drug
      works).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-014 is an antibody-drug conjugate that binds to a protein called TIM-1, which is found on
      a high percentage of kidney cells that are clear or papillary and ovarian cancer cells that
      are clear cell.

      The study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ovarian
      clear cell carcinoma to determine the safety and efficacy of CDX-014.

      This study will include a Dose-Escalation Phase followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of CDX-014 (in mg/kg). MTD will be defined as the highest dose-level where DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) occurs in less than 33% of treated patients.</description>

    <description>During the treatment phase of the study, patients will receive CDX-014 treatment every 3 weeks (RCC or OCCC) or every 2 weeks (RCC) as long as they remain eligible. Patients may be discontinued from CDX-014 treatment based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing side effects that make study therapy intolerable.
The planned dose of CDX-014 depends on the cohort assigned at enrollment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic clear cell or papillary
             renal cell carcinoma or histologically confirmed clear cell ovarian carcinoma.

          2. For RCC, at least two prior anticancer regimens (one must be a VEGF-targeted TKI), or
             are otherwise inappropriate candidates for all approved therapies. For OCCC, at least
             one line of prior therapy with a platinum and taxane regimen.

          3. Documented progressive disease based on radiographic, clinical or pathologic
             assessment during or subsequent to last therapy.

          4. Measureable (target) disease.

          5. Must have available tumor tissue for TIM-1 expression testing

          6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          7. If of childbearing potential (male or female), agrees to use effective contraception
             during study treatment and for at least 6 months following last treatment dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy containing MMAE

          2. Any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen, including antibody drug conjugates for RCC
             or cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks of study treatment for OCCC

          3. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy within 2 weeks or at least 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to planned start of study treatment.

          4. Monoclonal antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to the planned start of study
             treatment.

          5. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment (palliative
             radiotherapy to bone lesions allowed up to 2 weeks prior to study treatment start).

          7. Use of other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to study treatment.

          8. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (uncontrolled diabetes or
             infection), known infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          9. Brain metastases, unless previously treated and asymptomatic and not progressive for 2

             cured in situ cancers, or other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free
             for ≥ 3 years.

         12. Active systemic infection requiring treatment. Infection controlled by oral therapy
             will not be exclusionary.

         13. Chronic use of systemic corticosteroid above an accepted physiologic dose (5mg per day
             of prednisone or equivalent) within 7 days of enrollment except when used as
