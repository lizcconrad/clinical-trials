  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this comparative bioavailability and in vivo skin adhesion study, the impact of minor
      changes in qualitative composition of polyiso-Butylenes (PIB) from a different supplier and
      change of the manufacturing line of the micro porous membrane will be tested.

      This study is a randomized, single-center, cross-over, comparative bioavailability and
      adhesion study, comparing single administrations of a new scopolamine transdermal delivery
      system formulation to the current established reference transdermal delivery system in
      healthy adult participants. The study will consist of an ambulant screening day within 21
      days prior to the first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration at study Day 1
      and two treatment periods. Each treatment period will consist of 4.5 days (108 hours) of
      in-house confinement.
