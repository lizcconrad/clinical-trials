    <textblock>
      This protocol is a pilot study on standard care. The main goal is to assess the impact of
      positioning on lumbar puncture process especially on pain sensitivity in children.

      It's a prospective, monocentric, randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Inclusion period
      is one year, and number of inclusions forecasted is about 30. Each patient will have one LP
      in a seated position and one in a lying position.

      In Pediatric Oncology Hematology, invasive procedures such lumbar punctures or myelograms are
      essential to diseases diagnosis and treatment.

      In hematological malignancies, lumbar punctures are particularly frequent as the therapy
      processes. Despite a good analgesia, this repeated procedure can generate pain, anxiety,
      apprehension leading to an increasing difficulty in the procedure realization.

      Two positions are possible to carry out lumbar puncture: seated or lying position.

      The main goal of this study is to assess the impact of the child positioning during the
      lumbar puncture process in term of pain, anxiety and stress.

      This study is a prospective, monocentric, randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Inclusion
      period is 1 year, 30 patients will be included from 2 to 18 years old.

      Each patient will have 2 LP one in seated and one in lying position in a specific order
      determined by randomization.

      All data regarding pain and anxiety will be collected the day of LP. Patients will be re
      contacted 48 hours and 15 days after LP procedure in order to evaluate complications such
      post-lumbar puncture syndrome or hematoma. The main analysis will be done on
      intent-to-treat-analysis basis and will compare pain intensity between the two groups.
