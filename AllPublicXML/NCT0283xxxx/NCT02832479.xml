  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evolution of medical care for patients with cystic fibrosis appeared in recent years:
      prolongation of life expectancy with consequently increased comorbidities and the use of lung
      transplantation, systematic neonatal screening of new born since 2002, prescription of
      expensive new molecules or new presentation. This evolution justifies to realize an update of
      statistics of costs of care and to assess adherence to treatment
