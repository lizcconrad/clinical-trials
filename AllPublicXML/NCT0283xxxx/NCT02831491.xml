          -  The participant has adequate organ function.

          -  The participant's urine protein is &lt;2+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA). If

             must be collected and must demonstrate &lt;2 grams of protein in 24 hours to allow
             participation in the study.

          -  For male participants, are sterile (including vasectomy confirmed by post vasectomy
             semen analysis) or agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (2 methods
             preferred, or per country requirements, whichever is more strict), and to not donate
             sperm starting with the first dose of study treatment, during the study, and for at
             least 6 months following the last dose of study treatment or country requirements,
             whichever is longer.

          -  For female participants, are surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or agree to use a
             highly effective method of contraception (2 methods preferred, or per country

             the last dose of study treatment or country requirements, whichever is longer.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  The participant has received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for locally
             advanced or metastatic NSCLC; however, prior maintenance chemotherapy for locally
             advanced or metastatic NSCLC is allowed.

          -  The participant's tumour contains small cell lung cancer.

          -  The participant has undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of
