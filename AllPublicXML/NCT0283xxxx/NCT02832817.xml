  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia is a frequent situation in clinical practice, particularly in intensive care units
      or perioperative. The mortality and morbidity increase for cardiovascular reason, due to
      hypoxia has been reported several times. It is therefore important to detect hypoxemia very
      early and with accuracy. The objective is to correct the causes quickly and thus avoid or
      minimize complications.

      In addition to the risks associated with hypoxemia, the monitoring of Arterial Oxygen
      Saturation also avoids the adverse effects associated with hyperoxia. Indeed oxygen leads to
      the formation of free radicals, which in physiological condition are regulated by antioxidant
      mechanisms. However, in anesthesiology, it is common to find pathological situations (acute
      respiratory distress syndrome, shock, prolonged inflammatory state) where these regulatory
      mechanisms are overwhelmed. Oxygen administration to supra-physiological concentrations leads
      to a formation of excessive free radicals, aggravating the existing injury (including lung).

      Oxygen therapy is a fully-fledged treatment requiring monitoring of its effectiveness and
      tolerance. Currently, the standard method for assessing oxygenation is the arterial blood gas
      analysis with the Arterial Oxygen Saturation. Its cost and the need for an arterial blood
      sample do not allow regular monitoring. Clinical evaluation of hypoxia is completely
      unreliable. there is a third method : monitoring devices that measure Arterial Pulsed Oxygen
      Saturation, called &quot;pulse oximeters.&quot; Pulse oximeters have become an integral and mandatory
      part of the standard monitoring. It is through the measurement of Arterial Pulsed Oxygen
      Saturation, supposed to reflect Arterial Oxygen Saturation, that clinicians guide their
      therapeutic attitudes to optimize oxygenation and improve the prognosis of patients. So pulse
      oximetry is a method considered reliable and especially non-invasive. It is less expensive
      and does not require blood sampling. These qualities explain why these devices are easily
      used in anesthesia, intensive care and in emergency situations.

      However, several studies have demonstrated the inaccuracy of Arterial Pulsed Oxygen
      Saturation in frequent situations resuscitation (shock, sepsis, dark skin type). Thus, it is
      necessary to objectify the benefits and limitations of pulse oximetry to optimize their use,
      especially in these situations of high risk, where a discrepancy between the values measured
      by the pulse oximetry and measurement of arterial blood saturation with oxygen gas can be
      detrimental.

      It exists several pulse oximetry devices, whose accuracy seems unequal, which necessitates a
      comparative study.
