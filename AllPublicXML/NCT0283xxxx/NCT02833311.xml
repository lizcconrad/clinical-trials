  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in routine physical activity may help decrease
      severity of symptoms, prevent secondary conditions, and slow functional decline in people
      with disabling neuromusculoskeletal conditions. However, people with these conditions face
      many health barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. With the advent of portable
      technologies, such as smart phones, tablets and PDAs, there is a need to explore whether
      these technologies can help people with disabling conditions to stay motivated and overcome
      barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors.

      The overarching goal of this mixed methods, comparative effectiveness randomized controlled
      pilot study is to evaluate whether goal setting, self-monitoring, and barrier management
      using a computer tablet can increase physical activity behavior, improve nutritional habits,
      and promote health-related quality of life in people with disabling neuromusculoskeletal
      conditions. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the standard care contact control group,
      participants in both the tablet group and the paper and pencil group will yield significant
      improvements in healthy behaviors,with the tablet group yielding significantly larger
      increases.

Participants will then receive weekly follow-up phone calls to discuss progression and/or possible trouble-shooting strategies. Participants will be asked to set goals related to increasing self managing health behaviors. Participants will be encouraged to self-monitor goals, behaviors and symptoms using a computer tablet.</description>
