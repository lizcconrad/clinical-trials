      This clinical trial studies the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing
      aromatase inhibitor-induced toxicity in patients with stage I-III breast cancer. An omega-3
      supplementation may help relieve moderate to severe bone pain and improve joint symptoms
      caused by aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of the complementary therapy omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 PUFA)
      supplementation in preventing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias (AIIAs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively define the population most at risk for developing AIIAs by the
      identification and validation of genetic risk predictors and to develop a single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)/gene profile predictive of treatment intervention response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      Group I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) once daily (QD) for
      6 months.

      Group II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

      After completion of study, patients will be followed up periodically.

    <description>The rates of adherence to and discontinuation of AI therapy will be recorded. Reasons for treatment discontinuation will be described.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A sequential analysis of the data that allows filtering of extraneous SNPs and select SNP loci, identification and creation of predictive SNP clusters, and then evaluation of the networks' potential clinical and biological validity will be performed.</description>

    <description>The relationship between RBC n-3 PUFA levels, inflammatory blood markers and the joint symptoms evaluated by the patient symptom assessment instruments. Scatter plots and correlation coefficients (either Pearson or Spearman) will be used to summarize their pairwise relation. The differences between the treatment and placebo in terms of these measures will also be reported using numerical summaries and graphic plots.</description>
