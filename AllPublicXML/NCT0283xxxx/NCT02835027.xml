    <textblock>
      Study of acute lower ischemia therapies based on data collected from the Swedish Vascular
      Surgery Registry between 1994 and 2014.

      Primary endpoint is long term amputation-free survival and secondary end-points are 30 days
      and 1 year amputation-free survival as well as different revascularization techniques results
      and time trends.

      The prospective Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) started in 1987 and since 1994 it has
      included more than 95 percent of the vascular surgical procedures performed nationwide. The
      registry has received extensive high internal and external validation. Roughly 16000 open
      surgical and endovascular revascularisation procedures for acute limb ischemia have been
      performed during this period of time.

      The fact that every Swedish citizen has a unique personal identification number makes it
      possible to obtain 100 percent accurate survival and amputation data. Survival data were
      obtained through crosschecking the personal identification number with the national
      population registry in June 2016.

      This offers a unique opportunity to study a large population-based cohort of unselected
      patients.
