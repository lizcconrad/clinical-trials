      While it is well accepted that a low level of RONS production is necessary to maintain
      physiological function, too much formation of RONS are believed to participate in
      biomolecules damage. Damage of lipids, proteins and DNA/RNA, to cellular and tissue level, as
      a consequence of oxidative stress has been linked to a number of serious diseases, including
      cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension and atherosclerosis,
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's dementias, diabetes
      and the process of aging.

      The dietary intake of antioxidants is thought to play a major role in oxidative stress
      network. Many epidemiologic studies have reported an inverse association between vegetable
      and fruit consumption with reduced risk of chronic diseases, especially cancer and CVDs.
      However, although many clinical trials have been conducted with vitamins (E, C or their
      combinations) their in vivo protective effect remains uncertain. Therefore the possibility
      that the complex mixture of phytochemicals in foods may contribute to their protecting
      effects has been raised. In this concept, it is possible multiple compounds to act through
      complimentary or synergistic mechanisms to present a greater biologic effect than can be
      achieved by any individual component To investigate this hypothesis, a double-blind,
      randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in order to investigate the
      effects of a multi-micronutrient supplement against oxidative stress in apparently healthy
      adults.

      This was a double-blind, block randomized, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, eight-week
      study. Initially 77 apparently healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in the study.
      62 volunteers were enrolled in the study and assigned to either the MM group (n = 32) or the
      placebo group (n = 30) using a stratified randomization to guarantee comparability of age,
      sex and BMI distribution between the two groups. The randomization code was prepared by a
      staff member who was not involved in running the trial, by using computer-generated random
      numbers. At the initiation of the study, the subjects received 5 bottles (0.5L each) of the
      MM or placebo, which were made indistinguishable by their identical packaging. At 4 weeks the
      subjects received again 5 bottles. The subjects were asked to consume 80mL per day,
      preferably after meals. The dose was chosen based on the commercially recommended level. At
      each visit, the remaining volume of the supplement was counted by research coordinators. The
      subjects were excluded from the analysis if they consumed &lt;80% of the recommended dose.
