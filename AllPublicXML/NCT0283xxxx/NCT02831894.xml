    <textblock>
      Treatment-seeking insomnia sufferers most often present in primary care venues where the
      first and usually only treatment is a prescription for a sedative hypnotic, typically a
      benzodiazepine (BZD) or newer benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA). For some patients,
      short-term or intermittent use provides satisfactory insomnia relief. However, more than 65%
      of individuals who are prescribed hypnotics use them for more than a year, and &gt; 30% remain
      on these agents for more than five years. Whereas some patients may appreciate partial or
      full relief of insomnia symptoms with ongoing hypnotic use, continuous long-term use of these
      agents may not represent optimal therapy. A sizable proportion of insomnia patients who
      participate in non-drug insomnia therapy such as cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy
      (CBT-I) achieve sustained insomnia remission long after a time-limited course of treatment.
      However, it is difficult for most long-term hypnotic users to convert from use of medications
      to a self-management approach. Interventions that combine CBT-I with supervised medication
      tapering (SMT) have shown the greatest promise for achieving this outcome, but almost 50% of
      patients who receive this assistance either fail to discontinue their hypnotics or return to
      them even if they do achieve short-term abstinence. Previous research provides only a
      rudimentary understanding of how to help long-term hypnotic users discontinue their sleep
      aids and successfully manage their insomnia with CBT-I techniques.

      Limitations of existing research include failure to consider how:

        1. the pace of hypnotic withdrawal influences outcomes;

        2. patient characteristics such as belief in the need for sleep medications, and anxiety
           sensitivity moderate outcomes; and

        3. hypnotic withdrawal symptoms and changes in sleep quality mediate outcomes.

      This R34 project will gather key pilot data to address these limitations. Specifically, this
      project will compare the currently recommended tapering pace (25% dose reduction every two
      weeks) to a slower tapering pace (10% dose reduction every two weeks) and a no tapering
      condition to determine the influence of tapering pace on outcomes. The study also will
      examine participants' beliefs about their need for hypnotics, anxiety sensitivity, and
      hypnotic dose, half-life and time used as moderators of outcomes. The influence of hypnotic
      withdrawal symptoms and level of sleep disturbance during withdrawal will be tested as
      mediators of outcomes. Enrollees (N=75) will first complete CBT-I and then will be randomized
      to a tapering pace (n=25 per SMT pace). Target moderators and mediators will be examined to
      assess their influence on outcomes. Primary outcomes will include drop-out rates and hypnotic
      discontinuation rates observed for each SMT pace. Investigators will tally rates of those who
      achieve hypnotic dose reductions during SMT and those who return to hypnotic use by a 3-month
      follow-up as secondary endpoints. Results will inform a future R01-level clinical trial
      focusing on tapering pace, patient characteristics that moderate the effect of tapering pace,
      and psychophysiological processes that mediate the effect of tapering pace. This line of
      research will inform clinical practice by helping to refine guidelines for tapering pace so
      as to provide more successful, person-centered interventions

          5. provide written consent to participate.

          6. have an insomnia severity index score &gt; 10 indicating at least mild insomnia symptoms
             without sleep medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. an untreated unstable, or &quot;in-treatment&quot; psychiatric disorder (e.g., major depression

          7. a history or screening evidence of restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep
             disorder (e.g., delayed sleep phase syndrome), sleep apnea (AHI &gt; 5), or periodic limb
             movement disorder (PLM index &gt; 15)

          8. habitual bedtimes later than 2:00 AM or rising times later than 10:00 AM; (i)
