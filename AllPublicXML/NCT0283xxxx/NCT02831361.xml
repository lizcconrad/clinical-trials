      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin 50 mg
      orally administered once daily for 24 weeks compared with placebo in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on insulin alone or on insulin in
      combination with metformin stably for 8 weeks.
