          -  Histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of solid tumor that is advanced
             and/or metastatic.

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, participants must be appropriate candidates for
             experimental therapy after available standard therapies have failed or for whom
             standard therapy is not appropriate.

          -  Performance status of ≤1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          -  Adequate organ function, including hematologic, hepatic, and renal.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received previous therapy for cancer within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study
             drug for a nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents, respectively.

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions.

          -  Have current or recent (within 3 months of study drug administration) gastrointestinal

          -  Have known acute or chronic leukemia or current hematologic malignancies that may
             affect the interpretation of results.
