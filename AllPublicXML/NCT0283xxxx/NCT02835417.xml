      Background

      The fetal heart rate (FHR) is commonly monitored during labor to detect early fetal acidosis.
      FHR variability is traditionally investigated using Fourier transform, however, fetal
      conditions differ from adults (higher frequency, widely instable signal) modifying spectrum
      repartition along frequencies, making this approach inappropriate. New mathematic approach,
      including Multifractal analysis, adaptative multiscale complexity analysis, nearest-neighbor
      based wavelet entropy rate measures, scattering transform, may identify parameters associated
      with fetal acidosis. Modern classification system, driven by the data, based on these
      relevant parameters should help to dsiccriminate the fetus at risk for acidosis and help the
      clinician in decision making for the management and termination of labor. Analysing 20 to 30
      minutes sliding windows with these different methods in a limited number of cases (foetus
      born with acidosis) and controls (foetus without acidosis) should lead to identify relevant
      parameters, which will be submitted to these classification tools. For external validation, a
      large database, including more than 4500 FHR recording documented with foetal outcomes, will
      be used to evaluate the performance of the combination of parameters identify and
      classification system used to discriminate foetuses at risk for short term acidosis or not,
      in order to give a relevant information to the clinician before acidosis occurs, to make the
      appropriate decision.
