  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein-calorie malnutrition is frequently observed in patients with advanced liver
      cirrhosis. There have been continued interests in potential benefits of long-term oral
      branched-chain amino acid supplement in improving severity of liver disease. However, there
      are limited evidences in literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      oral branched-chain amino acid in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis.

      This study is a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving thirteen centers in Korea
      nation-wide. The inclusion criteria are liver cirrhosis patients with Child-Pugh score 8 to
      10. The major exclusion criteria are abnormal serum creatinine level, and hepatocellular
      carcinoma with viable tumor. The investigators analyzed improvement of Model for End-Stage
      Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh score, incidence of cirrhosis-related complications, and
      event free survival.
