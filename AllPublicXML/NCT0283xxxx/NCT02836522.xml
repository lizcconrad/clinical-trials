        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consented to the ANCHOR trial as per self-report and by providing a valid referral
             code on the information sheet provided by the referring site. Both men and women from
             the ANCHOR trial will be recruited to this study.

          -  English fluent as we are only validating this measure in English at this time

          -  At least one month post-treatment for anal HSIL as per self-report, or if the person
             is in the ANCHOR trial observation arm, then at least one month post- randomization.

          -  Within two weeks post initial-treatment for anal HSIL on ANCHOR study or within two
             weeks post-randomization to ANCHOR study as per self-report.

        NOTES:

          -  ANCHOR participants who are randomized to the treatment arm must have completed
             initial treatment and are within two weeks of initial treatment completion.

          -  ANCHOR participants who were treated initially with topical treatment are only
             eligible within two weeks after the last topical treatment application.

          -  ANCHOR participants who were treated initially with both topical and ablation
             treatments are eligible within two weeks of completing both treatments.

          -  ANCHOR participants who are randomized to the active monitoring arm are eligible if
             they are within two weeks of randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a scheduled ANCHOR follow-up appointment in the next two weeks as per self report.
             The purpose of this exclusion criterion is to minimize the impact on a participant's
             responses to a post-test evaluation the potential occurrence of an interim diagnosis
             or treatment event, or anxiety related to an upcoming medical follow-up.
