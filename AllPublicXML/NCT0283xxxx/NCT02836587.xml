  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall related injuries are major health problem which effect especially elderly population.
      After experiencing a fall, most of the elderly are unable to resume their previous mobility
      and the fear of future falls affects their daily life. Falls in elderly population are often
      related to balance or gait problems. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of
      balance training on postural and motor control of healthy elderly participants. The study is
      designed as a parallel interventional study with experimental and control group (allocation
      ratio 1:1). Participants' general health, balance abilities, fear of falling and gait
      stability and variability will be assessed on the baseline measurement, right after and 2
      months after the completion of the training programme. Experimental group will undergo
      training focused on development of balance abilities and strength twice a week (60 minutes in
      length each) for 8 weeks. Participants will receive individualized exercises which will be
      focused on the main 4 types - stance exercises, gait and transition exercises and strength
      exercises especially focused on muscle strength of lower extremities.

    <description>The interventional program will last 8 weeks with the intensity of two 60-minutes lectures a week. Training sessions will be delivered by a physiotherapist to small groups of patients (3-5). Participants will receive individualized exercises which will be focused on main 4 types - stance exercises, gait and transition exercises and strength exercises especially focused on muscle strength of the lower extremities. The difficulty level will be increased progressively after participant's ability to complete each exercise independently (e.g. eyes closed, exercises on balance equipment - wobble board, foam etc., addition of a secondary cognitive task). The training session will consist of a ten-minute warm-up followed by five-minute stretching, 30 minutes of balance training and 15 minutes of stretching and relaxation.</description>
