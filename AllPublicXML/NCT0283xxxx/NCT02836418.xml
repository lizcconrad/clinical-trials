      ATYR1940-C-006 is a multi-national, multicenter study being conducted at centers in the
      United States (US) and Europe who participated in the Study ATYR1940-C-003 (Stage 1 only) or
      ATYR1940-C-004 (i.e., the parent studies).

      Study ATYR1940-C-006 is a multi-national, multi-center, open-label extension study designed
      to evaluate the long-term safety, effects on muscle, and PD of ATYR1940 in patients with
      LGMD2B or FSHD previously treated in the Protocol ATYR1940-C-003 (Stage 1 only) or
      ATYR1940-C-004 (i.e., the parent studies). This study will be conducted at the same study
      centers at which patients were enrolled in the parent studies.

      Patients who completed the treatment period in the parent study; in the Investigator's
      opinion, demonstrated acceptable tolerability of ATYR1940, are considered by the Investigator
      to be compliant with ATYR1940 and the study procedures, and do not meet any criterion for
      ATYR1940 discontinuation are eligible for participation in the current study, contingent upon
      Investigator and patient agreement to continue ATYR1940 treatment.

      For the first 12 weeks in this extension study, patients will receive ATYR1940 at the highest
      tolerated dose received in the parent study; no dose adjustments are allowed during this
      12-week period. After 12 weeks, if the patient is demonstrating good tolerability, the
      ATYR1940 dose may be increased on a patient-specific basis at the Investigator's discretion,
      in consultation with the Sponsor and Medical Monitor. ATYR1940 dose increases to &gt;3.0 mg/kg
      are not permissible.

      All patients will receive ATYR1940 on a weekly basis in this study, regardless of the
      frequency of dosing in the parent study. ATYR1940 will be administered via IV infusion over
      90 minutes. If medically indicated, the infusion duration and volume may be adjusted at the
      Investigator's discretion in consultation with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor.
