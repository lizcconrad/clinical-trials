      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate how much galcanezumab gets into the body after
      it is given as an injection just under the skin by two different devices. This study will
      measure how much galcanezumab reaches the blood stream and will test how it affects
      calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) in blood. Information about any side effects that may
      occur will be collected. The study will last about 20 weeks for each participant. Screening
      is required within 45 days prior to the start of the study.

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the
             investigative site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not
             clinically significant by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating galcanezumab, and have previously received galcanezumab

          -  Have allergies to either humanized monoclonal antibodies, diphenhydramine,
             epinephrine, or methylprednisolone

          -  Intend to use over-the-counter or prescription medication within 7 days prior to
             dosing and during the study (especially systemic glucocorticoids, immunomodulatory
             drugs, drugs with propensity for dermal reactions, drugs with known hepatic toxicity,
             etc). Stable doses of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are allowed for inclusion at
             the discretion of the investigator

          -  Have had lymphoma, leukemia, or any malignancy within the past 5 years except for
             basal cell or squamous epithelial carcinomas of the skin that have been resected with
             no evidence of metastatic disease for 3 years
