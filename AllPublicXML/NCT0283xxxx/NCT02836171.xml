    <textblock>
      he primary purpose of this study is to investigate potential pharmacokinetic interaction in
      healthy volunteers when apatinib is administered in combination with itraconazole. Secondary
      objective is evaluating the safety and tolerability of apatinib alone and when
      co-administered with itraconazole.
