  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current scales are not suited to a direct measure for the elderly with cognitive disorders
      and are difficult to handle for the care teams. In this context, a visual analog scale was
      created to answer a single question &quot;How are you feeling now, immediately?&quot; with the help of
      pictograms. This study aims to assess the validity and reliability of the Scale of Well-Being
      Assessment (SIWA) (in french : Echelle d'Evaluation Instantanée du Bien-Etre (EVIBE)) in
      people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between SIWA and an other quality of life scale (Qol-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>the Qol-AD is collected once. (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>In the Qol-Ad, the patient assesses the quality of life (bad / average / good / excellent) on five areas: relationships with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality through 13 questions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stability over time of SIWA</measure>
    <time_frame>The SIWA is collected twice at ten minute intervals (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The SIWA is a visual analogue scale for reporting the status of the patient's well-being at a specific time. On a graduated scale from 0 to 5, the caregiver should position a cursor : position from the left corresponding to the lowest feeling of well, position from the right corresponding to the highest feeling of well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between SIWA and an health scale (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>the EQ-5D is collected once. (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>In the EQ 5D, the patient evaluates his state of health on 5 dimensions: mobility, human autonomy, common activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression based on 3 levels &quot;no problems&quot;, &quot;some problems&quot; and &quot;severe problems&quot;. Then the patient is asked to distinguish his general state of health on an analog scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between SIWA and behavioral and psychological symptom of dementia (BPSD) (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>the NPI is collected once. (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Each of the 12 BPSD (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, excitement, apathy, disinhibition, depression, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite) is evaluated from 0 to 12, depending on its frequency and severity.</description>

    <description>To investigate the scale reliability over time, SIWA are assessed twice, ten minutes apart. To investigate the validity of the tool, SIWA is correlated with another quality of life questionnaire (QoL-AD), a quality of health scale including an analog portion (EQ 5D), and a behavioral disorder scale (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI).</description>
