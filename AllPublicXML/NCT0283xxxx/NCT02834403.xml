  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and efficacy of L-NMMA when combined with
      docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer
      patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two
      dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,
      15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. In the Phase II
      portion of the study, the starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion
      of the study.

      docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer
      patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two

      15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. L-NMMA dose will
      escalate/de-escalate based on DLT occurrence. For the 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg L-NMMA
      doses, docetaxel will be administered at 75 mg/m2. For the 17.5 and 20 mg/kg L-NMMA doses,
      docetaxel will be administered at 100 mg/m2. In the Phase II portion of the study, the
      starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion of the study. Patients will
      receive up to 6 (21-day) cycles of the L-NMMA and docetaxel combination. L-NMMA will be
      administered via 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1-5 of each cycle. Docetaxel will
      be administered via 1-hour IV infusion approximately 15 minutes after the Day 1 L-NMMA
      infusion. For L-NMMA-induced hypertension, amlodipine (10 mg) will be orally administered for
      6 days at each cycle. Amlodipine administration will start 24 hours before the first dose of
      L-NMMA. For docetaxel-induced leukopenia, pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via
      subcutaneous injection approximately 24 hours after every dose of docetaxel.
