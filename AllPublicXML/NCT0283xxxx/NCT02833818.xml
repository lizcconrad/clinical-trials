  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few scientific reports on preterm infants with birth weights between 1500 and
      2000g. Adequate and properly balanced supply of nutrients believed to better growth and
      cognitive development in this patient group, and optimized nutrition is an important part of
      treatment There is a need for more studies that can provide knowledge of growth and weight
      development in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants with a birth weight
      between 1500 and 2000g.

    <textblock>
      There has been little focus, at least there are few scientific reports on preterm infants
      with birth weights between 1500 and 2000g, at least in Norway. Studies have shown the benefit
      of enhanced protein and energy supplements in very low birth weight infants (VLBW, birth
      weight &lt; 1500g), regarding growth and neurodevelopment . Adequate and properly balanced
      supply of nutrients is believed to give better growth and cognitive development in premature
      infants with slightly higher birth weight, i.e between 1500 and 2000g (1). In an intervention
      study of VLBW children at four Norwegian hospitals we found lower supply of energy and
      protein than international recommendations (2). A larger proportion of premature children
      were stunted growth (weight below 10 percentile for age) during hospitalization. Although
      this applies to preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g, this may also be the case
      for larger premature patients.

      More studies that can provide knowledge of growth rate, weight and neurodevelopmental
      outcomes in preterm and small for gestational age (SGA) infants are warranted. This study
      examines those with birth weight between 1500 and 2000g. Overall, this may provide new and
      useful knowledge that can help to optimize the nutrition to preterm and SGA infants with a
      this range of birth weights
