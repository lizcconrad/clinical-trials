      Project summary

      Rationale

      Many NICU's replace their feeding tubes once a week or more rarely in order to avoid
      disturbing the infants. The researchers discovered that there are high concentrations of
      potentially pathogenic bacteria in the yield of resident nasogastric feeding tubes, even
      within one day of use (own data, manuscript submitted). Preterm infants are vulnerable to the
      colonization of the gut, and development of dysbiosis might lead to necrotizing
      enterocolitis. The researchers speculate if replacing the resident feeding tube every day and
      thereby decreasing the amount of potentially pathogenic bacteria given to the infants via the
      feeding tube will lead to fewer bacteria present in the upper part of the gastrointestinal
      tract of the infant and hence a reduced competition with probiotic colonization.

      Objectives

      The investigators plan to conduct an intervention study in premature infants receiving
      probiotics (&lt; 32 weeks of gestation) where the feeding tube will be replaced every day in the
      intervention group and once a week (standard practice) in the control group. The main outcome
      will be bacterial concentration in the stomach after one week of life.

      Methods

      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial in preterm infants. Infants will be
      randomized to the intervention group in which the tube is replaced every day or the control
      group which will follow normal practice in the department. The intervention will last one
      week. The infants will be followed until discharge. The investigators plan to include 11
      infants in each group.

      Primary outcome

      Concentration of bacteria in gastric aspirates on day seven.
