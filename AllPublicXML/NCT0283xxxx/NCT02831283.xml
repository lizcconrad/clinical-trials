  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about inflammation and amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. A
      type of brain scan called a PET scan is used measure 1) inflammation and 2) abnormal
      accumulation of a the amount of a certain protein fragment called beta-amyloid (plaques) in
      the brain. These are thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will
      also perform brain MRI and do tests to measure the participants' memory and thinking.

      This study is being done to determine the relationship between inflammation, cognitive
      impairment, and amyloid burden in elderly subjects with different clinical and biomarker
      profiles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants will undergo amyloid PET imaging with
      18F-Florbetaben with target number of completers being 15 amyloid-positive elders with
      impairment, 15 amyloid-positive elders with normal cognition, 15 amyloid-negative elders with
      impairment, and 15 amyloid-negative elders with normal cognition. Subjects will undergo
      screen that includes neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and PET imaging with
      18F-florbetaben to define the above 4 groups. Subjects will have 11C-PBR28 PET imaging to
      measure the 18 kDa translocator protein (a marker of inflammation). Subjects will have the
      option to have lumbar puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of amyloid,tau,
      phospho-tau, and inflammatory markers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 60 and older.

          2. Meet criteria for either a) amnestic mild cognitive impairment (single or mixed
             domain) or mild Alzheimer's disease, or b) have no cognitive impairment based on
             history, exam, neuropsychological testing, and consensus diagnosis. MCI and mild AD
             patients must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5 or 1. Unimpaired
             subjects must have Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.

          3. Subjects unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker

          4. Written and oral fluency in English or Spanish.

          5. Able to participate in all scheduled evaluations and to complete all required tests
             and procedures.

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must be considered likely to comply
             with the study protocol and to have a high probability of completing the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past or present history of certain brain disorders other than MCI or AD.

          2. Certain significant medical conditions, which make study procedures of the current
             study unsafe.

          3. Contraindication to MRI scanning.

          4. Conditions precluding entry into the scanners (e.g., morbid obesity, claustrophobia,
             etc.).

          5. Exposure to research related radiation in the past year that, when combined with this
             study, would place subjects above the allowable limits.

          6. Low affinity binding on TSPO genetic screen.

          7. Participation in the last year in a clinical trial for a disease modifying drug for
             AD.

          8. Inability to have a catheter in subject's vein for the injection of radioligand.

          9. Inability to have blood drawn from subject's veins.
