    <textblock>
      The aim of this explorative trial is to verify the comparability of a fractionated intensity
      modulated radiotherapy with a conventional radiotherapy related to quality of life on the one
      hand and to evaluate toxicity, re-calcification and stability of vertebral body as well as
      pain relief and local response for palliative patients with painful spinal bone metastases on
      the other hand. This is a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial with
      parallel-group design to determine the quality of life after RT in patients with spinal bone
      metastases. Two different techniques were evaluated: intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
      and fractionated conventional external beam RT with 10×3 Gy each.

      Experimental intervention:

      IMRT 10 x 3 Gy

      Control intervention:

      3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy

      Experimental intervention:

      IMRT 10 x 3 Gy

      Control intervention:

      3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy After the baseline measurements have been recorded, the patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two groups: IMRT 10×3 Gy (n = 30) or fractionated
      conventional 3D-RT 10×3 Gy (n = 30). The RT will be applied daily (mondy to Friday).

      Follow-up per patient:

      The target parameters will be measured and recorded at baseline, at the end of RT (t1), and
      at 12 weeks (t2) and 6 months (t3) after the end of the irradiation period.
