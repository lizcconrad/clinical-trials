    <textblock>
      Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the risk of RAO, including anticoagulation,
      immediate postprocedural sheath removal, and a small sheath/radial artery ratio. Doppler
      ultrasound examination showed that interrupted blood flow in RA tend to occur in the proximal
      end rather than distal part of the artery,which was ignored by a majority of interventional
      cardiologists. Different insights into occlusion location may lead to different options of
      sheath materials, models, catheters and puncture access. Thus, the investigators designed
      this present study to explore the reason of radial artery endothelial dysfuction and damage
      and occlusion location by ﬂow-mediated dilation (FMD) to determine the suitable method to
      reduce occlusion risk during TRI.
