      This study will examine how abstinence-induced brain changes contribute to smoking cessation
      outcomes in treatment-seeking smokers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of mortality and a significant economic burden.
      Even with the best available treatments, most smokers relapse within days or weeks after a
      quit attempt. Nicotine replacement therapy, the most widely used pharmacotherapy, yields end
      of treatment quit rates of &lt;25% suggesting that managing nicotine withdrawal is not
      sufficient. To improve quit rates significantly, a more refined mechanistic understanding is
      needed. Neuroimaging can identify mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report
      and behavioral measures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show that brief
      (e.g., 24 hr.) abstinence from smoking produces working memory deficits associated with
      reduced neural activity in cognitive control circuits and weakened resting state functional
      connectivity. Neural reactivity to smoking cues also increases risk of relapse, and
      psychological stress can enhance neural responses to smoking cues and increase smoking
      intensity. This study will examine how abstinence-induced brain changes contribute to
      clinical outcomes in treatment-seeking smokers. Using a validated fMRI abstinence challenge
      paradigm, 200 treatment-seeking smokers will complete two 1-hour pre-treatment fMRI scans:
      after smoking satiety and after 24 hours of confirmed abstinence. The investigators will
      examine brain responses during performance of tasks probing working memory, cue reactivity,
      and stress response as well as resting state functional connectivity. Participants will then
      set a target quit date, receive smoking cessation counseling, and be monitored for 6 months
      to assess time to relapse using a validated smoking relapse protocol.

    <measure>Days to relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after target quit date</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the number of days to relapse following the target quit date. Relapse will be confirmed using a conventional SRNT guideline criterion of either a positive biochemical verification of smoking or 7 consecutive days of smoking based on self-report (it is very unlikely that a subject would meet the latter criterion without also meeting the former, given the long half-life of cotinine). The days to relapse will be based upon time from target quit date to the first day of the relapse period. Self-reported daily smoking data will be collected using a validated timeline follow-back method. Self-reported abstinence will be biochemically verified on a weekly basis using urine cotinine (&lt;100ng/ml) and a CO reading of â‰¤5PPM. Drop-outs will be considered relapsers following the last date of abstinence data provided.</description>

    <description>Participants will discuss reasons for quitting, the model of smoking as a learned habit, triggers for smoking, and trigger management; receive brief training in how to manage withdrawal symptoms and relapse prevention counseling and receive the NCI Clearing the Air self-help smoking cessation booklet. The target quit date (TQD) session will be scheduled to occur up to 2 weeks following the pre-quit session. Participants will then meet with a smoking cessation counselor for a 15 minute booster counseling session. During the first week following TQD there will be two monitoring visits to closely monitor abstinence. Weekly thereafter for four weeks, participants will attend a brief booster counseling session.</description>
