    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to estimate the real-world safety profile of Eliquis
      in Japanese Venous Thromboembolism patients and to estimate the risk factors likely to affect
      the incidence of bleeding. Lastly, the secondary objective of this study is to estimate the
      real-world effectiveness profile of Eliquis in Japanese Venous Thromboembolism patients.
