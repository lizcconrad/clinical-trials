  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the USECARE project is to improve and test SENACA, an ICT-based self-management
      support system for chronically ill patients and informal caregivers. 60 end-users will be
      instructed to use SENACA for approx. 3 months (in Israel and Norway). Amongst others,
      clinical and behavioural outcomes will be recorded. Additionally, SENACA's usability will be
      evaluated to determine its potential future scalability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, SENior health ACAdemy (SENACA, www.senaca.ch) has been developed by the
      European Medical Network EMN.

      SENACA is a structured self-management support system with several interacting components,
      combining tele-monitoring devices and a solution for personalised health plans. This online
      support system's usability, the behaviour change techniques it builds on, modes of delivery
      and its effects on health-related behaviour, clinical and Quality-of-Life outcomes will be
      established in a larger group of end-users.

      Testing the usability of SENACA and practical effectiveness of this intervention is the goal
      of this multi-national project USECARE (www.usecare.eu).

      SENACA will be implemented in two countries (Israel and Norway ) via field test with
      community-dwelling older adults living with chronic conditions (i.e. diabetes, COPD, chronic
      heart failure) and their informal caregivers.

      Key element of USECARE is a field-test including a study based upon pre-experimental design
      with three time point measurements and a pre-usability round. Multiple methods will be used
      to evaluate the usability and to observe clinical and process parameters before, during and
      after the implementation of the enhanced SENACA prototype.

      All of the results combined will provide an insight into the end-user experience, usage
      pattern, usability perception and potential added value of the enhanced SENACA prototype for
      chronic disease management in the participating countries.

    <description>Technology acceptance (usability) of system is measured by assessing participants' intention to use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, technology experience, preference in using technology, errors, and user satisfaction. Instruments used are: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), all self-reported questionnaires. In addition, system errors will be reported (number and type of problems).</description>
