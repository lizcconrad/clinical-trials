      An Open-Label, 2-Period, Fixed Sequence Study to Determine the Effect of Multiple Oral Doses
      of Itraconazole on the Single Dose Pharmacokinetics of AG 120 in Healthy Adult Subjects.
      Period 1 consists of a single oral dose of AG-120 will be administered at Hour 0 followed by
      PK sampling for 504 hours (21 days). In Period 2, multiple oral doses of itraconazole will be
      administered once daily (QD) for 18 consecutive days with a single oral dose of AG-120
      coadministered at Hour 0 on Day 1. PK sampling for AG-120 will be taken for 504 hours (21
      days) following AG-120 dosing on Day 1.

                  chemical (e.g., spermicide) barrier method from the time of screening and
                  throughout the study.

               -  surgical sterilization of the partner (vasectomy for 4 months minimum the first
                  dose/dosing) and with either a physical (e.g. condom, diaphragm, or other) or a

             been performed 4 months or more prior to first dose of study drug. A male who has been
             vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study first dose must follow the same
             restrictions as a non vasectomized male).

                  permitted during the study.

               -  Any drugs known to be significant inducers of CYP enzymes and/or P gp, including
                  St. John's Wort, for 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.
                  Appropriate sources will be consulted by the PI or designee to confirm lack of
