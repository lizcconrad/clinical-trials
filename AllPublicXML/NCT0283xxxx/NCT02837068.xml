  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether wheelchair handrail compensator plus
      rehabilitation training could do better than ordinary wheelchair plus rehabilitation training
      in relieving pain and improving daily life activity, upper limb motor function and quality of
      life for patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain.

    <textblock>
      The ideal management of hemiplegic shoulder pain(HSP) is prevention,and a normal limb
      position is necessary for preventing and reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain.The foam or board
      supports has been used to prevent shoulder pain and could be recommended for wheelchair users
      to keep normal position. Therefore, the investigators designed the equipment wheelchair
      handrail compensator and expected to help paralyzed limbs to maintain a normal position.Using
      of the wheelchair handrail compensator may help patients achieve: pain relieve, improvement
      of upper limb function and increase of the quality of life.The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effect of treatment by wheelchair handrail compensator and rehabilitation
      training for people with hemiplegic shoulder pain.

    <measure>Change of Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale (UE-FM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>0-66, with higher scores indicating higher function of movement.UE-FM was a well-established stroke motor measure, iteratively determining active movement at each joint of the upper extremity. The UE-FM items were organized into scales that discern isolated movements at increasingly distal upper extremity regions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of shoulder pain is measured using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) from baseline at 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>0-10, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of pain.The VAS was commonly used in pain assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Modified Barthel Index (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of independence is measured using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) from baseline at 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>0-100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of independence.The Barthel Index (BI) score is a 10-item measure of activities of daily living. It has been proved that the BI has excellent inter-rater reliability for standard administration after stroke. The MBI, modified from BI by Shah, is more sensitive to small changes in functional assessment than the BI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Quality of Life Index (QLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of quality of life is measured using the Quality of Life Index (QLI) from baseline at 4 and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>0-5, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life. The QLI is a generic measure for the evaluation of quality of life (QOL) that was initially used in patients with chronic diseases or pain. It has reported that QLI have good reliability and validity in measuring pain disorder.</description>

    <description>Patients were treated by wheelchair handrail compensator for six times per week during the four-weeks treatment, with each treatment lasting at least 60 minutes, and follow up by eight weeks. The handrail compensator would help the paralysis upper limb kept the shoulder joint stretch forward, the elbow joint extend, the forearm in pronation, the wrist in flection and the fingers extend.</description>

    <description>Patients were treated by ordinary wheelchair for six times per week during the four-weeks treatment, with each treatment lasting at least 60 minutes, and follow up by eight weeks.The ordinary handrail could prevent the disable arm from sinking, but could not help the upper limp keep a normal position.</description>
