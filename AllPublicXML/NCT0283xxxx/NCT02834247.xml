  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and efficacy of TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab in
      participants with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested is TAK-659.This study will look at the determination of the MTD/RP2D
      and efficacy measured by ORR in participants who take TAK-659 in combination with nivolumab.
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part 1), a potential nivolumab fixed dose
      cohort, and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants, approximately 9-12 in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 36 in each of the 3 dose expansion cohorts. Participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

        -  Part 1: Advanced Solid Tumors

        -  Potential Nivolumab Fixed Dose Cohort

        -  Part 2: Metastatic TNBC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic NSCLC

        -  Part 2: Metastatic HNSCC

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets of TAK-659 at the same time each day
      throughout the study. Participants will also receive intravenous infusion of nivolumab
      (within 30 minutes after the TAK-650 dose) once every 2 weeks. This multi-center trial will
      be conducted globally. The overall time to receive treatment in this study is approximately
      12 months. Participants will be assessed for disease response and PD during the PFS follow-up
      of 6 months (for participants who discontinue due to reasons other than PD) and OS follow-up
      of 12 months from the last dose of study drug.

    <description>After RP2D of TAK-659 has been identified, based on evaluation of combination with weight-based dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg), RP2D may be evaluated in combination with a fixed dose of 240 mg IV nivolumab after discussion between investigator and sponsor for all types of advanced solid tumors. For single-agent nivolumab, fixed dose is expected to have equal exposure, safety, and efficacy as weight-based (3 mg/kg) dose. If nivolumab fixed dose is evaluated with TAK-659 RP2D, 3 participants will be initially enrolled into cohort. Following evaluation of safety, efficacy, and any available PK data, along with discussions between investigator and sponsor, 3 additional participants may be enrolled into cohort for a total of 3 to 6 participants. If &gt;=1 out of 6 participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1, or significant safety issues are seen in Cycle 2 and beyond, re-evaluation of TAK-659 RP2D when administered with a fixed dose of nivolumab is permitted.</description>

A subset of participants will receive two weeks of TAK-659 monotherapy during Cycle 1, and will receive nivolumab beginning on Day 15 of Cycle 1. The dose of nivolumab will be either 3 mg/kg or 240 mg IV, dependent on whether the 240 mg fixed-dose cohort is evaluated and deemed safe and tolerable.

                  participants); adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a
                  metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required. Mandatory biopsies
                  will be taken before TAK-659 monotherapy, after the 2 weeks of TAK-659
                  monotherapy, and after 6 weeks of TAK-659 plus nivolumab combination therapy. An
                  optional biopsy may be taken at progression with additional consent from the
                  participants.

         11. To be enrolled in the HNSCC expansion cohort, participants must have:

               -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (oral cavity, pharynx, or
                  larynx) that is stage III/IV and not amenable to local therapy with curative
                  intent (surgery or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy).

               -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of
                  unknown primary or nonsquamous histologies (example, mucosal melanoma) are not
                  allowed.

               -  Histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx is
                  allowed, but these participants will not be included as response-evaluable
                  participants for efficacy analysis of HNSCC.

               -  Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1.

                  platinum-based therapy in the adjuvant (that is, with radiation after surgery),
                  primary (that is, with radiation), recurrent, or metastatic setting.

               -  Safely accessible tumor lesions (based on investigator's assessment) for serial
                  pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies are required for participants receiving
                  TAK-659 monotherapy run-in treatment for 2 weeks followed by TAK-659 plus
                  nivolumab combination treatment (approximately 10/30 response-evaluable
                  participants); adequate, newly obtained, core or excisional biopsy of a
                  metastatic tumor lesion not previously irradiated is required. Mandatory biopsies
                  will be taken before TAK-659 monotherapy, after the 2 weeks of TAK-659
                  monotherapy, and TAK-659 after 6 weeks of TAK-659 plus nivolumab combination
                  therapy. An optional biopsy may be taken at progression with additional consent
                  from the participants.
