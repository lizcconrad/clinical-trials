  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common diseases especially in aged
      women that frequently cause urogenital infection, voiding difficulty, urinary retention,
      pelvic pain, constipation, and coital difficulty, as well as impact the quality of life of
      women. Risk factors of the above diseases include pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and menopausal
      status. Despite playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the above diseases, the
      urogenital skeletal muscular dysfunction cannot be fully corrected via the current treatment
      modalities.

      The human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a prime candidate cell type for
      current research and future cell therapy because of their significant self-renewal,
      differentiation potential and the relative lack of ethical conflict. With the advent of
      efficient technology of reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into hiPSCs,
      researchers can generate personalized lines of cells from which it will be possible to obtain
      differentiated cells in a less invasive way, introducing opportunities in treating diseases
      that are now considered incurable.

      Until very recently, little success has been achieved in terms of skeletal muscle
      differentiation from hiPSCs. The purpose of this study is to explore the applicability of the
      differentiation into skeletal muscle progenitor cells from hiPSC cell lines and the
      associated biomolecular messages. It is anticipated that the derived skeletal muscle
      progenitor cells can be reprogrammed from PBMCs of female patients with urinary incontinence
      and/or pelvic organ prolapse and used in preclinical testing for relieving female urogenital
      problems.
