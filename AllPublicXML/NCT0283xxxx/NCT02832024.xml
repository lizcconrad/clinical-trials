    <measure>12-month Primary Patency Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary patency is defined as no significant reduction of flow detectable by Duplex ultrasound through the index lesion and no further clinically driven target vessel revascularization performed in the interim. Significant reduction of flow is binary restenosis defined as the diameter stenosis &gt;50% with a peak systolic velocity ratio &gt;2.4 as measured by Duplex ultrasound.</description>

    <measure>Major Adverse Events at 12-month Post Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Major adverse events included death, index limb ischemia, index limb amputation, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and significant embolic events, which were defined as causing end-organ damage.</description>
