  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors, as a group, are extremely inactive and this has serious consequences for
      them, including an increased risk of a second stroke and developing other diseases. This
      study investigates a novel intervention designed to improve everyday activity after stroke by
      combining walking training to improve walking capacity with a program to encourage more daily
      walking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a group, stroke survivors are more physically inactive than even the most sedentary older
      adults. Lack of physical activity has serious consequences in persons with stroke, including
      an increased risk of recurrent stroke, developing other diseases and mortality. Current
      rehabilitation interventions do little to improve real-world walking activity after stroke,
      suggesting that simply improving walking capacity is not sufficient for improving daily
      physical activity after stroke. Rather, the investigator's hypothesize that the combination
      of a fast walking intervention that improves walking capacity, with a step activity
      monitoring program that facilitates translation of gains from the clinic to the &quot;real-world&quot;,
      would generate greater improvements in real world walking activity than with either
      intervention alone. Data from the investigator's lab provides support for this hypothesis;
      however, it suggests that the greater efficacy of combining the 2 interventions depends on a
      participant's initial walking activity. Thus, the investigator's do not expect that one
      intervention will be superior to the others for all participants, but rather that the
      combined intervention will be superior for those with low levels of baseline walking
      activity, speed and endurance. The specific objective of this study is to test whether and
      for whom combining fast walking training with a step activity monitoring program (FAST+SAM)
      is superior in improving real-world walking activity compared to fast walking training alone
      (FAST) or a step activity monitoring and feedback program alone (SAM) in those with chronic
      stroke. Using a randomized controlled experimental design, 225 chronic (&gt; 6 months) stroke
      survivors, will complete 12 weeks of fast walking training (FAST), a step activity monitoring
      program (SAM) or a fast walking training + step activity monitoring program (FAST+SAM).
      Moderation of specific intervention outcomes by baseline characteristics will be evaluated to
      determine for whom the interventions are effective.
