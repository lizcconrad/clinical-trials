  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of study drugs called
      selinexor (KPT-330) and ixazomib (MLN9708) with a low dose of dexamethasone. This study tests
      different doses of the study drug, selinexor to see which dose is safer in people. Depending
      on which group (dose level) you are in, the dose of selinexor will vary, but the ixazomib and
      dexamethasone doses will be the same among the groups.

    <description>Patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM will be treated with ixazomib, selinexor, and dexamethasone, all of which will be administered orally.Ixazomib will be given on Days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28 day cycle.
Selinexor will be given twice weekly for three weeks, then there will be 1 week off (Days 1,3, 8,10, 15, 17) This study will follow a 3-by-3 dose escalation design.
Dexamethasone will be given on all days of Selinexor but will also be given on the week off from Selinexor (Days 1, 3, 8, 10,15, 17, 22, 24).</description>
