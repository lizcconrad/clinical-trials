    <textblock>
      The rate of success 12 months after surgery is reported to be 60-65% in patients with lumbar
      disc herniation and 60-70% in patients with spinal stenosis.

      At the Back Center Copenhagen, patients with persistent low back pain caused by lumbar disc
      herniation and spinal stenosis are treated by a multidisciplinary team comprising
      rheumatologists, physiotherapists, chiropractors, and social workers according to current
      guidelines. Therefore we have a unique opportunity to report the long term outcome in
      candidates for surgery, regardless of whether they have surgery or not, after having received
      optimal but unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to answer the following questions: 1) What is the proportion of
      patients operated upon after referral to surgical evaluation with positive MRI findings,
      persistent low back pain, and poor outcome following non-operative treatment? 2) What was the
      outcome in these patients 2 years following referral? 3) Where any baseline variables
      predictive of good or poor postsurgical outcome? 4) Where there any difference in outcome in
      patients with or without surgery?
