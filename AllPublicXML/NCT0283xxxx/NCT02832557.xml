      The goal of this study is to identify miRNAs that are at increased or decreased levels in the
      saliva of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay and would be
      useful biomarkers for the screening of toddlers and young children for ASD. These biomarkers
      may allow earlier diagnosis of autism, allowing earlier service, and also help us to
      understand some of the changes in the brains of autistic children.

      The central aim of this project is to characterize the expression of microRNA (miRNA) in the
      saliva of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In 2012 the CDC reported that the
      prevalence of ASD in U.S. children was 1 in 88. Yet, the biological causes, diagnosis, and
      treatment of this disease remain ambiguous. Recent research suggests that certain factors
      that regulate gene expression may play a role in ASD. To investigate this possibility we plan
      to measure small molecules called miRNAs in the saliva of children with ASD. Studies on
      miRNAs have shown that they can be extruded from neurons as extracellular signaling molecules
      and this knowledge provides a new approach for examining the genetic regulation of the
      central nervous system.

      In this study we are measuring the expression of extracellular miRNA in children with ASD.
      Levels of miRNA from saliva will be compared to those of normally developing controls. The
      goal of this research will be to provide possible biomarkers for diagnostic screening of ASD
      and identify genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in ASD.

      The primary endpoints of this study are as follows:

        1. Characterization of miRNA in the saliva of children with ASD and normally developing
           control children from two to six years of age.

        2. Identification of miRNAs in saliva that are predictive of ASD diagnosis and severity of
           symptoms.

      Secondary endpoints are the identification of miRNA expression patterns that correlate with
      ASD symptom severity measured with standardized neuropsychologic testing.

        The study will compare salivary miRNA in 2 groups of children between the ages of 2 years,
        0 months and 6 years, 11 months of age:

        Group 1: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria and
        confirmed with ADOS-2, or another semi-structured evaluation measure. ASD should not be
        attributable to an underlying genetic cause, and participants should not have a history of
        extreme pre-term birth or underlying neurological disorders such as seizures or cerebral
        palsy.

        Group 2: Healthy controls, meeting developmental milestones, with negative MCHAT-R
        screening and no family history of autism in first degree relatives
