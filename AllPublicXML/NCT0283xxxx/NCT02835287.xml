      The overall objective of the proposed cluster randomized trial is to test whether
      implementation of protocol-based integrated care will improve CVD risk factors (glycated
      hemoglobin [HbA1C], systolic blood pressure [SBP], and LDL-cholesterol) over 18 months and
      reduce major CVD events (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalized
      heart failure, and CVD mortality) over 3 years among patients with type 2 diabetes and
      additional CVD risk factors or clinical CVD compared to usual care in community clinics in
      Xiamen, China.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in China. Most patients with diabetes have multiple
      uncontrolled cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors due to suboptimal care, especially in
      underserved populations. The overall objective of the proposed cluster randomized trial is to
      test whether implementation of protocol-based integrated care will improve CVD risk factors
      (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C], systolic blood pressure [SBP], and LDL-cholesterol) over 18
      months and reduce major CVD events (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction,
      hospitalized heart failure, and CVD mortality) over 3 years among patients with type 2
      diabetes and additional CVD risk factors or clinical CVD compared to usual care in community
      clinics in Xiamen, China. The protocol-based integrated care, which will provide a
      standardized, combined, multi-component intervention according to clinical guideline
      treatment algorithms for diabetes and comorbidities in community clinics, will be delivered
      by trained primary care physicians, health managers, and nurses supported by diabetes
      specialists. The proposed trial will recruit 11,780 patients with diabetes and additional CVD
      risk factors or clinical CVD from 38 community-based primary care clinics (community health
      service centers) in Xiamen, China. Nineteen community clinics with approximately 310
      participants each will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and 19 community
      clinics with similar participants to the control group matched by administrative district and
      socioeconomic status. The protocol-based integrated care intervention will last for 36
      months. HbA1C, BP, LDL-cholesterol, other variables, and co-morbidities will be measured at
      baseline and follow-up visits at months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36. In phase 1 (during the
      first 18-month intervention), the primary outcome is the difference in the combined changes
      in HbA1C, SBP, and LDL-cholesterol levels between intervention and control groups,
      simultaneously modeled using a scaled marginal model which allows estimation of a single
      overall treatment effect. In phase 2 (during the three-year intervention), the primary
      outcome is the difference in major CVD incidence (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, hospitalized heart failure, and CVD mortality) between intervention and control
      groups. The secondary outcomes include: (1) the net changes in HbA1C, SBP, and
      LDL-cholesterol individually; (2) estimated 10-year risk of CVD; (3) the proportion of
      participants with HbA1C &lt;7% (or &lt;7.5% if with clinical CVD), BP &lt;140/90 mm Hg, and
      LDL-cholesterol &lt;100 mg/dL; (4) health-related quality of life; and (5) cost-effectiveness of
      intervention over three years. The proposed trial is designed to provide 90% statistical
      power to detect a 3.6% reduction in the combined changes in HbA1C, SBP, and LDL-cholesterol
      levels in phase 1 and a 20% reduction in major CVD (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, hospitalized heart failure, and CVD mortality) in phase 2 at a significance level
      of 0.05 for a two-sided test. This will be the first randomized cluster trial to test the
      implementation of a protocol-based integrated care program on multiple CVD risk factors and
      CVD events in diabetes patients who receive care from community clinics in China. This
      implementation research project has a high impact in public health because it will generate
      urgently needed data on an effective, practical, and sustainable intervention program aimed
      at reducing the CVD burden among diabetes patients in middle- and low-income countries.
