  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the agreement between intraocular pressure (IOP)
      measurements taken by iCare, held in both vertical and horizontal positions. In addition,
      iCare measurements will be compared against pneumotonometry measurements to assess for
      accuracy.
