  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type II glycogen-storage disease (Pompe disease) varies depending on
      ethnicity and geographic region. As of 2010, nine studies have been published documenting the
      incidence of Pompe disease. It is most common within the African American population, with an
      incidence of 1 in 14,000. In the U.S. more broadly speaking, the combined incidence of all
      three variants of the disease is 1 in 40,000. These estimates relied on the frequencies of
      three mutations in the gene acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to variants of the disease.
      Criteria for inclusion in the studies were often non-selective; in many cases, molecular
      genetic screening was done at birth. With such a high prevalence of Pompe disease reported,
      it is expected that large university medical centers specializing in neuromuscular diseases
      would see a higher incidence of Pompe disease among their patients. From a comparable Italian
      multicenter study, it appears that Pompe disease accounts for 3% of all patients presenting
      with proximal weakness with or without CK elevation.

      This study will measure the incidence of Pompe disease based on manifest laboratory
      abnormality, namely low GAA enzyme activity. Analysis of GAA enzyme activity will be
      determined through a blood sample of 4 mL. The study seeks to measure the epidemiology of
      Pompe disease by symptomatically screening all patients who present with symptoms of hitherto
      undiagnosed proximal weakness with or without elevation of the muscle enzyme, creatinine
      kinase (CK), or elevation of CK alone, at thirteen academic tertiary neuromuscular practices
      throughout the United States and Canada. Total recruitment is expected to be ~1,500
      participants. It is anticipated that the number of incident Pompe cases in this cohort would
      be between 3-5%, i.e. 45-75 newly diagnosed cases of Pompe disease.
