  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2, multiple-cohort, randomized, open-label, international study of
      talazoparib (a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor) is to compare the efficacy and
      safety of talazoparib monotherapy and talazoparib plus temozolomide in women with relapsed
      ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women ≥ 18 years of age and willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Relapsed, histologically confirmed ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.
             Histologic subtypes include serous, endometrioid, clear-cell, mixed, undifferentiated
             histology, and carcinosarcoma.

          -  Sufficient archival tumor tissue available or consent to a fresh tissue biopsy for
             biomarker analysis. Consent to blood sample collection for biomarker analysis is
             required.

          -  Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 during or after the last treatment. Have metastatic
             disease with at least 1 target tumor lesion measurable per RECIST 1.1 on the screening
             scan. Lesions used for biopsies cannot be designated as a measurable lesion for RECIST
             1.1 assessments.

          -  Additional criteria for cohort 1 include the following:

          -  Have a deleterious germline or a somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, or a high diagnostic
             HRD test score (myChoice score ≥ 42), which represents a loss of DNA repair function
             based on testing performed at a sponsor-approved laboratory

          -  Received at least 1 and no more than 3 platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (prior
             bevacizumab is allowed) and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before randomization

          -  No prior PARP inhibitor treatment (COHORT 1 ONLY)

          -  Additional criteria for cohorts 2 and 3 include the following:

          -  Received at least 2 platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (including first-line
             chemotherapy; prior bevacizumab is allowed) and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before
             randomization

          -  Received prior PARP inhibitor treatment as a single agent or in combination therapy
             regimen and the last dose is ≥ 28 days before randomization, as follows:

          -  For cohort 2 only: Received PARP inhibitor treatment for ≥ 6 months and had a response
             of CR, PR, or stable disease for ≥ 6 months

          -  For cohort 3 only: Received PARP inhibitor treatment for &lt; 6 months with no response
             (disease progression or stable disease)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          -  Able to swallow drugs, have no known intolerance to study drugs or excipients, and
             able to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have not recovered (recovery is defined as National Cancer Institute Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≤ 1) from the acute toxicities
             of previous therapy, except treatment-related alopecia or laboratory abnormalities
             otherwise meeting eligibility requirements.

          -  Use of any investigational agent within 14 days before randomization.

          -  Had &gt; 2 paracentesis procedures within 28 days before randomization.

          -  Major surgery within 14 days before randomization.

          -  Requirement for intravenous alimentation (at the time of randomization).

          -  Diagnosis of MDS.
