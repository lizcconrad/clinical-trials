      Context: Cesarean section is the most common surgery in women, both in developed and
      underdeveloped countries. However results are conflicting report in which material for
      intradermal suturing get better aesthetic result. Objective: To compare the aesthetic
      appearance of two suture materials, polyglecaprone 25 and polyamide (nylon) with intradermal
      sutures for skin closure in women undergoing cesarean section first. Methods: This is a
      clinical, prospective and randomized study which was conducted in the Department of
      Gynecology and Obstetrics of a tertiary Institute, Hospital das Clinicas Samuel Libânio, in
      PousoAlegre, Estate of Minas Gerais. Sixty women undergoing cesarean section were first
      included and randomized into two groups: group I (n = 30) polyamide and group II (n = 30)
      polyglecaprone 25. Hypertrophy, color and width of the wound were evaluated, receiving a
      score, according to Trimbos table, six months after surgery. Later the results were compared
      to non-parametric statistical tests
