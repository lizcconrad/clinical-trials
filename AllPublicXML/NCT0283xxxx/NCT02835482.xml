    <textblock>
      The use of the femtosecond laser causes an increase in the intraocular pressure (IOP) between
      100 mm Hg and 200 mm Hg for a period of about 80 seconds (suction phase).

      If it is known that elevated IOP accelerates the degradation of retinal ganglion cells, whose
      axons form the optic nerve.

      No data has been published to date on potential adverse effects of femtolaser cataract
      surgery performed in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

      Since some time, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT) provides a detailed
      analysis of ganglion cell complex (GCC) for which the loss is a marker of glaucomatous optic
      neuropathy. The resolution of this device, about a few microns, can detect even a tiny loss
      of this layer.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the effects of elevated intraocular pressure in
      glaucoma patients undergoing femtolaser cataract surgery, studying the GCC through SD-OCT.
