    <textblock>
      This study explores the use of KBP-5074 in patients with advanced stages of Chronic Kidney
      Disease (CKD) (including patients with severe renal impairment and those on hemodialysis
      [HD]) and to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of
      KBP-5074 in male and female patients with severe CKD (defined as estimated glomerular
      filtration rate [eGFR] ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2, based on the Modification
      of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) and a subset of patients requiring HD.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, 2-part study designed to assess the PK, safety,
      and tolerability of KBP-5074 in patients undergoing HD and non-HD patients with severe CKD
      (defined using the eGFR ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the MDRD
      equation). The study will be conducted at up to 4 clinical research units (CRUs) in the US.
      Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in the study (a single cohort of 6 patients in
      each of Part 1 and Part 2). Parts 1 and 2 of the study will be conducted in parallel. If Part
      1 is completed prior to the completion of Part 2, or vice versa, the PK, safety, and
      tolerability analyses for the completed study part may proceed as planned and will not be
      delayed based on the timing of the other respective study part.

             requiring HD (Part 2) may continue to receive routine medications (including vitamins,
