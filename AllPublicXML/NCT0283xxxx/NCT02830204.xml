    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and feasibility of the Edwards SAPIEN 3
      valve in subjects with mitral annular calcification (MAC) associated with mitral stenosis
      (MS) and/or mitral regurgitation who are at high-risk for mitral valve surgery or deemed
      inoperable due to the extent of calcification.

             treatment or 30 days prior to procedure with definitive treatment.

          -  A known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation regimens, or
             inability to be maintained on oral anticoagulant following the study procedure.

          -  An estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;30 as calculated using the
