  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of addictive disorders in old age is increasing. Age specific and appropriate
      therapeutic concepts tailored to in-patients thus represent a promising approach for the
      future. The investigated therapeutic intervention is a &quot;therapy program for integrated
      qualified acute treatment of alcohol and drug problems&quot; (TIQAAM).

      The prevalence of addictive disorders in old age is increasing. Age specific and appropriate
      therapeutic concepts tailored to inpatients thus represent a promising approach for the
      future. The investigated therapeutic intervention is a &quot;therapy program for integrated
      qualified acute treatment of alcohol and drug problems&quot; (TIQAAM).

      Subjects ≥ 65 years, in which according to the WHO ASSIST V3.0 a risky consumption of
      alcoholic beverages, or benzodiazepines / non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone,
      zaleplon), or both, are examined before and after a psychotherapeutic intervention during
      their inpatient stay exists. The data collected in part 1 of the study pertain to social
      integration, the motivation to change, quality of life in old age, general psychiatric
      symptoms. The data collected in part 2 of the study pertain to brain structure and functions.
      Data from standard procedures will be correlated to the data above.These relate to
      psychiatric symptoms, past consumption behavior, cognitive abilities, perceived social
      support and risk appetite.
