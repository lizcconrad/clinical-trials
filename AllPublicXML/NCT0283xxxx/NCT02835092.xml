  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effects of two commercially available weight loss programs, the TSFL
      and the MEDD programs, each compared to a self-directed control diet, on changes in body
      weight over a 16-week weight loss phase, in apparently healthy overweight and obese men and
      women.
