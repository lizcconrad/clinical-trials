  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to demonstrate that perampanel given as adjunctive
      anti-epileptic treatment is superior to placebo in reducing the number of drop seizures in
      participants with inadequately controlled seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
      (LGS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      perampanel as adjunctive therapy in participants with inadequately controlled seizures
      associated with LGS. The study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization (4 to 8 weeks),
      Randomization (22 weeks), and Extension (56 weeks).
