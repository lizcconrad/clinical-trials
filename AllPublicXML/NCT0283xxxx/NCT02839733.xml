      Background:

      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood motor disability. The neurotransmitter
      dopamine (DA) is important in cognition and emotions/behavior. DA may also be important in
      motor skill learning. Genes that relate to DA function may affect a person s ability to learn
      new cognitive or motor skills. Some children with CP can learn motor skills easily while
      others have trouble. Researchers want to find out if DA gene variations cause some of this
      variability.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about how DA and its related genes affect motor and cognitive learning in
      people with and without CP.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 5 25 with and without CP who can:

      Follow the protocol

      Attend and perform the training sessions

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood draw for genetic tests

      The study has 2 parts. Participants with CP can join both. Those without can join only Part
      1.

      All participants will have a baseline assessment: short motor skills test and blood draw.

      Part 1:

      Two 10-session training programs over 2 weeks. Cognitive training will be 2 sessions at the
      clinic, 8 at home. Participants will perform memory tasks on a computer. All 10 motor
      training sessions are at the clinic. Participants will step on lines in a virtual reality
      environment.

      Part 2:

      Two lab training sessions at least 1 week apart. Participants will perform tasks on a

      computer.

      Participants with CP may have a brain MRI at 1 visit. They will lie on a table that slides
      into a machine that takes pictures. They will be in the scanner about 45 minutes. They may
      have a

      Objective

      The broad objective of this study is to determine the relationship between variations in
      genes related to dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in areas of the brain associated with motor
      leaning (e.g. DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, COMT, DAT) and/or to activity-dependent brain plasticity
      (e.g. BDNF) and differences in motor learning rates and cognitive processing abilities in
      persons with and without cerebral palsy (CP). We hypothesize that individual genetic
      differences will be related to the ability to learn new motor and cognitive skills and may
      thus provide a potential explanation for the often reported response variability to
      rehabilitative therapies seen in CP. We will also explore whether motor and cognitive
      learning abilities are correlated within individuals which could suggest similar underlying
      neural mechanisms. Finally we would like to evaluate the effect of rewards on procedural
      learning in CP, to preliminarily assess how behavioral manipulations of the DA system may
      affect learning across individuals.

      Study Population: A maximum of 100 ambulatory children and young adults with and without CP
      (ages 5-25 inclusive) will be enrolled in this protocol.

      Design: This protocol will consist of two separate but related studies: Study #1 is an
      observational trial whereby subjects with and without CP will participate in two different
      training paradigms, 10 sessions each, one that involves learning novel working memory tasks
      and one that involves motor skill learning in the lower extremities, adapted from the
      horizontal ladder task utilized in rodent studies. All will have blood draws for genetic
      analyses at baseline, the results of which will be related to changes in performance
      (learning) per task after training.

      Study #2 will be a within-subjects evaluation in CP only on the effects of reward (versus
      no-reward) during learning, which is presumed to increase dopamine transmission. Mean and
      individual responses to reward-based learning will be assessed and related to genetic
      variations in dopamine transmission.

      For subjects with CP, we would like to obtain brain MRI but this is optional and if they are
      unable or unwilling to do this portion, they can still participate in this protocol.

      Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes are changes in performance (learning) on each task after
      training which will be related to presence or absence of polymorphisms that have been
      associated with brain plasticity or with deficits in working memory and/or motor learning.
      Individual responses to rewards will also be related to variations related to high versus low
      dopamine transmission in the brain.
