    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of synchronized
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (sTMS) using the NeoSync EEG Synchronized TMS device (NEST)
      in subjects with Bipolar Disorder type I in a Major Depressive Episode. This is an open label
      study in which subjects will receive treatment 5 days per week for 6 weeks.

    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be performed as a baseline and endpoint assessments and efficacy measure. It's considered the gold standard for rating depression severity and used frequently in clinical trials. The MADRS score ranges from 0 to 60; a score of 0-6 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-28) will be done at baseline and endpoint assessments. The HRSD-17 score, derived from the HRSD-28, will be analyzed. The HRSD-17 score ranges from 0-52; a score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.</description>

    <measure>Mean IDS-SR score change (Last Observation Carried Forward)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR) will be performed as a baseline and after every 5 treatments. It's a standardized self-rating scale for depressive symptom severity used in many clinical trials. IDS-SR total score ranges from 0 to 84; a score of 0-13 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or reflect clinical remission), while a score of 26 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean AMRS score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Altman Mania Rating Scale (AMRS) will be performed at baseline and at weekly assessments. It is a self-rating scale for hypomanic/manic symptoms. The AMRS score ranges from 0 to 20; a score of 5 or lower is less likely to be associated with significant symptoms of mania, while a score of 6 or higher indicates a high probability of a manic or hypomanic condition, prompting further clinical evaluation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to qualify
        for enrollment into the study:

          1. 18 - 70 years of age;

          2. DSM-5 primary diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder type 1 (with a documented past manic
             episode), currently in a Major Depressive Episode by diagnostic criteria elicited by
             structured clinical interview (SCID-5-RV);

          3. MADRS score ≥ 20;

          4. Duration of current episode &gt;4 weeks

          5. YMRS score ≤ 12;

          6. baseline EEG of sufficient quality for quantitative analysis processing;

          7. willing and able to adhere to the intensive treatment schedule and all required study
             visits;

          8. currently on adequate dose of mood stabilizer with significant evidence base or FDA
             approval as antimanic or for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder (e.g, valproic
             acid/divalproex, carbamazepine, lithium, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone,
             quetiapine, olanzapine, asenapine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, paliperidone,
             cariprazine).

        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects will be excluded from study participation if one of the
        following exclusion criteria applies:

          1. unable or unwilling to give informed consent;

          2. diagnosed with current primary psychotic disorder (rather than BD);

          3. diagnosed with current mania or hypomanic mood episode;

          4. history of moderate to severe substance use disorder within the past 6 months (except
             nicotine and caffeine);

          5. currently being treated with a stimulant;

          6. clinically defined major neurological disorder; including, but not limited to, seizure
             disorder and history of loss of consciousness due to head injury for greater than 10
             minutes, or with documented evidence of brain injury;

          7. increased risk of seizure for any reason, including diagnosis of increased
             intracranial pressure, comorbid neurological disorder, use of certain medications,
             highly unstable use of alcohol or benzodiazepines;

          8. initiation of new antidepressant treatments (new medication, new device-based
             stimulation, or new psychotherapy) within 6 weeks prior to study baseline;

          9. active suicidal intent or plan as detected on screening assessments, or in the
             Investigator's opinion, is likely to attempt suicide within the next six months;

         10. presence of implanted cardiac pacemakers, implanted medication pumps, or intracardiac
             lines;

         11. intracranial implant (e.g., aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants,
             stents, or electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head (excluding
             the mouth), which cannot be safely removed;

         12. clinically significant unstable medical condition;

             from completion of the study;

         15. for participants in the MRI study: ferromagnetic metal implant or other
             contraindication to imaging in a 3 Tesla MRI;

         16. past treatment with TMS therapy.
