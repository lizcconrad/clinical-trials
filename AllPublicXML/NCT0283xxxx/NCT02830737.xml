  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional RFA treatment has been a curable therapy for small hepatocellular carcinoma
      (diameter≤3cm). This technique ablates the tumor via radio frequency by inserting an
      electrode needle directly into the tumor. This clearly violates no-touch technique based on
      the principle of surgical oncology. Thus the 1-year recurrence rate of the cancer is up to
      30% after the treatment, and the 3-year tumor-free survival rate is only 20% - 40%. No-touch
      RFA treatment avoids the direct contact with the tumor that can cause the spread of cancer
      cells in the liver, or the Antrim spread, Therefore it has been suggested that no-touch RFA
      treatment reduce the recurrence rate after operation in comparison with the traditional RFA
      treatment. This research project aims at using the prospective randomized comparative method
      to compare the short-term and the long-term curative effects between no-touch RFA and
      traditional RFA treatments for small hepatic carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma, according to the postoperative pathological
             examination as the standard, or the diagnostic criteria with reference to the 2012
             American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases if the pathological evidence is
             not available;

          2. A single tumor with a diameter ≤3cm;

          3. The tumor that has not invaded the portal vein, the hepatic vein, or the secondary
             branch;

          4. Liver function classified as Child A or B;

          5. Liver reserve function test with ICG-R15 (indocyanine green retention at 15min) ≤30%,
             and the important organs that can function with the tolerance of RFA or partial
             hepatectomy;

          6. No significant coagulopathy: platelet count &gt; 50,000,000,000 /L, prolonged prothrombin
             time &lt; 5 seconds;

          7. Age 18 - 70 years old;

          8. No acceptance of other anti-cancer therapy before the treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Complication of severe portal hypertension: a history of upper gastrointestinal
             bleeding, a history of severe hypersplenism, or refractory ascites;

          2. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis or lymph node metastasis;

          3. Patients with multiple liver tumors found from imaging exam or during the treatment;

          4. Patients with pathological examinations showing the other tissue type of liver cancer
             after the treatment;

          5. Patients who expect to receive a liver transplant;

          6. Patients whose preoperative imaging exam indicates the tumor close to the gallbladder,
             hilar major blood vessels, bile ducts and surrounding vital organs, with a potential
             of serious injury by mistake or serious complications during the treatment.
