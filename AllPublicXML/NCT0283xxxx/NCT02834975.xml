  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that tumor cell killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy exposes the
      immune system to high levels of tumor antigens.The combination of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and
      Pembrolizumab will invigorate tumor-specific T-cell immunity in this setting by inhibiting
      PD-L1/PD-1 signaling, and may result in deeper and more durable responses compared with
      standard chemotherapy alone.

      This is a single arm, open-label, phase II study to assess pathologic objective response rate
      (complete response + partial response) in patients treated with pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and
      carboplatin for advanced stage III or IV Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Carcinoma
      (EOC).

      Eligible patients will undergo tissue biopsies to confirm diagnosis, followed by 3 to 4
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). NACT will be paclitaxel and carboplatin in
      combination with pembrolizumab. A cycle will consist of pembrolizumab at 200mg (IV),
      paclitaxel 175mg/m2 (IV), and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 or 6, on day 1 every
      21 days. The length of each cycle is 21 days. This regimen will be followed by interval
      debulking surgery (IDS). Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) will consist of 3 to 4 more cycles of
      paclitaxel with carboplatin plus pembrolizumab, once every 21 days. At the discretion of the
      treating physician dose-dense paclitaxel may be administered in the adjuvant setting weekly
      (instead of once q3 weeks) plus carboplatin once q21 days.

             carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of Study treatment and any neurologic

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for this study. If
             subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity
             and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
