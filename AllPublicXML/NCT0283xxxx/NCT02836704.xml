      Primary Objective:

      -To test the hypothesis that higher initial dose of basal insulin (0.3 U/kg) is non inferior
      to standard initial dose (0.2 U/kg) based on the percentage of patients with at least one
      episode of hypoglycemia (≤3.9 mmol/L or severe) during the 16 weeks of treatment in
      overweight and obese type 2 diabetic patients uncontrolled with oral anti-diabetes drugs
      (OADs).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients achieving glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;7%.

        -  To evaluate the percentage and accumulated percentage of patients achieving fasting
           plasma glucose (FPG) target (&lt;5.6, &lt;6.1, and &lt;7.0 mmol/L).

        -  To assess the changes in HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial glucose (PPG).

        -  To evaluate the insulin doses change.

        -  To evaluate the weight change.

        -  To evaluate overall hypoglycemia, nocturnal hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia
           occurrence.

        -  To descriptively evaluate the safety profile.

        -  To assess patient and physician satisfaction and adherence (drop-out rate and the
           percentage of patients who can follow the treatment and insulin titration).

        -  Subgroup analysis on efficacy (control rate, control rate without confirmed
           hypoglycemia, and changes in HbA1c, FPG and PPG) and safety data according to:

        -  Age

        -  Duration of diabetes

        -  Baseline treatment (OAD)

        -  Baseline HbA1c, FPG and PP
