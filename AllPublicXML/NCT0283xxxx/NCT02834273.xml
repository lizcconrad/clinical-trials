  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke are critical in the reduction of
      morbidity, disability and stroke associated mortality Under-education about stroke may
      prevent people from recognizing symptoms early enough to seek immediate care.

      The studies reported on stroke patients managed in stroke center have shown that 39-42% of
      patients could not name any symptoms of stroke and 36% to 43% no risk factor of stroke.

      The stroke patients are therefore a population at high risk for neurological events and
      cardiac vascular recurrence. However, no studies have evaluated the interest of the
      development of therapeutic workshops in stroke unit to educate patients about symptoms
      suggestive of stroke, risk factors and what to do in cases of stroke.

      Investigators assume that the setting up of a therapeutic education workshop in the stroke
      unit may allow a better understanding of the symptoms, risk factors and what to do following
      stroke. So there is a direct benefit to the patient represented by a better knowledge of
      stroke (warning signs, risk factors, what to do), improved treatment compliance and reduced
      risk of recurrence.

      More generally, there is a real benefit to promote these messages to the public through the
      patient and his relatives
