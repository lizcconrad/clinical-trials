  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized study is designed to assess
      the healing effects of AR/101 on chronic Hard-to-Heal wound(s) of different etiologies
      including arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers and venous ulcers, of at least 3 months duration.
      After collection of comprehensive medical data to confirm eligibility of patient and
      obtaining informed consent , patients will enter Screening run-in Period where all wounds
      will be cleaned if necessary by surgical debridement and irrigation (isotonic solution) prior
      to initiation (run-in phase) of the study according to physician's instructions. During the
      14 day screening period, all subjects will receive standard of care (SoC) on a daily basis,
      as per indication and patients status, according to physicians instructions. Wounds will be
      morphologically assessed by the treating physician and by photographic evaluation by the PI
      once a week - at days 7 and 14 of the screening run-in phase. Following the run-in period,
      Subjects with wounds of ≥ 5cm2 and ≤100 cm2 of at least 3 months duration that fail to
      respond to treatment with SoC during the screening run-in phase will be enrolled into the
      study. Eligible subjects with wounds will be randomized and treated topically with AR/101+
      SoC or placebo +SoC once daily for up to 14 days. During this treatment phase I, depending on
      their wound size and wound type, subjects will receive treatment dose applied topically daily
      and wounds will be dressed according to physician's instructions. Wounds will be photographed
      daily and assessed by the treating physician in the clinic once a week (at the end of each
      weekly period). During the treatment period, adverse events and concomitant medications will
      be monitored; wounds will be morphologically assessed by photo documentation and followed for
      wound bed progression and granulation tissue formation. At the end of Treatment period I,
      patient's wounds will be analyzed and all patients from both treatment arms with wound score
      0-2 will be assigned to receive the study drug for and additional up to 14 days treatment
      phase II in full accordance with the treatment regimen described in Treatment phase I. A
      termination visit will be performed at day 14 of Treatment phase I or II or earlier if the
      wound has reached the maximum score on the granulation scale or if the wound is ready for
      skin grafting; or in any case of early withdrawal that is not due to withdrawal of consent.
