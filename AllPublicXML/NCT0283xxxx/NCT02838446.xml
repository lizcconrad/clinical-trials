  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate of the effectiveness of Graded Motor Imagery
      (GMI) on hand functionality in patients with Distal Radius Fracture (DRFx). This study was
      carried out on 36 patients. These patients were randomly assigned to two groups: classic
      treatment group (n=19) and GMI group (n=17). Both groups received a 8-week (2 days a week)
      physical therapy and rehabilitation intervention. Outcome measurements were based on upper
      extremity functional status (Disability of the Arm Shoulder Hand and Michigan Hand
      Questionnaire scores), pain (on the rest and during the activity with Visual Analog Scale),
      range of motion (wrist flexion, extension, ulnar/radial deviation, supination and pronation
      with goniometer), grip strength (standard grip strength with Jamar hydraulic hand
      dynamometer; lateral, palmar and pinch strength with pinch meter).

    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to evaluate pain intensity. The scale was consisted of a standard line labeled 0 on the left and 10 on the right. (0: no pain, 10: the worst pain).</description>
