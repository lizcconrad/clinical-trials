      PhenoDM1 will use patient reported outcomes to assess levels of pain, fatigue and quality of
      life in this cohort. Clinical and functional outcomes will look at muscle wasting and levels
      of myotonia. DNA, RNA, serum and CSF samples will be taken from all patients so that
      additional genetic and molecular biomarker analysis can be carried out. A subset of patients
      will undergo detailed sleep studies along with skeletal muscle MRI of the lower limbs. This
      study will complement the work of other groups currently looking at myotonic dystrophy type 1
      using the same outcomes and measures where possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myotonic Dystrophy type I (DM1) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy,
      affecting 1 in 8000 individuals. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with multisystemic
      involvement of multiple organs and tissues, namely brain, heart, endocrine system, eyes and
      both smooth and skeletal muscles. It results from the CTG expansion of an untranslated region
      3' terminal of the DMPK gene which causes a disturbance of the RNA metabolism, in particular
      defective splicing of various pre-mRNAs such as the muscular chloride channel (causing
      myotonia), the insulin receptor (causing diabetes) and others. We will carry out an in-depth
      characterisation of 400 adult DM1 patients identified from local clinical populations across
      England and through the national DM Registry. Over a two year period we will take
      measurements 12 months apart to address specific symptoms that cause major quality of life
      impairment including muscle weakness, myotonia, excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive
      impairment. DNA samples will be collected in order to determine the CTG repeat length and
      serum samples for biomarker identification. We will carry out muscle MRI and sleep studies in
      a subset of 50 patients. The implemented measures will capitalise on the efforts of previous
      cohort studies ensuring that all measures are comparable with existing datasets.

        Inclusion criteria will be limited to those over 18 years of age, with a genetic
        confirmation of DM1 who are able to provide informed consent. This unrestrictive approach
        will enable assessment of a true cross-section of the population, including those with
        congenital, childhood and adult onset. Two substudies will be open to a subset of patients,
        one assessing muscle through MRI and on focussing on sleep and fatigue. Additional
        restrictions may be in place to ensure the safety of the participants during these studies.

        Informed consent will be obtained from all patients, including detailed patient
        information. Sharing and storage of data and samples will be discussed in this information
        and covered appropriately in the consent.
