  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) has been defined as &quot;a group of permanent disorders of the development of
      movement and posture causing activity limitation(s) that are attributed to non-progressive
      disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain&quot;.

      Investigators previously developed two classification systems, one for the upper limb and one
      for the hand, based on 100 films of patients with cerebral palsy. Separate classifications
      were developed following an initial study in which investigators found no correlations
      between upper limb and hand patterns, meaning that specific upper limb patterns are not
      always associated with specific hand patterns. Thumb patterns were not included in these
      classifications since robust classifications already exist, moreover thumb patterns are
      independent from hand patterns.

      The aim is to evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of two previously developed
      classifications of upper limb and hand patterns.
