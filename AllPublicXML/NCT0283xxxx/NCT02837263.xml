    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is:

        -  To find out how safe the study drug, pembrolizumab, is when combined with stereotactic
           body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the liver.

        -  To see how well subjects can tolerate treatment with pembrolizumab and SBRT.

        -  To find out how often colorectal cancer comes back 1 year after surgically removing all
           known disease and being treated with SBRT and pembrolizumab.

      This is a phase 1b feasibility study to evaluate the use of PD-1 blockade in combination with
      ablative radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). This study
      will examine the sequential combination of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and
      pembrolizumab for patients for whom the goal is eradicating all known sites of disease. It is
      very likely that for many patients the SBRT therapy will be completed following other
      modalities including operative resection or ablation.

Following SBRT, subjects will receive one cycle of pre-operative pembrolizumab given as an IV over approximately 30 minutes. Surgical management to remove all known sites of metastatic disease should occur 2 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment. Approximately 4-8 weeks after surgery subjects will being the second phase of pembrolizumab treatment. They will receive this treatment every 3 weeks (cycle) for 8 more cycles after surgery. Prior to the 5th cycle of pembrolizumab subjects will also have tumor imaging (CT or MRI).</description>
