  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different inhibition suboccipital techniques, usually adjuvant of physiotherapy,
      for treatment of patients with chronic neck pain. In our clinical practice, a favorable
      effect is observed on patients with chronic neck pain, but there are no published studies
      evaluating the results of this techniques on pain, mobility and disability.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if the suboccipital manual techniques, provides
      further improvement in pain intensity, neck disability, range of motion, on patients with
      chronic mechanical neck pain and rotation deficit of the upper cervical spine, being treated
      with physiotherapy. For this purpose, investigators conduct a double-blind (patient and
      evaluator) randomized controlled trial, in a Public Primary Care Center.

      Seventy four subjects will be randomized (computer application) into three groups:
      Mobilization Group, Maintained pressure Group and Control Group. All the three groups receive
      the same protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment during three weeks and, additionally, the
      Mobilization Group receives six sessions (two sessions in a week during three weeks) of
      translational dorsal glide mobilization technique grade III of the atlanto-occipital joint
      and the Maintained pressure Group receives six sessions (two sessions in a week during three
      weeks) of pressure maintained suboccipital Inhibition technique. The Control Group receives
      the protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment only.

      Pain intensity (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Range of motion (CROM), will be measured
      at baseline, after treatment period, and three months after discharge from treatment. After
      discharge for treatment the patient subjective opinion about their evolution will be
      collected through a Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale, and evaluation of headache
      disability (HIT-6).

    <description>Translational dorsal glide mobilization technique grade III of the atlanto-occipital joint, it is a mobilization technique of Orthopedic Manual therapy according to Kaltenborn-Evjenth concept. The aim is to produce a dorsal glide of the occipital on the atlas, which will be held back by the therapist's hand, producing a stretch component of the suboccipital muscles.
And Protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment: Three weeks of daily sessions (five a week) of stretching exercises, thermotherapy and postural education.</description>

    <description>Pressure maintained suboccipital Inhibition technique is aimed to inhibit the tone of the suboccipital muscles. Although some dorsal occipital glide is produced by the weight of the head itself, the main effect is on the muscles due to dorsally pressure is not added to the occipital.
And Protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment: Three weeks of daily sessions (five a week) of stretching exercises, thermotherapy and postural education.</description>
