  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of a motivational online intervention (MOI)
      using pedometers to increase physical activity in a sample of sedentary students. It will be
      compared three conditions: MOI+PEDOMETER condition (access to a MOI and the use of a
      pedometer of new generation); MOI condition (access to a MOI and the use of a blinded
      pedometer); and CONTROL condition (the use of a blinded pedometer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular practice of physical activity (PA) has shown benefits in physical and mental health.
      However, the levels of PA are low in the general population. Pedometers and motivational
      online interventions (MOI) have been used to increase PA levels in sedentary population.

      In spite of finding positive outcomes on PA levels when theoretical constructs derived from
      theories of behavior change and Internet have been used to guide pedometer-based
      interventions, few interventions have incorporated all these variables together and have
      analyzed the short-term or mid-term results.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze the effect of a short self-administered
      Motivational Online Intervention (MOI) using pedometers to increase PA levels (primary
      outcome) and to change different theoretical constructs related to the PA behavior (positive
      decisional balance, self-efficacy, processes of change, stage of change, and enjoyment)
      (secondary outcomes) in a sample of sedentary students after 3-weeks intervention (post) and
      after 3-months (follow-up). It will be compared three conditions: MOI+PEDOMETER condition
      (access to a MOI and the use of a pedometer of new generation); MOI condition (access to a
      MOI and the use of blinded pedometer); and CONTROL condition (the use of a blinded
      pedometer). Hence, two conditions will include components of the &quot;Transtheoretical Model of
      Change&quot; in the intervention, such as the facilitation of the decisional balance, the increase
      of the self-efficacy, and the use of experiential and behavioral processes of change (e.g.,
      consciousness raising, counterconditioning, reinforcement management, stimulus control), but
      only one of these condition will receive the feedback of the pedometer that will allow
      self-monitoring the behavior.

    <description>The self-administered Motivational Online Intervention developed by the authors was based on the &quot;Transtheoretical Model of Change&quot;. It attempts to facilitate the decisional balance, the increase of the self-efficacy, and the use of experiential and behavioral processes of change (e.g., consciousness raising, counterconditioning, reinforcement management, stimulus control). The main objective is to deliver information to increase the motivation to practice physical activity and to set individualized goals. It has a total length of 45 minutes, and it is delivered in a web platform at the beginning of the intervention.</description>
