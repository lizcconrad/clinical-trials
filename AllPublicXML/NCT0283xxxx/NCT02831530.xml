  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclins CDK4 / 6 are extensively involved in the proliferation and growth of numerous cancers
      including breast cancer. The objective of this study is to identify if a new preoperative
      oral treatment, abemaciclib directed against the CDK / 6 compared to no treatment, inhibits
      tumor growth or induced senescence (aging) tumor.

      This early study is offered to women who are going to be operated on for breast cancer with
      expression of hormone receptor (ER and / or PR). These women will have 3 chances to receive
      one for up to 14 days in the waiting period of their surgery abemaciclib as tablets. Other
      patients do not receive treatment. The decision to receive or no treatment will be done by a
      random computer draw.

      The drug's effectiveness will be evaluated primarily on the biological parameters of the
      tumor itself when comparing surgery to before treatment. These results biomarkers will allow
      us to better know how this treatment and eventually will be used in future to identify
      patients for whom treatment with abemaciclib more efficiency.

      Patients treated in the protocol will then receive treatment entirely conventional in their
      breast cancer within the parameters of their tumors: their participation is very limited in
      time.

    <description>Patients randomized to the treatment arm will start treatment from 15 days before the surgery (day 1 of the study) to receive the last dose of treatment the day before the surgical procedure (day 14 of the study). Abemaciclib will be taken orally at a dose of 150 mg/ twice a day (Every 12h +/- 2h) on day 1 to day 14. The treatment should be taken in the morning and evening with a big glass of water (250ml) at approximately the same time.</description>

          4. Candidates for initial breast surgery with a minimum tumor size of 11 mm measured by
             breast ultrasound. Bilateral and multifocal tumors are allowed, assuming tumor
             evaluations and pre- and post-treatment biopsies are performed in the same target
             lesion.

          5. HR-positive (defined as either ER and or PR expression &gt;10% by immunohistochemistry or
             by PCR) irrespective of HER2 status.

          6. No evidence of metastatic disease.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0/1.

          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 50%

          9. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential within 14 days prior to
             treatment initiation (premenopausal or less than 12 months of amenorrhea
