    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the regimen limiting toxicities (RLT) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of indoximod in patients with newly diagnosed AML receiving
      remission induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin.

      Safety and tolerability of Indoximod will also be evaluated at the RP2D in combination with
      standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (defined as induction therapy with idarubicin and
      cytarabine and consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) in this trial) followed by
      single agent indoximod maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML as compared
      to safety and tolerability of SOC chemotherapy alone.
