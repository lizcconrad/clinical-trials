  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the proportion of patients who have wound closure within 12 weeks as
      well as the time to wound closure in patients receiving Artacent™ versus standard of care for
      treatment of non-healing lower extremity wounds. The recurrence of healed wounds will be
      assessed at 6 months via a telephone survey

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to document the efficacy of Artacent™ Human Amniotic Membrane (Artacent) in the
      treatment of diabetic and vascular lower extremity ulcers. The study will add to the
      currently available literature by also assessing the impact of treatment on quality of life
      and on heal economic outcomes. Finally the study will follow patients for longer than
      previous studies and will obtain data on healing and recurrence at 6 months.

      The objectives of this study are 1) to compare Artacent to standard of care (SOC) in the
      treatment of non-healing lower extremity ulcers and 2) to evaluate the impact of treatment on
      patient quality of life. Health economic outcomes will also be collected. The proportion of
      patients receiving Artacent who have wound closure with 12 weeks will be compared to those
      patients receiving SOC only will be compared. A comparison of time to wound closure will also
      be compared between the two populations.

      Patients who are randomized to the SOC group (control) and require further treatment at 12
      weeks due to incomplete wound healing, may receive treatment with Artacent if the
      investigator determines that to be a potentially beneficial option.
