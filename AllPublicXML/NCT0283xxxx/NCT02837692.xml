  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of single-dose evening
      administration of JNJ-42847922 in elderly non-Asian adults compared with weight- and
      gender-matched young healthy non-Asian adults and to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      single-dose evening administration of JNJ-42847922 in healthy Japanese adults.

    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>
