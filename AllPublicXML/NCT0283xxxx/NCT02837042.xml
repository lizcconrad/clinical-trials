  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is relatively rare but exhibits higher incidences in
      less developed countries. PSCC is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by early
      spread. Pembrolizumab has recently been FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma but will
      serve as the investigational agent for this penile cancer study.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter trial to evaluate Pembrolizumab for patients with advanced penile
      squamous cell carcinoma following prior chemotherapy. Participating institutions are the
      University of Alabama at Birmingham (coordinating center), M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
      University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and Emory University. Patients will receive
      intravenous Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and undergo a clinical exam. Radiographic scans will
      be done at baseline and every 9 weeks. Therapy will continue until disease progression or
      there are intolerable toxicities.

             treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to Pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant expecting to father children within the projected duration of the trial,
             starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last
             dose of trial treatment.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         17. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has known active Tuberculosis infection.

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
