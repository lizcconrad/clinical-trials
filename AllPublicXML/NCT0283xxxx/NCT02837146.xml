  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing the kinetics of the ultrasound (US) response in DMARD-naive
      very early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with tocilizumab (TCZ) and methotrexate
      (MTX).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most rheumatic autoimmune diseases, treatment has two components: induction of remission
      and maintenance (to prevent relapse). After screening (week -3 to 0), patients enter into a 3
      week run-in period during which no glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is allowed. At week 0, if
      persistent synovitis is confirmed patients will enter the induction phase. During the
      induction phase all patients will receive TCZ and MTX from week 0 to week 24. After week 24,
      all patients will receive MTX.

      Ultrasound (US) is increasingly used in rheumatic diseases, in particular in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The great resolution of superficial musculoskeletal structures obtained by
      using high frequency transducers and the high sensitivity of colour Doppler (CD) and power
      Doppler (PD) techniques allow to detect synovial vascularisation, synovial hypertrophy (SH)
      and joint effusion (JE).

      This is a pilot US trial that allow us to explore the hypothesis that an early US response
      may be predictive of later clinical response.
