      An open-label, single-arm, multi-centre phase II trial for patients with refractory multiple
      myeloma and with BRAFV600E/K Mutation to evaluate the efficacy of the kinase inhibitors
      Encorafenib (LGX818 in) combination with Binimetinib (MEK162). The patients must have
      received at least two prior therapy regimen (at least one immunomodulatory drug and one
      proteasome inhibitor).

      The subjects receive LGX 818 450 mg. p.o. once daily and MEK 162 45 mg p.o. twice daily until
      disease progression or toxicity requiring discontinuation of treatment. 1 cycle is defined as

             method for birth control throughout the trial.

               1. Hormonal contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are
                  therefore considered neither indicated nor effective.

                  clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks
                  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
                  woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
                  not of child bearing potential

         25. Sexually active males unless they agree to use a condom during intercourse while
             taking the drug. This practice should be continued for another 12 weeks after stopping
             treatment. Also they should not father a child during the study period or the 12 weeks
             post study time.

             A condom is also required to be used by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery
             of the drug via seminal fluid;

         26. Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's
             ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the
             study protocol or complete the study.

         27. Patients taking non-topical medication known to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.
             However patients who either discontinue their treatment or switch to another
             medication at least three days prior to registration are eligible.

         28. Participation in other clinical trials within 1 month prior to enrolment except
             patients for supportive care studies and vaccination studies. This does not include
             long-term follow-up periods without active drug treatment of previous studies during
             the last 6 months.

         29. Patient has other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would,
             in the investigator's judgment contraindicate her participation in the clinical study
             (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, active chronic hepatitis ).

        No subject will be allowed to be enrolled in this trial more than once.
