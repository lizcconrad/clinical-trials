  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry study is intended to establish a large prospective longitudinal clinical cohort
      of lymphoma patients in Malawi, as such data is currently lacking from sub-Saharan Africa.
      The investigators will perform core biopsies on at least 800 consecutively enrolled patients
      with suspected lymphoma for accurate histopathologic characterization. The investigators will
      systematically collect relevant clinical and laboratory data, and longitudinally follow those
      with confirmed hematologic malignancies receiving treatment according to local standards of
      care to assess outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort registry study of at least 800 patients with suspected
      lymphoma in Malawi. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a large prospective
      longitudinal lymphoma cohort at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH). Subjects with confirmed
      hematologic malignancies treated according to local standards of care will be actively
      followed for 2 years after diagnosis to assess clinical outcomes. After 2 years, if subjects
      are well, they will be discharged from clinic if they desire and contacted via telephone
      every 6 months for 5 years after lymphoma diagnosis simply to assess vital status. Subjects
      who wish to continue clinic follow-up after 2 years will be seen every 6 months until 5 years
      after lymphoma diagnosis. Those who are unwell after 2 years and continuing to receive active
      treatment will continue follow-up in clinic with all treatment details recorded.

      All study laboratories and procedures which are being performed are consistent with
      international standards of care. Even without study implementation, all procedures may be
      undergone by patients at KCH, and there is no 'new' intervention being provided by the study
      which is currently absent in Malawi. However, current clinical and laboratory assessments of
      lymphoma patients at KCH over time are typically highly inconsistent and incomplete by
      international standards, as a result of extreme scarcity of resources and personnel. It is
      therefore hoped that the study will provide greater standardization and uniformity in the
      longitudinal characterization of patients with lymphoma at KCH, and allow data collected to
      be used for clinical as well as research purposes, as such data from sub-Saharan Africa are
      lacking and can be tremendously informative.
