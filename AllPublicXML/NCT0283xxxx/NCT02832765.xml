  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to determine the local control-rate after radiotherapy (RT)
      with and without simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) concepts in patients with bone
      metastases of the spine. Further study objectives are survival, and clinical parameters such
      as pain, quality of life (QoL) and fatigue. We expect an improvement in local control and
      consecutively an increased re-sclerotization of the bone metastasis due to a higher
      biological dose in the tumor area. Therefore patients could benefit in quality-of-life, pain
      relief and mobility.

    <textblock>
      The vertebral column is the main localization of bone metastases and is where they frequently
      indicate an advanced stage of a malignant primary disease [1, 2]. Two thirds of all patients
      with tumors are estimated to develop bone metastases in the course of their disease [3].
      Spinal bone metastases are of central impact for patients in a palliative setting. The
      clinical symptoms include pain at rest and under exercise but also impaired activity of daily
      life, the risk of pathological fractures, and neurological deficits. Local control is the
      essential factor for stability of the vertebral body of patients with spinal bone metastases.
      In regard to re-calcification of former osteolytic lesions, palliative radiotherapy (RT)
      represents an effective treatment option [4]. The most common schedule was specified as 30 Gy
      in 10 fractions. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) can be a safe modality for treating spinal metastasis with enhanced
      targeting accuracy [5]. Secondly, IMRT to the spine was well tolerated (especially in the
      spinal cord), had no significant late toxicities, and spared other organs at risk
      simultaneously [6]. The main problem of the standard schedule is the limited dose application
      to the metastasis due to organ at risk myelon. Therefore, the aims of this study is to apply
      a high biological dose in the tumor region and to achieve an improved result related to local
      control for palliative patients with painful spinal bone metastases. Secondly, the aim is to
      evaluate QoL, fatigue, and survival of three different RT-techniques. To the best of our
      knowledge, no comparable randomized study has been described in the literature so far.
