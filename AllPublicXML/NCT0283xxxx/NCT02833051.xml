  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine the effects of an acute bout of exercise on
      children's energy intake over the course of a day. Previous studies in adolescents and adults
      have shown exercise to be effective in decreasing short-term energy intake, with some
      variability. Individual characteristics such as habitual physical activity and psychological
      factors may influence the effect of exercise on energy intake, but these factors have yet to
      be examined. The investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, with
      expertise in eating behavior, exercise, psychology, and clinical research in order to examine
      these questions. First, the investigators will examine the difference in energy intake at
      lunch, snack, and dinner meals in response to 30 minutes of imposed exercise compared to 30
      minutes of rest. Second, the investigators will collect objective measures of children's
      habitual physical activity, child characteristics (body composition, eating behavior traits),
      and individual responses to the controlled exercise bout. The investigators can then examine
      both group and individual differences in the energy intake response to exercise. Twenty
      children (ages 9-12) will be tested over the course of three visits. The key outcome will be
      differences in energy intake in response to exercise vs. rest. Secondary outcomes include the
      influence of differences in habitual physical activity, personal characteristics, and
      responses to the exercise bout on children's energy intake. The long term goal of this line
      of research is to understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between exercise and
      energy intake. The translational potential of this research will be to inform personalized
      childhood obesity prevention strategies in children at risk for overweight.
