    <textblock>
      The study will involve administering a single dose of investigational drug or placebo in
      ascending dose cohorts. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      investigational drug as well as the efficacy of investigational drug versus placebo in adults
      with primary (first episode) Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

      SER-262-001 is a Phase 1b, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single
      dose clinical study with 2 treatment arms (SER-262 or placebo) in up to 8 dose cohorts.
      Patients who have been diagnosed with their first (primary) episode of CDI, defined as
      diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools per day for 2 consecutive days), a positive C. difficile stool
      test and who have responded to standard‑of‑care antibiotic will receive investigational drug
      or placebo on Day 1.
