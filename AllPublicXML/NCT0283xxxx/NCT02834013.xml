      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1
      overall response rate (ORR) in subsets of patients with advanced rare cancers treated with
      ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicities in each cohort. II. To estimate overall survival (OS),
      progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate; and to estimate immune-related ORR
      (irORR), and immune-related PFS (irPFS) by unidimensional immune-related response criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association of tumor mutational burden measured by tissue sequencing with
      durable response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] lasting 24 weeks or more).

      II. To describe the mutational load and targeted sequencing of well-known oncogenes and
      changes in these markers of patients at up to three time points (baseline, cycle 2, and
      progression), and across strata to describe associations with survival outcomes.

      III. To describe the presence of germline mutations, and across strata to evaluate
      association with outcome.

      IV. Within strata, to describe patient risk category as defined by the biodesix protein
      signature and change over time at up to three time points (baseline, cycle 2, progression),
      and across strata to evaluate associations with outcomes.

      V. Within strata, to evaluate the association of PD-L1 expression (positive versus negative)
      with response and survival outcomes, and within strata, to characterize baseline PD-L1
      prevalence.

      VI. To collect specimens for banking for use in future correlative biomarker research
      studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and
      ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 years from registration.

             thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or, free thyroxine (T4) serum tests demonstrating
             values within the normal range, within 28 days prior to registration; Note: TSH, with
             reflex T4 is allowable if per institutional standard; otherwise, both TSH and free-T4
             must be obtained

          -  Patients must have adequate adrenal axis function, as evidenced by adrenocorticotropic
             hormone (ACTH) values within the institutional normal ranges OR cortisol levels within

             women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
             method; a woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses
             at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine
             contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy
             and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation; however, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures
             outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  Men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use birth control throughout the
             study and for 31 weeks after completion of protocol therapy; in addition to routine
             contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy
             and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (vasectomy); however, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he is responsible
             for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  Patients must not have known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis virus (HCV)
             infection at time of registration; patients with HBV or HCV that have an undetectable
             viral load, or in the opinion of the treating investigator is well-controlled, are
             eligible

          -  Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive at
             registration are eligible at the time of registration:

               1. Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cell count greater or equal to 250 cells/mm^3

               2. If patient is on antiretroviral therapy, there must be minimal interactions or
                  overlapping toxicity of the antiretroviral therapy with the experimental cancer
                  treatment; once daily combinations that use pharmacologic boosters may not be
                  used

               3. No history of non-malignancy acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining
                  conditions other than historical low CD4+ cell counts

          -  Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
             in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, immunosuppressive drugs,
             or corticosteroids with doses higher than prednisone 10mg or equivalent); replacement
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment; autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to autoimmune hepatitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease), as well
             as symptomatic disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis
             [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's
             Granulomatosis]); CNS or motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g.,
             Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis or
             glomerulonephritis); vitiligo, alopecia, hypothyroidism on stable doses of thyroid
             replacement therapy, psoriasis not requiring systemic therapy within the past 2 years
             is permitted; short-term steroid premedication for contrast allergy is permitted

          -  Patients must not have any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including (not limited
             to): symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
             III/IV), unstable angina pectoris or coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 24 weeks
             prior to registration, unstable cardiac arrhythmia (ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of
             NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 4 grade &gt;= 2),
             known psychiatric illness that would limit study compliance, intra-cardiac
             defibrillators, known cardiac metastases, or abnormal cardiac valve morphology (&gt;=
             grade 3)

               -  Note: Patients with history of CHF or patients who are deemed at risk because of
                  underlying cardiovascular disease or exposure to cardiotoxic drugs should have an
                  electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram (ECHO), as clinically indicated, at
                  baseline and at the start of each cycle; patients who have evidence at baseline
                  (or subsequently) of CHF, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, or myositis
                  cardiac evaluation (NYHA I/II) should have additional consult by a cardiologist,
                  including review of EKG, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), troponin, echocardiogram,
                  as clinically indicated

          -  Patients must have amylase or lipase within =&lt; 1.5 x IULN without symptoms of
             pancreatitis at registration, within 28 days prior to registration
