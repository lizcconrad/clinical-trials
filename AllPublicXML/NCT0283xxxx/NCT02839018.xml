      Little is known about nutritional Parameters that potentially influence the course of
      intensive-care unit acquired weakness (ICU - AW). The investigators aim to elucidate the
      nutritional profiles in blood, urine and muscle in respective patients at risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the patient's legal representative and later
             from the patients (as soon as possible)

          -  Individuals diagnosed with severe head trauma or intracerebral hemorrhage (&quot;central
             nervous system group&quot;) or with severe sepsis/ septic shock (&quot;Sepsis group&quot;) at any
             time from ICU admission until day 5 (i.e. day of screening)

          -  Patient on the ICU for ≥ 5 days (&quot;ICU long stayer&quot;)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Language other than German or French

          -  Institutionalized Individuals (e.g. prisoners, severe pre-existing mental incapacity)

          -  Patients with known pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that will make
             informed consent likely impossible

          -  Patients with known pregnancy or known to be lactating will not be included to the
             investigation. Due to the observational/ diagnostical nature of the study, a pregnancy
             test will not be performed.

          -  Patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

          -  Clinical signs of pre-existing malnutrition (Body mass index &lt;18)

          -  Pre-existing evidence for history of anorexia or bulimia

          -  Parenteral nutrition received within last 5 days (for more than 12 hours) or evidence
             for parental nutrition needed within next 7 days

          -  Terminal disease (i.e. life expectancy &lt;14 days)

          -  Patients with active malignancy

          -  Patients on biologicals interfering with metabolism (e.g. infliximab)

          -  Patients on chronic steroid medication (i.e. prednisone equivalent dose &gt;10mg/day)

          -  Patients on neuromuscular blocking agents on a regular basis (i.e. on a repetitive
             basis within last 48 hours or evidence for need within next 7 days)

          -  At screening (day 5): prescribed caloric intake substantially higher (i.e. &gt; 150% of
             caloric need of indirect calorimetry) than indirect calorimetric results (in intubated
             patients) or i.e. standard-of-care (25 Kcal/kg body weight/day)

          -  Severe adipositas defined as BMI &gt;40

          -  Known pre-existing allergy to standard enteral formulae

          -  Subject previously enrolled to an interventional trial that is not considered
             standard-of-care (e.g. investigation of new medication/drug or medical devices)
