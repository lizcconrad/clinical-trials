    <textblock>
      To collect pilot data on the prevalence and incidence of asymptomatic Leishmania donovani
      infection in HIV infected individuals in a visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-HIV endemic region to
      inform the feasibility of a larger study exploring a screen and treat strategy for VL in HIV
      co-infected individuals in East-Africa (Ethiopia).
