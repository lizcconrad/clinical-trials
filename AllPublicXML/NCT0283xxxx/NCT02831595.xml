  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern knee implants combine several types of metal and therefore potentially expose patients
      to different metal ions.

      Titanium niobium nitride coating (TiNbN) acts like a physical barrier against the corrosion
      process and the metallic ions release towards the surrounding biologic environment, thus,
      making TiNbN-coated prostheses possible to be safety implanted in metal sensitized patients.

      The aim of the study is to verify that the postoperative plasma metal concentrations at 1
      year are not different than preoperative values.
