    <textblock>
      This is a translational, multicentre questionnaire study. The study design follows that of a
      cross sectional, quantitative research approach. Data collection will involve
      self-administered, paper-based questionnaires. The method of data collection allows for a
      large sample size without major expense. The questionnaires are comprised of several
      questions examining areas such as demographic details, cancer diagnosis, understanding of the
      term 'clinical trials', attitudes to personal participation in cancer clinical research and
      the experience of patients who previously participated in a cancer clinical trial. The study
      will be opened in all interested hospitals in Ireland following initiation of the study at
      each site. Questionnaire completion will be seen as implied informed consent and no formal
      consent will need to be signed by the patient. The paper-based questionnaire responses will
      be electronically and anonymously recorded in a computer database to facilitate analysis.
