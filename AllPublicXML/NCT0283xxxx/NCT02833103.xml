  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) refers to biliary kinetic abnormality of the sphincter of
      Oddi (SO), often accompanied by pain, hepatic and pancreatic enzyme elevation, common bile
      duct (CBD) dilation or onset of pancreatitis. Pain caused by SOD affects the quality of life
      (QoL).The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of relieving abdominal
      pain of Pinaverium Bromide in medication therapy for patients with post-cholecystectomy SOD.

      1.1 Background (I)

      1.1.1 10%~50% of the patients who previously underwent cholecystectomy experience recurrent
      abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, abdominal distention, enzymatic changes, etc., and
      sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) accounts for about 13% of such cases;

      1.1.2 Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD):

        -  It refers to biliary kinetic abnormality of the sphincter of Oddi (SO), often
           accompanied by pain, hepatic and pancreatic enzyme elevation, common bile duct (CBD)
           dilation or onset of pancreatitis.

        -  Pain caused by SOD affects the quality of life (QoL).

      1.1.3 The diagnosis of SOD is still being disputed, and there has been no optimal solution so
      far.

        -  The diagnosis of SOD is largely based on clinical judgment

        -  The gold standards ERCP and SOM are invasive diagnostic criteria

      1.2 Background (II)

      1.2.1 If biliary-type abdominal pain after cholecystectomy is considered as SOD, most of the
      patients are classified as SOD II and SOD III according to Rome III Criteria-modified.

      Biliary SOD Type I: moderate or severe biliary-type abdominal pain; transient ALT / AST/ALP
      elevation &gt; 2ULN; CBD dilation &gt; 8mm as evidenced by ultrasound or other non-invasive
      examination Type II: biliary-type abdominal pain; One or two of above items Type III:only
      biliary-type abdominal pain

      1.3 Background (III)

      1.3.1 Treatment of SOD is being disputed: currently, the main method is to relax sphincter of
      Oddi (SO).

        -  Medications: antispasmodic drugs, nitrates, calcium ion antagonists, modulators of
           gastrointestinal (GI) motility

        -  EST(endoscopic sphincterotomy): postoperative complications and mortality

      1.3.2 EST is not well effective in the treatment of SOD type II and type III, which are
      mostly caused by functional abnormalities

      −ASGE guideline 2015 points out that EST is not recommended for patients with SOD type III.
      Endoscopic stents are not recommended, either.

      1.3.3 Danshu Capsules: contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and has the
      effects of fighting infection, alleviating pain, promoting bile secretion and lifting muscle
      spasms; literature showed that Danshu Capsules effectively improved the symptoms of biliary
      disorders, such as pain, nausea and abdominal distension.

      1.3.4 Pinaverium Bromide: able to improve the spasms of SO; literature showed that it treated
      biliary disorders effectively.·10%~50% of the patients who previously underwent
      cholecystectomy experience recurrent abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, abdominal
      distention, enzymatic changes, etc., and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) accounts for
      about 13% of such cases.

    <time_frame>Change From Baseline to 3 Months After Medication</time_frame>
    <description>abdominal pain scores (baseline vs. 3 months after treatment)
Abdominal pain score based on main symptom: Degree of pain in point（0 - no pain [0 point]；1~3 - mild pain [1 point]；4~6 moderate pain [2 point]]；7~10 - severe pain [3 point]）、Frequency in times/week (No episodes[0 point]；1 time/week[1 point]；2 times/week[2 point]; 3 times/week[3 point])、Duration in days/week(No episodes[0 point]；&lt; 1 day/week[1 point]；1-2days/week[2 points]；≥ 3days/week[3 points])
The sum of the scores for the above three items is the total score for abdominal pain.
Efficacy evaluation: reduction in abdominal pain score, as compared with the baseline
= 100%: complete remission (CR)；60%~99%: significant remission (SR)；30% ~ 59%: partial remission (PR)；0% ~ 29%: no response (NR)
Treatment response = CR + SR
Treatment response rate = (CR + SR) / the total number of patients</description>
