      This is an observational study using Bronchial-alveolar lavage (BAL) as specimen for
      GeneXpert, a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of tuberculosis
      (TB). Patients suspicious of TB, who require bronchoscopy as part of the investigation
      procedures, will be recruited for this study over a period of 18 months. Clinical likelihood
      of TB will be systematically scored according to various clinical parameters. This will
      determine the pre-test probability. Clinician will decide if anti-TB treatment is to be
      started and patients will be followed up for a minimal of 18 months. Sensitivity,
      specificity, positive, negative predictive values and the respective likelihood ratio will be
      calculated accordingly.
