    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-cycle, multiple-dose, single-sequence study in women of
      child-bearing potential. The primary objective is to assess the effect of BMS-986142 on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Combined Oral Contraceptive Containing Ethinyl Estradiol and
      Norethindrone Acetate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Informed Consent

          -  Target population: Healthy females with no clinically significant deviations from
             normal in medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms
             (ECGs), physical measurements, and clinical laboratory tests that are willing to
             switch to Loestrin during the study.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 32 kg/m2.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with intact ovarian function and history of regular
             menstrual cycles must have been on a stable regimen of combination of birth control
             containing ethinyl estradiol without evidence of clinically significant breakthrough
             bleeding or spotting for at least 2 consecutive months prior to Day -1.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
             contraception for the duration of treatment with study drugs (53 days) plus 5
             half-lives of BMS-986142 (3 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a
             total of 86 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any chronic or acute illness including active TB in the last 3 years,
             recent infection, gastrointestinal disease, smoking within less than 6 months prior to
             dosing, alcohol abuse, inability to tolerate oral medication, or inability to be
             venipunctured.

          -  History of jaundice or irregular bleeding associated with taking oral contraceptives,
             frequent headaches, cerebrovascular or coronary-artery disease, retinal vascular
             lesions, cancer of the breast or endometrium, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
             embolism, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or phlebitis.

          -  Vaccination or plans for vaccination with any live vaccine 12 weeks prior to first
             dose of study drug, during the course of the study, or 30 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or clinical laboratory
             determinations beyond what is consistent with the target population.

          -  History of allergies and adverse drug reaction to any oral contraceptive compounds or
             Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.
