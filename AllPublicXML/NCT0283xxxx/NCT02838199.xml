      The purpose of this study is to determine that Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
      with SAPIEN 3 is superior to traditional surgical aortic valve replacement(SAVR) with
      bio-prosthesis regarding the rate of all-cause mortality at 1 year in patients with
      symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis.

             intervention

          -  Concomitant severe mitral valve or significant aorta disease requiring surgery

          -  Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months of procedure

             inability to be anticoagulated for the study procedure.

          -  Native aortic annulus size &lt; 18 mm or &gt; 25 mm as measured by echocardiogram.

          -  Expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of aortic stenosis
