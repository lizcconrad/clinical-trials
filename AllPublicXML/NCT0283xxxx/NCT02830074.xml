  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) remains under-treated in individuals living with spinal cord
      injuries and disorders (SCI/D). The investigators' aim is to test a program that addresses
      challenges and barriers to positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of SDB among patients
      with SCI/D. The investigators anticipate that patients who receive this program will have
      higher rates of PAP use and will demonstrate improvements in sleep quality, general
      functioning, respiratory functioning and quality of life from baseline to 6 months follow up
      compared to individuals who receive a control program. This work addresses critical
      healthcare needs for patients with SCI/D and may lead to improved health and quality of life
      for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to test the efficacy of a comprehensive approach to improving positive
      airway pressure (PAP) therapy acceptance and adherence and sleep quality among patients with
      SCI/D. The proposed study is very relevant to the mission of the VA in promoting optimal
      health for all Veterans, including those with disabilities. To this end, this study is a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of a combined sleep and PAP
      adherence program, called the &quot;BEST&quot; program (Best practices PAP + patient Education +ongoing
      Support and Training). The central aim of this proposal therefore is to test the efficacy
      between two PAP adherence programs. The study has two main aims. First, the investigators aim
      to test the efficacy of the educational program in improving adherence to PAP therapy for the
      first 6 months of use (with data available for some subjects for up to 12 months). Second,
      the investigators will evaluate the impact of the program on sleep quality and on three key
      areas of function: general functioning (using measures specific to SCI/D patients),
      respiratory functioning (via spirometry) and quality of life (assessed with measures
      appropriate for use with patients having limited mobility) over the 3-month intervention
      period. The investigators will also explore whether the intervention is more effective for
      some subgroups of patients than others. The proposed work is very relevant to VA's patient
      care mission, addressing a critical need for patients who suffer from disparity in access to
      high quality care because of their disabilities. The investigators anticipate that the
      investigators' work will yield significant new knowledge that improves the health and quality
      of life for Veterans living with SCI/D.

    <measure>PAP adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>PAP adherence will be monitored remotely using existing data gathering systems. This will be summarized into the proportion of nights (out of 90 nights) with use &gt;4 hours. The investigators will also examine mean hours of nightly use for each participant over the 90-day intervention period. The investigators have experience using these procedures in other studies and this process has resulted in data loss rates &lt;10% for PAP use. The proportion of nights each month (out of 30 nights) with use &gt;4 hours will be used as the main independent measure of PAP use. Remote monitoring of nightly PAP use</description>

    <measure>Subjective Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an 18-item questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over the past month. The PSQI is sensitive for distinguishing normal and abnormal sleepers and has good test-retest reliability. The investigators will use the 3-factor scoring, which has been shown to have superior psychometric properties. This will be used as the main independent measure of sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the WHO-QOL BREF questionnaire. This is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100, and is frequently used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The questionnaire is composed of four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. It also includes one question on overall quality of life and one on general health. Importantly, items on this scale are not dependent on mobility, which is unlikely to change in patients with SCI/D as a result of improved sleep. The WHOQOL-BREF scores correlate highly (.89 or above) with WHOQOL-100 scores, and demonstrate good discriminant validity, content validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The four WHOQOL-BREF domain scores will be used as main outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>subjective sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep diaries will be completed for 1 week before the laboratory PSG, and again at the 3-month follow-up assessments. The investigators will use a diary based on the AASM Consensus Sleep Diary, with items added to track sleep medication use, and self-reported PAP use. The diary will be used to compute self-reported sleep efficiency (time asleep out of time in bed), hours of sleep, time to fall asleep, time awake at night, and number of awakenings. This will be used as an measure of sleep quality. Participants who cannot complete a paper diary will be provided with a phone number to call to report diary information each morning</description>

    <measure>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure-Self Report (SCIM-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure-Self Report (SCIM-SR) will be used to evaluate performance of activities of daily living. The SCIM-SR is a self-report version of the SCIM III, a reliable and valid measure of global disability for patients with SCI/D. The SCIM-SR has 3 subscales: self-care, respiration and sphincter management, and mobility. Scores range from 0-100 and higher scores reflect greater independence. Since some individuals' in the study will require the assistance of family members or caregivers, for descriptive purposes the investigators will also ask an individual familiar with the patient's level of functioning to complete the SCIM if the patient gives permission for us to do so. The SCIM-SR total and subscales scores (as completed by the patient) will be used as the functional status outcome measure</description>

    <measure>Depressive symptom severity</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a 9-item depression module in the PHQ (a self-administered diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders) which is part of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) suite of evaluation tools. The PHQ-9 aligns to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for depression and is widely used to screen for depression across VA. The PHQ-9 total score will be used to measure depressive symptom severity as an outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Flinders Fatigue Scale (FFS) is a 7-item fatigue rating scale used to measure general symptoms of fatigue. The FFS has high internal consistency (.91), can discriminate good vs. poor sleepers (p&lt;.0001) and is sensitive to change over time. The FSS is sensitive to change after sleep-related interventions as well. The FSS total score will be used as an outcome measure</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory function: spirometry and respiratory muscle force</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is a simple bedside test used to evaluate lung function. Key spirometry values include forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) and the absolute FEV1/FVC ratio. If the FVC and FEV1 are decreased, the absolute FEV1/FVC ratio distinguishes between obstructive and restrictive impairments. A normal absolute FEV1/FVC ratio suggest that restrictive ventilatory impairment may be present, and a reduced FEV1 and absolute FEV1/FVC ratio indicates an obstructive ventilator pattern. The investigators will use supine FVC and MIP as the key outcome measures for respiratory function for this study, as these are the most representative of respiratory functioning during sleep.</description>
