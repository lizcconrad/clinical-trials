  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-group, multi-centre trial to confirm the safety and efficacy of
      loxoprofen sodium/methocarbamol ( IP-TN) when administered orally for 2 weeks to patients
      with low back pain, scapulohumeral periarthritis, or cervico-omo-brachial syndrome associated
      with muscle strain. More than 90 patients will be screened to enroll approximately 80
      patients in the trial.

      After giving written informed consent, patients will be enrolled in the trial. Patients who
      are considered eligible for the trial by the Investigator after consent and complete the
      trial procedures and assessments at Visit 1 will receive the trial medication and enter the
      open-label treatment period of 2 weeks. Patients who complete the open-label treatment period
      will enter the follow-up period of 1 week and complete the trial after confirmation at the
      last visit (or phone interview).

                  there are some evaluation sites, investigators determine its evaluation sites to
                  one site with the biggest of visual analogue scale score.

               -  Visual analogue scales score of &gt;=40 mm in one of pain symptoms (tenderness,
                  listlessness, pain at rest, pain on motion, night-time pain, or limitation of
