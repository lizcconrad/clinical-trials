    <description>Subjects will be treated in cohorts of size three and six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLT in no more than one out of six subjects treated at a particular dose level. A DLT will be determined by cycle 1 toxicity, although all-cycle toxicity will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The first several study participants will receive the lowest dose. If the drug does not cause serious side effects, it will be given to other study participants at a higher dose. The doses will continue to increase for every group of study participants until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. Participants at each site will participate in the dose escalation phase of the study. During the dose escalation phase, study participants will be assigned sequentially to three dose levels in groups (cohorts) of 3 to 6 subjects per dose level: Cohort 1: CC-115 at 5 mg dose twice a day &amp; enzalutamide at 160 mg once a day. Cohort 2: CC-115 at 10 mg dose twice a day &amp; enzalutamide at 160 mg once a day. The protocol has been amended to accrue an additional 17-30 patients in the expansion phase treated at 7.5 mg BID.</description>
