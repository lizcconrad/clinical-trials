      This is a mono-center, open-label, phase 1 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody
      JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer who have failed in
      routine systemic treatment. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation and
      cohort expansion to investigate tolerability and efficacy.

      This is a mono-center, open-label, phase 1 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody
      JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer who have failed in
      previous routine systemic treatment. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation
      and cohort expansion. In the first part, nine patients are injected with different dosage of
      the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody (1mg/kg or 3mg/kg or 10mg/mg, three patients in one group )
      once and observed carefully in the following 4 weeks. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      occurs, then they are injected every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs. This part is to confirm DLT, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      dose (RD). In the second part, 6-12 patients are enrolled in each dosage group and injected
      with the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs. This part is to further analyze safety and efficacy of the humanized
      anti-PD-1 antibody.

    <description>humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (JS001) is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, which selectively interferes with the combination of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of lymphocytes and elimination of malignancy theoretically.</description>
