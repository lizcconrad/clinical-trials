    <textblock>
      This study has two major purposes:

        1. To test developed multiple anatomic and functional MRI methods;

        2. To evaluate the potentials of these MRI methods in the diagnosis, prognosis, and
           monitoring of the progression of renal dysfunction.

      These purposes will be achieved by performing pilot studies with cohorts of patients.

      This study is observational with no intervention applied for the patients. In this study,
      multiple anatomic and functional MRI methods will be performed with three cohorts of
      patients. In addition to anatomic MRI methods, non-contrast enhanced functional MRI methods
      will also be applied to evaluate tissue perfusion and vascular reactivity in these patients.

        The study population will include three main cohorts of patients: 20 ESRD patients with
        their transition to dialysis treatment, 20 CKD controls and 20 non-CKD controls. Based on
        the investigators previous experience, about 20% of recruited subjects may not be able to
        finish the proposed studies. Therefore, a conservative estimate of the total number of
        subjects to be recruited is 72.
