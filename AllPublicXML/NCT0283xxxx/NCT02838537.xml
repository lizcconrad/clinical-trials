      This study will be conducted as a retrospective study of exposed and unexposed cohort of the
      French population included all beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Exposed patients will be
      matched to non exposed controls according age, gender and area of residence (ratio 1/4). Two
      exposed arms and two non exposed control arms will be planned. Triptan arm will be user of
      triptan defined as at least one recorded dispensing of any drug during the follow up, with no
      recorded of any of these drugs during the previous 6 months (&quot;new or incident users&quot;). Ergot
      arm will be user of ergot derivative defined as at least one recorded dispensing of any drug
      during the follow up, with no recorded of any of these drugs during the previous 6 months
      (&quot;new or incident users&quot;). This study involved data from the French National Health Insurance
      Information System (Système National d‟Information Inter-Régimes de l‟Assurance Maladie ;
      SNIIRAM) linked with the French hospital discharge database (Programme de Médicalisation des
      Systèmes d‟Informations, PMSI).

        -  The SNIIRAM is a vast national medico-administrative database representing the most part
           of the French population, allowing to identify and to describe precisely all medication
           dispensations (name of drug, date of dispensing and quantity) including triptans and
           other reimbursed medications.

        -  The PMSI provides medical information about all patients admitted to hospital in France,
           including discharge diagnoses encoded according ICD-10, medical procedures and French
           diagnosis-related groups The research proposed is expected to provide an update and
           nationally-consolidated estimation of the cardiovascular risk is associated to triptans
           use in elderly population.

        Both exposed cohorts will include all beneficiaries recorded in the SNIIR-AM aged 65 and
        older, who had an incident dispensation of any triptans (or ergot derivatives) over the
        study period.

        An incident dispensation is defined by the lack of dispensation for triptan (or ergot
        derivatives) for the first six months of the study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 65 and more

          -  Patients registered in the SNIIR-AM

          -  To avoid depletion of susceptibles bias, only incident users will be included.
             Incident users are defined by the lack of reimbursement for triptan (or ergot
             derivatives) prior six months of the study period.
