      This phase I trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients
      with prostate cancer that is likely to come back or spread (high-risk) undergoing surgery.
      SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a
      patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body. Delivering radiotherapy before
      prostatectomy by SBRT is more convenient, conformal, and may spare normal tissues better than
      delivering radiotherapy after prostatectomy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility of pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in prostate
      cancer patients at high risk for recurrence after prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and acute toxicity of SBRT followed by prostatectomy. This will be based
      on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and patient reported
      quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] and International Prostate
      Symptom Score [IPSS] questionnaires).

      II. Correlative biomarker and molecular analyses using the primary tumor specimen and serial
      blood draws before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3 fractions of SBRT over 1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed primary non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Patient desires and is medically fit to undergo prostatectomy

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 70

          -  Patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are allowed

          -  For confirmation of high risk local failure status, patients will have any one of the

               -  Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating
                  seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) or extraprostatic extension (EPE) within 1 year of
                  enrollment into the study

               -  Gleason score 7-10 (Gleason 7 must be 4+3), presence of any Gleason 5 (even if a
                  tertiary score) as determined at diagnostic biopsy

               -  Gleason score 7 and &gt; 50% of biopsy cores positive for prostate cancer
