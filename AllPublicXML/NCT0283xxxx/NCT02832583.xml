      The aim of this prospective study is to assess the efficacy of autologous Platelet Rich
      Plasma combined with Hyaluronic Acid prepared with RegenKit-BCT HA Cellular Matrix on skin
      rejuvenation. Thirty-one patients were included and received three PRP-AH injection sessions
      4 weeks apart into the cheeks. The outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months
      after the last injection session. Safety was assessed by reported adverse event analysis.
