  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American Indians (AI's) are experiencing an epidemic of stroke morbidity and mortality, with
      higher prevalence and incidence, younger age at onset, and poorer survival than other racial
      and ethnic groups. With a stroke incidence more than twice that of the general U.S.
      population, stroke in AI's is a public health problem of staggering scope. AI's also have
      disproportionate burdens of many risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, smoking,
      obesity, and diabetes. However, no rigorous, population-based studies of stroke prevention
      have included AI's. The investigators at WSU, and community partners, have designed the
      &quot;Family Intervention in the Spirit of Motivational Interviewing&quot; (FITSMI), a program
      delivered at the household level to encourage lifestyle changes that transform the home
      environment and reduce stroke risk for all residents. FITSMI uses a &quot;talking circle&quot; format
      in which facilitators guide participants to identify goals for change and create a tailored
      plan for sustainable implementation that may target smoking, exercise, diet, or medication
      adherence. FITSMI requires just 2 sessions (baseline and 1 month post-baseline), with text
      messaging used to boost long-term adherence. In a group-randomized trial design, the
      investigators will recruit 360 households where Strong Heart Family Study members aged 45 and
      older reside. The investigators will assign half to FITSMI and half to a control condition
      that receives educational brochures.

    <description>Investigators will use the Stroke Risk Scorecard, developed by the National Stroke Association to classify the stroke risk of participants. The factors used to classify stroke risk will be collected using a questionnaire to assess the prevalence of high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, smoking, high cholesterol, physical activity, weight, and family history of stroke.</description>
