  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate multimodel MRI exploring the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.

      The investigators use multimodel MRI to evaluate the extent of blood-brain barrier and white
      matter fiber tracts destruction , iron deposition and cerebral blood flow of associated
      regions in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders using
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging , quantitative susceptibility mapping, diffusion
      tension imaging, and arterial spin labeling with post labeling delay of 2.0 seconds. Transfer
      constant volume , magnetic susceptibility, cerebral blood flow and fractional anisotropy(FA)
      value were measured in lesion and normal appearing white matter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients:

      Patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were included.
      clinical characteristics such as disease duration, expanded disability status scale(EDSS)
      score, age, associated laboratory examination(autoantibodies directed to aquaporin-4 and
      oligoclonal bands in serum as well as cerebrospinal fluid)were recorded.

      Imaging scan were conducted at admission, six months and one year after admission

      Imaging protocols:

      MRI scan protocols: T2 weighted image, T1 weighted image, Diffusion weighted image(DWI),
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging(DCE-MRI) , diffusion tension imaging(DTI) ,quantitative susceptibility mapping(QSM) ,
      arterial spin labeling(ASL) with post labeling delay(PLD) of seconds, sagittal CUBE Fluid
      Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images, sagittal 3-dimensional Fast Spoiled Gradient
      Echo(3D-FSPGR).

      Contrast agent:

      Omniscan 0.1mmol/kg, Inject rate：2ml/s

      Imaging evaluation:

      Transfer constant volume value measured by DCE-MRI indicates the extent of blood-brain
      barrier destruction.

      Magnetic susceptibility manifests iron deposition in lesions and normal appearing white
      matter.

      Diffusion tension imaging demonstrates the extent of white matter fiber tracts destruction.

      Arterial spin labeling(ASL) with post labeling delay(PLD)of seconds shows cerebral blood flow
      in associated regions.

    <description>The patients will be monitored whether they recured multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders confirmed by neurologist and conventional MRI.
Clinical suspicious signs of recurrence : visual loss,urination and defecation function disturbance and so on.
Conventional MRI: there are new lesions or the lesions show high signal on diffusion weighted images or enhancement on post contrast enhanced images.</description>

          2. patients with poor imaging quality（Poor imaging quality mainly defined as the image
             cannot be applied to future analysis on account of severe motion artifacts appeared in
             conventional MRI and mistakes in the MRI process by accident factors which cannot to
             be applied to future analysis）
