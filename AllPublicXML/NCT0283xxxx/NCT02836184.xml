      With calcium carbonate as the positive control drug, to observe the effectiveness and safety
      of nicotinic acid in hemodialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia is an important risk factor affecting long-term survival in patients with
      hemodialysis. Nicotinic acids, as well as its metabolites nicotinamide, were found to inhibit
      the sodium-phosphorus co-transporter on animal intestines. Several studies from other
      countries demonstrated that nicotinamide can reduce blood phosphorus levels in end-stage
      kidney disease patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and
      safety of nicotinic acids on hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients of ethnic Han live in
      China. The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      study. Eligible patients will be randomized to 6 wk of nicotinic acids or calcium carbonate.
      After a 2-wk washout period, patients switched to 6 wk of the alternative therapy. The
      primary measurement is the change in serum phosphorus during the whole term of each arm.
      Statistical analysis will be performed using two-sample paired-group t test.The significance
      level of the analysis was set to 0.05. All other adverse reactions will be analysed and
      reported, if there.
