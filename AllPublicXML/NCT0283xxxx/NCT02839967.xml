  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the
      temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome (TMD) is characterized as a subset of
      orofacial pain, whose signs and symptoms include pain or discomfort in the temporomandibular
      joints. Pain is considered one of the most common and limiting clinical manifestations. One
      of the most used resources to treat muscle pain is the low-level laser therapy (LLLT),
      However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects observed in clinical trials remain poorly
      elucidated, as well as therapy with light emitting diode therapy (LEDT) which, has some
      advantages, among them the larger area radiation point and low cost. However, its effects
      remain elusive in intraoral application in temporal muscle, lateral and medial pterygoid
      muscle. Assuming that there is need to investigate therapeutic resources that combine not
      only different wavelengths as well as different light sources (LED and LLLT), this study aims
      to evaluate the effect of photobiomodulation with a combination of different light sources on
      pain, joint mobility, equity and quality of jaw movements after treatment in patients with
      TMD. It will be made a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial.
      Individuals participate with myogenic temporomandibular disorder, being allocated into 2
      groups randomly and stratified by the method of sealed envelopes. The results will be
      evaluated using: RDC/TMD, digital caliper, visual analog scale, and kinematics. The protocols
      will be used in a 6 sessions and will be evaluated in four different moments. The analyses of
      the data will be performed by adopting a significance level of 5%.

    <measure>Intensity of pain as measured by Visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale is a tool which allows easy measurement of the intensity of the pain, and consists of a straight line of 10 cm in length, the ends have a verbal description (without pain and worst pain ever felt, respectively), in which the volunteers will be directed to make a perpendicular dash between the two extremes that represents the level of pain she presented at that time.</description>

    <measure>Measured by joint mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Will be used a digital meter to assess the breadth of mandibular movement (in mm), i.e. will be measured the opening of the mouth, sides (right and left) and protrusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional as measured by Patient specific Functional scale</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patient specific Functional scale is a global scale, so it can be used for any region of the body. The patient is asked to identify up to 3 activities that are unable to perform or presents any difficulty and may incorporate issues that were not addressed in a generic scale but it's important for the patient's problem. The measurement is made by Likert-type scales of 11 points for each activity, and the higher the average score (0-10) the better the patient's ability to perform the activities.</description>

    <description>For the purposes of photobiomodulation is used a portable cluster 9 PainAway ® diodes manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical ® (Solon, OH-USA), and 1 905 nm diode LASER, 4 875 nm LED diodes and 4 670 nm diodes LED, 4 cm2 beam, emitting an energy of 39.27 J.</description>

    <description>To provide the &quot;blinding&quot; of the participants of the study we will use two identical photobiomodulation equipment supplied by the manufacturer, being an active and another a placebo, but both have identical light and sound device (do not send energy and heat, non-coherent light without biological effect). The devices are named in X and Y for a researcher who does not participate in treatment and assessments.</description>

    <description>Intraoral photobiomodulation is applied in the temporal, medial and lateral pterygoid, bilateral, totaling 4 points of application of phototherapy. The researcher who will perform the treatments will receive the equipment with the stylus activates and pre-programmed dose, an eye protection (glasses, opaque) will be used by the participants, to protect the eyes, because the same does not cause any sensation to volunteer. The technique is used, contact an area. The individual is positioned supine on a stretcher, with the legs supported on a foam roller 20 cm in diameter, the head supported on a pillow, to accommodate her comfortably in a resting posture, prompted the opening of the mouth and placing the tip of photobiomodulation in sections as described below, with 2 minutes interval between one application and another for rest with the mouth closed.</description>

    <description>The volunteers will be subjected to the same Group intervention, Photobiomodulation and the researcher will receive the equipment unaware if the pen that will apply the phototherapy is active or placebo, only the research coordinator will have this knowledge, and for this group the researcher will receive placebo pen. Fits the caveat that, when the voluntary participation, will be held with the active pen treatment.</description>
