      The Collaborative Lifestyle Intervention Program in Knee OsteoArthritis Patients (CLIP-OA)
      compares a novel community-based exercise and dietary weight loss program to the Arthritis
      Foundation's Walk with Ease intervention on improved mobility in knee osteoarthritis (OA)
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee OA is a chronic, progressive, degenerative disease that affects over 20 million
      Americans, and is cited as the primary cause for activity restriction and physical disability
      in older adults. The joint damage and symptoms (i.e., pain, stiffness, and fatigue)
      accompanying symptomatic knee OA result in activity restriction, muscle atrophy, reduced
      quality of life and difficulty in performance of functional tasks.

      Despite the well-established benefits of the Arthritis Foundation's (AF) exercise programs,
      recent evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions combining Exercise and Dietary Weight
      Loss (EX+DWL) results in superior improvements in key clinical outcomes in older, overweight
      or obese knee OA patients.

      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of a novel community-based EX+DWL program to AF's Walk
      with Ease (WWE) EX intervention on improved mobility in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the cost effectiveness and effects of the EX+DWL and WWE
      interventions on weight loss, pain, and quality of life.

    <description>For the first 6 months, participants will meet at a community center for 3 group-based sessions and 1 individual session each month. Sessions include a 45 minute exercise component and a 45 minute dietary weight loss component. Exercise will consist of progressive aerobic and strength training. The dietary component will focus on decreasing caloric intake, while being nutritionally safe. All diets will be monitored by a Registered Dietitian. During months 7-12, participants will meet for 1 group session and 1 individual session per month. The final 12-24 months, bimonthly phone calls are provided to the participants to aid in retention efforts.</description>

    <description>The Arthritis Foundation's (AF) WWE is a self-management program for symptoms of arthritis (pain, fatigue, stiffness,etc.) through exercise. It is a 6 week program involving 3 sessions per week each lasting about 60 minutes. The WWE sessions are comprised of walking, stretching and strengthening exercises, and health education lectures. These group classes will be lead by an AF instructor. Each participant will complete 2 consecutive WWE classes for a total of 12 weeks in the program. During the final week of the program, participants will be trained and transitioin to the self-directed version of WWE for maintenance of exercise. To aid in retention efforts, phone contacts are provided to participants on a monthly basis from 4-12 months and bi-monthly from 12 to 24 months</description>
