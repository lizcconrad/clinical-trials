    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that chronic inflammatory dysimmune state promotes the development of
      cardiovascular complications. The biological assumption is based on the fact that chronic
      inflammation promotes lesions of the vessel wall (endothelial alterations, calcification,
      atherosclerosis). The clinical aim is to allow to identify high-risk patients and to act in
      prevention.

      The project CARMIN involves the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, their management,
      and their influence on cardiovascular prognosis in patients with autoimmune diseases and
      immunodeficiencies acquired. It is based on the creation and monitoring of a cohort of
      patients with different types of dysimmune disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus,
      rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, systemic vasculitis ANCA, kidney transplants,
      and hematopoietic stem cells transplants.
