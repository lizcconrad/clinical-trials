  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients who have an episode of moderate to severe acute kidney
      injury (AKI) and are followed in a focused post-AKI clinic. After patients present signs of
      kidney recovery and before hospital discharge, patients who give consent will be enrolled in
      the study. At the first post-AKI clinic visit, patients will be randomly allocated to follow
      a normal (ad-lib) or a low protein diet (LPD) for 3 months. Patients allocated to a LPD will
      receive a drug called Ketosteril. This drug allows the intake of essential amino acids while
      minimizing the amino-nitrogen intake, what in excess, can be bad for the recovered kidney.
      The investigators will evaluate the nutritional parameters and the kidney recovery of all
      patients and compare these parameters in those two groups.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot single center, randomized controlled, trial of patients who have an episode
      of Stage 2/3 AKI and are followed in a focused post-AKI clinic. Patients will be randomize to
      either; a. LPD-K diet containing 0.6 g protein/kg per day, phosphorus 5-10 mg/kg/day,
      Ketosteril 1 capsule per 5 kg body weight/day divided over three doses (max 8 capsules per
      dose) or b. ad lib diet. Ketosteril should be takes daily during meals and the tablets must
      not be chewed. Ingestion during meals facilitates proper absorption and the metabolisation
      into the corresponding amino acids.

      After the initial assessment, those randomized to LPD-K will be on this diet for a maximum of
      90 days. Additional interventions will include dietary counselling and questionnaire in both
      groups. We would aim for maintaining serum bicarbonate levels ≥ 22meq/L in both groups.

      Evaluation of renal function will be performed using blood and urine tests. In addition,
      specimens will be collected in a bio-repository, and tested for biomarkers of renal
      structural damage. Comprehensive nutritional assessment will be performed by a dietitian,
      along with bioelectrical impedance measurements, blood and urine tests. 24-hour urine urea
      nitrogen and food records will be used to estimate the protein intake of each individual.
      Quality of well-being will be assessed using a standardized tool such as Euro Quality of Life
      (EQ-5D), Charlson Index, and Short Form 8 (SF8) or equivalent. Relevant clinical events
      (adherence to follow-up, death, hospitalization, renal recovery, repeat AKI episodes) will be
      tracked throughout the study.

    <description>Feasibility: assess the compliance with diet and drug. Compliance to the assigned protein prescription will be estimated at each visit during the intervention period by nutrient intake data obtained from 3-day food records and the estimated protein intake calculated from urinary nitrogen appearance in 24-hour urine samples. Treatment compliance will be assessed by counting returned tablets.</description>

    <description>percentage of renal function recovery using baseline estimated GFR as reference. Recovery will be considered as
Complete: return of SCr by no less 20% from baseline in patients with known previous renal function. For patients without previous renal function, we will consider complete recovery if measured GFR more or equal to 90ml/min/1.73m2 .
Partial: return of SCr less than 20% from baseline in dialysis independent patients. For patients without previous renal function, we will consider partial recovery if measured GFR less than 90ml/min/1.73m2.</description>
