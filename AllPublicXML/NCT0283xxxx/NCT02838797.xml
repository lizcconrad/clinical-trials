  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety and tolerability of a new medicine (RQ10) for
      gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease. The investigators will also begin to look
      at the effect of this medicine on gastrointestinal problems. The results will determine if
      future studies are appropriate. In this study, RQ10 will be compared to a placebo (a
      look-alike inactive substance). Participation will include multiple office visits.
      Approximately 48 people will participate.

      This is a phase Ib study with the primary objectives of determining the safety and
      tolerability as well as pharmacokinetics after single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple
      ascending doses (MAD) of RQ10 in Parkinson's disease patients. A secondary objective will be
      to assess the impact of single doses of RQ10 on gastric emptying in Parkinson's Disease
      patients as well as the effects of RQ10 on gastroparesis symptoms. The expected results of
      this exploratory phase Ib study will allow deciding about whether to proceed with further
      development of RQ10 in Parkinson's Disease patients (&quot;go-no go&quot;) and help design a formal
      phase IIa &quot;proof of concept&quot; study by informing repeat-dose selection and possible effect
      sizes in Parkinson's Disease patients.

        Inclusion Criteria: For both the Single Ascending Dose and Multiple Ascending Dose studies:
        Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (UK Brain Bank Criteria), Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages 1-3,
        participants may be on oral levodopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors,
        catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and amantadine, but doses must have remained
        stable for 28 days prior to enrollment and should be anticipated to remain stable
        throughout the study, participants may have deep brain stimulation (though stimulator
        settings must be expected to remain constant throughout the study) or ablative surgery for
        Parkinson's Disease.

        Additional Inclusion criteria for the Multiple Ascending Dose study only: Must have
        symptoms suggestive of current gastroparesis or constipation as shown by any one or more of
        the following: 1. Need for regular use of prokinetics, laxatives, or stool softeners of any
        kind, 2. A total score of 2 or higher on the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptoms Index (total
        score equals average of scores on the 3 subscales), 3. A score of 5 or higher on the
        gastroparesis subscale or 5 or higher on the constipation subscale of the Gastrointestinal
        Symptoms in Neurodegenerative Disease Scale.

        present a risk of suicide, any chronic gastrointestinal diseases except gastroesophageal
        reflux disease, history of any gastrointestinal surgery that might impact drug absorption

        liver or kidney function, cardiac arrhythmia (past or present) or abnormal QT interval on
        entrance electrocardiogram, positive drug screen at screening visit, allergy to spirulina,
