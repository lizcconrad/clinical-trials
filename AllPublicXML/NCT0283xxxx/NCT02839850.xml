  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the change from pre-operative baseline to
      two year postoperative functional performance improvement for the ATTUNE primary, cementless
      TKA RP system as measured with the KOOS questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score). This will be
      carried out for two configurations: cruciate retaining rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless
      CR RP) and posterior stabilized rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless PS RP).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in post-operative outcomes using additional
           patient reported measures at 2 years: PKIP (overall and sub-scores), KOOS (overall and
           sub-scores), AKS and EQ-5D-3L.

        -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in pain and satisfaction over time as
           measured using a modified VAS Pain Score (discrete numbers rather than a continual
           scale) at 2yr.

        -  Evaluate type and frequency of Adverse Events

        -  Evaluate survivorship of the ATTUNE Primary Cementless TKA system for the CR RP and PS
           RP configurations using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 2yr and 5yrs.

        -  Evaluate primary, cementless ATTUNE TKA fixation through zonal radiographic analysis of
           the bone-implant interface at 6wk, 6mo, 1yr, and 2yr after surgery.

        -  Evaluate any changes in anatomic tibiofemoral, femoral component and tibial component
           alignment at 2 years compared to the first postoperative radiographs.

    <time_frame>Minimum 2 years (670-1033 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions and include the WOMAC Osteoarthritis index. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <description>The Pre Surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</description>
