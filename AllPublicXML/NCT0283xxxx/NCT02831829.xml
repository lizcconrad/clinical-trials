  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of water-based and land-based exercise
      training, and usual care (no exercise training) in patient with coronary artery disease, on
      exercise capacity, vascular function, arrhythmogenic potential and cardiac autonomic
      function, and markers of neurohormonal activity, activated hemostasis and inflammation.

      Swimming and other water-based physical activities represent an effective form of
      aerobic-dynamic exercise. However, existing guidelines mainly advise caution when
      recommending water-based activities to patients with coronary artery disease. To date, safety
      and efficacy of short-term water-based exercise in patients with coronary artery diseases
      have only scarcely been addressed.

      Cardiovascular rehabilitation is an integral part of management after a myocardial infarction
      or coronary procedure. Most rehabilitation programs are exercise-based, since the beneficial
      effects of physical activity undisputed, and corroborated by a large body of evidence.

      Research has mainly been focused on the impact assessment of the standard forms of physical
      training, they studied various forms of physical exercise, mainly land-based. No previous
      study has reported on the effect of exercise in water as an integral element of standard
      cardiac rehabilitation in coronary patients on exercise capacity, vascular function,
      arrhythmogenic potential and cardiac autonomic function, and markers of neurohormonal
      activity, activated hemostasis and inflammation.
