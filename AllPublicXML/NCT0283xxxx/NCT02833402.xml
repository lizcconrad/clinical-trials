      Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) which is approved as a treatment for men and women with urgency
      urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency frequency syndrome, urinary retention and anal
      incontinence, is a procedure designed to deliver electrical pulses to the sacral nerves,
      thereby influencing the bladder, sphincters, and pelvic floor. Although the success rates of
      this treatment are quite high, the precise mechanism of action of SNM in subjects with UUI
      remains unclear. Moreover, there are little data regarding specific patient characteristics
      that may serve as &quot;predictors&quot; for SNM success. Recent studies suggest that the bacterial
      community that lives in the urinary tract plays a role in the development and continuation of
      urinary symptoms. It is proposed that the urinary microbiome may change in women before and
      after SNM implantation and this study aims to describe these changes. Investigators in this
      study also hope to determine if differences in the urinary microbiome exist in women with a
      positive response to SNM treatment (responders) compared to those without symptom improvement
      (non-responders). This hypothesis will be tested by collecting urine samples as well as
      questionnaire and medical data from subjects with UUI that are already planning on undergoing
      SNM as part of clinical care before and after their SNM treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in four women reports bothersome symptoms of a pelvic floor disorder with 16% reporting
      urinary incontinence (UI). Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) which is approved for men and women
      with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency frequency syndrome, urinary retention and
      anal incontinence, is a procedure designed to deliver electrical pulses to the sacral nerves,
      thereby influencing the bladder, sphincters, and pelvic floor. SNM provides symptomatic
      relief in 70-86% of patients undergoing the procedure for UUI according to several recent
      prospective studies. Although the success rates are quite high, the precise mechanism of
      action of SNM in subjects with UUI remains unclear. Moreover, there are little data regarding
      specific patient characteristics that may serve as &quot;predictors&quot; for SNM success.

      The microbiome refers to the genetic material of the micro-organisms present in a particular
      environment. The role of the microbiome has recently been implicated in several disease
      states (obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional bowel disease. Initially, the
      urinary microbiome was not a part of the &quot;human microbiome project&quot; as it was widely accepted
      that urine is sterile. However, recent studies have noted the presence of a urinary
      microbiota in adult women without clinical urinary tract infections. Furthermore, recent
      studies have shown that the urinary microbiome differs among women with UUI versus those
      without UUI and also among women with interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome versus
      those without it. These studies suggest that the urinary microbiome plays a role in the
      development and continuation of urinary symptoms.

      Because of the invasiveness of the SNM procedure, it would be helpful to have a way to
      predict treatment success. Investigators in this study propose that the urinary microbiome
      may change in women before and after SNM implantation and hope to describe these changes by
      conducting this study. Investigators also hope to determine if differences in the urinary
      microbiome exist in women with a positive response to SNM treatment (responders) compared to
      those without symptom improvement (non-responders). This hypothesis will be tested by
      collecting urine samples from subjects with UUI that are already planning on undergoing SNM
      as part of clinical care before and after their SNM treatment.
