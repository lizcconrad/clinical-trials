    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of H3B-6527 (Part 1), and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of H3B-6527 as a single agent administered orally (Part 2) in participants with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

         17. Provide written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Other malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for basal or squamous cell
             skin cancer, stage 1 prostate cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or breast that has completed curative therapy.

          2. Current evidence of corneal disorder/keratopathy including but not limited to
             bullous/band keratopathy, corneal epithelial thinning, corneal abrasion,
             inflammation/ulceration, or keratoconjunctivitis (to be confirmed by ophthalmological
             examination). Pre-existing cataract is not a reason for exclusion.

          3. Brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local
             therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at
             least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs (example, radiologic)
             or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting
             study treatment.

          4. Participants with genetic diseases of the liver that may complicate review of safety
             data.

          5. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          6. Uncontrolled significant active infections, except Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C
             (HCV). Participants with HBV are eligible, but should be taking appropriate antiviral
             medication if indicated. Participants with HCV are eligible but must not be taking any
             concomitant treatment for HCV while receiving H3B-6527.

          7. Major surgery or other locoregional treatment within 4 weeks before the first dose of
             study drug or radionuclide treatment (example, 90^Yttrium intra-arterial treatment)
             within 8 weeks before the first dose of drug administration.

          8. Inability to take oral medication, or presence of a malabsorption syndrome or any
             other uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition (example, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting)
             that might impair the bioavailability of H3B-6527. Participants with prior gastric
             resection are eligible.

          9. Participants taking any drug that is a strong inhibitor or inducer of the CYP3A4
             enzyme within at least 2 weeks before the start of study drug and during the conduct
             of the study unless there is an emergent or life-threatening medical condition that
             requires it.

         10. Participants taking any drug known to prolong QTc interval within at least 2 weeks
             before the start of the study drug and during the conduct of the study.

         11. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors that cannot be discontinued 3 days prior to the
             start of study drug and during the course of the study; antacids are permitted except
             for calcium carbonate antacids (example, Tums®).

         12. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever
             is shorter) before study drug administration.

         13. Previous treatment with a selective FGF19-FGFR4 targeted therapy.

         14. Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases (example, influenza, varicella)
             within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy.

         15. Presence of gastric or esophageal varices requiring active treatment.

         16. A clinically significant ECG abnormality, including a marked baseline prolonged QTc
             interval (example, a repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;500 milliseconds [ms])

         17. Significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater
             than New York Heart Association Class II, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, unstable
             angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke within 6 months of the first dose of study
             drug; or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment (including oral
             anticoagulation).

         18. Any other major illness, medical condition or concomitant medication that, in the
             investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the
             participant's participation in this study or would compromise the participant's
             ability to safely complete the study.

         19. Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners do not meet the criteria above (that is, not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or
             for 90 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
             study period or for 90 days after study drug discontinuation.

         20. Hypersensitivity to the study drug or to any of the excipients.

         21. Intolerance or hypersensitivity to both CT and MRI contrast material that would
             preclude the ability to acquire the triphasic liver imaging required by the protocol.

         22. Participants with Inorganic phosphorus &gt; ULN for the institution. Note: Participants
             may be on treatment for hyperphosphatemia, but the levels must be normal at screening
             to participate in this study. Participants with high levels on screening may
             subsequently be treated and rescreened and, should they have stable levels for 2 weeks
             prior to study, may enter the study.

         23. Participants with total or ionized serum calcium &gt; ULN for the institution. Note:
             Participants may be on treatment for hypercalcemia, but the levels must be normal at
             screening to participate in this study. Participants with high levels on screening may
             subsequently be treated and rescreened and, should they have stable levels for 2 weeks
             prior to study, may enter the study.

         24. Participants with endocrine changes that may result in increases in calcium or
             phosphate, including but not limited to hyperparathyroidism and tumoral calcinosis.

         25. Participants with past medical history and/or current evidence of tumoral calcinosis
             or tissue calcification.

         26. Participants who take calcium, vitamin D or systemic corticosteroids. The duration
             between the last systemic corticosteroid administration and the first dose of study
             drug should be at least 2 weeks.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
