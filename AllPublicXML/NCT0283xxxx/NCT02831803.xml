      This study is designed to test the feasibility of asking older adults with high blood
      pressure to supplement their daily diets with walnuts and extra-virgin olive oil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the
      United States, Americans have yet to widely adopt evidence-based dietary modifications
      necessary to reduce CVD risk factors. Encouraging evidence from the Prevención con Dieta
      Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial indicates that adding olive oil and nuts to the diets of older
      adults in Spain substantially impacted CVD risk factors and events.

      A large trial testing EVOO and nuts in a U.S. population is needed to determine if
      supplementing with EVOO and nuts can reduce risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in
      adults living in the U.S. Prior to launching a large trial, it is important to assess whether
      adults 55 and older would be interested in participating in a supplementation trial such as
      PREDIMED. Additionally, it is important to assess if they are willing to consume the nuts and
      EVOO and attend study related-data collection visits.

    <description>All participants will receive an 8-week supply of walnuts and Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). Study supplements will consist of 28 gm of walnuts and 32 gm of EVOO per day. Participants will be instructed how to consume the proper amount of walnuts and EVOO and to report their consumption using a compliance diary. The walnuts are pre-packaged in daily servings (one 28 g packet per day) and measuring spoons will be provided with the olive oil to assist participants in consuming it appropriately. Participants will also receive recipes and other written information that will assist them in incorporating both the nuts and olive oil into their existing dietary patterns.</description>
