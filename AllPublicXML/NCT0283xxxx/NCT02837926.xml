  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify global and local determinants of HPV vaccine acceptability, HPV
      vaccine uptake and compliance as well as identify logistics and programmatic issues in each
      country to offer the HPV vaccine, as a potential cervical cancer prevention strategy, to
      mid-aged women attending screening.

      3000 women aged within the age range of 25-45 years old will be recruited; 250-300 women per
      country. These women will be identified by means of screening registry lists or screening
      clinical visits. Eligible women will receive a study questionnaire on the HPV vaccine.
      Additionally, and independently of participating in the study questionnaire, those who accept
      will get 3 HPV vaccine doses. Depending on country preferences, either Cervarix®
      (Glaxosmithkline Biologicals, S.A.) at month 0, 1 and 6 or Gardasil® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC)
      at month 0, 2 and 6, will be administered.

      Safety data and HPV vaccine compliance will be assessed.

      A sub study in Spain will also analyze acceptability of HPV vaccination in a sample of women
      aged 35-40 yrs identified as poor screening attenders.

      Two independent informed consent forms will be provided; one for the study questionnaire
      participation and another for HPV vaccine administration.
