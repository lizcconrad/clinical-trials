  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention represents the gold standard for the treatment of
      ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, periprocedural bleedings are
      associated with an increased risk of mortality, re-infarction, and stroke. Although the
      prognostic value of access site related bleeding complications is still debated, transradial
      approach is associated with better short-term outcomes and reduced hospital stay as compared
      to transfemoral approach. The investigators aimed to compare transradial approach with
      transfemoral approach with systematic achievement of hemostasis by the implantation of a
      vascular closure device in a national multicentre randomized clinical trial.

    <description>Transradial coronary angiography will be performed by the Judkins technique using 6 French diameter sheaths and pre-molded catheters for selective catheterization of left and right coronary arteries. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment will be indicated when a culprit lesion is identified, with high probability of angiographic success, being ideally performed immediately after coronary angiography Procedures will be performed according to recommendations of current guidelines. To achieve hemostasis in the transradial approach, a radial compression device will be applied, to maintain patent antegrade flow.</description>
