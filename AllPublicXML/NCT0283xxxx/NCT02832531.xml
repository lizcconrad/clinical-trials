    <textblock>
      This program is a comprehensive evaluation of rheumatic valvular heart disease (RVHD), Atrial
      fibrillation (AF)/flutter and stroke.

      A prospective, randomized, open-label superiority trial comparing rivaroxaban to aspirin in
      high risk patients either with AF and unsuitable for VKA or without AF and with high risk
      factors.

Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast OR

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. RVHD diagnosed by echocardiography at any time prior to enrollment

          2. Age ≥18

          3. Increased risk of stroke by any of the following

               1. CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 OR

               2. Moderate/Severe mitral stenosis with valve area ≤2.0 cm2 OR

               3. Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast OR

               4. Left atrial thrombus

          4. Heart Rhythm

               1. AF or Flutter and unsuitable for VKA therapy. (AF or Flutter should be documented
                  on baseline 12-lead ECG, or on a previous 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor,
                  in-hospital ECG rhythm strip or Pacemaker or ICD electrogram). OR

               2. In the absence of AF or Flutter, patients would be eligible in the presence of
                  any one of the following:

               1. Left atrial enlargement ≥5.5 cm OR

               2. Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast OR

               3. Left atrial thrombus OR

               4. Frequent ectopic atrial activity (&gt;1000/24 hours) on Holter monitoring

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal to give informed consent

          2. Actively involved in any study that would compromise the protocol of INVICTUS Trial

          3. Severe co-morbid condition with life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          4. Other serious condition(s) or logistic factors likely to interfere with study
             participation or with the ability to complete the trial, as appropriate to country or
             region.

          5. Likely to have valve replacement surgery within 6 months

          6. Mechanical valve prosthesis or other condition requiring treatment with VKAs. Patients
             with deep vein thrombosis or recent pulmonary embolism can be enrolled where both VKAs
             and rivaroxaban are approved.

          7. Contraindication to the study medication of the trial

               -  Allergy to rivaroxaban

               -  Allergy to VKAs ( non-inferiority trial)

               -  Allergy to aspirin ( superiority trial)

          8. Severe renal insufficiency with an calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault)
             &lt;15 ml/min

          9. Serious bleeding in the past six months or at high risk for bleeding

         10. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment

         11. Ongoing need for dual antiplatelet therapy (patients with on-going aspirin therapy
             ≤100 mg per day are not excluded)

         12. Ongoing need for dual strong inhibitors of CYP-3a4 or p-glycoprotein inhibitor.

         13. Received an investigational drug in the past 30 days

         14. Patients considered unsuitable for trial inclusion because of unwillingness to attend
             follow up visits

         15. Women who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding

         16. Women of child bearing age who do not use an effective form of birth control.
