    <textblock>
      The Click-Mid-Upper Arm Circumference study aims to describe and compare the performance of a
      set of three simplified mid-upper arm circumference classification devices (&quot;Click-MUAC&quot;) for
      use by mothers and caregivers to screen for acute malnutrition in young children. The study
      will be conducted in Isiolo County, Kenya. The study builds on the recent approach of
      training mothers to screen for acute malnutrition in their own children (mother MUAC
      approach).

      The primary aim of the study is to describe and compare the performance of a set of three
      prototype Click-MUAC devices against a gold standard of classification, in terms of measures
      of agreement (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, Youden's J) for the
      classification (diagnosis) of acute malnutrition. A secondary aim of the study is to
      determine the difference in agreement with the gold standard classification amongst
      mothers/caregivers using a Click-MUAC prototype versus mothers/caregivers using a regular
      MUAC tape. The hypothesis of the study is that at least one of the Click-MUAC prototypes is
      equal to the gold standard of classification in terms of measures of agreement for the
      classification of acute malnutrition. A secondary hypothesis of the study is that agreement
      with the gold standard classification is better amongst mothers/caregivers using a Click-MUAC
      prototype compared to mothers/caregivers using a regular MUAC tape. The outcomes of the study
      will be used to decide on whether production of a Click-MUAC device is desirable and, if this
      is the case, to select a design based on the performance of the prototype devices and the
      stated preferences of intended users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a non-randomised, non-blinded, clinical diagnostic trial describing and
      comparing performance that will be conducted in two phases: (i) calibration of the devices,
      (ii) testing of Click-MUAC prototypes against &quot;gold standard&quot; classification.

      The study will take place at designated health facilities within Isiolo County that already
      have an IMAM programme running. The investigators expect that the health facilities with the
      highest number of acute malnutrition admissions will be selected as study sites in order to
      be able to test the prototypes on a large number of attending Severe Acute Malnutrition
      (SAM)/Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) children.

      The first phase of work will concentrate on the calibration of Click-MUAC prototypes. The
      performance of the Click-MUAC prototypes with regard to accuracy of classification will be
      assessed in children with a measured MUAC at or close to the 115 mm and 125 mm case-defining
      thresholds. This phase of work is required as prior testing of the Click-MUAC prototypes will
      only have been performed on semi-rigid testing tubes.

      The second phase of work will test the Click-MUAC prototypes. Three sets of
      measurements/classifications will be taken during the Click-MUAC testing trial: (i)
      Mother/caregiver MUAC classification performed by the mother/primary caregiver on their own
      child, using each of the three Click-MUAC prototypes and a regular MUAC tape; (ii) IMAM staff
      MUAC classification performed by the Integrated Management of Acute malnutrition (IMAM) staff
      on the same child, using each of the three Click-MUAC prototypes and a regular MUAC tape;
      (iii) Gold standard MUAC measurement performed by the study coordinator and/or data
      collection team members trained in the measurement of MUAC and selected for their accuracy
      (i.e. against the study supervisor) and precision of measurement, following a validation
      exercise using the Habicht method, on the same child. In addition, mothers/caregivers and
      IMAM staff will also be asked to state their preference of Click-MUAC prototype and asked to
      give reasons for their preference.

      The Click-MUAC devices are screening/diagnostic devices. Appropriate measures of agreement
      between the different measurer groups (mothers/primary caregivers, IMAM staff, gold standard)
      can be calculated from two-by-two contingency tables. The following appropriate measures of
      agreement will be calculated from these tables: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen' s
      Kappa, Younden's J. The analysis (i.e. two-by-two contingency table and estimation of
      appropriate measures of agreement) will be performed for each prototype Click-MUAC device. A
      discordancy analysis will also be performed. The aim of the discordancy analysis is to
      describe misclassifications in terms of the range, interquartile range, and median MUAC at
      each type of discordancy. This analysis provides further calibration information that may
      inform design changes that avoid/minimize gross misclassifications and to minimize the
      frequency of errors made at or close to class boundaries.

    <description>Youden's J is a chance-corrected measure of agreement that can be interpreted as the probability of making an informed decision using a given method of ascertaining case-status. The measure is estimated as:
J = Sensitivity + Specificity - 1
Sensitivity is defined as the ability of the Click-MUAC device to correctly detect patients who do have the condition (i.e. either severe wasting or moderate wasting or any wasting). The measure is mathematically defined as: sensitivity = a/(a+b) where a= true positive and b= false negative
Specificity is defined as the ability of the Click-MUAC device to correctly detect patients who do not have the condition (i.e. either severe wasting or moderate wasting or any wasting). The measure is mathematically defined as specificity= d/(c+d) where d=true negative and c=false positive</description>

    <description>The term &quot;accuracy&quot; best applies to agreement between true case status (from the gold standard measurement procedure) and classification by mothers or program staff.
The measure is mathematically defined as accuracy= (a+d)/(a+b+c+d) where a= true positive, b= false negative, c=false positive and d=true negative</description>

    <measure>Cohen's Kappa</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate (i.e. this measure can be calculated immediately upon data collection). The measure will be collected throughout study implementation for up to three months, for completion as planned for October 2016.</time_frame>
    <description>Cohen's Kappa is defined mathematically as:
Cohen's Kappa= (p_o-p_e)/(1-p_e )
The term p_o is observed agreement (calculated from the two-by-two contingency table) and the term p_e is expected agreement (also calculated from the two-by-two contingency table). Cohen's Kappa can be used with square contingency tables larger than the two-by-two case. The measure is useful for evaluating a Click-Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) device for more than two classes (e.g. severe wasting, moderate wasting, no wasting).</description>
