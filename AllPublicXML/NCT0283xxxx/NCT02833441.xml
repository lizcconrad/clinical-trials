      Youth with evidence of virologic failure defined as an HIV VL&gt;400 copies/mL on two
      consecutive occasions at least 1 month apart will be eligible for enrollment. Youth will be
      randomized to a community based peer counseling support group or clinic based standard of
      care, with viral load, and drug monitoring evaluations at 3 month intervals to determine the
      efficacy of the intervention in improving adherence and virologic suppression.

      Title The Peer Support Intervention - supporting HIV positive adolescents in Zimbabwe to
      improve HIV care continuum outcomes

      Short Title The Peer Support Intervention

      Study Design Prospective randomized study

      Study Duration 2 years

      Study Population 250 Youth (ages 10-24 years) with virologic failure

      Study Outcomes Primary Outcomes

      1. Virologic suppression rate in the The Peer Support Intervention group compared with the
      standard of care group following 48 weeks in the Peer Support Intervention.

      Secondary Outcomes

        1. Frequency of acquired drug resistance mutations among youth failing ART.

        2. Baseline prevalence of psychological distress among adolescents and young adults failing
           first line therapy

        3. Prevalence of psychological distress (measured using PHQ-A and SSQ) after 48 weeks of
           enrolment in the Peer Support Intervention compared with the standard of care

        4. Association between self-reported adherence, pill counts and objective surrogate markers
           of adherence obtained from plasma (viral load), DBS and hair (tenofovir concentrations).

        5. Effectiveness of point mutation assays for the detection of drug resistance as compared
           with standard sequencing techniques.

      Description of Intervention Youth with evidence of virologic failure defined as an HIV VL&gt;400
      copies/mL on two consecutive occasions at least 1 month apart will be eligible for
      enrollment. Youth will be randomized to a community based peer counseling support group or
      clinic based standard of care, with viral load, and drug monitoring evaluations at 3 month

    <description>Adolescents/young adults in the Peer Support Intervention arm will be referred to a Peer Support Intervention support group within their own or nearby community. This support group will meet monthly and will be facilitated by a professional HIV counsellor together with a Peer Support Intervention counselor. The Peer Support Intervention counsellors will provide regular counselling to their allocated participants through home visits and SMS messages. Each participant will be visited once a week in their home. Whatsapp messages will be delivered daily to each participant by the Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters. The agreed messages will briefly enquire about the participant's well-being without specifically making reference to HIV or ARVs. In addition, participants' caregivers will be invited to a 3-session intervention to build knowledge, skills and confidence to better support their adolescents.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Standard of Care Practice</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the standard of care group will receive adherence evaluations and counseling at the clinic as per the current standard of care. Current procedures involve a group counseling session given on Monday morning during which topics are discussed that are relevant to adolescents. In general children aged between 13-19 years attend these sessions. After the group counseling, adolescents also receive an individual counseling session before being evaluated by the clinic doctor. Youth are also encouraged to complete a self reported adherence questionnaire and may periodically undergo pill counts by the clinic counselors.
The adolescents may belong to peer support groups in their communities, however these activities are not part of the clinic program. No interventions are typically targeted at their caregivers.</description>
