        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient requires a chronic indwelling Foley catheter for at least 3 days.

          -  Catheters will not remain indwelling greater than 30 days at a time

          -  Patient is more than 18 years of age

          -  Patient is able to give informed consent

          -  Patient is able to attend follow-up sessions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is less than 18 years of age

          -  Patient is pregnant

          -  Patient with a known allergy to silicone

          -  Patient has urinary tract anatomic abnormality that would prevent placement of a
             standard Foley catheter

          -  Patient unable to accommodate the catheter

          -  Patient has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) or other diagnosed infection that
             is untreated.

          -  Patient currently taking (or expected to take) more than a single dose of antibiotics
             for prevention of other infections during the catheter indwell period

          -  Patient has uncontrolled fecal incontinence (uncontrolled stool/poop passage)

          -  Patient is unable to feel and/or communicate their symptoms

          -  Informed consent is unable to be obtained

          -  Patient is unable or unwilling to comply with the study follow-up schedule

          -  Patient has a medical condition or disorder that would limit life expectancy to less
             than 30 days or that may cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound the data
             analysis

          -  Any other reason that if in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrollment in the study
