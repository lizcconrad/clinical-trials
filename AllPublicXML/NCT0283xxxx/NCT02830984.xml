  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become one of the most important
      techniques in the treatment of bile duct stones. A number of studies have been conducted
      using large-balloon dilation (LBD) after adequate EST to extract large bile duct stones. In
      those studies, the authors suggested that EST plus LBD might lower the risk of post procedure
      pancreatitis (PEP) by directing balloon dilation toward the bile duct rather than the
      pancreatic duct. It has been reported that EPBD followed by insertion of nasobiliary drainage
      catheter can prevent PEP. However, it is still unclear that nasobiliary drainage after
      endoscopic sphincterotomy plus large-balloon dilation for preventing postoperative
      pancreatitis in treating of large bile duct stones.The investigators therefore designed a
      prospective randomized trial to determine whether nasobiliary drainage prevent PEP after
      endoscopic sphincterotomy plus LBD for the treatment of large bile duct stones.

      Patients enrolled were confirmed the presence of CBD stones using magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography. Patients with large bile duct stones were randomly assigned to
      EST+LBD+ENBD group and EST+LBD group. A descriptive analysis will be performed on primary
      endpoint, containing frequency of number and percentage of patients. A two proportion
      equality test will be conducted to explore whether incidence rates are different. Descriptive
      statistics including number (N), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, will
      be produced for all continuous variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and percentage of
      subjects will be produced for all categorical variables.
