    <textblock>
      The current standard for Prostate Cancer (PCa) detection remains taking 10-12 systematic
      biopsies of the prostate. This approach leads to overdiagnosis of insignificant PCa on the
      one hand and underdiagnosis and undergrading of significant PCa on the other. multiparametric
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) has seen an increasing uptake in the clinics for biopsy
      targeting, but the value in biopsy naive patients remains controversial. With Contrast
      Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised with the
      potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localisation
      significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS, all basing
      their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. To overcome these difficulties
      CEUS quantification techniques have been used with encouraging first results. These imaging
      techniques have been proposed to improve the yield of prostate biopsies and possibly
      replacing systematic biopsies.

      In this trial mpMRI imaging and CEUS + quantification are performed before primary biopsy.
      Using a fusion device, targeted biopsies are taken from predefined MRI lesions and CEUS
      lesions, together with standard systematic biopsies in the same patients by separate blinded
      clinicians. The main outcome measure is the per-patient (significant) prostate cancer
      detection rate for each of the biopsy regimens.
