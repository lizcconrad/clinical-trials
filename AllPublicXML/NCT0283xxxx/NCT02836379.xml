  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of radiotherapy, control of breakthrough pain represents a special challenge.
      Patients undergoing radiotherapy may experience different situations of pain that may be due
      to the need to remain immobilized during radiotherapy session, the need to wear an
      immobilization mask (head and neck cancer), the odynophagia caused by mucositis, defecation
      after the development of proctitis, or sudden pain during the night causing sleep
      disturbances.

      In a survey conducted in radiation oncology services more than half of patients treated with
      radiotherapy experienced pain, and 39% of patients reported that their pain was not treated
      properly. This situation may increase the patient's anxiety, dissatisfaction with treatment,
      affect their quality of life and can even come to refuse radiotherapy treatment.

      This post-authorization observational study will assess the quality of life of cancer
      patients with breakthrough cancer pain treated in radiotherapy services in Spanish hospitals.
