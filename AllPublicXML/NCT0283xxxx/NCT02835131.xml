  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare condition that can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.
      Current treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism is often suboptimal, and such individuals
      may respond to a new somatostatin analog, pasireotide. This is a compassionate use study of
      the effects of pasireotide on individuals with suboptimally treated congenital
      hyperinsulinism.

      Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rare condition that can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.
      Current treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism is often suboptimal, with diazoxide as the
      mainstay of treatment. Individuals who are not adequately treated with diazoxide may undergo
      pancreatectomy. Octreotide has been used with some success in congenital hyperinsulinism but
      there is limited data on pasireotide, the newest somatostatin receptor agonist, which,
      compared to octreotide, has 30-40 times greater affinity for somatostatin receptors 1 (SSTR1)
      and 5 (SSTR5), 5 times greater for somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) and a comparable affinity
      for somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2).

      In human islets, SSTR2 &amp; SSTR5 are present in beta cells. Therefore, there is reason to
      believe that pasireotide may have greater effectiveness than octreotide in preventing
      hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Indeed hyperglycemia is a known effect of pasireotide
      when used for treatment of Cushing's disease and Acromegaly. The current study is of
      compassionate use for prevention of hypoglycemia in individuals with congenital
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia who are not adequately treated with diazoxide.

                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

         18. If the patient is a sexually active male he is excluded unless he agrees to use a
             condom during intercourse while taking pasireotide and for 3 months after stopping
             pasireotide medication . They should not father a child in this period. A condom is
             required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug
             via seminal fluid
