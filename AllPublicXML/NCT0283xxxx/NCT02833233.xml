    <description>Patients will undergo breast biopsy with cryoablation 7-10 days prior to the planned surgery, and ipilimumab with nivolumab administration 1-5 days before cryoablation. All patients will undergo surgery at the pre-determined day defined at the initial surgical consultation. Women will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab 1-5 days prior to US or MRI-guided core biopsy and cryoablation date. Intravenous ipilimumab will be administered as a single 1 mg/kg dose to be infused intravenously over 90 minutes. Intravenous nivolumab will be administered as a single 3 mg/kg dose to be infused intravenously over 60 minutes.</description>

          -  Operable tumor measuring ≥1.5 cm in maximal diameter

               -  Any nodal status

               -  Multifocal and multicentric disease is permitted

               -  Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer is permitted

          -  Breast surgery planned

          -  Tumor amenable to cryoablation as determined by radiologist

          -  ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1

          -  Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria:

               -  White blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 2000/μL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^3/μL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL (or glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40 ml/min)

               -  AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Bilirubin within normal limits (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome, who must
                  have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

               -  Negative HIV screening test

               -  Negative screening tests for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Patients with positive
                  results that do not indicate true active or chronic infection may enroll after
                  discussion and consensus agreement by the treating physician and principal
                  investigator.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 3 months after
             the last dose of ipilimumab in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.
             See below for the definition of WOCBP.

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose
             of ipilimumab/nivolumab

                  treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
                  trigger are permitted to enroll.

               -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
                  drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol
                  therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.

               -  Chronic use of immunosuppressants and/or systemic corticosteroids (used in the
                  management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). However, use of
                  corticosteroids is allowed for the treatment of immune related Adverse Events
                  (irAEs), or adrenal insufficiency.

               -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases
                  within 4 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab.

               -  Prior treatment with a CD137 agonist, ipilimumab or other CTLA4 inhibitor;

               -  Prior investigational agents within 2 weeks prior to first dose of ipilimumab;
