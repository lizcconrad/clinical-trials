  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to better understand how children sleep at night at MSKCC, so that the
      investigators can learn how to improve the sleeping environment.

    <description>Eligible patients will be approached for enrollment after their first night in the hospital (i.e.: not on day of admission). Patient/parent will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire describing the child's general sleep habits prior to admission. The parent and/or child will then be asked to complete a questionnaire describing sleep while in the hospital; this in-hospital sleep questionnaire will be obtained for 3 consecutive nights after enrollment, or until discharge, whichever is soonest. A subgroup of patients (between the ages of 5 and 18) will be invited to participate in an additional aspect of the study, where they wear an actigraph (a small device that looks like a watch) for up to 72 hours. This device reliably measures sleep by monitoring the child's motion. This will be used to relate sleep perception to more objective measures of sleep as provided by actigraphy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent/Patient must provide written consent

          -  Patient must be between the ages of: Newborn - â‰¤ 18 years of age

          -  Patient is expected to be admitted to the Pediatric floor at MSK for at least 2 nights
             (patients/parents will not be approached for consent on day of admission or day of
             discharge)

          -  Patient/parent must be English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Expected length of stay of fewer than 2 nights (for example.: if admitted Monday and
             discharged Tuesday, patient/parent will not be eligible).

          -  Patient /Parent unable to complete questionnaire due to education or language
             barriers.

          -  Patients admitted to the PICU. (Only children on M9 will be included. It is known that
             sleep in the PICU is highly disordered; as such, we will be excluding PICU patients
             from this study).
