  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age, creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score has been used to evaluate the
      clinical prognostic to patients who underwent PCI. However, it is not known if ACEF score
      could evaluate the prognostic of recanalization of non-infarct-related coronary arteries
      (non-IRA) chronic total occlusions (CTO) in patients who successful underwent primary PCI.
      The objectivity of current study was to assess the prognostic value of ACEF score in acute
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with non-IRA CTO after successful
      primary PCI.

        Between January 2006 to December 2013, a total of 2952 consecutive and unselected acute
        STEMI patients were admitted to our hospital and treated with successful primary PCI.

        Among the 2952 patients with STEMI successful treatment by PCI, 395 patients (13.4%) had a
        non-IRA CTO lesion. 18 patients were excluded from current study as they death within 7
        days (n=6) or were not to follow-up (n=7). Due to unavailability of ejection fraction or
        renal function before CTO-PCI, ACEF score could not be calculated in 5 patients. The
        remaining 377 patients (95.4%) were finally analyzed in the study. 279 patients performed a
        staged CTO-PCI attempt(ranging 7-28 days) and was successful in 221 of them. Due to low
        possibility of PCI success or patients refused to perform PCI, 98 patients did not undergo
        the PCI attempt. The patients were then divided into successful CTO-PCI group (221
        patients) and failed/ non-attempted CTO-PCI group (156 patients).
