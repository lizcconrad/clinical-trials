  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bio-bank and Registry for StratIfication and Targeted intErventions in the Spectrum Of
      Type 2 Diabetes (BRITE-SPOT) has been set up to prospectively collect clinical data and
      biologically relevant samples from individuals with, and at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D),
      with the aim of delineating factors related to susceptibility, progression, complications and
      response to treatment. Expanded from BRITE-SPOT, Assessing the Progression to Type - 2
      Diabetes (APT-2D) is a prospective cohort with a focus on non-diabetics (normoglycemic or
      prediabetic), to expand the sample size and depth of metabolic phenotyping in these upstream
      groups, with the more targeted aim of delineating factors related to insulin sensitivity
      versus secretion, that relate to progression to T2D.

      This is a prospective open cohort study.

      The study will comprise the following periods:

      Screening

      • Complete screening checklist and informed consent form

      Procedures.

        -  Following the screening visit, subjects are required to return to undergo the following:

             -  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to assess glucose tolerance and beta cell
                function

             -  Frequently-Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance test (FSIVGTT) to assess acute
                insulin response to glucose

             -  Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EHC) to obtain the insulin sensitivity index and
                assess insulin action

        -  The Disposition index (DI) that quantifies the relationship between insulin sensitivity
           and insulin secretion, will be determined through the results obtained during FSIVGTT
           and EHC to determine subject's risk for Type 2 diabetes.

        -  OGTT will be repeated every 6 months to assess for conversion to Type 2 Diabetes. Plasma
           C-peptide, and glucose will be measured at 7 time points during the OGTT for minimal
           model assessment of beta cell function

        -  FSIVGTT and EHC will be repeated within 3 months of conversion to Type 2 Diabetes, or at
           3 years from recruitment, whichever comes sooner.
