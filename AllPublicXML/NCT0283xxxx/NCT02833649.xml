      To report on 4-year postoperative safety, efficacy, stability and predictability outcomes(to
      evaluate the visual, refractive, contrast sensitivity, defocus curve and aberrometric data
      preoperation, and compare with a similar postoperative outcomes) with the Toric Implantable
      Contact Lens (TICL) for Stable keratoconus. Investigators will study the four-year follow-up
      from this standardized, multi-center clinical investigation, support from clinical and
      optical viewpoints TICL implantation, in stable keratoconus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age (25-38).

          -  Stable refraction was distinctive by 6 subjective refractions within ± 0.50
             diopters(D) of spherical equivalent during 6 months after CXL.

          -  best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of +0.4 LogMAR (20/40) or better, -clear
             central cornea.

          -  normal anterior chamber depth at least 3 mm to endothelium .

          -  intraocular pressure (IOP)&lt;20 mm Hg and preoperative endothelial cell count related to
             age and the anterior chamber depth with regard to Food and Drug Administration
             recommendations.

          -  Width of Angle greater than 30°, a pupil diameter of less than 6.25 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with central corneal thickness of less than 450 μm.

          -  endothelial cell count of less than 2,000 cells/mm2 .

          -  anterior chamber depth of &lt;3 mm from endothelium to anterior capsule .

          -  Corneal opacification or scars, cataract, retinal detachment, glaucoma, retinopathy,
             macular degeneration, neuro ophthalmic diseases or ocular inflammation, history of
             keratitis (any form), peripheral marginal degeneration, previous corneal and/or
             intraocular surgeries, and autoimmune and/or connective tissue disease. The central
             corneal thickness limit of 450 μm would account for around 400 μm of remaining stromal
             thickness after removal of the epithelium, which is considered as the safety thickness
             for the residual stroma to avoid endothelial cell damage during the CXL procedure.
