    <textblock>
      An RCT (n=193) in two podoconiosis clinics in Ethiopia to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      research based skin management regimen compared to the current regimen. The experimental
      group added 2% glycerine to the current skin care regimen and used 1 litre of water in the
      water soak compared to the 6 litres used in the current regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) affects some of the poorest people in
      20 countries in the world. In Ethiopia least 3 million people are affected with 17 million at
      risk. Irritant minerals (smectite, mica and quartz) from volcanic soil and pathogens enter
      skin breaches in the feet causing inflammation, lymphoedema and hyperkeratosis. Podoconiosis
      is preventable and treatable but is not curable. Current treatment consists of educating
      those with disease on its causes, prevention and treatment. Treatment taught in the Action on
      Podoconiosis (APA) Clinics consists of a daily hygiene regimen of washing the feet/legs with
      soap, soaking the feet and legs in water with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI) (0.0125%) added as
      a disinfectant, air drying and the application of a thin layer of petrolatum jelly.
      Whitfields ointment (benzoic acid and salicylic acid) is applied to any fungal infections.
      Wearing shoes is encouraged but this does not offer complete protection against the alkaline
      soil.

      Although the current treatment skin care regimen is effective there is no robust evidence on
      optimal skin care regimens to improve skin barrier function in this disease.

      Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of a new, low-cost, evidence-based skin care
      intervention to improve SBF in the lower limbs of those with podoconiosis.

      Method. A randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted over 3 months in two APA Clinics
      (n=193). Intervention was 2% glycerine (v/v) added to a reduced amount of soaking water (1
      litre versus 6 litres). The control group received the current skin care regimen. The primary
      outcome measure was skin barrier function (SBF). This was determined by measures of
      trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at four specific sites
      on the lower limbs.

    <measure>Change in TEWL at Top of Outer Lower Legs</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline following 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured with a Vapometer (non-invasive probe) on the outer lower leg 8 cms below the head of the fibula. TEWL is the water lost through the skin under non-sweating conditions. It is the major indicator of healthy skin. A reduction in TEWL indicates a positive effect on skin barrier function. It is generally recommended that differences or percentage changes are reported rather than absolute values.</description>

    <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured with a Vapometer (non- invasive probe) at a specific point on the outer lower leg. This was mid-way between the measurement site at the top of the outer leg and the site at the base of the outer lower leg. TEWL is the water lost through the skin under non-sweating conditions. It is the major indicator of healthy skin. A reduction in TEWL indicates a positive effect on skin barrier function.

        <title>Change in TEWL at Top of Outer Lower Legs</title>
        <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured with a Vapometer (non-invasive probe) on the outer lower leg 8 cms below the head of the fibula. TEWL is the water lost through the skin under non-sweating conditions. It is the major indicator of healthy skin. A reduction in TEWL indicates a positive effect on skin barrier function. It is generally recommended that differences or percentage changes are reported rather than absolute values.</description>
        <time_frame>Change from baseline following 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
        <population>3 month post intervention data was missing from one male participant in the control group. One left leg in the control group and one right and one left leg in the experimental group was not affected by podoconiosis so they were not included in the study.</population>

        <description>SCH was measured mid-way between the measurement site at the top of the outer leg and the site at the base of the outer lower leg. It was measured with a MoistureMeter (non-invasive probe).This measures skin capacitance in arbitrary units. It is generally recommended that differences or percentage changes are reported rather than absolute values. Increases in stratum corneum hydration indicate a positive effect on skin barrier function.</description>

          <title>Change in Stratum Corneum Hydration at Top of Feet</title>
          <description>Stratum corneum hydration measured at a specific point on the middle top of the foot with a MoistureMeter (non-invasive probe).This measures skin capacitance in arbitrary units. It is generally recommended that differences or percentage changes are reported rather than absolute values. Increases in stratum corneum hydration indicate a positive effect on skin barrier function.</description>
