  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well selumetinib works in treating patients with
      neurofibromatosis type 1 and cutaneous neurofibromas. Selumetinib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if selumetinib can result in shrinkage cutaneous neurofibromas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of selumetinib on target inhibition in cutaneous neurofibroma(s) excised
      prior treatment and on treatment with selumetinib for analysis of percent inhibition of
      phosphorylated ERK (pERK), and changes in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of selumetinib on the development on new cutaneous neurofibromas while
      on treatment with selumetinib.

      II. Assess the effect of selumetinib on target inhibition in cutaneous neurofibroma(s)
      excised prior treatment and on treatment with selumetinib for analysis of the tumor kinome.

      III. Assess the effect of selumetinib skin related morbidity using the Skindex patient
      reported outcome measure.

      IV. Quantify the development of new cutaneous neurofibromas on treatment with selumetinib.

      V. Detailed pathologic analysis of cutaneous neurofibromas pretreatment and on treatment with
      selumetinib for changes in cell composition (including macrophage and mast cell
      infiltration).

      VI. Investigate alterations that correlate with cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) response to
      selumetinib treatment with pilot genomic, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, and
      transcriptomic studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The width, length, and height will be measured, and the volume of each of the neurofibromas measured will be calculated. The effect of selumetinib will be separately evaluated 3-5 small (longest neurofibroma diameter 3-7 mm) and 3-5 larger (longest neurofibroma diameter &gt;= 8 mm) neurofibromas in each of the 3 regions. The sum of the on-treatment volumes for the smaller tumors will be subtracted from the pre-treatment volumes of the same tumors to arrive at an overall percentage change in tumor size for each patient. This will be repeated for the larger tumors. Then, the average percentage change for each size category will be reported along with its 95% confidence interval, and other associated statistics.</description>

          -  Patients who received prior medical therapy for a NF1 related tumor must have
             recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to =&lt; grade 1 Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4 before entering this
             study

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 4 weeks after dosing with selumetinib
             ceases; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             entry; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her

             another consent, such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pediatric Oncology
             Branch (POB) screening protocol; studies or procedures that were performed for
             clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for
             screening or baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was
             obtained, if the patient agrees
