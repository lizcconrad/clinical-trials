  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: The neuraxial blocks, spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia are among the most
      frequently performed procedures worldwide, and despite the advancements of medical equipment,
      remain dependent on experience and practice of the anesthesiologists. Although antisepsis
      takes part of the daily routine, there are still no solid scientific evidence of the most
      appropriate antiseptic for these procedures.

      Objective: To compare the 70% alcohol and 0.5% chlorhexidine alcohol solution in skin
      antisepsis for the neuraxial blocks.

      Methods: This is a clinical trial, a prospective, randomized study. There will be selected,
      consecutively, 70 patients candidates for neuraxial blocks. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to group A (n = 35), in which the antisepsis will be performed with alcohol 70%, and
      to group B (n = 35), in which the antiseptic will be performed with the 0.5% chlorhexidine in
      alcoholic solution. Samples will be collected with swabs in an area of 25 cm² for bacterial
      cultures three times: in pre-antisepsis moments, in the second minute after antisepsis, and
      immediately after the puncture. The number of colonies forming units per square centimeter
      (CFU / cm²) will be counted. The data will be analyzed statistically.
