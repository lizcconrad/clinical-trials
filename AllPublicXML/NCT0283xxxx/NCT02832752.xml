    <textblock>
      The addition of an Extracorporeal-Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) service to a region
      may improve the survival of young patients with sudden unexpected cardiac arrest.The primary
      aim of this study is to determine the benefit of the systematic integration of ECPR services
      into the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest management algorithm. This study is a controlled
      parallel group design with group allocation based on region of treatment. The investigators
      will compare the outcomes of ECPR-eligible patients in the intervention region, in comparison
      to patients meeting the same criteria in a comparable setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      British Columbia is a province which contains four metropolitan areas, each of which contains
      at least one tertiary care centre that provides Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)
      and cardiovascular surgery services, in addition to critical cardiology services and a
      coronary catheterization laboratory. Pre-hospital medical care in all areas is provided by
      British Columbia Emergency Health Services (BCEHS), which uses a tiered system of basic life
      support and advanced life support (ALS) paramedics (90% of cases have ALS involvement) in
      coordination with fire department first responders. Medical providers in the study footprint
      have extensive experience with interventional trials enrolling patients with out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest, through participation in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium.

      Through collaboration of clinicians from all areas and with BCEHS, this study will examine
      the benefit of a regional ECPR protocol established in one of the metropolitan areas (the
      &quot;ECPR Protocol Region&quot;), in comparison to the other areas (the &quot;Usual Care Region&quot;). The
      primary aim is to determine the benefit of incorporating ECPR services into a regional
      medical system of care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. All patients with out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest treated by emergency medical services (EMS) in both regions will be
      prospectively evaluated for study eligibility.

      Secondary aims include:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of ECPR therapy for those with refractory cardiac arrest
           after 45 minutes of attempted resuscitation.

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a regional ECPR protocol, in comparison to historical
           controls.

        3. To evaluate the long-term (5-year) outcomes of patients treated with ECPR.

        4. To evaluate the quantity of successful organ procurement from those treated with ECPR.

        5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a regional ECPR protocol.

      This controlled study is a parallel group design with group allocation based on region of
      treatment. The investigators will compare the outcomes of ECPR-eligible patients in the
      intervention region, in comparison to patients meeting the same criteria in a comparable
      setting.

      The effect of treatment group will be assessed while adjusting for other important
      prognosticators in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (including initial cardiac rhythm, time to
      emergency medical services [EMS] arrival, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR],
      EMS-witnessed arrest, and age). In addition, as the region of the cardiac arrest may be an
      independent predictor of outcomes, this will be included in the final adjustment. The
      investigators prospectively collected data on patients that fit the study criteria in both
      regions between 2012 and 2015. Outcomes in this historical data will be compared between
      regions, as well as historical data from each region individually compared to the study
      period, in order to estimate the independent effect of region of treatment.

    <description>The ECPR region has incorporated ECPR therapy into the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest algorithm. Within the ECPR Protocol, full standard advanced cardiac life support treatments will continue up until the time of ECMO initiation. The anticipated enrolment in this group is 70 patients. All eligible patients in the region will be enrolled, regardless of whether the ECPR protocol is activated or whether the patient is actually treated with ECPR.</description>

    <description>The control region will continue usual care as per current protocols which include standard advanced cardiac life support. Patients will be enrolled in the control region group at the same juncture of study eligibility. The anticipated enrolment in this group is 350 patients.
Within BCEHS practice, transport to hospital without prior return of spontaneous circulation is rare. Termination of resuscitation must be approved by an on-call physician and cannot occur prior to 30 minutes of resuscitation efforts.</description>

    <description>The regional protocol is activated for eligible patients who remain pulseless after 3 cycles of resuscitation, and intubation. The hospital team is activated at this time, which includes the emergency department team, a perfusionist, and a cardiovascular surgeon. A mechanical CPR device (Lucas chest compression device) is applied at this time and the patient is transported to hospital. The goal times from first professional CPR to ECMO flows is &lt; 60 minutes, and from emergency department (ED) arrival to ECMO flows &lt; 30 minutes.</description>
