      The purpose of the present study is to compare the safety and efficacy of up to 2 injections
      of NKA given 3 to 6 months apart (maximum) in subjects who are randomized to receive their
      first treatment as soon as the NKA product is made available versus subjects who are
      randomized to undergo contemporaneous, standard-of-care treatment for CKD during the first 12
      18 months prior to receiving up to 2 injections of NKA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKA is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells obtained from each individual
      subject's kidney biopsy. To manufacture NKA, biopsy tissue from each enrolled subject will be
      sent to Twin City Bio LLC, in whose facilities renal cells will be expanded and SRC selected.
      SRC will be formulated in a gelatin-based hydrogel at a concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL,
      packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the clinical site.

      Based on preclinical data, the dose of NKA will be 3 x 106 cells/g estimated kidney weight (g
      KWest). Since the concentration of SRC per mL of NKA is 100 x 106 cells/mL, the dosing volume
      will be 3.0 mL for each 100 g of kidney weight.

      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the Active Treatment Group or the Deferred Treatment
      Group following renal biopsy. Subjects in the Active Treatment Group will receive their first
      NKA injection as soon as the NKA product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site.
      After 3 months (+12 weeks), a second injection will be given, as appropriate. In contrast,
      subjects in the &quot;Deferred Treatment Group&quot; will undergo a period of observation after renal
      biopsy. During this time, they will receive contemporaneous, standard-of-care therapy for CKD
      while undergoing follow-up evaluations every 3 months similar to subjects in the Active
      Treatment Group. After 12-18 months (maximum), subjects from the Deferred Treatment Group
      will receive a series of up to two NKA injections given 3 months (+12 weeks) apart, as
      appropriate. Consequently, the study design includes a randomized control group receiving
      standard-of-care treatment for the first 12-18 months and a randomized, active treatment
      group receiving up to two NKA injections and follow-up evaluations during the same period of
      time. In addition, each subject's baseline rate of renal decline, based on adequate
      historical, clinical data obtained 18 months prior to NKA injection, will serve as a
      comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal insufficiency over time.

      The rate of progression of renal insufficiency for the Active Treatment Group (assessed via
      serial measurements of eGFR pre-randomization through 12 months after the last NKA injection)
      will be compared against that of the Deferred Treatment Group (ie, contemporaneous control
      group). In addition, each subject's baseline rate of eGFR decline (derived from adequate
      historical, clinical data) will be compared against the individual subject's rate of eGFR
      decline through 12 months following the final NKA treatment. The rate of progression of renal
      insufficiency from subjects (if any) who received a single NKA injection may be compared
      against that from subjects who received two NKA injections.

      Subjects will complete the KDQOL survey, which is a kidney-specific measure of health-related
      quality of life (ie, Kidney Disease and Quality of Life™ [KDQOL™-36] Version 1). Scores from
      the Active Treatment Group will be compared against scores from the Deferred Treatment Group.
      Subjects from the Deferred Treatment Group will comprise the contemporaneous control group
      for the analysis of KDQOL scores. In addition, each subject's baseline scores will be
      compared against the individual subject's KDQOL scores obtained through 12 months after the
      last NKA injection. Additionally, KDQOL scores from subjects who received a single NKA
      injection may be compared against scores from subjects who received two injections.
