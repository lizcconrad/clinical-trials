      This program is a comprehensive evaluation of rheumatic valvular heart disease (RVHD), Atrial
      fibrillation (AF)/flutter and stroke.

      A prospective, randomized, parallel group, open-label clinical trial of rivaroxaban versus
      standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy to evaluate non-inferiority of rivaroxaban to
      VKA, with testing for superiority if non-inferiority is satisfied.

          3. Increased risk of stroke by any of the following

               -  CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 OR

               -  Moderate/Severe mitral stenosis with valve area ≤2.0 cm2 OR

               -  Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast OR

               -  Left atrial thrombus

          4. Heart Rhythm *AF or Flutter should be documented on baseline 12-lead ECG, or on a
             previous 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor, in-hospital ECG rhythm strip or Pacemaker or ICD
             electrogram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal to give informed consent

          2. Actively involved in any study that would compromise the protocol of INVICTUS Trial

          3. Severe co-morbid condition with life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          4. Other serious condition(s) or logistic factors likely to interfere with study
             participation or with the ability to complete the trial, as appropriate to country or
             region.

          5. Likely to have valve replacement surgery within 6 months

         11. Ongoing need for dual antiplatelet therapy (patients with on-going aspirin therapy
             ≤100 mg per day are not excluded)

         12. Ongoing need for dual strong inhibitors of CYP-3a4 or p-glycoprotein inhibitor.

         13. Received an investigational drug in the past 30 days

         14. Patients considered unsuitable for trial inclusion because of unwillingness to attend
             follow up visits

         15. Women who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding

         16. Women of child bearing age who do not use an effective form of birth control.
