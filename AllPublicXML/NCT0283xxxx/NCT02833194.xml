  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the prevalence of the
      following psychiatric pathologies (based on the MINI5.0.0 questionnaire) among 3 groups of
      women (Leiden versus aP1Ab-positive versus thrombophilia-negative) with similar obstetrical
      histories 10 years after their initial assessment/diagnosis.

        -  Mood disorders, including depressive episodes during the previous two weeks, recurrent
           depressive disorders at any point in life, dysthymia in the last two years, or any
           current or past manic episode;

        -  Anxiety disorders, including current agoraphobia, current panic disorders, agoraphobia
           with panic disorders, current social phobia, generalized anxiety in the last 6 months,
           or current posttraumatic stress syndrome;

        -  Apparent psychotic syndromes, including isolated or recurrent psychotic syndromes, past
           or present (clinically validated),

        -  Current alcohol or drug problems (dependence or abuse).

        Patients were selected via the regional NOHA (Nîmes Obstetricians and Hematologists -
        Antiphospholipid Syndrome study) network, which referred women with losses of spontaneous
        pregnancies to the Hematology Outpatient Department of the Nîmes University Hospital.
