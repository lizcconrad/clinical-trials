      A prospective, randomized, controlled single-center clinical Study designed to evaluate
      Physician Preference related to the use of the SurgiQuest AirSeal® Insufflation System (AIS)
      at low vs. higher pressures for the Management of pneumoperitoneum. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 treatment device to control ratio into one of two (2) different study
      arms:

        1. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg ±1mmHg; or

        2. AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 15mmHg ±1mmHg.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed and powered to demonstrate superiority of the AIS at low pressure vs.
      at higher pressure on a single key effectiveness measure: Incidence of shoulder pain.
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either AIS with an insufflation pressure target of 9mmHg
      ±1mmHg or to AIS with an insufflation target pressure of 15mmHg ±1mmHg.

      Secondary outcome measures include severity of shoulder pain measured using a VAS scale and
      medication use, length of hospital stay, aspects of anesthesia management including end tidal
      CO2 and the frequency of adverse events. These outcomes will be evaluated in a controlled
      population undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

    <intervention_name>AirSeal® Insufflation System (AIS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The AirSeal® System consists of an insufflation, filtration, and recirculation system (AirSeal® iFS), a triple lumen filtered tube set, and a valve free trocar (AirSeal® Access Port). The device enables peritoneal access with a novel mechanism to maintain pneumoperitoneum without a mechanical seal. Specifically, the AirSeal® System creates a pressure barrier within the proximal housing of the cannula which acts as an invisible seal to maintain pneumoperitoneum during the course of surgery. It utilizes a re-circulation and filtration control unit (AirSeal® iFS) designed specifically for the AirSeal® Access Port to create and maintain the pressure barrier.</description>
