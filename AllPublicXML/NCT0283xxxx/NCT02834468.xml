  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaken by Qilu Hospital, Shandong University in China. In order to report
      the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone combined with rituximab, cyclosporin and intravenous
      immunoglobulin in the management of newly diagnosed ITP patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multicenter trial of 100 primary ITP adult patients from
      5 medical centers in China. All participants receive dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of
      40 mg per day for 4 days), rituximab (given intravenously at a dose of 500mg once),
      cyclosporin (given orally at a dose of 2.5-3 mg/kg per day for 28 days) and intravenous
      immunoglobulin (given intravenously at a dose of 5g per month for 6 months) for the treatment
      of adults newly diagnosed ITP patients.
