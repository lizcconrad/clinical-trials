      This single center, comparative design study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an
      experimental stannous fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity
      (DH) after short term use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, three day, randomized, examiner blind, two treatment arm,
      parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected
      test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet
      all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. DH will be assessed at
      baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3 days twice daily brushing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as participant's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth. Response of participant was scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score indicates improvement in sensitivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold Immediately After Single Use and on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after single use (after 5 minutes) and on Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

          <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. Tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. Tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking participant whether sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as tactile threshold. Higher tactile threshold, less sensitive tooth.</description>
