  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disease in the pediatric population,
      where classical medical treatment does not always prove effective. This clinical entity has
      an impact on the individual physiological balance particularly on the autonomic regulation.
      Studies concerning adults with irritable bowel syndrome, showed significant changes in heart
      rate variability indices (HRV: heart rate variability).

      The study of time and frequency domain analysis of HRV allows noninvasive and reproducible
      assessment of the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.

      The investigators hypothesize that the sympathovagal balance could be altered in children in
      case of prolonged nociceptive stress as the investigators find it in IBS. In recent years,
      the control of pediatric pain experienced considerable growth through hypnosis techniques and
      several studies have shown analgesic efficacy with a beneficial effect in terms of quality of
      life in children.

      Our study aims to assess the impact of the hypno-analgesia treatment of IBS on sympathovagal
      balance. The investigators propose to realize in 7 to 18 years old children with IBS a single
      center prospective study to highlight after a standardized hypnosis program, changes in the
      time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability and clinical or quality of life
      parameters. The primary endpoint will be the high frequency HF indice. Secondary endpoints
      will be the other indices of HRV (Ptot, VLF, LF, ratio LF / HF, SDNN, SDANN, pNN50, RMSSD),
      the Quality of Life Questionnaire values (PedsQL ™ 4.0) a pain scale and the composite score
      of Francis.
