  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give patients with cancer a low
      dose of the FDA approved anesthetic drug ketamine at the same time they receive radiation,
      chemotherapy, and/or surgery for their cancer treatment to treat depression and its effects.
      Researchers would also like to see if giving ketamine at the same time as cancer treatment is
      practical and reasonably acceptable to the patient.

      Depression has many negative consequences for outcomes in those with cancer. It causes
      delayed treatments, increases in hospital lengths of stay, decreases in treatment adherence,
      poorer self-care, and decreased quality of life, even at 3 years post treatment. The presence
      of depression is the number one predictor of incomplete treatment and difficulty with
      rehabilitation. Therefore, investigators would also like to see if it is feasible to give
      patients ketamine during their routine cancer treatment treat depression and its negative
      effects on cancer treatment outcomes, and also help with anxiety, pain, and quality of life.
      The study will also use a placebo to compare to the good and/or bad effects of ketamine. A
      placebo is not an active drug and it will be look the same as ketamine, as a liquid to be
      taken by mouth.

      Ketamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a general anesthetic
      by itself for some diagnostic and surgical procedures or combined with other general
      anesthetic agents. It has also been shown to reduce cancer pain. Ketamine is considered
      experimental in this study because it is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      depression.

      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, two-arm feasibility study of
      oral ketamine versus placebo for the treatment of depression in depressed patients with
      cancer undergoing curative intent cancer therapy. Approximately 20 patients with cancer about
      to undergo cancer therapy will be randomized 1:1 to receive study treatment with one of the
      following regimens:

      Arm A: nightly oral administration of 1.0 mg/kg ketamine Arm B: nightly oral administration
      of placebo (after completion of Arm B, patients will have the option to receive a nightly
      oral administration of 1.0 mg/kg ketamine and follow study procedures over again)

      Consenting patients will undergo screening procedures, and if eligible, a baseline interview
      and brief questionnaires regarding depression, mental and emotional health, and quality of
      life assessments.

      Study treatment will be administered for 12 weeks unless the patient experiences unacceptable
      toxicities, exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms, or withdraws consent. Patients
      on the placebo treatment arm will have the option to receive ketamine and follow all study
      procedures over again with the ketamine drug after completion of the placebo treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete psychosocial measurements every two weeks while on study
      treatment and monthly during a five-month follow-up period.
