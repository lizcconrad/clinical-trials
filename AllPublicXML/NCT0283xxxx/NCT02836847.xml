  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of target
      therapy according to genomic and proteomic profiling combined with GEMOX in advanced or
      recurrent extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genomic profiling studies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a tumor to detect genetic
      changes or abnormalities. immuno-histochemistry tests reveal the abnormal activation status
      of signal pathways involved in study.These information will be used to recommend target
      therapy which may be more likely to result in a beneficial response.Patients will receive
      target anti-tumor agents according to the result of genomic and proteomic profiling.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>percentage of patients with Clinical Benefit Response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Composite measure based on patient-reported pain (per Faces pain scale revised), patient-reported pain medication, Karnofsky performance status(KPS), and weight. Clinical benefit is indicated by either:(a) improvement in pain (less pain intensity with stable or decreased pain medication; or less pain medication with stable or decreased pain intensity) with stable or improved KPS; or (b) improvement in KPS with stable or improved pain.With stable for KPS and pain, clinical benefit may be indicated with an observation of positive weight change.
Clinical benefit response (CBR) was classified weekly and a patient was considered a clinical benefit responder if clinical benefit was observed and maintained over a 4 week period.</description>
