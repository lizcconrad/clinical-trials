  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The robot-assisted surgery for benign and malignant thyroid tumors was widely developed in
      Asia and begins to spread in Western countries. The main advantage of the technique is to
      avoid a scar in the neck by placing it either in the axilla or at the hairline behind the ear
      to improve esthetic consequences and body image. It is not surgery minimally invasive but
      rather a way of remote access surgery.

      Data from the literature including cohort studies and meta-analyzes attest the security of
      the procedure in comparison with classic thyroid surgery (which remains the &quot;gold standard&quot;).
      However there is few data on the effectiveness of the technique in terms of the completeness
      of the surgery, according to the routine standard criteria used in endocrinology and
      endocrine cancer, and no French medico-economic study has been performed.
