    <textblock>
      Ciclosporin A (CsA) is an immunosuppressive drug used in organs and tissues transplantations
      (kidney, heart, liver, bone marrow ...) to prevent rejection, and in different autoimmune or
      inflammatory diseases. A therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is required during a CsA
      treatment. It is justified by a narrow therapeutic range between efficiency and
      nephrotoxicity, and by large intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. TDM of
      CsA is conventionally performed by determining residual concentration, and sometimes
      concentration at 2 hours after administration. TDM of CsA is currently performed by venous
      sampling on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling could be
      a particularly interesting alternative to conventional blood sampling. With DBS, capillary
      blood is obtained from a finger prick by the patient himself, and the blood drop obtained is
      deposited on filter paper, which can be stored at room temperature and then be sent to the
      laboratory by mail.

      This sampling method has several advantages : it requires small blood volumes, it is less
      invasive than conventional venous sampling, sampling can be performed by the patient himself
      at home few days before the consultation, and the results of the analysis can be available to
      the clinician on the day of consultation, allowing dose adjustment more quickly.

      Several studies have been published in recent years using DBS sampling method, for various
      drugs such as antimalarials, antiepileptics, antiretrovirals, metformin, benzodiazepines, or
      immunosuppressants. Only one clinical validation study of TDM of CsA using DBS method was
      published by Wilhelm et al. (2013) in a population of 38 patients who received allogeneic
      stem cell transplant recipients. The results showed excellent correlation between the
      concentrations determined by the two sampling methods.

      The investigators propose an observational study at the University Hospital of Caen for
      clinical validation of DBS sampling for TDM of CsA in kidney transplantation, for which there
      are no data published. During a nephrology consultation, for each patient, venous and finger
      prick blood samples are simultaneously collected. CsA assays were performed by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the two sampling methods. A specific
      LC-MS/MS assay method applied for DBS samples was developed and validated for this study
      (DBS/LC-MS/MS). Correlation between the results obtained from the two sampling methods will
      be evaluated, on at least 100 samples. Patients have to answer a questionnaire to assess pain
      and comfort of DBS sampling, and feasibility of self-sampling at home by this method. The aim
      of this clinical validation study of DBS sampling is the establishment of the systematic TDM
      of CsA for renal transplant patients by DBS sampling at the University Hospital of Caen.
