  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) has been a
      well-recognized complication with significant morbidity and even mortality. A variety of
      possible mechanisms has been suggested in the occurrence of pancreatitis, but papillary edema
      caused by manipulations during cannulation or endoscopic treatment has received the most
      attention. The papillary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction of pancreatic juice,
      and then increase ductal pressure, resulting in the occurrence of pancreatitis. Topical
      application of epinephrine on the papilla may reduce papillary edema. Moreover, it is
      reported that epinephrine sprayed on the papilla may be effective to prevent PEP. However, it
      is still unclear that epinephrine sprayed on the papilla can prevent acute pancreatitis after
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We therefore designed a prospective
      randomized trial to determine whether epinephrine sprayed on the papilla prevent PEP after
      ERCP.

      Between July 2016 and December 2017, 670 consecutive patients older than 18 years who are
      scheduled to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at the Anhui Provincial Hospital will be
      recruited for the study. Patients were randomized using opaque, sealed envelopes containing
      random numbers assigning them to undergo a spray of epinephrine (epinephrine group) or saline
      (control group) on the major papilla. A two proportion equality test will be conducted to
      explore whether incidence rates are different. Descriptive statistics including number (N),
      mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, will be produced for all continuous
      variables. Frequency tables of number (N) and percentage of subjects will be produced for all
      categorical variables.
