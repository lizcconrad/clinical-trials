  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous cardiovascular monitoring as part of management of high-risk surgical patients is
      widely practiced, however its role in low-risk surgical patients is unclear. Detailed
      monitoring of cardiovascular parameters from pre-induction stage allows clinicians to
      individualise anaesthetic management in the perioperative period. The investigators' aim was
      to investigate haemodynamic and Bispectral Index (BIS) changes in healthy patients undergoing
      surgery following induction of anaesthesia with propofol using a continuous non-invasive
      blood pressure device (LiDCOrapid™).

      Recruitment Orthopaedic surgical teams, anaesthetists and theatre staff were made aware of
      the study that was being conducted at the investigators' institution. Prospective subjects
      that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the hospital operating theatre's
      database two weeks prior to surgery. A letter, which contained the study's objectives and
      methods, was sent out to all patients. Subsequently, a telephone call was made to patients
      one week before surgery to clarify any queries they had. Consent was obtained on the morning
      of surgery. All study participants provided written informed consent.

      Peri-operative monitoring LiDCO™ CNAP and BIS monitoring were attached prior to induction of
      anaesthesia in the anaesthetic room of the operating theatre. A standardised anaesthetic
      technique was used for every participant, consisting of propofol induction, sevoflurane
      maintenance to a target BIS (40-60) and opioid analgesia with fentanyl. Participants
      underwent positive pressure ventilation to a tidal volume of 8ml/kg.

      Measurements of the following variables were taken continuously from pre-induction to time of
      extubation: heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic
      vascular resistance and BIS. Data recorded up to 3 minutes following propofol injection was
      analysed to capture the post-induction period. Further measurements were taken in recovery
      room. The total quantity and type of fluids, drugs administered, time of tourniquet
      application and removal (if performed), and the duration of the operation were recorded.

    <description>Young, healthy adult patients (ASA I and II) undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia will be included in to this study. We will compare the standard monitored group of patients with the LiDCO rapid™ monitored group. We will use in the LiDCO rapid™ CNAP monitoring group, the continuous real time haemodynamic monitoring through non-invasive arterial pressure waveform. The monitor LiDCO rapid™ CNAP permits, through analysis the arterial blood pressure trace, to acquire information about CO, SVR, HR variability, SV and BIS.</description>
