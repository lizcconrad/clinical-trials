    <textblock>
      This study compared efficacy and safety of Ilaprazole based bismuth-containing quadruple
      regimen therapy including Ilaprazole 5mg, Bismuth Potassium Citrate 220mg, Clarithromycin
      500mg and Amoxicillin Cap (Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID on the first line eradication treatment of
      H.pylori.

      Participants are defined as persons who have endoscopically confirmed on gastric or duodenal
      ulcer(including scar stage), gastritis and dyspepsia confirmed to be H.pylori positive
      patients in the biopsy and UBT test. For 14 days, participants treated as Esoprazole based
      bismuth-containing quadruple regimen therapy therapy including Esoprazole 20mg, Bismuth
      Potassium Citrate 220mg, Clarithromycin 500mg and Amoxicillin Cap (Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID.
      After treatment, the healing rate was evaluated in the UBT test and Biopsy at 49±5days from
      the first day dosing.
