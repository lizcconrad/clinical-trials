      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ascorbic acid when given
      together with bevacizumab in treating patients with high grade glioma that has come back
      (recurrent). Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Ascorbic acid contains ingredients that may prevent or slow
      the growth of high grade glioma. Giving bevacizumab and ascorbic acid together may work
      better in treating patients with high grade glioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of intravenous ascorbic acid
      given three times weekly in combination with intravenous bevacizumab every two weeks in
      patients with recurrent high grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum ascorbic acid (using high performance liquid
      chromatography [HPLC] with coulometric electrochemical detection) during therapy with
      ascorbic acid and bevacizumab.

      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 2 cycles of therapy with ascorbic acid
      and bevacizumab.

      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent high grade
      glioma treated with therapy with ascorbic acid and bevacizumab. Patients with stable or
      responsive disease after every 2 cycles will continue on therapy with ascorbic acid and
      bevacizumab until intolerance or progressive disease.

      IV. To descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ascorbic acid.

      Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes three times per week
      (at least 24 hours apart) and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.
