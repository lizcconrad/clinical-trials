  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot cross-sectional study of measured transcutaneous CO-oximetry in children with
      inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and young adults age 6-24 with the following conditions: asthma, pneumonia, allergic
      rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, and well child (without inflammatory illness) will be recruited.

      Subjects will be asked to complete a brief screening survey to determine if they meet
      inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will be asked to complete questionnaire forms to
      characterize their health, current symptoms, medications, and common exposures.
      Transcutaneous carboxyhemoglobin will be recorded.

      This study is cross-sectional and will only require one visit coinciding with the clinical
      visit. Analysis will determine the pairwise differences in SpCO between conditions tested.

    <description>A pairwise comparison of mean SpCO will be performed between asthma exacerbation group and each other group, e.g., asthma exacerbation v. stable asthma, asthma exacerbation v. pneumonia, etc. An independent t-test will be used to determine statistical significance of the difference of means.</description>
