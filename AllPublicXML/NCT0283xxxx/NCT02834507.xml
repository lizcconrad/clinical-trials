      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two different multiple-dose regimens
      of nebicapone in comparison to placebo and entacapone 200 mg on the pharmacokinetics of
      levodopa in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients.

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:

      This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, four-way
      crossover study. The study consisted of 4 treatment periods in at least 16 patients with PD
      treated with standard release levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet®). Patients were randomly assigned
      to treatment with placebo, nebicapone 75 mg, nebicapone 150 mg or entacapone 200 mg (Comtan®)
      in 4 different sequences.

             instability).

          4. Predictable signs of end-of-dose &quot;wearing-OFF&quot; phenomenon (end-of-dose deterioration)
             despite &quot;optimal&quot; levodopa/carbidopa therapy.

          5. At least 60 minutes of daily OFF time in the two days prior to the randomisation visit

             levodopa/carbidopa (4:1 ratio) per day within at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation,
             although a bedtime dose of slow-release formulation is permitted.

          8. Concomitant anti-Parkinsonian medication (other than apomorphine and entacapone) in

         12. A history or current evidence of heart disease, including but not limited to
             myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia.

         13. Unstable concomitant disease being treated with changing doses of medication.

         14. A history or current evidence of any relevant disease in the context of this study,
             i.e., with respect to the safety of the subject (e.g., hepatic impairment) or related
             to the study conditions.

         15. A test positive for the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) 1 or 2 antibodies,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab).

         16. Donated or received blood or blood products within 3 months prior to randomisation.
