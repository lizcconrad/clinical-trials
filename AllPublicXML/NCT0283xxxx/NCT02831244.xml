      Agili-C™ implant is a CE marked. The Agili-CTM implant is a porous resorbable tissue
      regeneration scaffold for the treatment of articular cartilage and/or osteochondral defects.

      The Agili-C™ implant will be implanted using the Agili-Kit™ surgical toolset which is
      designed for the precise preparation of sites in cartilage and osteochondral defects, for
      implanting the Agili-C™ implant.
