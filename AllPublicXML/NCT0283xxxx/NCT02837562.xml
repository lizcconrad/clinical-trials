  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of radiation-associated lens
      opacities among interventional cardiology staff members (such as physicians, technicians, and
      nurses) and determine its association with occupational history.

      The hypothesis of the study is that interventional cardiology staff will have high prevalence
      of radiation-induced lens opacities, which will be higher than non-interventional cardiology
      staff and will correlate with the estimated cumulative lifetime dose.

      This is an observational, cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of posterior
      subcapsular cataract (PSC) and its association with prior occupational history of radiation
      exposure. Participants of the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions 2016
      Scientific Sessions to be held in Orlando, FL May 4th to May 7th, will be invited to
      participate. Both interventional cardiology and non-interventional cardiology staff and
      non-clinical participants will be assessed. Written informed consent will be obtained from
      all participants. They will subsequently be asked to complete a questionnaire on occupational
      radiation exposure, workplace practices and medical history followed by dilated slit lamp
      examination using a modified Merriam-Focht scoring system.
