  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planning to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of medium-chain fatty
      acid capsules (food-grade CNT-02) in subjects with primary triglyceride deposit
      cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) and neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSD-M)
      associated with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) genetic defects.
