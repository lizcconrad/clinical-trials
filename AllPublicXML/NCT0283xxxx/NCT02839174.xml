  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have identified a support group on social media with ~1500 members
      (children and adults), the majority of whom have T1DM and follow a carbohydrate-restricted
      diet. Many participants report exceptionally low HbA1C and insulin requirements. If these
      anecdotal reports are reflective of a large group of people with type 1 diabetes, a clinical
      trial would be warranted.

      The investigators propose to survey the above-mentioned group and their professional diabetes
      care providers to characterize glycemic control and explore associated dietary and diabetes
      care factors.

  <detailed_description>

      The surveys will address questions in the following domains: 1) Diabetes diagnosis and
      treatment; 2) Carbohydrate-restricted diet; 3) Insulin regimen; 4) Other diabetes related
      care; 5) Diabetes complications; 6) Other related health and healthcare; 7) Patient provider
      interactions; 8) Socio-demographics. Drafts of these surveys are included in the appendix of
      this protocol.
