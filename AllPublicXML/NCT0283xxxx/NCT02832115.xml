      The primary objective of the study is to determine the role of transdermal vasodilators as an
      adjunct to parenteral vasodilators in reducing radial artery spasm, improving patient
      comfort, and post procedure radial artery patency during transradial coronary angiograms and
      interventions. The study hypothesis is that transdermal vasodilators will increase radial
      artery size and reduce radial artery spasm as well as improve patient comfort and post
      procedure radial artery patency. This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study comparing the effect of transdermal preparations of lidocaine +
      nitroglycerine and lidocaine + placebo on radial artery spasm in patients undergoing
      transdermal coronary angiograms. Prior to the procedure, each patient will be randomized into
      either the control arm, lidocaine + placebo, or study arm, lidocaine + nitroglycerine.

      Background:

      Vascular access site complications (VASC) during cardiac catheterizations are significantly
      higher in transfemoral access compared to transradial access. Patient comfort and shorter
      length of stay are additional advantages favoring radial access, contributing to the trend of
      increasing adoption of radial access for cardiac catheterizations. Main disadvantage in
      radial access is the restriction in size of catheters related to smaller caliber of radial
      artery as well as incidence of radial artery spasm, which can adversely affect patient
      satisfaction as well as procedural success often leading to conversion to femoral access.
      Additionally, increased adoption of radial access has led to reduced familiarity with femoral
      access among radial only or radial first operators resulting in higher complication rate
      during femoral access compared to historical complication rates (Campeau paradox). Several
      measures to reduce radial artery spasm and increase procedural success have been studied.

      Radial artery spasm during cardiac catheterization is identified by pain in the forearm
      aggravated by movement of the catheter/sheath; difficulty in manipulating the catheter; loss
      of radial pulse or damping of radial arterial pressure. Tortuosity and loops in upper
      extremity arterial tree could mimic some findings of radial artery spasm. Incidence of radial
      artery spasm has been reported to range between 4% and 20%. Incidence of loss of radial pulse
      after transradial coronary angiography has been reported between 2.5% to 10%. Risk factors
      for radial artery spasm include smaller radial artery diameter, atherosclerotic lesions,
      entrance of guidewires into side branches, vessel tortuosity, larger arterial sheath
      diameters, longer procedure duration, female sex, younger age, lower body mass index,
      diabetes mellitus, number of catheters used, volume of contrast medium used, unsuccessful
      access at first attempt, fear and anxiety. Use of parenteral cocktails with different
      combinations of heparin, nitroglycerine, verapamil, nitroprusside, nicorandil, diltiazem,
      lidocaine, molsidomine, magnesium sulphate and phentolamine have been studied to reduce
      radial artery spasm.

      Radial artery is smaller in caliber compared to femoral artery with mean size reported at
      2.44 mm. Women and persons of south Asian descent tend to have smaller radial arteries with
      means of 1.91mm and 2.00 mm respectively. Outer diameters of commonly used 5F and 6F sheaths
      are 2.16 mm and 2.62 mm respectively. Ratio of radial artery to sheath size affects
      post-procedural radial artery flow.

      Intraarterial vasodilators reduce radial artery spasm. Use of transdermal vasodilators such
      as nitroglycerine to dilate radial artery prior to vascular access would increase chance for
      successful arterial access in first attempt and increase radial artery to sheath size ratio
      both of which should have additive benefit to intraarterial vasodilators in reducing radial
      artery spasm. Transdermal lidocaine would reduce pain during subcutaneous infiltration of
      lidocaine, which can further ameliorate the risk of radial artery spasm. Use of transdermal
      nitroglycerine for this purpose has been shown to safely increase radial artery dimension
      without any significant effect on blood pressure.

      Aim:

      To study the role of transdermal vasodilators as an adjunct to parenteral vasodilators, in
      reducing radial artery spasm and improving patient comfort and post procedure radial artery
      patency during transradial coronary angiograms and interventions.

      Hypothesis:

      Transdermal vasodilators will increase radial artery size and reduce radial artery spasm as
      well as improve patient comfort and post procedure radial artery patency.

      Study Design:

      Single center, double blinded, randomized placebo-controlled study comparing effect of
      transdermal preparations of lidocaine + Nitroglycerine and lidocaine + placebo on radial
      artery spasm and procedural success in patients undergoing transradial coronary angiograms
      and interventions. All patients will receive standard parenteral cocktail including
      intraarterial or intravenous heparin and intraarterial nitroglycerine and / or verapamil.
      Exact doses and combinations would be at the discretion of individual provider based on
      patient's hemodynamic status and comorbid conditions.

           b. Inpatient: i. Hospitalized patients who are interested and meet all inclusion
           criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled in the trial on or before
           the day of their scheduled procedure, but always prior to transfer to the
           Catheterization Lab. One of the participating investigators will obtain informed consent
           after the patient has had time to review the consent and all questions have been
           answered.

        2. After reviewing the most current vital signs, patients without any exclusion criteria
           will be randomized 1:1 to control arm (40 mg Lidocaine + placebo) or study arm (40 mg

       10. If SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg and patient complains of dizziness or light-headedness or if SBP &lt; 90
           mm Hg, the topical preparation will be removed promptly, 250 ml of 0.9% Normal Saline
           (NS) IV bolus will be given over 15 minutes, and provider will be notified immediately.

       11. If patient complains of headache, one or two tablets of 500 mg acetaminophen will be
           given by mouth every 4 hours as needed. One tablet will be given if the patient reports
           a value of 0-3 on the pain scale, and two tablets will be given if the patient reports a
           value of 4 or greater on the pain scale. The maximum dose of acetaminophen is 4g in 24
           hours.

       12. If 30 minutes after acetaminophen administration, headache intensity ≥ 5/10 or patient
           unable to tolerate intensity of headache, the topical preparation will be removed
           promptly and provider will be notified immediately.

       13. If any of the safety endpoints occur, an investigator will be notified immediately and
           further decision to proceed with cardiac catheterization or additional workup or
           treatment would be at the discretion of the investigator.
