  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm prospective, non-randomized, longitudinal study with up to 10 patients from

             resulting in stable menisci). No less than 60 degrees meniscal volume retained.

          8. The contralateral knee is asymptomatic, stable, and fully functional.

          9. Must be physically and mentally willing and able to comply with post-operative
