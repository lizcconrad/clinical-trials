  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to assess the LDL-C-lowering abilities of a dietary fiber ingredient, in
      order to confirm the product's efficacy. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the
      effect of 3g dietary fiber on lowering serum LDL-C in otherwise healthy men and women.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of 3g/d dietary fiber ingredient on lowering serum LDL-C in
      otherwise healthy men and women. Subjects will be generally healthy men and women
      (approximately equal number of men and women) 21-79 years of age, inclusive, each with a
      fasting LDL-C level ≥130 mg/dL and &lt;190 mg/dL.

      This randomized, controlled, 28-day parallel study will include one screening Visit (Visit 1,
      Day -14), two baseline visits (Visits 2 and 3; Days -3 and 0) and three test visits (Visits
      4, 5, and 6; Days 14, 25, and 28), and two contact reminders (Days 7 and 21).

      Study ingredients will be provided in three servings of study products each day. During the
      study, subjects will be instructed to consume one serving of study product at each mealtime.

      The primary outcome variable will be the percent change in LDL-C concentration from baseline
      (average of Days -3 and 0) to the end of each intervention condition (average of Days 25 and
      28).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a generally healthy male or female, 21-79 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Subject has a fasting LDL-C level ≥130 mg/dL and &lt;190 mg/dL at Visit 1 (Day -14) while
             receiving no drug therapy. One venous retest allowed for screening subjects within ±3%
             of the target range (i.e., minimum of 126; maximum of 196 mg/dL). In the event that a
             redraw is necessary, the average of the two LDL-C values (the redraw value and the
             Visit 1 value) will be used to determine eligibility.

          4. Subject has a fasting TG &lt;400 mg/dL at Visit 1 (Day -14). One venous retest allowed
             for ≥400 mg/dL values.

          5. Subject is willing to maintain a stable body weight, follow the dietary
             recommendations, and maintain usual physical activity throughout the study period.

          6. Subject is willing to maintain usual physical activity level throughout the trial.
