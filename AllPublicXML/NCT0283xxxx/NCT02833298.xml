  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of the patients receiving treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection in the United States have advanced liver disease. Patients with advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis who achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment and are
      clinically cured of HCV continue to have an elevated risk of developing hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). According to guidelines from several professional societies and from the
      American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), in particular, patients with
      advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis should undergo life-long bi-annual screening for incident HCC
      whether they achieve an SVR, or not. The number of patients who need post-SVR HCC screening
      has risen dramatically in recent years due to the confluence of three factors: Increased
      screening for HCV, which has allowed more people to realize that they have this often
      &quot;silent&quot; infection; the availability of safe and highly effective direct acting antiviral
      drugs (DAAs) for HCV, which has allowed a much higher percentage of treated patients to
      achieve an SVR; and the long duration of HCV infection in many patients, which has allowed
      enough time for advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis to develop. To investigate post-SVR patients in
      the era of DAAs and to promote HCC screening, the objective of this study is to conduct a
      randomized, unblinded, two-arm prospective intervention trial comparing rates of HCC
      screening between patients randomized to either personalized patient navigation or automated
      reminders (e.g. electronic or mailed). Both interventions represent improved care over
      current standard of care (no patient navigation or automated reminders). There is no evidence
      to suggest one intervention is better than the other. Healthcare providers who agree to
      participate in the study will be contacted to confirm the liver disease status of their
      patients and during the clinical trial the providers of patients in both arms of the trial
      will be sent reminders about the need to schedule patients for screening visits.
