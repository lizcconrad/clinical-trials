  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of itraconazole on the single dose
      pharmacokinetics of PF-06463922 in healthy volunteers in the fasted state.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, 2-period, fixed-sequence, crossover study to investigate
      the effect of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole on PF-06463922 PK in approximately 16
      healthy volunteers. The study will consist of potentially up to 6 treatments: single dose of
      PF-06463922 50, 75 or 100 mg and PF-06463922 50, 75 or 100 mg in combination with multiple
      dose itraconazole.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female subjects of non childbearing potential and/or male subjects, who at the
             time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption.

          -  A positive urine drug test.

          -  History of HIV, Hep B or Hep C.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption.

          -  Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating PR interval &gt;180 msec, QTc &gt;450 msec or a
             QRS interval &gt;120 msec.

          -  Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat, if deemed necessary: Use this criterion to describe any laboratory parameters
             that are not acceptable for the study. Examples included below:

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;1.0 × upper
             limit of normal (ULN);

          -  Total bilirubin level &gt;1.0 × ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may
             have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the
             direct bilirubin level is &lt;= ULN.
