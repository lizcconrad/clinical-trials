      1. Demographics data;

        2. Nutritional evaluation data;

        3. All biochemical monitoring data during the study period;

        4. All nutritional treatment data will be recorded daily during the study period, including
           actual calorie intake, protein intake, and the proportion of calorie/protein
           administered by EN and/or PN route. The nutritional treatment protocol will be decided
           by the attending physician, the investigator will not intervene.

        5. A blood sample (5 ml) will be drawn from every patient immediately after they enroll
           into the study, and the metabolomics of the samples will be analyzed analysis using a
           combined 800 MHz 1H-NMR-UPLC-MS system. The data will then be used to establish
           metabolic profile baseline.

        6. We will establish a sub-group that contains 20 patients (chosen from enrolled patients
           according to APACHE II scores: 10 patients are APACHE II scores in 21-30). We will take
           one blood sample daily during the whole study period. The plasma sample will be used for
           metabolomics analysis using an 800 MHz 1H-NMR-UPLC-MS system. And the data will be used
           for metabolic dynamic modeling.

        7. Clinical outcomes data, which include: 1) Complications after the operation (intestinal
           fistula, pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula and sepsis, bleeding, nosocomial
           infection); 2) death event; 3) ICU-stay; 4) Length of hospitalization
