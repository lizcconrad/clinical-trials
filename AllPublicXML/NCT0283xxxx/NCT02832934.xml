      Coronary heart disease (CHD) are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, particularly
      with the current context of an aging population. Prospective cohort studies, as well as
      analyses of pooled individual participant data suggest up to a 60-90% increase in the risk of
      CHD or HF events among adults with severe SHypo. However, no large randomized controlled
      trials (RCT) have assessed the impact of thyroid replacement on cardiovascular (CV) imaging
      outcomes. The goals of this proposal are to address the impact of thyroid replacement on
      subclinical atherosclerosis. The investigators will conduct a RCT in 185 patients with
      subclinical hypothyroidism who will be randomly assigned to thyroxine or placebo with an
      average follow-up of 24 months from baseline. The main outcome will be CV imaging modalities
      measured by carotid ultrasound at the close-out visit. Assessment of the impact of thyroid
      replacement on subclinical atherosclerosis within a trial will aid decisions and
      evidence-based guidelines development to treat a potential modifiable risk factor, such as
      SHypo.

      Background: Coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) are the leading causes of
      mortality and morbidity, particularly with the current context of an aging population.
      Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as elevated serum TSH levels with normal
      thyroxine values, is common in older adults (5-10%). Prospective cohort studies, as well as
      analyses of pooled individual participant data suggest up to a 60-90% increase in the risk of
      CHD or HF events among adults with severe SHypo. However, no large randomized controlled
      trials (RCT) have assessed the impact of thyroid replacement on cardiovascular (CV) imaging
      outcomes (largest trial to date: 45 participants). Imaging endpoints are especially
      well-suited for early trials with investigational therapies for HF treatment and prevention,
      as well as validated and strong surrogate markers of clinical outcomes.

      Specific Aims: The goals of this proposal are to address the impact of thyroid replacement on
      subclinical atherosclerosis.

      Methods: The investigators will conduct a RCT in 185 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism
      who will be randomly assigned to thyroxine or placebo with an average follow-up of 24 months
      from baseline (4 death and 17 withdrawal). The main outcome will be CV imaging modalities
      measured by carotid ultrasound at the close-out visit. Ultrasound of carotid intima media
      thickness (CIMT) will be used to assess subclinical atherosclerosis and plaque burden. All
      images will be centralized at the core lab for a blinded and standardized interpretation.

      Expected value of the proposed project: Controversies persist regarding the indications for
      screening and treatment of SHypo due to the lack of an appropriately powered RCT addressing
      the impact of thyroid replacement on CV outcomes. Assessment of the impact of thyroid
      replacement on subclinical atherosclerosis within a trial will aid decisions and
      evidence-based guidelines development to treat a potential modifiable risk factor, such as
      SHypo. The strengths of this study include the combination of: 1) High feasibility of the
      project in collaboration with the largest RCT on SHypo making it possible to investigate the
      mechanisms of associations with CV disease; 2) Innovative project with combined CV imaging to
      assess subclinical atherosclerosis with thyroid replacement therapy vs. placebo; 3) Excellent
      power given the large sample size and participants' older age. The sample size for this
      proposal will be 5-fold higher than previous small trials of thyroid replacement on CV
      outcomes and is comparable to statin trials showing a positive impact on CIMT. The
      collaboration of CV imaging modalities expertise with the ongoing largest trial on SHypo, is
      a unique opportunity to address the clinical and scientific issue of the impact of SHypo on
      the CV system.

    <description>The intervention will start with Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily (reduced to 25 mcg in subjects &lt;50 kg of body weight or if known coronary heart disease - previous myocardial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris) vs. matching placebo; at 3 months, if the serum TSH level is &lt;0.4 mU/L, dose will be reduced by 25 mcg; TSH &gt;=0.4 and &lt;4.6 mU/L, no change to dose; TSH &gt;=4.6 mU/L, additional 25 mcg. The process will be repeated at 12 months, then annually; mock titration will be performed in the placebo group. The maximum possible dose of Levothyroxine which will be prescribed is 150 mcg (after 4 increments of 25 mcg at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 years; from the starting dose of 50 mcg).</description>
