               -  1st controlled ovarian stimulation cycle ever, or

               -  2nd controlled ovarian stimulation cycle ever, or

               -  1st or 2nd controlled ovarian stimulation cycle after having achieved ongoing
                  pregnancy in a previous controlled ovarian stimulation cycle (note: the subject
                  cannot be included if she has had made more than one failed cycle before the

               -  &gt;20 days of gonadotrophin stimulation in a previous controlled ovarian
                  stimulation cycle, or

               -  any previous cancellation of a controlled ovarian stimulation cycle due to
