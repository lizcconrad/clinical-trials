    <textblock>
      This study assesses the mean difference in fluid balance at ICU discharge and associated
      patient outcomes, based on a dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness in septic patients
      with refractory hypotension in an ICU setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center randomized study comparing dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness utilizing
      Starling SV monitor compared to a control group.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment to control group ratio to increase power for
      sub-analysis by patient population.

      Patients randomized to the Starling SV arm will have treatment guided by a dynamic assessment
      of fluid responsiveness (measured by a change in stroke volume index &gt; 10%) as assessed by
      passive leg raise (PLR).

      Patients randomized to the control group will receive standard of care treatment.

    <description>A dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness using the Starling SV monitor will be performed at every clinical decision point for the first 72 hours of study enrollment. Examples of a clinical decision point include a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of &lt; 65, the decision to give additional fluid volume, and the decision to either escalate or wean vasopressors. Fluid responsiveness will be assessed using a passive leg raise (PLR) to guide corresponding treatment.</description>
