    <textblock>
      In this study, the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 Ointment will be
      evaluated in adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical actinic
      keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp.

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, multicenter, activity, safety, tolerability, and PK study
      of KX2-391 Ointment administered topically to the face or scalp of subjects with actinic
      keratosis.

      The study consists of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. Eligible subjects will
      receive X consecutive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the study site. Blood
      samples for PK analysis will be collected. Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations
      will be performed.
