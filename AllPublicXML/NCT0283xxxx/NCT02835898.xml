      Objective: The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the alterations of epigenetic patterns
      in periodontally diseased individuals, before and after periodontal treatment, also in
      comparison to periodontally healthy patients.

      Materials &amp; methods: Twenty patients were voluntarily enrolled in two groups: 10 participants
      with healthy periodontium, and 10 participants with chronic periodontitis. Clinical
      parameters were recorded and gingival biopsies were collected within the following timelines:
      At baseline (for both groups), after 15 days (for the diseased group only) and after two
      months (for the diseased group only).

      Study Design Baseline: Before harvesting gingival biopsies, bleeding on probing (BOP),
      periodontal pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were registered at the
      biopsy site, for all study participants. Following the registration of the clinical
      parameters, gingival biopsies were obtained from the periodontally-healthy individuals during
      crown lengthening surgery or surgical removal of wisdom teeth. In the periodontally-diseased
      group, biopsies were harvested from two sites: healthy site and periodontally-involved site.
      After harvesting of biopsies, patients with periodontal disease underwent scaling and root
      planing.

      Two weeks after periodontal treatment: Clinical parameters were registered and gingival
      biopsies were harvested (from two sites) for the periodontally-diseased group only, to
      evaluate if the epigenetic patterns (DNA methylation) were altered by conventional
      periodontal therapy, in comparison to the patterns observed at baseline for both diseased and
      healthy groups.

      Two months after initial periodontal treatment: Clinical parameters were registered and
      gingival biopsies were harvested (from two sites) for the periodontally-diseased group only,
      to evaluate if the epigenetic patterns were still altered by conventional periodontal
      therapy, in comparison to the patterns observed at baseline for both diseased and healthy
      groups, and at 15 days for the diseased group.

      Gingival biopsies will be collected in tubes that contain Allprotect tissue reagent (100 ml,
      Qiagen, USA), to immediately and effectively stabilize the DNA in tissues, based on the
      manufacturer's instructions. Tubes containing the reagent will be stored at 2-8 C. Later
      DNA/RNA will be purified using AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (50 ml, Qiagen, USA), following the
      manufacturer's instructions. With this approach, quantitative gene expression of specific
      cytokines is possible.
