  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 healthy man, 10 in trial group and 10 in control group (randomly divided) will participate
      in the experiment on order to evaluate if improvement in physical fitness influences spatial
      learning in humans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      subjects in both groups will perform 4 sets of VO2max test and spatial orientation test with
      a month between them (total 3 month).

      in addition, subjects in trial group will follow a training program throughout the trial
      (running on treadmill 3 times a week), suited according to their result in the first VO2max
      test.

      in each set VO2max test will be perform before spatial orientation test , in order to
      evaluated the subject`s aerobic fitness. the spatial orientation test is composed of 5
      following days in which the subject has 3 attempts to arrive to a destination in xbox one
      controller using a virtual glasses (Oculus Rift DK2). each attempt duration is 2 min.
