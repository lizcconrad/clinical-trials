  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for present trial conception and design moves forward from the assumption that
      a subcutaneous, pre-pectoral reconstruction by means of soft tissue replacement devices is
      feasible, safe and giving rewarding results when compared to the standard retro-pectoral
      technique. Ahead of that, the trial aims to test if there is a difference in the outcomes
      between a biological and a synthetic material when placed as a support under the mastectomy
      skin flaps, both in terms of immediate complications and of long-term results.

      This phase III randomized clinical trial will compare direct-to-implant pre-pectoral breast
      reconstruction with different supportive materials:

      the trial will comprise two arms: A-PRE-PECTORAL technique with a biological Acellular Dermal
      Matrix (ADM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT GRAFTING VS B-PRE-PECTORAL technique with
      a synthetic Titanium Coated Polypropylene Mesh (TCPM) prosthesis coverage and support + FAT
      GRAFTING

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate in percentage of surgical complications</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical outcomes within the first six months from mastectomy and IBBR will be evaluated with the statistical difference in percentage rate of complicated and non complicated patients between the two groups. Complications will be the following:
surgical site infection (any infection requiring an antibiotic therapy, either oral or intravenous), wound dehiscence, seroma (any fluid collection requiring aspiration for more than a month from mastectomy), nipple/skin necrosis (either partial or complete), hematoma, red breast syndrome, with their reintervention rate, all in percentages.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate in percentage of technique failure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The failure rate will be assessed considering the statistical difference in percentage rate of removed implants among total number and comparing them between the two arms: in other words the prostheses (implants) loss rate (reinterventions with prosthesis removal).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective quality of life assessment with Baker scale for capsular contracture</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 years from mastectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life outcomes at 2 years from mastectomy and at least 3 months after completion of the reconstructive step included in the protocol (one fat grafting procedure) will entail first of all an objective evaluation: such evaluation will be performed with the the scoring of capsular contracture rate, including assessment of the reintervention rate for amelioration or for a reconstructive strategy change, comparing the two arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective quality of life assessment with cosmetic evaluation on pictures with a Likert scale scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 years from mastectomy</time_frame>
    <description>In addition another objective analysis will include a third party objective evaluation, carried out by a group of a surgeon, a nurse and a lay person from a different center from that one where every single case was performed. This third party evaluation will assess the cosmetic outcome based on medical photographic files. Scores from this ranking will be compared between the two groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective quality of life assessment using the BREAST-Q questionnaire (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and The University of British Columbia © 2006, all rights reserved).</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 years from mastectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life outcomes at 2 years from mastectomy and at least 3 months after completion of the reconstructive step included in the protocol (one fat grafting procedure) will entail also a subjective evaluation: such evaluation will be carried out using the BREAST-Q questionnaire. Scores will be transformed in a 100 scale and compared as median between the two groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-efficiency analysis with comparison of costs in money of the two different procedures and following possible adjunctive costs for reintervention in case of complications</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 years from mastectomy</time_frame>
    <description>A long-term evaluation of costs will be carried out for all cases, considering procedures, hospitalizations, days off from work and long-term readmission and revision surgeries. These data will be compared between arms and with every other type of reconstruction. A specific similar analysis will be conducted on irradiated cases comparing with non irradiated.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate in percentage of surgical complications in the sub-group of irradiated patients</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 years from mastectomy</time_frame>
    <description>An analysis of the subgroup of patients with a previous breast irradiation or a post-mastectomy radiation therapy will be carried out considering short-term complications leading to failures and long-term complications leading to change in reconstruction strategy.</description>
