  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High quality bowel preparation is essential for successful colonoscopy. This study aimed to
      assess the impact of reinforced education by Wechat or short message service (SMS) on the
      quality of bowel preparation. This prospective, endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled
      study was conducted. Reinforced education groups received additional education via reminders
      by Wechat or SMS 2 days before colonoscopy. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel
      preparation according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). The secondary outcomes
      included polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), tolerance, and subjective
      feelings of patients.
