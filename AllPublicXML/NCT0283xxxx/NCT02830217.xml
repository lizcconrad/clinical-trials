  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an urgent symptom associated with sudden
      myocardial ischemia and ST segment elevated in ECG. Primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) re-open infarct artery efficiently for STEMI patients. However, patients
      are readmitted shortly after the primary PCI for several unfavorable clinical outcomes
      including thrombosis in stent, recurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart
      failure. This study is intended to test the predictive ability of a new biomarker soluble ST2
      (sST2) in peripheral blood. Previous studies have shown that elevated sST2 is highly
      associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of patients with ischemia heart diseases and
      heart failure. This study will further investigate the ability of sST2 to predict unfavorable
      outcomes for STEMI patients after primary PCI.
