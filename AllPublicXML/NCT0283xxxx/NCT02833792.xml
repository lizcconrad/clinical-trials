      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of ischemia-tolerant allogeneic human mesenchymal stem
      cells (hMSCs) manufactured by Stemedica versus placebo administered intravenously to subjects
      with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

      Secondary:

      To assess the preliminary efficacy of hMSCs versus placebo in subjects with
      Alzheimer's-related dementia, as evidenced by neurologic, functional, and psychiatric
      endpoints.

      This is a Phase IIa multi-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
      study in subjects with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Only the subject
      and their caregiver will be blinded to the study treatment. The study will consist of two
      cohorts of subjects (20 subjects per cohort), randomized in a 1:1 allocation to receive
      active study drug or placebo. Cohort 1 will receive a single intravenous dose of hMSCs of 1.5
      million cells per kilogram body weight on their Study Day 1, and Cohort 2 will receive equal
      volume of Lactated Ringer's Solution on their Study Day 1. At the six-month time point for
      each subject after their first infusion, Cohort 1 will receive a single intravenous dose of
      Lactated Ringer's Solution and Cohort 2 will receive a single intravenous dose of hMSCs at
      1.5 million cells per kilogram of the subject's body weight. Approximately 40 subjects will
      be enrolled in this study. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will conduct
      periodic safety reviews.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females between 55-80 years of age.

          2. Diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia for at least 3 months prior to enrollment,
             based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative

          3. Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
             (NINDS-ADRDA) Alzheimer's criteria.

          4. MMSE between 12-24 (inclusive) at time of enrollment.

          5. Amyloid-positive florbetapir PET scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with stem cells.

          2. History of intracranial, subdural, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

          3. Subjects with baseline brain MRI showing more than four (4) cerebral microhemorrhages
             (regardless of their anatomical location or diagnostic characterization as &quot;possible&quot;
             or &quot;definite&quot;), and/or one (1) or more areas of superficial siderosis, and/or evidence
             of a prior macrohemorrhage. MRI must include fluid-attenuation inversion recovery
             (FLAIR) and T2*-weighted gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) sequences.

          4. History of cancer within the past 5 years, with the exception of localized basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma.

          5. History of seizure disorder.

          6. Diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
             leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
