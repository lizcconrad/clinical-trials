             gradient &gt;40 mmHg or peak aortic valve velocity &gt;4 m/sec

          3. Symptomatology due to aortic stenosis resulting in one of the following:

               1. NYHA Functional Classification of II or greater

               2. Presence of angina

               3. Presence of syncope

          4. Aortic valve annular diameter ≥ 24 and ≤26 mm measured by MSCT based on area or
             perimeter

          5. STS score of ≥8, or documented heart team agreement of high risk for surgical aortic
             valve replacement (SAVR) due to frailty or comorbidities.

          6. Geographically available, willing to comply with follow up and able to provide written

          1. Congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve, or noncalcified aortic valve; or valve
             eccentricity (calcific or otherwise) that in the opinion of the investigator could
             compromise procedural success.

          2. Patients at high risk for coronary obstruction in the opinion of the investigator
             (e.g. combination of a coronary height &lt; 12 mm and coronary sinus diameter &lt; 30 mm)

         17. Unfavorable peripheral vascular anatomy or disease (e.g. severe obstructive
             calcification, severe tortuosity or vessels &lt; 6 mm) that would preclude passage of
             catheters from the femoral arterial access to the aorta as evidenced by peripheral
             MSCT

         18. Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 90 days*

         23. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure performed or planned to perform within 30
             days of the index procedure except for PCI which is within 7 days of the index
             procedure*

         24. Hypersensitivity or contraindication to procedural medication and device materials
             (e.g. titanium, nickel, pork) which cannot be adequately pre-medicated

         25. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to non-cardiac co-morbid conditions
