  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classically lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure are measured from the difference in
      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations i esophagus pressure
      divided by the tidal volume. This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon catheter
      which is cumbersome and costly. In this study values obtained as described above are compared
      to values obtained with a new method in which a stepwise increase in positive endexpiratory
      pressure (PEEP) is performed with a size which corresponds to the tidal volume which the
      patient is ventilated with. These measurements are performed in anesthetized patients prior
      to major surgery.

      Classically lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure are measured from the difference in
      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations in esophageal pressure
      divided by the tidal volume (Method 1). This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon
      catheter which is cumbersome and costly.

      In this study values obtained as described in Method 1 above are compared to values obtained
      with a new method in which a PEEP-step is performed with a size which corresponds to the
      tidal volume which the patient is ventilated with. Measurements using Method 1 and 2 are
      performed in anesthetized patients prior to major surgery.
