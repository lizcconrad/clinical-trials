  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathology of the rotator cuff and subacromial bursa is considered to be the principal cause
      of pain and symptoms arising from the shoulder. Physiotherapy specialists often disagree
      about which type of exercise is most appropriate. Manual Physiotherapy combined with guided
      exercise is a commonly applied clinical treatment, but no proof of its effectiveness has been
      shown. Clinical trials comparing results of treating subacromial syndrome of the shoulder
      with guided self-treatment and conventional physiotherapy yielded a slightly higher
      improvement, basically because patients suffered from chronic tendinitis and the treatment
      period lasted only two weeks. That is the reason why the investigators propose a long-term
      follow-up study and a more complete assessment of effectiveness of the exercise prescribed to
      improved this pathology.

      Objectives:

        -  Assessment of effectiveness of two different types of treatment of subacromial syndrome
           of the shoulder.

        -  Comparison of effectiveness of both treatments in order to select that one yielding
           better results as the one to be applied as a routine practice.

      Patients will be assigned one of the following treatments:

        -  Group 1: patients will be taught exercises in groups of six people, on a daily basis for
           twelve sessions.

        -  Group 2: patients will be taught the same exercise as Group 1, individually, and will
           receive manual therapy consisting of muscular and joint re-centering.

      A modified version of the Constant scale will be used to assess mobility and pain shoulder.
