             months prior to Day -1 of Period 1 and throughout the study.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 20.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2 at screening.

          4. Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the PI or
             designee. At screening, subjects must have alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; the upper limit of normal and
             triglyceride levels must be &lt; 250 mg/dL.

          5. A non-vasectomized subject must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from
             sexual intercourse during the study. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized
             male provided his vasectomy has been performed 4 months or more prior to Day -1 of
             Period 1. A subject who has been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to Day -1 of
             Period 1 must follow the same restrictions as a non vasectomized male).

          6. Understands the study procedures in the informed consent form (ICF), and be willing

             results of the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by their participation
             in the study.

          4. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to Day
             -1 of Period 1.

          5. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drugs,
             related compounds, milk, palm or coconut oil, or soy.

          6. History or presence of diverticular disease, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease or
             recurrent diarrhea or gout.

          7. Positive urine drug or alcohol results at screening or check in.

          8. Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          9. Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 140/90 mmHg at
             screening.

         10. Seated heart rate is lower than 40 bpm or higher than 99 bpm at screening.

         11. QTcF interval is &gt;460 msec or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with clinical
             significance by the PI or designee at screening.

         12. Estimated creatinine clearance ≤80 mL/min at screening.

         13. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any drug, including prescription and
             non prescription medications, herbal remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning 14
             days prior to Day -1 of Period 1 and throughout the study. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g
             per 24 hour period) may be permitted during the study.

         14. Has been on a diet incompatible with the on study diet, in the opinion of the PI or
             designee, within the 28 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1 and throughout the study.

         15. Is lactose intolerant.

         16. Is unable to complete the meal prior to Day -1 of Period 1.

         17. Subject consumed grapefruit or Seville oranges within 14 days prior to Day -1 of
             Period 1.

         18. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to Day -1 of Period
             1.

         19. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1.

         20. Participation in another clinical study within 28 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1.
             The 28 day window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or
             dosing, whichever is later, in the previous study to Day -1 of Period 1 of the current
             study.
