  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study evaluates the safety, immunogenicity and lot-to lot consistency of 3 lots
      of aH5N1c vaccine for pandemic avian influenza, in approximately 2394 healthy adults ≥18
      years of age receiving the vaccine and 798 healthy adults receiving placebo. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either aH5N1c vaccine or saline placebo. Enrollment will
      be stratified by age: 18 to &lt;65 years of age and ≥65 years of age, to allow adequate safety
      assessment of the entire age spectrum.

             medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment by the Investigator; able
             to comply with all study procedures, to be contacted, and to be available for study
             visits according to the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female subjects of childbearing

             control from Day 1 (1st vaccination) to 3 weeks after the second study vaccination,
             and, if sexually active, who have not used a reliable birth control method for at
             least two months prior to study entry.

          -  Individuals with a body temperature ≥38.0 °C (≥100.4 °F) or any acute illness within 3
             days of intended study vaccination.

          -  Individuals who received any type of influenza vaccine (e.g., &quot;seasonal&quot;) within 7
             days prior to enrolment in this study or who are planning to receive any type of
             influenza vaccine within 7 days (before or after) from the study vaccines.

          -  Individuals who received any other licensed vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated
             vaccines) or 28 days (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who are
             planning to receive any (non-influenza) vaccine within 28 days (before or after) from
             the study vaccines.

          -  Individuals with known or suspected impairment of the immune system.
