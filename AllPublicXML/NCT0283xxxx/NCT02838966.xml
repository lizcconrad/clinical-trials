      Study Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the optimal effective
      dose for preoperative nutritional supplementation with immunomodulators on immune function
      and perioperative outcomes following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Primary Endpoints:

      The primary endpoints will be effect on immunological profile (circulating Myeloid derived
      suppressor cells, circulating B cells, NK cells, CD4 and CD8 cells), serum arginine levels,
      immunological milieu of the tumor (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), overall morbidity rate
      and infectious complication rates.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Monitor Safety and Tolerability

        -  Hospital Length of Stay

        -  Readmission rate

        -  One-year event free survival

        -  Effect on nutritional parameters (serum total protein, prealbumin, albumin and
           transferrin)

        -  Effect on acute phase reactants (CRP, IL6, TNF alpha)

      Study Design: This is a 1:1:1:1 four-arm single center prospective randomized feasibility
      study to compare preoperative nutritional supplementation with an enhanced formula containing
      immune-modulating agents (IMPACT AR) for 5 days with 1,2 or 3 cans versus 5 days of 3 cans of
      comparable iso-caloric iso-nitrogenous supplementation (Boost) for patients with resectable
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Number of Patients 20 (5 in each arm) Eligibility Criteria: Patients over 18 years of age,
      who have histologic and/or radiologic evidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head of
      the pancreas, who have been deemed resectable, and who are able to give informed consent,
      will be eligible Exclusion criteria would include Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral or
      fungal infection within 21 days of study entry OR Inability to take oral, nasojejunal or
      jejunostomy tube nutritional supplements OR patients on chronic steroid therapy (i.e. greater
      than 3 months)

      Nutritional Supplement interventions:

      Patients randomized to the TEST intervention will receive Impact Advanced Recovery™ formula,
      which is a commercially available oral nutrition supplement drink that is supplied in 237mL
      containers. Each serving provides 1.4 kcal/mL (340 kcal/serving) of which 22% of the kcal are
      derived from protein (18.1 gm protein/serving), in addition to their regular diet. Patients
      randomized to CONTROL Boost® High Protein Drink will consume their regular diet and 4 cans of
      Boost per day for 5 days preoperatively (to maintain equivalent supplementation in terms of
      calories and protein with the group receiving the highest dose of Impact AR).

      Study procedure:

      Screening/baseline assessments will performed prior to the first treatment within
      approximately four weeks of the treatment and will include a detailed medical history and
      physical examination,standard of Care Laboratory tests (CBC, CMP), tumor markers: as
      indicated: CEA and CA19-9; and coagulation (baseline and as clinically indicated): INR, PTT,
      PT. Imaging to confirm respectability would include a high quality tri-phasic CT scan with
      0.7mm cuts or Dynamic MRI with contrast to confirm the absence of metastatic disease Study
      specific tests include pre-treatment and post treatment (Office visit/ pre-anesthesia visit,
      Morning of surgery, postop day 5)

        -  Nutritional parameters and acute phase reactants: serum prealbumin, albumin,
           transferrin, CRP, IL6, TNF alpha

        -  Serum arginine,

        -  MSDC (myeloid derived suppressor cell) assay of fresh blood and Arginase I expression
           Study procedure at the time of surgery: Semi-quantitative assay of Tumor infiltrating
           lymphocytes from tissue block of tumor obtained at time of surgery. Tumor tissue will
           also be banked for post hoc tests if needed.

      During follow up visits history and physical examination, performance Status evaluation and
      Standard of care Laboratory Tests (CBC, CMP, and Tumor Marker Assessment as clinically
      indicated per the discretion of the investigator would be done approximately every three
      months). Imaging during follow up include a CT/MRI for disease status (approximately every
      three months during follow-up) Adverse Event Monitoring and Concomitant Medication monitoring
      will be done out to 90 days
