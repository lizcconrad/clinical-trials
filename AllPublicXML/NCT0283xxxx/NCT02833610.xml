  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a possible therapy as a possible treatment for the
      consequences of Multiple Myeloma with renal insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. This study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of denosumab in Multiple Myeloma participants, by studying drug interactions
      with different parts of the body.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Denosumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved denosumab for use in other cancers to treat cancer-related
      bone disease such as prostate and breast cancer.

               -  Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow greater than or equal to 10% and/or
                  presence of a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma

               -  Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urine

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min, not eligible for bisphosphonate. Estimated
