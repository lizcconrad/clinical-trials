      A Prospective, multi-center, single-arm post-approval study of the IMPELLA® 2.5 System in Non
      Emergent High Risk PCI patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the IMPELLA® 2.5 System in
      subjects undergoing non-emergent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) post
      market approval. The primary endpoint will be a composite clinical endpoint of major adverse
      events through 90 days following the PCI procedure. The outcome will be compared to the pre
      specified performance goal of 53%.

        The study population will consist of high risk subjects indicated for nonemergent
        percutaneous treatment after heart team evaluation including a cardiac surgeon of at least
        one de novo or restenotic lesion in a native coronary vessel or bypass graft.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Subject is indicated for a NON emergent percutaneous treatment of at least one de novo
             or restenotic lesion in a native coronary vessel or bypass graft per the judgement of
             a heart team including a surgeon

          3. Age eligible (18 ≤ Age ≤ 90)

          4. Subject presents with:

               1. Ejection Fraction≤ 35% AND at least one of the following criteria:

                  Intervention on the last patent coronary conduit, or Intervention on an
                  unprotected left main coronary artery Or

               2. Ejection Fraction ≤ 30% and intervention in patient presenting with triple vessel
                  disease. *three-vessel or triple vessel disease is defined as at least one
                  significant stenosis* in all three major epicardial territories: Left Anterior
                  Descending (LAD) Artery and/or side branch, left circumflex (LCX) artery and/or
                  side branch, Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and or side branch. *Significant
                  stenosis is defined as at least 50% diameter stenosis by visual estimate or any
                  total occlusion. In the case of left coronary artery dominance, a lesion in the
                  LAD and the proximal LCX qualifies as three-vessel disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. ST Myocardial Infarction within 24 hours or CK-MB that have not normalized

             2. Pre-procedure cardiac arrest within 24 hours of enrolment requiring CPR

             3. Subject is inotrope dependent or in cardiogenic shock defined as: Hypotension
             (systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg for &gt; 30 minutes or the need for supportive measures to
             maintain a systolic BP of greater than or equal to 90 mmHg) AND end organ
             hypoperfusion (cool extremities OR a urine output of &lt; 30 ml/hour)

             4. Mural thrombus in the left ventricle

             5. Patient scheduled for revascularization of a total chronic occlusion (CTO) or
             transcatheter aortic valve replacement within 1 year of index procedure.

             6. The presence of a mechanical aortic valve or heart constrictive device

             7. Documented presence of aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis graded as ≥ +2 equivalent
             to an orifice area of 1.5cm2 or less.

             8. Documented presence of moderate to severe aortic insufficiency (echocardiographic
             assessment of aortic insufficiency graded as ≥ +2)

             9. Severe peripheral arterial obstructive disease that would preclude the IMPELLA
             System device placement

             10. Abnormalities of the aorta that would preclude surgery, including aneurysms and
             extreme tortuosity or calcifications

             11. Subject with renal failure (creatinine ≥ 4mg/dL or on dialysis)

             12. Subject has history of debilitating liver dysfunction with elevation of liver
             enzymes and bilirubin levels to ≥ 3x ULN or INR (Internationalized Normalized Ratio) ≥
             2

             13. Subject has uncorrectable abnormal coagulation parameters (defined as platelet
             count ≤75,000/mm3 or INR ≥2.0.)

             14. History of recent (within 1 month) stroke or TIA

             15. Allergy or intolerance to heparin, aspirin, ADP receptor inhibitors(clopidogrel
             and ticlid) or contrast media

             16. Subject with documented heparin induced thrombocytopenia

             17. Participation in the active follow-up phase of another clinical study of an
             investigational drug or device
