  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to know the prophylactic anti-emetic effect of ramosetron compare to
      ondansetron in patient undergone total knee arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia and
      intrathecal morphine .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were allocated into 2 groups by computerized block randomization according to a
      computer generated randomization. Treatment allocations were contained in sealed envelopes
      that were opened after patient enrollment. Patients received either 8 mg of intravenous (IV)
      ondansetron or 0.3 mg of IV ramosetron 10 minutes before spinal anesthesia and intrathecal
      morphine. All of the unilateral TKAs were done by one orthopedic surgeon using the same
      minimally invasive surgical technique and the same prosthesis.

      Patients were monitored for incidence of Post Operative Nausea Vomiting(PONV) every 6 hours
      until 24 hours, and 24-48 hours postoperatively. Common adverse drug reactions associated
      with serotonin receptor antagonists (pruritus, dizziness, and headache) were also recorded.

      The sample size calculation was based on the ability to detect a difference in incidence of
      postoperative nausea in between the two groups of 40% i.e. 50% in the ondansetron arm, and
      30% in the ramosetron arm, consistent with a previous study. Using a power of 80% (Î²=0.2) and
      a two sided significance level(alpha) of 0.05, 45 patients in each group were required.
