  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of
      moxifloxacin or amoxicillin plus metronidazole in one-stage scaling and root planing in
      treating generalized aggressive periodontitis. Forty five subjects will be randomly allocated
      to 3 treatment groups. Subgingival plaque samples will be analysed for cultivable bacteria.
      The primary outcome variable to determine the superiority of one treatment over the others
      would be differences between groups for means CAL changes at 6 months post-treatment.
      Secondary outcome variables include differences between therapies for the mean changes in the
      mean levels of PD and the proportion of BOP.

    <description>The interventions are Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) combined with systemically administered moxifloxacin (MOX) 400 mg, once daily for 7 days.The experimental treatment group consist of SRP combined with systemically administered MOX at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days.One-stage full-mouth SRP under local anesthesia will be performed (using manual instruments and ultrasonic debridement) in approximately 2 h and half by the same experienced clinician.The endpoint of SRP will be a tactile smooth root surface. The adjunctive agent will start at the SRP visit. Subjects in the MOX group will be extensively informed about the intake of the prescribed medication.</description>
