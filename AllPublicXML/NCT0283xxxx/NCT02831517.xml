      The primary objectives of this study are: To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of
      BIIB074 administered as a single oral dose in healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants;
      and To evaluate the PK properties of BIIB074 administered as repeated oral doses in healthy
      Japanese participants. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of BIIB074 administered as a single oral dose (Japanese and Caucasian
      participants) and as repeated oral doses (Japanese participants).
