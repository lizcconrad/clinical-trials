    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of TMS on the ANS. The investigator
      will determine whether single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex in the dominant
      hemisphere in healthy, young adults will affect 1) heart rate and heart rate variability, 2)
      blood pressure and 3) baroreflex function. This study is foundational in that it will begin
      to characterize how single-pulse TMS affects the ANS in healthy adults.

      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of TMS on the ANS.
      Specifically; the investigator aim to determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor
      cortex in the dominant hemisphere in healthy, young adults will significantly affect 1) heart
      rate and heart rate variability, 2) blood pressure and 3) baroreflex function.

      The first purpose of this study is to measure alterations in sympathetic and parasympathetic
      activation in response to TMS. To do this, we will measure HRV immediately after single-pulse
      TMS. The second purpose is to investigate the changes in blood pressure in response to TMS
      and to determine whether the baroreflex, a critical modulator of blood pressure, is inhibited
      by TMS.

      Aim 1: To determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex will significantly alter
      heart rate variability. We hypothesize that single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex will
      elicit an acute decrease in heart rate and result in improved heart rate variability
      indicated by a significantly decreased LF power and increased HF power.

      Aim 2: To determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex will significantly alter
      blood pressure and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). We hypothesize that single-pulse TMS of the
      primary motor cortex will elicit an acute decrease in blood pressure by inhibiting the
      baroreflex.
