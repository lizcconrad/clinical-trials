  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, prospective clinical trial, patients with trigger finger or trigger
      thumb, will be treated with two different methods; ultrasound-guided release of the first
      annular pulley or open surgical release of A1 pulley. Results will be compared regarding
      functional, clinical and cosmetic outcome.
