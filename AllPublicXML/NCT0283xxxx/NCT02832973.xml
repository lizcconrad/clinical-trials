      A randomized clinical trial comparing sequential nephron blockage (SNB) with dual blockade of
      the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) plus bisoprolol (DBB) in the treatment of resistant
      arterial hypertension (RH) was designed to investigate the importance of the SNB and the
      contribution of its volume component versus DBB and the importance of the serum renin in
      maintaining BP levels. This randomized trial with two treatment arms could help tailor
      therapy by identifying a more effective choice to control hypertension whether by acting on
      the control of volume or sodium balance, or by acting on the effects of the RAAS on the
      kidney.

      Methods - Participants: 80 patients undergoing treatment for RH with losartan (100-200 mg),
      chlorthalidone (25 mg), and amlodipine (5 mg) will be randomly divided into two groups after
      applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Group 1: Sequential nephron blockade (SNB Group) n = 40 Group 2: Dual blockade of the RAAS
      plus bisoprolol (DBB Group) n = 40 Intervention: SNB consists in a progressive increase in
      sodium depletion. After the administration of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and
      aldosterone receptor blocker, low doses of furosemide are administered and subsequently
      amiloride is prescribed to enhance the natriuretic effect.

      The dual blockade of the RAAS plus bisoprolol is used to increase the effect of angiotensin
      receptor 1 blockers (ARBs). Therapy then requires sequentially adding an angiotensin
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to reduce the levels of angiotensin (Ang) II resulting from
      blockage of the Ang II receptor and then to administer a beta-blocker to decrease the
      elevated renin secretion due to both the ACE inhibitors and ARBs Objective: This study, which
      compares two antihypertensive treatment regimens in patients with RH, has the following
      objectives: to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SNB against DBB in RH patients, and to
      assess the side effects and adherence to treatment over 20 weeks of treatment.

      Enrollment: The eligibility criteria will follow those shown in the flowchart for the
      diagnosis of RH of the First Brazilian Position on RH.

      Patients will be excluded if they have: chronic renal failure, atrial
      fibrillation/atrioventricular block, contraindication to the drugs that will be used, refusal
      or failure to follow the regimen and secondary hypertension.

      Follow-up: Patients will be analyzed in five visits at intervals of 28 days for 20 weeks

      Introduction

      Resistant hypertension (RH) is characterized when the blood pressure (BP) remains above the
      recommended goal after taking three antihypertensive drugs with synergistic actions, at their
      maximum recommended tolerated doses for at least six months; one preferably should be a
      diuretic. True RH should be differentiated from pseudo resistance, which occurs due to
      non-adherence to treatment, inadequate BP measurements, inadequate doses of medications,
      inappropriate therapeutic regimens, or the presence of the so-called white-coat effect.

      The exact prevalence of RH is unknown. In controlled randomized studies with thousands of
      hypertensive patients, approximately 25% to 30% of participants did not achieve the BP goal
      recommended by guidelines despite receiving three or more antihypertensive drugs; these
      studies included careful assessments of adherence to therapy and even ambulatory BP
      monitoring (ABPM), which excludes patients with pseudo resistance.

      Observational data from the North American National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
      (NHANES) collected in 2003-2008 showed that the prevalence of RH among adults diagnosed with
      hypertension (HTN) in this period was 8.9% and among adults on antihypertensive treatment, it
      was 12.8%. Similarly, a large population study in Spain (68,000 patients) found that the
      prevalence of RH was 14.8% among those treated for HTN. Based on these recent studies, it is
      justifiable to say that the prevalence of RH is about 14%. RH is a difficult-to-manage
      clinical condition due to failure of patients to adhere to treatment, the physician's
      difficulty to adjust the medication because of genetic factors that hinder the effectiveness
      of treatment and medical inertia.

      Pathophysiology of resistant hypertension: The mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of
      RH are the vascular smooth muscle tone and increased blood volume, intensification of the
      activity of the sympathetic system and hyperactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system (RAAS). Increased sensitivity to sodium appears to be the main factor in understanding
      the pathophysiology of this syndrome, not only as it incorporates the above mechanisms, but
      also as it explains, in part, the variability of therapeutic response of patients with RH.
      The RAAS is vital to the regulatory system that controls total body sodium as are atrial
      natriuretic peptide factors and pressure receptors in the atria and kidney. Sodium and water
      retention can lead to resistance against antihypertensive drugs. Under the physiological
      point of view, BP is maintained by continuous regulation of cardiac output and peripheral
      vascular resistance exerted at three anatomic sites: arterioles, postcapillary venules
      (capacitance vessels) and the heart. A fourth anatomical site of control, the kidney,
      contributes to the maintenance of BP by regulating intravascular volume.

      Rational:

      Thus, identifying the contribution of volume and serum renin in maintaining BP levels could
      help tailor treatment with a more effective choice for hypertension control, whether by
      acting on the control of volume or sodium balance, or by acting on the effects of the RAAS on
      the kidney.

      Sequential nephron blockade consists in a progressive increase in sodium depletion. After the
      administration of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and aldosterone receptor blocker, low
      doses of furosemide are administered and subsequently amiloride is prescribed to enhance the
      natriuretic effect.

      The blockade of the RAAS is to increase the effect of the angiotensin receptor 1 blockers
      (ARBs). Therapy then requires sequentially adding an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor to reduce the levels of angiotensin (Ang) II resulting from the blockage of the Ang
      II receptor and then to administer a beta-blocker to decrease the elevated renin secretion
      due to both the ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

      Research question:

      The following research questions will be explored: Do sequential nephron blockade (SNB) and
      dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol (DBB) constitute
      good therapeutic options in the reduction of peripheral blood pressure of patients with RH?
      Which therapeutic option is able to reduce the central BP of resistant hypertensive patients?
      Is the strategy of SNB as good as DBB? Objectives: This study will compare two
      antihypertensive treatment regimens in RH patients of the Medical School in Sao Jose do Rio
      Preto. It aims to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SNB against DBB in RH patients, and
      to assess the side effects, and adherence to therapy over 20 weeks of treatment.

      Methods:

      A randomized clinical trial with two therapeutic regimens for RH, SNB and DBB, will be
      compared in an open-label prospective study at the Medical School in Sao Jose do Rio Preto.

      Eighty patients undergoing treatment for RH with losartan (100-200 mg), chlorthalidone (25
      mg), and amlodipine (5 mg) will be randomly divided into two groups after applying inclusion
      and exclusion criteria.

      Group 1: Sequential nephron blockade (SNB Group) - 40 patients will receive in addition to
      the basal therapy, spironolactone (25 mg), spironolactone 25 mg plus furosemide (20 mg),
      spironolactone (25 mg) plus furosemide (40 mg) and spironolactone (25 mg) plus furosemide (40
      mg) plus amiloride (5 mg), sequentially.

      Group 2: Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol (DBB
      Group) - 40 patients will receive, in addition to the basal therapy, ramipril (5 mg),
      ramipril (10 mg), ramipril (10 mg) plus bisoprolol (5 mg) and ramipril (10 mg) plus
      bisoprolol (10 mg), sequentially.

      Forty patients fulfilling the following criteria will be enrolled in each group:

      The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital de Base of the Medical
      School in São José do Rio Preto (FAMERP) and Brazilian Research Ethics Committee (#
      33943014.6.0000.5415).

      The nature of the study was carefully explained to patients and all individuals, after
      agreeing to participate in the study, signed informed consent forms and filled out a standard
      questionnaire.

      Measurement of BP including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM): The BP will be measured by
      the indirect method, following the VI Brazilian Guidelines for the Treatment of Hypertension.

      ABPM and home BP measurement will be carried out as additional tools to investigate
      hypertension according to the technical norms of the 5th Brazilian Guidelines on Ambulatory
      Blood Pressure Monitoring.

      ABPM will be performed using the Mobil-O-Graph (Netherlands). Anthropometric measurements
      (Weight and height), measured by anthropometric scales, will be used to calculate the body
      mass index (BMI) utilizing the formula BMI = weight (kg)/height squared (m²). The abdominal
      circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower costal
      margin. Values equal to or below 80 cm and 94 cm are considered appropriate for women and for
      men, respectively.

      Biochemical tests and imaging: Blood samples will be drawn from all patients at the first and
      last visits after fasting for 12 hours to measure total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
      triglycerides, glucose, insulin, creatinine, sodium and potassium.

      All patients will be submitted to electrocardiography, echocardiography, carotid Doppler,
      ultrasound with Doppler of the renal arteries, stress testing and radial artery applanation
      tonometry (AT).

      Study design:

      Patients will be analyzed in five visits at 28-day intervals. V zero: Week -4 to Week 0. All
      patients will remain under treatment with losartan (100 - 200 mg), chlorthalidone (25 mg),
      and amlodipine (5 mg). Individuals with BP &gt; 135/85 mmHg by ABPM will be randomized to one of
      the study groups.

      V1: Week 0 to Week 4. Individuals receive 25 mg of spironolactone (SNB Group) or 5 mg of
      ramipril (DBB Group).

      V2: Week 4 to Week 8. Individuals with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue using the same
      regimen. Subjects with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive in addition to their existing
      regimen, furosemide (20 mg) for the SNB Group and ramipril (10 mg) for the DBB Group.

      V3: Week 8 to Week 12. Subjects with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue on the same
      regimen. Individuals with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive an extra 40 mg of furosemide
      for patients in the SNB Group and 5 mg of bisoprolol for patients in the DBB Group.

      V4: Week 12 to Week 16. Subjects with BP &lt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will continue using the same
      regimen. Individuals with BP &gt;135/85 mmHg by ABPM will receive an extra 5 mg of amiloride for
      patients in the SNB Group and 10 mg of bisoprolol for patients in the DBB Group.

      V5: Week 16 to Week 20. Subjects will continue using the same regimen. Blood samples will be
      drawn from all patients. Radial artery applanation tonometry and ABPM will be performed.

      Statistical analysis:

      The t-test or Wilcoxon test (quantitative variables) and chi-square and Fisher test
      (qualitative variables) will be used in the comparative analysis of the clinical
      characteristics of the RH patients. Data will be expressed as means ± 1 standard deviation
      (SD).

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the strategy of sequential nephron blockade compared to
      dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol assuming an
      absolute difference of ≤ 5 mmHg for systolic BP, the sample size was estimated at 72
      individuals for an expected zero difference with 1 SD of 12 mmHg.

      Non-inferiority will be evaluated for a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated by a
      linear mixed model for repeated measures. P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.

      Primary outcomes:

      Reduction of systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean BP and pulse pressure after 20 weeks of
      treatment with sequential nephron blockade compared to dual blockade of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plus bisoprolol.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Safety and tolerability, biochemical changes, evaluation of the renal function and
      recognition of hypotension (ABPM). Assessment of BP outcomes (mean of three measurements by
      an automatic electronic device - Omron 711) and hemodynamic parameters (Omron 9000 device)
      will be measured in the office at all follow-up visits.

      Missing or dropout Participants: Patients will be registered with a phone number and address
      for further contact in case of missing visits.

      Sample size:

      The calculation of the sample size with an alpha error of 5%, statistical power of 80%,
      standard deviation of 8 mmHg, and maximum acceptable absolute difference of 6 mmHg (diastolic
      BP), indicated the necessity to study 36 patients per group (SNB versus DBB). However,
      considering a potential rate of 10-15% dropout or loss to follow-up, 40 will be considered
      for each group. The difference of 5 mmHg (diastolic BP) has been achieved, on average, in
      clinical trials that have demonstrated the advantage of one drug over placebo or other
      non-pharmacological treatments in the prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes.

      No washout period will be used.
