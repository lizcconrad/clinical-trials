      To test the benefits of ERCP Mechanical Simulator (EMS) practice in improving ERCP
      cannulation success rate of novice surgical trainees.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Practicing Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures using the EMS
      provides opportunities for novice endoscopists to learn basic ERCP skills without a patient.
      In two randomized controlled trials (RCT), coached EMS practice increased selective bile duct
      cannulation success rate of novice endoscopists. Surgical trainees do not have sufficient
      endoscopy experience to meet the perceived basic requirement for ERCP training. However, ERCP
      is done with a side-viewing scope and even experienced GI trainees have difficult initially
      mastering the basic skill with scope manipulation and cannulation. It is not known whether
      EMS can provide additional benefit to novice surgical ERCP trainees.

    <description>Device: ERCP mechanical simulator training EMS group was coached (by JWL) on how to use the EMS, and then practiced with supervision by a senior surgeon biliary endoscopist (WBM). Trainees practiced for a total of 20 hours performing basic maneuvers including scope insertion 2 hours, scope positioning 6 hours, selective guide wire cannulation of common bile duct (CBD) stricture or pancreatic duct (PD) 10 hours and placement of a biliary stent 2 hours.
All trainees received hands-on supervised clinical ERCP practice on patients. Time taken to perform ERCP procedures was documented. Trainees received verbal instructions, hands-on assistance from the trainer in performing the clinical procedure. If the trainee still failed after 20 minutes, the trainer took over.</description>
