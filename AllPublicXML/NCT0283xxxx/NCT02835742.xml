          3. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other study procedures specified in the protocol (including short-term hospital
             admission).

          4. Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis diagnosed by both HR-CT and biopsy and/or
             BAL as well as GM-CSF antibodies in serum positive.

          5. PaO2 &lt; 70 mmHg after 5 minutes spine position at room air, or PaO2 &lt; 75 mmHg after 5
             minutes spine position at room air and with symptom(s) including cough, sputum and
             exertional dyspnea

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed as secondary or hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

          2. WBC of 12,000/mm3 or more

          3. Fever of 38 degree celsius or more

          4. Severe edema

          5. History of malignant disease within recent 5 years (not applied to the treated cases
             of uterine carcinoma in situ and local basal cell carcinoma)

          6. Complication of cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure, angina
             pectoris, hemorrhagic tendency, etc with severe condition.

          7. Complication of respiratory diseases such as pulmonary infectious disease(incl.
             pulmonary tuberculosis), bronchial asthma, lung fibrosis ,interstitial pneumonitis, or
             bronchiectasis, in which the evaluations of safety and efficacy of GM-CSF therapy are
             considered as difficult.

          8. History or complication of infectious diseases which require systemic administration
             of antibiotics, antifungal or antiviral agents within recent 2 weeks.

          9. Treatment with other cytokines

         10. Pregnant or possibly pregnant women, lactating women, and women who desire to become
             pregnant during the study period

         11. Patients who have been treated with whole-lung lavage, repeated segmental-lung lavage,
             or rituximab within 6 months before the start of the study (this criterion does not
             apply to patients for whom 6 months or more have elapsed after their last lavage or
             rituximab)

         12. Severe liver dysfunction (AST &gt; 100 IU/L and/or ALT &gt; 100 IU/L and/or T-bil &gt;3.0mg/dL)

         14. Previous experience of severe and unexplained side-effects during aerosol delivery of
             any kind of medicinal product

         15. Treatment with oral or intravenous administration or inhalation of corticosteroids.

         16. Treatment with other inhaled drugs.

         17. Previously treated with GM-CSF before the start of the study.

         18. Demonstrate hypersensitivity to GM-CSF agent.

         19. Other patients judged to be inappropriate for the study by the attending physician
             (e.g., patients who are unlikely to complete treatment or are uncooperative).
