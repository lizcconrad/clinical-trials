  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this split mouth, single-center, controlled study is to compare the healing of
      intrabony defects treated with a combination of Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral (ABBM)/Platelet
      Rich Fibrin (PRF) or Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral alone. The hypothesis being tested in the
      study was that PRF would augment the regenerative effects of ABBM in human intrabony defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) is extensively used in the treatment of intrabony
      defects. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a new generation platelet concentrate with a
      simplified technique. Although there are some studies on the use of PRF in the treatment of
      intrabony defects, to date none of them evaluate its additive effects with ABBM. Therefore, a
      randomized, split mouth clinical trial was conducted to compare the healing of intrabony
      defects treated with a PRF/ABBM combination and to those obtained with ABBM alone. Using a
      split mouth design, 15 paired intrabony defects were randomly treated with either ABBM alone
      (control group) or with ABBM- PRF combination (test group). The following clinical parameters
      and radiographic measurements were recorded at baseline and six months postoperatively:
      plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), clinical
      attachment level (CAL), vertical bone loss, the depth of the defect and defect angle
