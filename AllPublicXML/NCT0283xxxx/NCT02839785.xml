  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPARCLE 1 and 2 studies followed a cohort of 818 children with cerebral palsy (CP) between 8
      and 12 (SPARCLE 1) and 13 and 18 years old (SPARCLE 2) interviewed at home. The prevalence of
      pain in these populations was respectively 60 and 69% while it is about 35% in typically
      developed children of the same age.

      The main location of the pain for 60% of children with CP was the lower limbs, caused by
      musculoskeletal pain and movement (for those who can) and therapeutic procedures. In SPARCLE
      2, 50% of the children complained about pain during physical therapy.

      If the pain is part of the management of physiotherapy, a recent review showed that for a
      condition such as chronic back pain, the level of evidence of the effectiveness of
      physiotherapy techniques in reducing pain is low. The effectiveness of these techniques would
      include higher efficacy on anxiety than pain itself.

      Despite significant involvement of physiotherapists in the management of pain, the focus on
      pain should increase, in particular taking into account the procedural/induced pain (caused
      by treatment).

      In addition to drugs, physical methods (analgesic therapy) or psychotherapy are used to
      reduce the pain of children during medical procedures. For the latter most of them require
      the presence of two individuals to provide the therapy. This is unsuited for out-patient care
      provided to the majority of children with CP.

      Non steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), are first recommended, alone or in combination
      with the treatment of several indications in child pain (migraine, postoperative pain, etc.).
      Ibuprofen is commonly used in children during painful procedures and represented the 4th
      molecule among prescribed per os analgesic drugs in 2008 in the United States.
