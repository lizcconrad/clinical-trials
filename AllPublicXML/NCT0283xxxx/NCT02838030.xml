  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the incidence of preeclampsia ranges from 2 to 10% of pregnancies. The World
      Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the incidence of preeclampsia is seven times higher
      in developing countries than in developed (2.8% and 0.4%). In Mexico it is estimated that
      preeclampsia - eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
      Because it is an idiopathic heterogeneous syndrome associated with endothelial damage, so far
      there is no effective treatment to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this entity, so it
      is necessary to strengthen prevention; the use of aspirin alone is inconclusive, in addition
      to the information the investigators have reduced the effect of these strategies on arterial
      stiffness; Moreover, it has been observed that L-arginine lowers blood pressure in this
      population. It is for this that is of interest to know the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of L-arginine low dose, which is known as an important eNOS in NO production
      substrate, and aspirin for its qualities of antiinflammatory and anticoagulant in the
      prevention of preeclampsia and also determine their effect on arterial stiffness as a
      noninvasive method, as is the applanation tonometry.

      It will conduct a clinical trial, double-blind, randomized and placebo control group female
      patients with 12 weeks of gestation have one or more risk factors for developing
      preeclampsia. 2 groups will be formed with 82 patients each, chance will determine the
      intervention (acetylsalicylic + L-arginine acetylsalicylic acid or acid + placebo). At the
      beginning and end of the intervention clinical and laboratory determinations, the end will be
      determined in both groups the incidence of preeclampsia, severity and number needed to treat
      is made. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 22. It was
      considered statistically significant at p &lt;0.05.
