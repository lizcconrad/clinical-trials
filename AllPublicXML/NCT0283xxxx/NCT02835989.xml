  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community Paramedicine @Home (CP@Home) is a novel community paramedicine health assessment
      program for high users of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Individuals who have been
      identified as active callers to EMS, individuals who have called EMS for lift-assists, and
      direct paramedic referrals are referred into the community paramedicine home visit program.
      The program will focus on in-home chronic disease management, community health service
      connections, and EMS usage education. Aside from chronic disease management, aspects of the
      program include health-related quality of life, social isolation and other social
      determinants of health. Participants in the program will have up to 3 one-on-one home visits
      from a community paramedic to ultimately reduce repeat EMS calls and improve their overall
      health.

    <description>The experimental group will receive the CP@Home program. The main elements of this program include BP assessment, diabetes risk assessment, falls risk assessment, heart failure risk assessment, neurologic assessment, psychiatric assessment, depression screening, health-related quality of life analysis (including pain, mobility, anxiety/depression, ADLs), social isolation screening, and food and income security. The program is targeted at referrals to appropriate community resources, identification and referral of high-risk patients to their family physician (FP), as well as regular communication of participants' health information to their physician.
The intervention will be implemented by community paramedics from the local paramedic service who have undergone a structured training program (4 hours of online, interactive training modules, including case studies and the observation of an intervention visits led by another paramedic) to assure intervention fidelity.</description>

    <description>Community paramedics (CPs) will be assigned to visiting the participants for a first time the week following the initial EMS call. Participants will complete the informed consent process with a CP on their first visit. This visit will also include a full assessment and risk analysis that will take approximately 90 minutes and will be located in the participant's home. As a result of the initial visit, the CP will make all relevant clinical referrals and decisions based on predetermined @Home algorithms. A second visit will be made to the participant 2-4 weeks following the initial call for a streamlined follow-up and reassessment during a 30 minute period. A final visit will be made 6-8 weeks following the initial call for a final evaluation of their situation. It is anticipated the patient will be discharged from the CP@Home program at this point. If the patient calls EMS following the third visit, if they meet the inclusion criteria, they will be re-entered into the CP@Home program.</description>
