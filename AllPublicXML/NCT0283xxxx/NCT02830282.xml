      This is a nested multicenter, prospective cohort study within the I-SPY 2 TRIAL for women
      undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer who are also undergoing
      definitive surgical resection and have clinical or radiographic evidence of residual tumor at
      the completion of chemotherapy.

        women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary breast cancer who are undergoing
        definitive surgical resection and have clinical or radiographic evidence of residual tumor
        at the completion of chemotherapy

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment on the treatment phase of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL

          -  Completed a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or assigned treatment on I-SPY 2
             and planning definitive surgical resection. Participants who have discontinued
             assigned treatment on I-SPY 2, switched to standard of care, and have completed a
             standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen are still considered eligible.

          -  Pre-surgical imaging or clinical examination demonstrating residual disease in the
             breast. Participants with any extent of enhancement attributable to tumor on the
             pre-surgical MRI are eligible. No minimum extent of palpable tumor pre-surgery is
             required.

          -  Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol
             specifications

          -  No clinical evidence of distant metastatic disease. Pre-chemotherapy staging scans are
             sufficient in the absence of any symptoms or subsequent clinical evidence suggesting
             distant metastases

          -  Age 18 or over and are able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals under the age of 18

          -  Individuals who cannot understand and give informed consent. We will not be assessing
             decisional capacity; determination of ability to give informed consent will be at the
             discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Pregnancy. Participants in the parent I-SPY 2 TRIAL are screened for pregnancy at
             enrollment and pregnancy is an exclusion criteria. No additional screening for
             pregnancy is required for participants enrolling on SURMOUNT. However if a study
             participant does become pregnant while on study or during the course of the 10 year
             follow-up, the study participant will remain on the study protocol and will not be
             withdrawn. Because this is an observational study and does not have a therapeutic
             component, there will be no increased risk to following a study participant through
             annual blood draws and medical information abstraction from the medical chart who may
             or may not become pregnant during the course of the follow-up period.
