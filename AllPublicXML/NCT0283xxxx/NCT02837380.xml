    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the PK of FF/UMEC/VI in dose combinations of
      100/62.5/25 mcg after single and repeat dose administration from a DPI in healthy Chinese
      subjects. This study will evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK), of FF/UMEC/VI in
      Chinese healthy population when administered using dry powder inhaler (DPI)as a blended
      combination of UMEC/VI in one strip and FF in the second strip in dose combinations of
      100/62.5/25 mcg. The triple, fixed dose combination product Fluticasone furoate(FF)/
      Vilanterol (VI) /Umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) with new configuration enables the delivery of
      inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), Long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and
      inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) from a single device. Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled
      in the study. After taking into account the allowable time windows for screening, treatment
      and follow-up, a subject will be in the study for a maximum duration of 6-7 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following
             specific requirements: Ventricular rate inside the range 40-90 beats (inclusive) per
             minute (bpm) at screening, PR interval &lt;=210milliseconds (msec), No pathological Q
             waves, QRS interval &gt;=60 msec and &lt;=120 msec, the waveforms must enable the QT
             interval to be clearly defined and the corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method
             (QTcF) must be &lt;450msec (machine or manual reading) based on a single ECG value, or an
             average from three ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=80% predicted and a FEV1/Forced Vital
             Capacity (FVC) ratio &gt;=0.7

          -  AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin &lt;=1.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Male/females aged between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive), at the time of signing
             the informed consent. Male and female is 1:1.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 Kilogram (Kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19-24 Kg per
             square meter (m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and lung
             function testing. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the investigator considers the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and outcome.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers and have not used any tobacco products in the 6
             month period preceding screening and have a pack history of &lt;=10 pack years.

        [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day /20) x number of years smoked]

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if: she is of child-bearing potential and
             is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate
             period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start
             of dosing to sufficiently minimize the chance of pregnancy at that point or She must
             agree to use contraception until the follow-up visit (i.e. until follow-up visit is
             complete) or she is on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status
             is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method or she is confirmed postmenopausal or permanently sterilised
             (example [e.g.] tubal occlusion, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             gonadotropin (HCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen or on admission to the Unit.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational

             investigational product (whichever is longer) or has had exposure to more than four

             opinion of the investigator, contraindicates their participation.

          -  A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of clinically
             significant abnormalities. A chest X-ray must be taken before Day1, in any day between
