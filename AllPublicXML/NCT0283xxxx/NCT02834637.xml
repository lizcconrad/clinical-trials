  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 15-44 years in East Africa, and
      mortality rates are very high. HPV vaccines are most effective if given to girls who have not
      yet acquired HPV infection. In Tanzania, HPV vaccine has been shown to be safe, acceptable
      and can be delivered with high coverage (around 80%). However, the cost of delivering HPV
      vaccine is considerably higher than costs for traditional infant/child vaccinations. This is
      primarily because of costs to establish outreach programmes and associated personnel costs
      including nurses who must spend significant time away from their posts to deliver vaccine,
      especially if multiple doses are needed. There is global interest in simplifying HPV vaccine
      delivery by reducing the number of doses. If a single dose could be given, this could halve
      the costs of delivery, making it more accessible to the populations that need it most.
      Recently, the WHO recommended that 2 doses of HPV vaccine could be given to young girls,
      based on studies in high and upper middle income countries. However in Africa high rates of
      infections like malaria and worms can affect immune responses to vaccines. It is essential to
      know that reducing the number of doses does not reduce the protective immune response of
      these vaccines. The investigators are conducting a trial in Tanzanian girls aged 9-14 years
      to establish whether a single dose of HPV vaccine produces immune responses that are likely
      to be effective in preventing cervical cancer. Two different HPV vaccines, the bivalent (2-v)
      vaccine that protects against HPV 16/18 (the cause of 70% of cancers) and a new 9-valent
      (9-v) vaccine that protects against 9 HPV types, will be compared. The trial will randomise
      900 girls to 6 groups and follow them for 36 months. Girls will receive the 2-v or the 9-v
      HPV vaccine, as 1, 2 or 3 doses. Girls receiving 1 or 2 doses will be compared with those
      receiving 3 doses of the same vaccine, to ensure that the reduced dose regimen produces an
      immune response that is not inferior to the standard 3 doses. The immune responses in this
      study will also be compared with results from other countries where the vaccine has been
      shown to be protective. This will provide information about whether a reduced number of doses
      is likely to be protective in Africa. This work will be extremely important in informing
      future HPV vaccination strategies and will be one of the first randomised trials of 1 and 2
      doses of any HPV vaccine in Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary cause of cervical cancer, a major public
      health problem in Africa. Currently there are three vaccines (Cervarix, Gardasil® and
      Gardasil-9®) that offer excellent protection against HPV infection with vaccine-related HPV
      genotypes. The objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of immune responses
      with 1 dose of HPV vaccine compared with the recommended 2 or 3 doses of the same vaccine by
      evaluating HPV 16/18-specific seropositivity, antibody avidity and memory B cell responses at
      M36. Specifically, the investigators will determine whether a single dose of the 2-valent HPV
      vaccine (Cervarix, that protects against HPV 16/18 genotypes) or of a new 9-valent HPV
      vaccine (Gardasil-9,that protects against HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) produces immune
      responses that are non-inferior to those observed with 3 doses of vaccine when given to
      HIV-negative 9-14 years old girls in a malaria-endemic region of Tanzania.

      The trial will also determine whether the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently
      recommended 2 dose strategy for girls aged under 15 years produces similar immune responses
      in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared to the previously recommended 3 dose schedule. In
      addition, the cost-effectiveness of alternative dosing schedules and of the two vaccines will
      be explored.

      The trial will enrol 900 girls who are resident in Mwanza into an un-blinded,
      individually-randomised trial with 6 arms. Arm A will comprise participants randomised to
      receive 3 doses of the 2-valent vaccine, Arm B those randomised to receive 2 doses of the
      2-valent vaccine and Arm C those randomised to receive 1 dose of the 2-valent vaccine. Arms
      D, E and F will be those participants randomised to receive 3, 2 or 1 dose of the 9-valent
      vaccine, respectively.

      The effect of different dose schedules and type of HPV vaccine on a range of immune responses
      will be measured up to 36 months after the first dose. The protocol will be harmonised, and
      laboratory procedures and immunological endpoints will be cross-validated, with those of a
      large HPV vaccine dose-reduction efficacy trial being planned by the NIH in Costa Rica to
      examine the protective effect of the same vaccines given as 1 or 2 doses.This trial will
      allow the examination of quality and durability of antibody responses, and safety and
      cost-effectiveness of reduced dose schedules compared to the originally recommended 3 dose
      schedule in a population with high burden of malaria and other infections that may affect
      vaccine immune responses.
