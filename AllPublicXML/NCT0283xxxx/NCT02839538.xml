      Background and Objectives: Postoperative analgesia and early recovery are relevant for
      hospital discharge after hemorrhoidectomy. This study investigated the postoperative
      analgesic effect with local infiltration compared with spinal block.

      Methods: This randomized study included 40 patients aged 18 to 60 years old. Local group (LG)
      received local infiltration under general anaesthesia; spinal group (SG) received a
      subarachnoid block. LG received general anaesthesia with propofol, atracurium and propofol
      infusion as well as a local infiltration of 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine. SG received 2 ml of 0.5%
      hyperbaric bupivacaine. Analgesic supplementation was with 50µg of fentanyl for LG and 1%
      lidocaine for SG. There were assessed: postoperative pain intensity, sphincter relaxation,
      motor blockade of lower limbs, time to discharge, analgesic dose over 1 week and adverse
      effects.

      This is a prospective, randomized study, including 40 patients between 18 and 60 years, of
      both genders, ASA 1 or 2.

      Patients in group 1( n= 19 ) will be submitted to spinal block and group 2 (n=21) to local
      infiltration. The spinal block will be performed with 10 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The
      infiltration will be performed with 10 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine on each side.

      Will be evaluated: intensity of pain on a numerical scale from 0 to 10 every 30 minutes,
      relaxation of the sphincter muscles, intensity of pain after the operation every 30 minutes
      until reached the criteria for discharge, motor blocked of the lower limbs every 30 minutes,
      BP, HR, SO2, FR, other items that determine the conditions of discharge (urine output, nausea
      and vomiting), time to hospital discharge, and duration of analgesia.

      Adverse effects and complications will be noted.
