  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine whether the addition of trospium chloride to xanomeline
      tartrate will ameliorate the peripheral cholinergic side effects that have been previously
      experienced with xanomeline tartrate when administered alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this inpatient study, volunteers will received either xanomeline alone, or xanomeline plus
      trospium for 7 days. Subjects will report cholinergic side effects daily via visual analog
      scales, for each of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and excessive salivation. Clinician
      administered scales will also be administered daily for assessment of the same cholinergic
      side effects.
