      The investigators will randomize women diagnosed with anemia in the mid-trimester of
      pregnancy to once or twice daily iron supplementation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women defined as having iron deficiency anemia based on a low hemoglobin as defined by the
      American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a low serum ferritin, in the absence of
      hemoglobinopathy, will be randomized to ferrous sulfate 325mg PO daily or PO twice daily.
