  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among youth, the prevalence of mental health and addiction (MHA) disorders is roughly 20%,
      yet youth are challenged to access services in a timely fashion. To address MHA system gaps,
      this study will test the benefits of an Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCT) model for
      at-risk youth with MHA challenges. In partnership with community agencies, adolescent
      psychiatry hospital departments, and family health teams, investigators have developed an
      innovative model of service provision involving rapid access to MHA services. This model will
      be implemented and compared to the usual treatment youth receive in hospital-based,
      outpatient, mental health clinics in Toronto. A rapid, systematic, approach to MHA services
      geared to need in a youth-friendly environment is expected to result in better MHA outcomes
      for youth. Moreover, the ICCT approach is expected to decrease service wait-times, be more
      youth- and family-centred, and be more cost-effective.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) with random allocation occurring
      within each hospital site to either treatment as usual (TAU) (4 out-patient hospital sites)
      or treatment at one of 3 community-based Integrated Collaborative Care Teams (ICCTs). A total
      of 500 youth aged 14-18 with mental health and/or addictions (MHA) concerns, referred for
      out-patient services at one of four local hospitals, will be randomized to receive ICCT care
      versus TAU. For each youth, a primary caregiver will also be recruited into the study, if
      available.

      With wide inclusion criteria and a design meant to emulate a &quot;real world&quot; setting, this study
      will rigorously evaluate a service delivery model composed of multiple interventions for
      youth presenting with a broad range of MHA problems. The ICCT is expected to result in better
      MHA outcomes, show better performance indicators, and be more cost-effective than TAU.

    <description>Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCTs) are housed in the local community to improve youth access, in three neighborhoods across Toronto (East Metro Youth Services [EMYS]-Scarborough, EMYS-Southeast Toronto, and Delisle Youth Services-Central Toronto). Each ICCT will include a variety of service providers and coordinated patient care delivering evidence-informed interventions in a stepped-care model.</description>

    <description>The comparator arm consists of out-patient TAU in a hospital setting and will occur at one of four outpatient hospital sites across Toronto.
Partners include the following four hospitals: Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Michael Garron Hospital (formerly the Toronto East General Hospital), and Sunnybrook Hospital.</description>
