  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent unilateral, non-infectious pleural exudate is suspicious for primary or secondary
      pleural malignancy. Both conditions are associated with 5-year survival of 10%. Work-up is
      difficult, as the pleural surface is large and &lt;33% of pleural malignancies shed malignant
      cells to the pleural fluid. Even so, additional tissue biopsies are needed for establishing
      mutation status for targeted therapies.

      Optimal imaging to guide tissue sampling is pivotal. PET-CT has higher sensitivity than
      conventional CT for detecting malignant lesions &gt;10mm. However, no randomised trial has
      investigated differences in diagnostic accuracy, time-to-diagnosis, or economics. Falsely
      PET-positive lesions in e.g. colon however, lead to more derived tests than do CT alone.

      Gold standard for pleural tissue sampling is the surgical (VATS) thoracoscopy, allowing
      direct visual guiding of tissue sampling from all pleural surfaces. Yet, globally the medical
      (pleuroscopy) thoracoscopy is more widely used: cheaper, outpatient procedure, but allows
      only sampling from the parietal pleura. To date, no randomised studies have compared medical
      and surgical thoracoscopy concerning diagnostic hit rates, adverse events, or economics.

      The investigators will perform two randomized studies to investigate whether

        1. PET/CT is comparable to CT alone

        2. VATS is comparable to pleuroscopy concerning hit rate, total investigations performed,
           time-to-diagnosis.
