  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a new lever drive wheelchair, LARA - Lever Actuated
      Resonance Assistance. LARA facilitates patients in performing a high amount of practice using
      their moderate to severely impaired upper extremity after stroke.

      Investigators will recruit 44 subjects with subacute strokes to participate in the study
      through the acute rehabilitation unit of the UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. Study participants
      will be randomized into 2 groups: LARA therapy group or standard therapy group. The LARA
      therapy group will use LARA to propel themselves to therapy appointments in the unit and to
      play video games with the affected upper extremity for 30 mins / day. The standard therapy
      group will use a standard wheelchair to propel themselves using their unaffected upper and
      lower extremities. They will be asked to perform a matched duration of standard arm exercises
      for 30 mins/ day. This program of standard arm exercises was developed by an OT at the
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago which consists of graded-difficulty table-supported
      exercises.

      This study will have 3 assessment visits: baseline, 3 weeks after therapy or upon discharge
      from the acute rehabilitation unit if sooner, and a 3-month follow up.

    <description>The LARA arm of this study will use the LARA system while study participants are staying at the acute rehabilitation unit of UC Irvine Douglas Hospital. LARA is a system that facilitates patients to perform high amounts of arm movement with the affected upper extremity. Study participants are able to actively propel themselves in the unit.</description>
