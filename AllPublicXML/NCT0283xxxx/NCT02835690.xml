    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      efficacy of three doses of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adult Chinese participants with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Cycle 1 is 28 days long; subsequent cycles are 21 days long.

             address.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Has histologically-/cytologically-confirmed, advanced unresectable NSCLC and has
             measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
             (RECIST 1.1) as determined by the site.

          -  Has failed established standard medical anti-cancer therapies or has been intolerant
             to such therapy, or in the opinion of the investigator have been considered ineligible
             for any form of standard therapy on medical grounds.

          -  Has a score of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance
             Status within 3 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has adequate organ function.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate
             method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

          -  Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B or C.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the study.

          -  Has received or will receive a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first
             administration of study drug.

          -  Is at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance
