      The purpose of this study is to learn how medications participant will receive in the course
      of their delivery are metabolized (broken down by the body). The investigators hope to learn
      more about the way drugs are metabolized by pregnant women, and how those drugs are
      distributed in the blood and body compartments and cleared in the urine, and how maternal
      body weight affects the metabolism. With this information the investigators will be able to
      develop a treatment regimen considering factors in the body that affect magnesium levels so
      that the investigators can improve treatment of pregnant women. The goal of the study is to
      understand how different dosing of magnesium sulfate affects blood levels of the magnesium in
      larger women.

      Magnesium sulfate is generally given to patients to protect the mother against seizures in
      the case of preeclampsia. Different hospitals in the United States use different doses of
      magnesium sulfate. Participants will receive one of two accepted doses of magnesium sulfate
      for preeclampsia. The dose is usually 4g - 6g at the start, with another dose of 2-3 g every
      hour until 24 hours after delivery. Participants will be assigned to either a dose of 4 g at
      the start, followed by 1g every hour; or a dose of 6 g at the start, followed by 2g every
      hour until treatment for preeclampsia is complete. Participants will receive magnesium
      sulfate in the course of their normal clinical care whether or not they participate in this
      study.
