  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative recovery after live donor nephrectomy (LDN) is largely determined by the
      consequences of postoperative pain and analgesia consumptions. The investigators' goal is to
      establish the relationship between the use of deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) during
      laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) and the early quality of recovery. Therefore, the
      investigators designed a trial in which patients scheduled for living donor nephrectomy are
      randomized into a group with deep NMB or moderate NMB. The primary outcome measurement will
      be the Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire (overall score) at 48 hours after extubation.

      Rationale: Postoperative recovery after live donor nephrectomy (LDN) is largely determined by
      the consequences of postoperative pain and analgesia consumptions. The use of deep
      neuromuscular blockade (NMB) has shown to reduce postoperative pain scores after laparoscopic
      surgery. With this study the investigators will investigate if deep NMB also improves the
      early quality of recovery after LDN.

      Objective: To establish the relationship between the use of deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB)
      during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) - with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum - and
      the early quality of recovery.

      Study design: A multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled trial

      Study population: 96 adult patients (18 years or older), scheduled for living donor
      nephrectomy, will be randomized into a group with deep or moderate neuromuscular blockade.
      Deep neuromuscular blockade is defined as post tetanic count 1-2.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measurement will be the Quality of
      Recovery-40 questionnaire (overall score) at 48 hours after extubation.

      Secondary outcomes measured are: intra-operative parameters (e.g. surgical conditions,
      operation time, length of pneumoperitoneum, first warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss,
      conversion to open or hand-assisted donor nephrectomy, intra-operative complications,
      cumulative use of rocuronium and sugammadex), the total score of the quality of Recovery-40
      questionnaire at 48 hours after extubation, post-operative pain (components of pain scores);
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (NRS), the cumulative use of analgesics and anti-emetics,
      time to reach discharge criteria and postoperative complications.

    <description>The QoR-40 is a validated assessment tool for measuring a patient's self-assessed quality of recovery after surgery. It consists of 40 questions measuring 5 dimensions: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence and pain. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, giving a minimal score of 40 and a maximum score of 200.</description>
