    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well an internet-delivered positive affect (PA)
      intervention works in managing emotion in young adult cancer survivors. An internet-delivered
      PA intervention may teach younger cancer survivors healthy coping skills and help doctors to
      learn more about what effects mood may have on the health and well-being of young adults with
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To adapt an individualized positive affect intervention that was developed for newly
      diagnosed HIV patients to use with young adult cancer survivors.

      II. To pilot test the positive affect intervention with young adult cancer survivors to
      determine its feasibility and acceptability.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe health related quality of life, psychological well-being, daily emotion
      reports, and health behaviors in young adult cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete an initial online questionnaire lasting about 25-30 minutes and report
      daily emotion via text message during weeks 1-2 and weeks 9-10. Patients complete an
      internet-delivered PA program during weeks 3-8. Each week consists of didactic material and
      20-30 minutes of daily online exercises. At the end of each day of the PA program, patients
      provide an end of day recall report via text message. Patients also receive booster text
      messages and emails.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 12 weeks.
