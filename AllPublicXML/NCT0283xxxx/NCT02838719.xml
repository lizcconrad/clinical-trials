  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anaesthesia technique that provides
      analgesia to the parietal peritoneum as well as skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal
      wall. In the past, a number of adjuvants have been added to the local anaesthetics in
      peripheral and neuraxial blocks resulting in an effective and long lasting analgesia.In
      recent times, dexamethasone has been increasingly used as an adjuvant to local anaesthetics
      in peripheral nerve blocks. Dexamethasone has a long and efficient glucocorticoid structure
      and also has anti-inflammatory property. It also blocks the C- fibers of pain pathway. When
      added to local anaesthetics as an adjuvant in peripheral nerve blocks, it has shown to
      prolong the analgesia time. A number of previous studies have also shown an opioid sparing
      effect of steroids, when used intravenously perioperatively. Though previous studies have
      shown that addition of dexamethasone to local anaesthetics in transverse abdominis plane
      block prolongs the duration of block, however it is not known whether this effect of
      dexamethasone is due to its peripheral action or because of its systemic absorption. Thus, in
      this study planned to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone on quality and duration of
      analgesia when used as an adjuvant with local anaesthetics in transverse abdominis plane
      block versus when given systemically by intravenous route along with transverse abdominis
      plane block using local anaesthetics only, in patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopic
      procedures under general anaesthesia.
