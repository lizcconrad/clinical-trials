  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong causal association between persisting genital tract infection with Human
      Papilloma Virus (HPV) and gradual progression of infection to cervical (mouth of uterus)
      cancer.The robust study from India have shown that single round of HPV DNA screening test to
      significantly reduce the cervical cancer mortality. The above findings are very encouraging
      since it demonstrates that a simple and reliable HPV DNA test which is now available in low
      income countries has a potential to be accepted as primary screening test in future.

      The cross-sectional studies from developed countries from year 1999-2004 which focused to
      determine the test characteristics of HPV Hybrid Capture 2 test (HC2) to determine CIN2 and
      higher grade lesions, reported test sensitivity of 90% to 100% with a mean of 95%.

      Similarly the cross-sectional studies from developing countries from 1993 to 2003 which have
      focused on test characteristics of HPV DNA Hybrid capture 2 (HC2) test to determine CIN2 and
      higher grade lesions has shown a sensitivity in the range of 50% to 91% with an average
      sensitivity of 79%.Among the developing countries cross-sectional study from India which
      evaluated test reported sensitivity of only 68.2%.

      There is a statistical significant difference ( p value = 0.003) of sensitivity of HPV DNA
      HC2 test between the developed and developing countries to determine CIN2+ Lesions while
      there is no difference in the specificity.

      A study that was conducted in Chinese women to detected the prevalence of HPV genotype among
      women with mucopurulent cervicitis, healthy women and women with Invasive cancer, the author
      reported a 10% higher failure rates to extract HPV DNA in cases of mucopurulent cervicitis as
      compared to other two groups.

      So the study will explore if if the presence of untreated co-infections with STIs/RTIs
      (Sexually transmitted infections/Reproductive tract infections) resulting in cervical
      inflammation is somewhere interfering with low sensitivity of HC2 test due to presence of
      blood and excess mucus associated with the conditions leading to low sensitivity of the test
      in context to Indian Scenario.

      Methodology-The eligible women in the age group of 30-50 years will be screened. Eligibility
      criteria will be determined. Women with clinical cervicitis as per NACO guidelines on per
      speculum examination will been rolled as cases after signing the inform consent. Women with
      no signs and symptoms of cervicitis (No white discharge P/V,No lower Abdominal pain, No
      urinary symptoms,No dysperunia,No pruritis vulvae,No post coital bleeding)will be enrolled as
      controls after signing the inform consent. The participants ready to participate will be
      explained the details and the purpose of the study by Doctor.All the women enrolled in women
      shall be followed up after 7-14 days.

      Day 1.Cervical swab from ectocervix and endocervix shall be collected. Additional vaginal
      swab Will be taken from lateral vaginal wall and posterior fornices for all women enrolled in
      study.The swabs will be evenly spread on a glass slide and heat fixed. The slides will be put
      in slide box to be transported to Microbiology Department for Gram staining for Gonococcal,
      Non-Gonococcal infections,Bacterial Vaginosis,Candida. Next, cervical cells for HPV DNA
      testing will be collected.

      The women diagnosed with clinical cervicitis will receive treatment on the spot and advised
      use to use barrier contraception for 15 days.No treated will be given for the women in
      enrolled arm i.e women without clinical and lab STIs.

      Day7-14- All the women enrolled in study shall be followed up after 7-14 days. Women will
      undergo per-speculum examination and clinical signs of cervicitis or cervicovaginitis will be
      reassessed again and documented.

      A repeat cervical swab and vaginal swab shall be collected and send for gram staining for the
      above mentioned organisms.

      A repeat, cervical cells for HPV DNA testing will be collected. Women who are positive for
      HPV DNA and STIs on follow up visits shall be counselled and referred for further evaluation
      and treatment to appropriate hospital.
