  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on how to avoid POCD are limited. The purpose of this monocentric parallel - grouped
      observational registry is to collect study data of the incidence of postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction (POCD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive functioning of the study groups and the control group is measured with a battery of
      neuropsychological tests, computer-based tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
      Automated Battery [CANTAB®] and non-computer based tests.

      The neuropsychological assessment is performed at preoperative baseline, after 5-7 days and
      at three months follow up, and in some studies additionally at 1year, 2 year and 5 year
      follow-up. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) will be classified using different
      calculation methods, primarily the dichotomous approach established by Rasmussen et al. in
      the International Study on postoperative cognitive deficits (ISPOCD). This calculation method
      defines POCD as a reliable change in pre- and postoperative cognitive performance (difference
      scores) of each individual in the surgical patients cohort as compared to the changes in a
      non-surgical control group (reliable change index in either a composite score including
      cognitive test parameters from all tests in the cognitive test battery or in at least two of
      the chosen cognitive test parameters). Additional calculation methods like &quot;g-factor&quot;, &quot;GCP&quot;
      and arbitrary definitions e.g. &quot;20.20- rule&quot; will be used for detailed methodologic
      evaluation.
