    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to investigate the time difference in the diagnosing of
      anemia among elderly with hip fracture, between measurements with standard blood samples and
      non-invasive SpHb-measuring. Another aim is to investigate the relationship between perfusion
      index and prolong perioperative anemia and the potential impact on perioperative
      complications.

      Immediately after admission and diagnosis of a hip fracture the patients will be monitored
      with Masimo SpHb. The Patients will be continuously measured until the third day after
      surgery. The Monitors Hb and PI data but not the SpO2% will be blinded to all participating
      healthcare personnel.The first three postopertive days the patiens will daily be examined to
      determined it they have developed delirium.

      All perioperativ complications in that period will be monitored.
