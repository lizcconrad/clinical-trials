      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy
      of a second course of TPX-100 administered by intra-articular injection to subjects with
      osteoarthritis of the knee who participated in study TPX-100-1.

    <textblock>
      Recruit up to 70 subjects whom participated in protocol TPX-100-1. The opposing knee that was
      treated will be getting 200mg in 4 weekly injections. The knee that was treated in TPX-100-1
      will get randomized to either 200mg dose or a placebo lookalike. The investigators will
      follow these subjects for 6 months. Two MRIs of bi-lateral knees will be assessed. Also
      collection of ADA samples at 4 time points through the 6 month period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous enrollment in study TPX-100-1

          2. Able to read, understand, sign and date the subject informed consent

          3. Willingness to use only acetaminophen as the primary analgesic (pain-relieving) study
             medication during the injection period and through study day 30. The maximum dose of
             acetaminophen must not exceed 2 grams/day (2000 mg per day).

          4. Willingness to use only hydrocodone or hydrocodone/acetaminophen (e.g. Norco) for
             breakthrough pain through study day 30.

          5. Willingness not to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin,
             ibuprofen, naproxen through study day 30.
