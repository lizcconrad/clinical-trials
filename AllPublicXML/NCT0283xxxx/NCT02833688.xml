  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether dexmedetomidine reduce liver injury after hepatectomy. During
      hepatectomy, surgeons always took inflow occlusion to reduce blood loss with Pringle
      maneuver. A few clinical studies had shown dexmedetomidine could reduce ischaemia/reperfusion
      (IR) injury caused by the secretion of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines.
      Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was a sensitive and specific marker for hepatic injury in
      several studies before. So the investigator decided to use it as the primary endpoint.
      Besides, in our center, there are some liver resection surgeries that didn't need occlusion.
      So it can serve the best placebo for determine the the actual effect of dexmedetomidine on
      the IR injury in further subgroup analysis.

      The purpose of our study is to compare liver injury with dexmedetomidine. The enrolled
      patients were randomized into two group. In the study group, dexmedetomidine, diluted in 0.9%
      sodium chloride with the concentration of 4 ug ml-1 is administered with an loading dose of
      0.5ug kg-1 of 10 min, and maintained with infusion rate of 0.5 ug kg-1 h-1. While, 0.9%
      sodium chloride serves as the placebo with the same loading dose and infusion rate in the
      control group. The infusion is ceased after the resection of the hepatic issues.

      GST is a sensitive and specific marker for hepatic injury in several studies before and is
      taken as the primary endpoint. And the investigator use other inflammatory cytokines
      reflecting the systemic inflammatory response in serum. Besides these, the investigator
      observe the hemodynamic changes during the operation time and complications related with
      anesthesia and surgery.
