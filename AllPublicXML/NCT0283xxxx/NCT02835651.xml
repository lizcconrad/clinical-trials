  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid
      (C18:0) have different effects on HDL metabolism during the fasted state.

      Study design:

      Double blind, randomized, cross-over study with two different diets: one diet will be high in
      palmitic acid (C16:0) and the other diet will be high in stearic acid (C18:0). Subjects will
      receive both diets for 4 weeks with a wash-out period of 4-6 weeks in between. Contrast in
      the intakes of palmitic acid and stearic acid is 6% of energy. A postprandial test will be
      carried out at the end of each dietary period.

      Study population:

      Accounting for a dropout rate of 20%, 40 healthy men and postmenopausal women, aged between
      45 and 70 year, having a BMI (body mass index) between ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2 will be
      recruited.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cholesterol efflux capacity after dietary period high in palmitic acid compared to dietary period high in stearic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Cholesterol efflux is measured during fasted state at day 0, day 25 and day 28 of each intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>J774 Macrophages will be used to measure ex vivo cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL particles after a diet enriched with C16:0 or C18:0. Change in ex vivo cholesterol efflux capacity between the diets will be assessed using a linear mixed model with subject as random factor and day 0 as co-variant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fasted lipid metabolism markers between dietary period high in palmitic acid and dietary period high in stearic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Markers for lipid metabolism will be measured during fasted state at day 0, day 14, day 25 and day 28 of each intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Markers include fasting LDL-C [mmol/L], HDL-C [mmol/L], total cholesterol [mmol/L], non-HDL cholesterol [mmol/L] and triacylglycerol [mmol/L] concentrations. Change between diets will be assessed using a linear mixed model with subject as random factor and day 0 as co-variant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fasted lipid ratios between dietary period high in palmitic acid and dietary period high in stearic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Markers for lipid metabolism will be measured during fasted state at day 0, day 14, day 25 and day 28 of each intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Markers include fasting total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio and LDL-C to HDL-C ratio. Change between diets will be assessed using a linear mixed model with subject as random factor and day 0 as co-variant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fasted apolipoproteins between dietary period high in palmitic acid and dietary period high in stearic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Apolipoproteins will be measured during fasted state at day 0, day 14, day 25 and day 28 of each intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Apolipoproteins include fasting ApoA1 [μg/mL] and ApoB100 [μg/mL]. Change between diets will be assessed using a linear mixed model with subject as random factor and day 0 as co-variant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postprandial triacylglycerol levels between dietary period high in palmitic acid and dietary period high in stearic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>Triacylglycerol [mmol/L] is measured during postprandial state at day 28 (0 to 480 minutes after meal intake) of each intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Change between diets will be assessed using a linear mixed model with subject as random factor and day 0 as co-variant.</description>
