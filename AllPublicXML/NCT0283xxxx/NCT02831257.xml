      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug AZD2014 can shrink
      growing or symptomatic meningiomas. Based on laboratory research, the cellular pathways which
      are blocked by AZD2014 are important for the growth and survival of meningiomas. Further
      treatment of meningioma cells in the laboratory setting has resulted in decreased survival of
      tumor cells. As such, the purpose of this research is to see whether treating your meningioma
      with AZD2014 will result in tumor shrinkage. The safety of AZD2014 will also be studied. Your
      physical state, your symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings
      obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if AZD2014 is safe and effective
      in patients with your condition.

      AZD2014 is being studied in patients with various cancers as a single agent (a drug that is
      used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of anticancer therapies.
      Previous studies have also allowed investigators to determine the best dose and frequency of
      AZD2014 to achieve anti-tumor effects while reducing the likelihood of side effects.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD2014 as a treatment for
      any disease.

          -  Participants must have progressive or symptomatic meningioma. NOTE 1: Histologic
             confirmation of meningioma is not required in the setting of compatible radiographic
             appearance, NOTE2: progression is defined as an increase in target meningioma volume ≥
             20% OR ≥ 3 mm during the past 2 years.

             -- Subjects must have a target meningioma that is not amenable to surgery due to
             patient preference or high risk for surgical complications

          -  Participants must be willing and able to undergo regular MRI scans of the brain

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one meningioma ≥ 1.0 ml
             that can be accurately measured by contrast-enhanced cranial MRI scan, performed
             within 28 days of study registration.

          -  Prior surgical resection and radiation therapy for the progressive meningioma are not

             fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening: (1) post-menopausal women,
             defined as either women aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least 12
             months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, or, (2) women under
             50 years old who have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months following the cessation

             barrier method of contraception during the study and for 16 weeks following the last
             dose of study treatment if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. If
             not done previously, storage of sperm prior to receiving AZD2014 will be advised to
             male patients with a desire to have children.

             enzymes CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or the drug transporters Pgp (MDR1), BCRP,

               -  supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, which are
                  uncontrolled

               -  haemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, including transient ischaemic attacks or any
                  other central nervous system bleeding

             msec obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), family or personal history of long or
             short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de
             Pointes within 12 months of the patient entering in the study

          -  Patients with Diabetes Type I or uncontrolled Type II (HbA1c &gt;8% assessed locally) as
             judged by the Investigator or Abnormal fasting glucose value defined as &gt;126 mg/dL (&gt;7
             mmol/L).

          -  Concomitant medications known to prolong QT interval, or with factors that increase
             the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or
             unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age).

             drug.

          -  Judgment by the Investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements. Note: patients who are likely to require surgery or radiation for
             NF2-related tumors during the first year of treatment in the investigator's opinion
             should not be enrolled on this clinical trial.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2014 is an mTORC1/2 inhibiting
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with AZD2014, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with AZD2014.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD2014. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca,
