  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plastic and covered metal stents need to be removed or exchanged within appropriate time in
      case of undesirable complications. However, it is not uncommon that patients does not follow
      the recommendation for further stent management after ERCP. we hopothesized that short
      message service (SMS) intervention monthly could improve the adherence in patients with
      benign pancreaticobiliary after ERCP.

    <description>Each month after stent implantation, the investigator sent a text message by SMS to inform patients the necessity of regular stent removal/exchange and the disadvantage of delayed management, and to remind them the appropriate date to come back to the hospital for stent management. Patients were requested to respond by SMS and were encouraged to contact the investigator if they had any questions about stent management. Besides, patients received conventional reminder:After stent implantation, all patients received oral and written instructions about further management. If single or multiple plastic stents were inserted, patients were informed to come back to the hospital at 3 months for stent removal/exchange; if FCSEMS was inserted, they were informed to come back to the hospital at 6 months after ERCP.</description>
