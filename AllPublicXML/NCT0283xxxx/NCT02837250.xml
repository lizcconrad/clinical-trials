      RECRUITING NOW AT www.pos4health.org

      This project has developed a patient-centered eHealth intervention; specifically, an Internet
      intervention, targeting multiple issues and nonadherence in HIV. The intervention,
      Pos4Health, includes peer role model videos and evidence-based interactions to promote
      understanding, coping with, and managing risk factors for nonadherence to ART, and to improve
      nonadherence itself. In this Pilot Trial, investigators will test the eHealth intervention
      Pos4Health with PLWH who reside outside urban centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving treatment adherence among active substance users requires addressing many health
      barriers beyond substance use alone.(Dr N. Zaller Ph. D, Gillani, &amp; Rich, 2007; Simoni,
      Amico, Pearson, &amp; Malow, 2008; Willenbring, 2005) Behaviors like smoking and drug use, and
      experiences like poverty, poor social support, stigma, fear of HIV disclosure, depression,
      and anxiety, all reduce antiretroviral (ART) adherence and engagement in care, while
      accelerating disease progression.(Atkinson &amp; Petrozzino, 2009; Bouhnik et al., 2002;
      Hendershot, Stoner, Pantalone, &amp; Simoni, 2009; Mugavero et al., 2009; Shuter &amp; Bernstein,
      2008; Simoni, Frick, &amp; Huang, 2006; Tucker, Burnam, Sherbourne, Kung, &amp; Gifford, 2003; Villes
      et al., 2007) Improving multiple health behaviors that are related to nonadherence is a
      promising approach that will be used in the current project. Emerging evidence supports
      simultaneously targeting multiple health behaviors.(Prochaska et al., 2008) Unfortunately,
      few interventions address the range of issues that undermine adherence to HIV care.

      Extending a program of research by the investigative team, this project will develop a
      patient-centered eHealth intervention; specifically, an Internet intervention, targeting
      multiple issues and nonadherence in HIV.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To develop a prototype of a patient-centered eHealth (Internet) intervention targeting
           adherence and a set of behaviors and experiences known to undermine adherence among
           non-urban PLWH.

        2. To evaluate the prototype for usability, feasibility and acceptability among PLWH and
           HIV care clinicians, modify it using PLWH and clinician feedback, and finalize it for
           pilot testing

        3. To pilot test the finalized intervention to determine whether it warrants a subsequent
           randomized clinical trial.

      The pilot test will:

        1. evaluate the feasibility of the eHealth intervention by examining access, usage, refusal
           vs. enrollment, retention vs. dropout, etc. using both web-tracked process data and
           interviews

        2. provide preliminary data on the impact of the eHealth intervention on knowledge and
           usage of strategies of adherence and each targeted experience and behavior that
           undermines ART adherence

        3. test variables likely to be used as primary outcome markers in a subsequent RCT for
           their variance in this population (i.e., adherence by pharmacy refill rate, rate of
           missed HIV care visits, rate of drug-using days, and rate of risky drinking days)

      If the pilot test of the new patient-centered eHealth intervention shows an impact on
      knowledge and use of strategies, and it proves to be feasible and acceptable, it will be
      tested in a subsequent RCT.

    <description>Feasibility will be judged by the rates of study acceptance and completion of the trial. Study Acceptance will be determined by consents obtained divided by patients approached for the study. The trial will be considered feasible if the acceptance rate among eligible patients is equal to or greater than 56%.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is the intervention acceptable? Acceptability will be judged by participant ratings, and by actual program usage data. Participants will rate the Intervention at follow-up. The range of items on this scale is from 1 to 7. An item mean of 3.5 would be mid-range. Basic descriptive information will be gathered from the tracking system about whether participants logged in, how many times, and for how long. Time spent in each Core will be tracked and summarized. Pos4Health will be judged acceptable if if the average score on the evaluation was &gt; 5.6, which is 80% of the highest score (range 1-7), and if 75% of participants completed at least half of the Cores and provide 4 of 7daily diaries of adherence on at least 4 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There is 1 secondary research question: How do adherence and engagement in care measures perform as future primary outcomes? At this stage, investigators will examine the data quality of adherence and engagement in care indicators (Pharmacy Refill Rate, Missed Visit Proportion) to determine which ones are suitable as outcome measures in a future RCT. The purpose is to calculate effect sizes for the planned randomized trial.</description>

    <description>Pos4Health is a 6 Core Internet intervention focusing on improving adherence to ART among nonadherent substance users living with HIV in non urban areas. Pos4Health Cores each present a topic, show videos of HIV+ peers discussing that topic, and how they have coped with it, and use interactions to teach about the topic and to develop knowledge and skills. Each core ends with tips to try that include tips mentioned by peers or from expert material. Content is personalized to the user and users receive tailored feedback. Cores are metered out weekly after each Core is completed.</description>
