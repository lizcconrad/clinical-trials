    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of playing high school football on later in
      life cognitive functioning and mental health. This is an observational study that will use
      data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to compare high school football playing graduates
      in 1957 with comparable non-high school football playing graduates on cognitive functioning
      and mental health measures when participants are in their 60s.

      The investigators will use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of graduates from
      Wisconsin high schools in 1957 to investigate the link between playing high-school football
      and later life depression and cognitive impairment. The WLS has a number of attractive
      features that make it well-suited for such a study. First, it records whether study
      participants participated in high school football and also includes detailed measurements of
      later-life mental health, psychological well-being, and cognition. Second, it includes a rich
      set of baseline covariates which the investigators will use to construct matched sets of
      treated and control individuals, including family background, adolescent characteristics,
      educational and occupational achievement and aspirations. Third, the WLS is one of the few
      longitudinal data sets that includes an administrative measure of childhood cognition. In
      short, the WLS provides a large data set that facilitates comparing the later life mental
      health and cognitive ability of men who played high school football to those who did not,
      after carefully controlling for a range of potential confounders. The investigators will
      compare the primary outcomes of the treated subjects to the primary outcomes of the control
      subjects, after controlling for baseline covariates via full matching with a propensity score
      caliper. The primary outcomes are depression (modified CES-D score) and cognitive functioning
      (average of z-scores for letter fluency and delayed word recall) when participants are age
      65. Secondary outcomes that include cognitive scores on various domains, the Spielberger
      anger index, the Spielberger anxiety index and a hostility index will also be analyzed.

    <description>Average of the standardized scores from two cognitive functioning tests. In the first test, Letter Fluency, which measures executive functioning, subjects were asked to name as many words beginning with &quot;L&quot; or &quot;F&quot; as they could in 60 seconds. In the second, Delayed Word Recall, which measures memory and attention, subjects were told a list of 10 words and asked to recall as many as possible 12minutes later.</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to describe how two objects from a given list of 9 pairs were alike. Their responses were scored on a fixed scale. For instance, if asked to describe how an orange or a banana are alike, the response &quot;both are fruits&quot; received the highest score (2 points), &quot;both may be eaten&quot; received 1 point, and &quot;both are sweet&quot; received 0 points.</description>
