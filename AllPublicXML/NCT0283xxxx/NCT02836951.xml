  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been discovered in laboratory animal
      models. The objective of this study is to find whether similar markers are detectable in the
      body fluids of human subjects that have sustained a TBI.

    <description>This group consists of patients that are hospitalized due to a head injury. Samples of blood, urine and plasma will taken from these subjects and the fluids will be analyzed for novel biomarkers using a biochemical assay. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be drawn in cases when sampling is justified for treatment, not for study purpose solely.</description>

        Study population will include patients that are hospitalized due to a suspected traumatic

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is hospitalized because of a head trauma and suspected TBI.

          -  Age 18 or above. The subject (including the control subjects) must be an independent
             adult who is not under guardianship.

          -  The patient, or the next of kin in the case of an incompetent person, has signed the
             Informed consent. This concerns the control subjects, too.

          -  The samples can be collected during regular office hours.

          -  The patient needs lumbar puncture for treatment reasons. This is not a limiting
             criterion however. If it is difficult to find an adequate number of patients for
             lumbar puncture, CSF samples of some patients can be omitted after the study
             coordinator's consideration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has been found positive for HIV or hepatitis-B in the involved laboratory
             studies.

          -  The subject has a chronic mental disorder which is mentioned on the sickness insurance
             card.
