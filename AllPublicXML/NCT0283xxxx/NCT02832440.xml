  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although exercise training of haemodialysis patients is associated with generally positive
      outcomes few haemodialysis units routinely offer intradialytic exercise therapy. This is
      often related to financial cost and/or staffing limitations. Home-based programs could be an
      alternative means of providing exercise benefits without associated implementation costs The
      aim of this study was to compare the effects of 4 weeks intradialytic versus home based
      exercise for haemodialysis patients regarding adherence and strength gains.

    <description>Assess lower extremity, which includes objective performance-based measure of balance (side-by-side, semi-tandem and tandem), endurance (4m gait speed) and strength (five chair stands). Each component was scored from 0 to 4 and when summed yielded Short Physical Performance Battery scores between 0 (poor) and 12 (best).</description>
