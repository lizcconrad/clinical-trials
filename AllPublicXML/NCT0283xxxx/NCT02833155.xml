      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of entinostat administered
      orally as a single agent in a weekly dosing schedule. Additionally, this study will
      characterize the pharmacokinetics parameters in Chinese postmenopausal women with advanced
      breast cancer. And to define the profile of adverse events, including laboratory parameters
      in these subjects
