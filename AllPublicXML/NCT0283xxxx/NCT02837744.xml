    <description>Axiostat® is a sterile, non-absorbable haemostatic dressing intended to control profuse bleeding within minutes of application by providing an active mechanical barrier to the wound site.
Axiostat® stops moderate to severe bleeding due to cuts, abrasions, lacerations, venous/arterial punctures and more. Mechanism of action is such that Axiostat® is an extremely positive dressing that becomes very sticky in the presence of negatively charged blood and thus seals the wound area.</description>
