  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence exists to support cancer rehabilitation, services are fragmented and
      rehabilitation professionals are consulted infrequently and often long after treatment ends,
      when chronicity of problems limits the impact of intervention. Therefore, the objective of
      this project is to develop, implement, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the Rehabilitation
      Consult (RC). The RC program goals are to increase knowledge about rehabilitation needs and
      resources to meet those needs; to establish individualized rehabilitation goals for HNC
      survivors and personalized action plans to meet those goals; and to provide support to HNC
      survivors for the implementation and evaluation of action plans. This project consisted of
      intervention development and pilot evaluation; this trial registration describes the pilot
      evaluation phase only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A RC for survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) was developed in collaboration with an
      Advisory Panel that includes survivors, family members, health care professionals, and health
      system representatives. This phase of the study aims to conduct a pilot evaluation of the RC
      using a mixed method, single group study with a convenience sample of approximately 35
      survivors of HNC post primary cancer treatment, recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer
      Center HNC clinics. In addition to the RC intervention, participants will be required to
      attend 3 research assessments (pre intervention, post intervention, and 1 month follow-up)
      that are a combination of face-to-face visits and telephone calls.

      Quantitative data analysis will be exploratory and descriptive, and effect sizes will be
      calculated for all outcomes to help plan for a future, controlled trial. Means, standard
      deviations, and Cohen's d effect size will be calculated for normally distributed data. For
      non-normally distributed data, medians, ranges, and a nonparametric effect size r will be
      calculated. For qualitative analysis, all interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed
      verbatim, and analyzed using a two-phased, hybrid approach that is both deductive and
      inductive. Findings will be summarized and reported to the Advisory Panel, who will then make
      recommendations regarding any additional modifications to the RC. The research team will make
      final decisions about RC modifications and will finalize a version for future evaluation.

    <description>The RC was designed to foster key contributors to self management in the participants. The RC is administered by a rehabilitation professional and consists of an initial one-hour face-to-face consult and follow-up appointment(s) 2-12 weeks later, either telephone or face-to-face. The initial consult consists of orientation, consultation, goal-setting, teaching cognitive strategies, introduction to online resources/action planning/planning coping responses, review/implementation intentions/scheduling follow-up. The follow-up consists of a reminder, reorientation, checking of progress on goals and plans, re-planning as necessary, and discharge or scheduling of further follow-up as necessary.</description>
