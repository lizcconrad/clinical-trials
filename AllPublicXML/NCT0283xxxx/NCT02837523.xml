    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of an
      amino acid called cystine in different tissues and organs of the body including the kidneys,
      eyes, muscles, liver, pancreas and brain. Generally, cystinosis is broken down into three
      different forms known as nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis and
      non-nephropathic (or ocular) cystinosis. Nephropathic cystinosis presents in infancy and is
      the most common and severe form. Early detection and prompt treatment are criticalin slowing
      the development and progression of symptoms associated with cystinosis. The kidneys and eyes
      are the two organs most often affected. Individuals with nephro-pathic or intermediate
      cystinosis ultimately require a kidney transplant. Non-nephropathic cystinosis only affects
      the corneas of the eyes. Cystinosis is caused by mutations of the CTNS gene and is inherited
      as an autosomal recessive disease.

      The specific symptoms and severity of cystinosis vary greatly from one person to another
      based upon several factors including age of onset and whether the disorder is promptly
      diagnosed and treated. The progression of the disorder can be slowed by early diagnosis and
      treatment. Eventually, cystinosis can affect all tissues of the body. The age of onset for
      different symptoms varies greatly.

      NEPHROPATHIC CYSTINOSIS (renal Fanconi disease)

      Nephropathic cystinosis is the most frequent and most severe form of cystinosis. The symptoms
      of nephropathic cystinosis usually become apparent within the second half of the first year
      of life. Specific symptoms can be mild or severe based upon each individual case and the age
      when treatment is started.Growth failure and renal Fanconi disease are usually the first
      noticeable complications of the disorder. Although infants appear normal at birth, by the age
      of one they often fall into the third percentile for height and weight. In addition, affected
      infants may have episodes of vomiting, poor appetite, and feeding difficulties that
      contribute (along with kidney dysfunction) to nutritional deficiency and the failure to gain
      weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Ultimately, growth in untreated
      children with cystinosis occurs at 60 percent the expected rate.

      Infants with nephropathic cystinosis develop renal Fanconi disease, a rare disorder
      characterized by kidney dysfunction. The kidney tubules fail to reabsorb a variety of needed
      substances, including the compounds mentioned above as well as amino acids, phosphate,
      calcium, glucose, carnitine, certain proteins and electrolytes. Consequently, affected
      individuals have abnormally low levels of many of these substances in the body.

      Symptoms of renal Fanconi disease usually become apparent between 6 and 12 months of age and
      may include excessive thirst (polydipsia), excessive production and passage of urine
      (polyuria), electrolyte imbalances, vomiting, and dehydration with or without fever.
      Dehydration can be severe in some cases. Children with nephropathic cystinosis may also
      develop symptoms unrelated to the kidneys (extrarenal symptoms). Again, these findings are
      highly variable and affected children will not develop all of the symptoms discussed below.
      Specific extrarenal symptoms will vary greatly depending upon the age that treatment is begun
      and the specific organs that become involved; those organs can include the eyes, bone marrow,
      liver, pancreas, spleen, intestine, brain, thyroid, muscles and testes.

      At any age, children may develop an abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia) and
      irritation due to the formation of cystine crystals in the cornea. The severity of
      photophobia can vary.Affected children may also develop deficiency of thyroid hormone
      production (hypothyroidism) due to cystine crystals accumulating in the thyroid. The thyroid
      is a butterfly shaped gland located at the base of the neck. The thyroid secretes hormones
      into the bloodstream that influence certain activities of the body such as growth, maturation
      and the rate of metabolism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are highly variable, but may include
      fatigue, feeling cold, dry skin, constipation and depression. Children with nephropathic
      cystinosis do not produce tears, sweat or salivate normally. Tear production may be
      diminished causing the eyes to dry out. An impaired ability to sweat can potentially cause
      total exhaustion or collapse due to heat (heat prostration). The increased longevity of
      individuals with nephropathic cystinosis has revealed that additional complications affecting
      organs other than the kidneys can occur later during life. These complications develop due to
      the chronic accumulation of cystine crystals in individuals who have not been adequately
      treated by cysteamine, although they have undergone a kidney transplant. These additional
      complications generally develop between 20 and 40 years of age. Accumulation of cystine in
      muscle tissue can cause muscle disease (myopathy) leading to progressive weakness and wasting
      of affected muscles. Impairment of muscles in the throat can lead to swallowing and feeding
      difficulties. Involvement of chest muscles can result in pulmonary insufficiency.A wide
      variety of gastrointestinal symptoms can develop including enlargement of the liver
      (hepatomegaly) causing high blood pressure of the main vein of the liver (portal
      hypertension), enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly), gastroesophageal reflux, ulcers,
      inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis), and dysfunction of the muscles of the
      gastrointestinal tract (dysmotility). Additional symptoms include inflammatory bowel disease,
      tearing of the bowel causing the contents of the intestines to flow into the abdominal cavity
      (bowel perforation), and inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis), which is the membrane
      that lines the abdominal wall and organs.

      Additional findings include metabolic bone disease and an inability to properly digest food
      due to a lack of digestive enzymes normally produced by the pancreas (pancreatic exocrine
      insufficiency). Adults with cystinosis may also develop abnormalities affecting the eyes
      including spasms of the eyelids (blepharospasm), band keratopathy and pigmentary retinopathy.
      Band keratopathy refers to the accumulation of calcium deposits in a band across the central
      surface of the cornea, which can cause pain and decreased clarity of vision (visual acuity).
      Pigmentary retinopathy is characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, the thin
      layer of nerve cells that line the inner surface of the back of the eyes. The retina senses
      light and converts it to nerve signals, which are then relayed to the brain through the optic
      nerve. Pigmentary retinopathy can impair night and color vision and, eventually, can
      contribute to overall reduced clarity of vision.

      Individuals with nephropathic cystinosis appear to have a higher rate of diabetes than the
      general population because of destruction of the pancreas by cystine accumulation.

      INTERMEDIATE CYSTINOSIS

      Also known as nephropathic juvenile cystinosis or adolescent cystinosis, this form of
      cystinosis is characterized by all of the signs and symptoms of nephropathic cystinosis
      described above. However, onset of these symptoms does not occur until later perhaps around 8
      years of age. Generally, the symptoms are less severe than in the classical infantile
      nephropathic form and have a slower progression. If untreated, endstage renal failure in
      intermediate cystinosis usually develops at some point between 15 and 25 years of age. There
      is a spectrum of disease severity in cystinosis, with overlap of the infantile and
      intermediate forms.

      NON-NEPHROPATHIC CYSTINOSIS

      Also known as ocular or &quot;benign&quot; cystinosis, this form usually affects adult's during middle
      age; it was once called adult cystinosis. Kidney disease does not occur in these individuals.
      The disorder appears to only affect the eyes. Untreated individuals with non-nephropathic
      cystinosis eventually develop photophobia due to cystine crystal accumulation in the eyes.New
      methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of
      the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from the plasma of the affected
      patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier
      treatment.
