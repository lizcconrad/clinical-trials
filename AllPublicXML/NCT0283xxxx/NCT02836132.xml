  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer grant is to complete development
      of a virtual reality intervention to augment and improve commercial Internet-delivered
      behavioral weight loss treatments, and to test it in a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are major health problems, affecting over two-thirds of US adults.
      Commercially available Internet-based weight loss programs are currently used by millions of
      overweight/obese individuals in the U.S, but weight losses are often poor, likely because
      these products on the whole do not incorporate empirically validated behavioral weight loss
      strategies that have been researched for over 40 years. Similarly, the weight losses obtained
      via research-based online weight loss programs are about half the size of those obtained via
      in-person treatment, likely because of the lack of (1) &quot;hands-on&quot; training in behavioral
      weight control strategies, and (2) support and guidance from group leaders and peers, both of
      which are hallmarks of traditional in-person treatment. The goal of this application is to
      improve commercial Internet -delivered behavioral obesity treatments by developing a virtual
      reality (VR) system that can be integrated into existing Internet weight control programs,
      such as Weight Watchers Online. The VR system will allow users to experience learning,
      implementing, and mastering behavioral weight control strategies in controlled virtual
      settings. The VR system will: (a) increase awareness of barriers to weight control behaviors,
      (b) teach skills to cope with these barriers, (c) build confidence using these skills, and
      (d) increase commitment to using these skills in real-world situations. The design of the VR
      System is based on Social Cognitive Theory, which states that health behaviors are learned by
      observing and imitating peers and role models, and by receiving social reinforcement. A
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with N = 125 participants to test the
      efficacy of 4 scenarios for improving weight losses obtained in a popular paid commercial
      weight loss program (Weight Watchers Online) over 6 months.
