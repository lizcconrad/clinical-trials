  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine an efficacy of the combination of L. rhamnosus
      19070-2 (FloraActiveTM) and L. reuteri DSM 122460 (FloraActiveTM) in decreasing cry/fuss in
      infants aged 4 through 12 weeks with IC. The active group of infants will receive
      lactobacilli with vitamin D3 while the control group will receive vitamin D3 2 times daily as
      oil suspension for 28 days. Duration of infant fuss/cry will be measured at baseline and at
      the end of intervention to define a difference between the groups

      There is accumulating interest in role of lactobacilli in decreasing cry and fuss in infant
      colic, the condition that affects around 1 of 4-5 infants. The interest for dietary
      supplementation has been evoked by a line of earlier studies, indicating that infants with
      colic had an increased number of gas-forming E.coli in the intestines and potential
      interference between lactobacilli and E.coli. Systematic review of evidence, based on the 6
      randomized controlled dietary studies, conducted in Italy, Poland, Australia, Canada, and
      Finland, has concluded of the decrease of the mean time cry of infant by -55 minutes a day
      after the 3 weeks dietary course with lactobacilli . In the mentioned studies most commonly
      used lactobacilli were L. reuteri, however, the effect of combination of L. reuteri with
      other lactobacilli remains unknown.
