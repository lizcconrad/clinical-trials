  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial fibrosis is recognized as the pathologic entity of extracellular matrix
      remodeling. Diffuse, reactive fibrosis is increasingly recognized in a variety of conditions
      despite the absence of ischemia. Regardless of the etiology, fibrosis leads to increased
      myocardial stiffness thereby promoting cardiac dysfunction. This dysfunction may present
      clinically with symptoms of cardiac failure although this is often a subclinical disease.
      Various imaging modalities and collagen biomarkers have been used as surrogate markers to
      assess the presence, extent, and turnover of myocardial fibrosis. Techniques using
      echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear imaging have been developed to
      detect early features of systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction and impaired
      contractile reserve. Further identification of diffuse reactive fibrosis may be possible with
      evolving cardiac magnetic resonance and molecular techniques. The goal of this protocol is to
      validate cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as a new tool for fibrosis quantification against
      histology as standard of reference.
