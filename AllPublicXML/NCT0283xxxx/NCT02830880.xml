  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if using
      anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC or fluciclovine) PET scan will
      be useful in determining if participants are responding to chemotherapy treatment.

      Investigators will enroll participants whose cancer has been treated with hormone therapy and
      now the cancer is not responding to the treatment (Castration -resistant), and so therefore
      will be started on chemotherapy. Investigators will enroll thirty (30) participants in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the investigation is to examine therapeutic monitoring of chemotherapy in
      castrate resistant prostate carcinoma with anti-3-[18F]FACBC in prostate carcinoma to
      determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC amino acid imaging can serve as an accurate and efficient
      imaging biomarker.

      Investigators will perform a baseline anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT of the whole body. All
      participants will also undergo conventional staging including 99mTc MDP bone scanning and cat
      scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR) of the abdomen and pelvis which are standard of
      care at the enrolling institution. This study will not interfere with standard patient
      evaluation or delay therapy.

      All 30 participants will receive chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Participants will
      undergo a repeat anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT after 1 and 6 cycles and also repeat conventional
      imaging including bone scanning CT or MR of the abdomen and pelvis after 6 cycles. At the end
      of the study, the study team will then record the response (or lack thereof) on
      anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT and correlate that response with response per standard clinical
      criteria including bone scan uptake for skeletal lesions, CT or MR for soft tissue and
      skeletal lesions, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression or regression, and other
      clinical parameters such as declining performance status.

    <description>An MRI will be used to assess response to treatment. Treatment response will be reported as follows:
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Complete Response Unknown (CRU)
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Stable Disease (NR/SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>
