    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study was to look at the effect of changing walking parameters on the
      dynamic walking characteristics among children post severe traumatic brain injury, children
      with cerebral palsy and typically developed controls.

      leisure time physical activity by the Godin and Shephard (G&amp;S) questionnaire. Balance tests -
      the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and functional reach test (FRT). Maximal isometric strength
      was assessed by using a hand held dynamometer; walking dynamics were recorded by an
      electronic mat, and the 6 minute walk test, energy expenditure index (EEI) and perceived
      exertion by the OMNI scale.
