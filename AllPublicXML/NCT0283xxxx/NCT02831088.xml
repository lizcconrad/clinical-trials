  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy and safety of Neu2000, a multi-target drug designed to prevent both NMDA
      receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and free radical toxicity, will be investigated in acute
      ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular treatment to remove clot within 8 hours
      following stroke onset. Neu2000KWL will be administered before endovascular treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neu2000 was designed as a multi-target neuroprotectant preventing both the NMDA receptor, a
      Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptor, and free radicals, two major routes of brain cell death in
      stroke. Neu2000 is a moderate NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonist and spin trapping
      molecule (=free radical scavenger or antioxidant). Therapeutic potential of Neu2000 has been
      well demonstrated in four animal models of stroke with better efficacy and therapeutic time
      windows than either NMDA receptor antagonist or anti-oxidant advanced to clinical trials. In
      human phase I studies of 165 healthy subjects conducted in the United States and China,
      Neu2000KWL showed promising safety profiles without any serious adverse events up to a single
      intravenous infusion of 6000 mg that is far beyond the therapeutic target dose determined in
      animal models of transient ischemic stroke. Very recently, acute endovascular recanalization
      therapy has been introduced as the new standard care of care in acute ischemic stroke. The
      present study is aimed to examine efficacy and safety of Neu2000KWL in acute ischemic stroke
      patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy within 8 hours of stroke onset.
