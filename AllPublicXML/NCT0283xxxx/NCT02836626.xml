  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1.37 million Caesarian sections (C-sections) are performed annually in the US . It is
      estimated that 12-20 % of those will result in chronic scar pain. This pain can lead to
      functional difficulties performing activities of daily living, pain with bowel movements, and
      pain with sexual activity . There is anecdotal evidence supporting the use of deep fascial
      scar mobilization techniques in reducing abdominal surgical scar pain, and yet almost no
      research has been published. The aims of this randomized clinical trial will be to determine
      if deep fascial scar mobilization techniques or superficial scar mobilization techniques will
      improve chronic pain and its resulting functional deficits, threshold pressure discomfort,
      pressure tolerance and mobility restrictions resulting from C-section surgery and to see if
      these interventions are more effective than no intervention. A positive result may result in
      an increase in the use of this intervention and thus the reduction of chronic scar pain for
      many women; it may provide justification for insurance reimbursement for this approach and it
      will also pave the way for further investigation into the use of these techniques with other
      types of painful scars including hysterectomy.

      Methods: Thirty six subjects will be recruited who have a history of C-section surgery more
      than three months before entering the study and who report chronic pain in or around the scar
      stemming from the surgery. Subjects will initially be tested twice four weeks apart, before
      beginning intervention. This will allow the establishment of a baseline and the subjects will
      all be part of a baseline control group. They will then be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups. Group 1 will undergo four, 25 minute sessions of light massage to the trunk
      followed by superficial skin rolling of the C-section scar. Group 2 will undergo four,
      25-minute treatment sessions consisting of multi-planar pelvic and abdominal myofascial
      mobilization techniques and direct scar mobilization techniques..

      Outcomes: Outcome measures will include threshold pressure discomfort and pressure tolerance
      using a Pressure Algometer, Adheremeter measurements of scar mobility, the numeric pain
      rating scale (NPRS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Hip extension and shoulder flexion
      measured via goniometery, and the Global rating of Change scale. Follow up measures will be
      collected four weeks following the start of interventions and again at 12 weeks. In addition
      qualitative data will be collected from the subjects. The treating therapist will be blinded
      to the results of the outcome measures.

    <description>Pelvic and abdominal myofascial release techniques as described by Barnes will be performed to facilitate independent mobility between tissue layers as needed following the direction of palpated fascial tension. Following this, direct scar mobilization techniques as described by Manheim will be done, applying a stretch in the direction of palpated restriction . This involves applying deep pressure whose force and direction is dictated by the tightness the therapist palpates and the subject reports. These are each held until a release is felt (defined as a sudden relaxation of tissue tension), usually 60-120 seconds. Total treatment time will last 25 minutes. Treatments will include all the above techniques but the therapist will tailor each treatment to address palpated restrictions. Subjects will be instructed to carry on their normal routines between sessions and will not be given any home interventions. Treatment sessions will total four to occur within a three week time period.</description>

    <description>This group will undergo four 25-minute sessions of gentle superficial effleurage to the abdomen and posterior trunk followed by superficial skin rolling to the scar. Each treatment session will be terminated a) after 25 minutes or 2) when the patient asks to stop due to discomfort. Reasons for termination will be documented. Subjects will be instructed to carry on their normal routines between sessions and will not be given any home interventions. Treatment sessions will total four to occur within a three week time period.</description>
