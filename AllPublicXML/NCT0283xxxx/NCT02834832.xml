      This study evaluates the effect of coatings on bacterial adhesion on denture acrylic and the
      wear of denture teeth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Denture stomatitis is a prevalent disease among removable denture wearers. The cause of this
      disease stems from a myriad of factors including host immunity and poor oral hygiene. Denture
      acrylic material is very conducive for the growth and adhesion of bacteria because of its
      porous nature. The application of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) coatings
      on the surface of acrylic dentures can produce a less porous surface which may minimize the
      adhesion of bacteria and therefore colonization. The goal is the application of these
      coatings will help minimize the occurrence of denture stomatitis.

      Another issue of removable dentures is the low wear resistance of denture teeth. The
      application of these coatings on denture teeth should minimize wear of these teeth and
      prolong the life of removable dentures.
