  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer experience fatigue although
      doctors do not fully understand why. The purpose of this study is to test if patients who
      experience fatigue during radiation treatment for breast cancer have changes in their
      capability to perform exercise on a treadmill.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the 13-item FACIT-fatigue scale for the assessment of fatigue in cancer patients.24 The FACIT-Fatigue is a validated questionnaire that was originally developed for the precise evaluation of fatigue levels in cancer patients with anemia. It consists of 13 questions using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much). It has been used frequently in the clinical trial setting (please see appendix 1). Responses to each question are added with equal weight to obtain a total score. The range of possible scores is 0-52, with 0 corresponding to the highest level of fatigue and 52 corresponding to the lowest level of fatigue.</description>

        Patients who are undergoing or have recently completed radiotherapy for breast cancer (in
        the last 3 months) will be assessed in outpatient clinics of the Radiation Oncology
        Department of MSKCC. The protocol is available for consenting only at OneMSK Sites Basking
        Ridge, Rockville Center, Commack, Monmouth and Westchester.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  Medical clearance from attending radiation oncologist or medical oncologist to undergo
             a symptom-limited CPET

          -  Currently undergoing intact breast radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer
             (including TisN0, T1N0, T2N0) or has completed intact breast RT in the last 3 months.

          -  Receiving or received a prescribed dose of 4240 cGy in 16 fractions to the whole
             breast without treatment directed at nodal basins. Patients may also be receiving or
             have received a boost to the lumpectomy bed at the discretion of the treating
             physician.

          -  Subjects may be treated in the supine or prone position at the discretion of the
             treating physician.

          -  Subjects may be treated with or without a deep inspiratory breath hold technique at
             the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Identified by the treating radiation oncologist as having significant
             treatment-related fatigue or minimal treatment-related fatigue and not simply baseline
             fatigue. A score of &quot;0&quot; on the RTOG fatigue scale will be considered minimal fatigue,
             while a score of &quot;2&quot; or greater will be considered significant fatigue (moderate
             fatigue causing difficulty performing some ADLs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently undergoing post-mastectomy radiation

          -  Has received chemotherapy previously or has a plan to receive chemotherapy during the
             timeframe of study assessment.

          -  Any of the following absolute contraindications to CPET, as per American Thoracic
             Society (ATS) recommendations

               -  Acute myocardial infarction (within 3-5 days of any planned study procedures)

               -  Unstable angina

               -  Uncontrolled arrhythmia causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise

               -  Recurrent syncope

               -  Active endocarditis

               -  Acute myocarditis or pericarditis

               -  Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis

               -  Uncontrolled heart failure

               -  Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction within 3 months of any planned
                  study procedures

               -  Thrombosis of lower extremities

               -  Suspected dissecting aneurysm

               -  Uncontrolled asthma

               -  Pulmonary edema

               -  Room air desaturation at rest â‰¤ 85%

               -  Respiratory failure

               -  Acute non-cardiopulmonary disorders that may affect exercise performance or be
                  aggravated by exercise (i.e. infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis)

               -  Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate
