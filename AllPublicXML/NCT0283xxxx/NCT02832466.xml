  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing haemodialysis present a decrease in physical function, but little is
      known about the rate at which function decreases.

      The purpose of this study is quantifying the nature and degree of functional deterioration
      experienced by stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients during a six month period of
      maintenance haemodialysis therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Short Physical Performance Battery at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess lower extremity, which includes objective performance-based measure of balance (side-by-side, semi-tanden and tandem), endurance (4m gait speed) and strength (five chair stands). Each component was scored from 0 to 4 and when summed yielded Short Physical Performance Battery scores between 0 (poor) and 12 (best).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline One Leg Standing Test at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Consist in maintain one leg stance for as long as possible. The test was considered normal if the one leg standing time reached 45 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Sit to Stand to Sit 10 and 60 at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the Sit To Stand 10 participant has to stand up and sit down 10 times and the time needed is record; while for the Sit to stand to sit 60 the participant consist in measures how many repetition the participant can to stand up and sit down during 60 seconds</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline On leg heel rise at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the strength in the triceps surae in the one leg standing position and has to rise the heel. It measures how many repetitions the participants is can do</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Handgrip strength at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the amount of strength developed by each hand in kg</description>
