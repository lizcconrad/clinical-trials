  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogenic acellular dermal matrix has been used in burn injuries or abdominal walls
      reconstructions. However, it is solely used in breast reconstructions after breast carcinoma
      amputation. The efficacy of such allogenic dermal matrix can be advantageous when compared to
      current treatment options, however, this has to be proved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study, where patients undergoing breast reconstruction surgery using
      acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with expander use in first phase of reconstruction will be
      included. The permanent breast implants will be implanted approximately half year during
      second surgery. Acellular dermal matrix is a soft tissue graft that is formed by
      decellularization, however with intact extracellular dermal matrix. Such structure is able to
      re-create adequate skeleton for host cells with subsequent incorporation and
      revascularization. The safety and appropriateness of such ADM in breast reconstruction
      surgery will be analyzed.
