      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ABSORB bioresorbable vascular scaffold is
      non-inferior to XIENCE everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium stent with respect to target-lesion
      failure (TLF) at 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 and more

          -  Diffuse long native coronary artery stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) with lesion
             length of more than 40 mm requiring at least 2 overlapped stents with a
             reference-vessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.75 mm on visual assessment

          -  Patients with silent ischemia, stable or unstable angina pectoris, and acute
             myocardial infarction including NSTEMI or STEMI

          -  The patient or guardian agrees to the study protocol and the schedule of clinical
             follow-up, and provides informed, written consent, as approved by the appropriate
             Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee of the respective clinical site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to device material and its
             ingredients (everolimus, poly(L-lactide), poly(DL-lactide), lactide, lactic acid) and
             cobalt, chromium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, acrylic, and fluoro polymers that cannot
             be adequately premedicated

          -  Subject has known allergic reaction, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to aspirin;
             to clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor; or to heparin and therefore cannot be
             adequately treated with study medication

          -  An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of
             antiplatelet drugs within 12 m after the procedure

          -  STEMI requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Left main

          -  Extreme angulation (≥90°) or excessive tortuosity (≥two 45° angles) proximal to or
             within the target lesion

          -  Heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion

          -  Compromised left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF &lt;30%)

          -  At the time of screening, the subject has a malignancy that is not in remission

          -  Terminal illness with life expectancy &lt;1 year

          -  Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational
             study, which have not completed the primary endpoint follow-up period

          -  Patient's pregnant or breast-feeding or child-bearing potential
