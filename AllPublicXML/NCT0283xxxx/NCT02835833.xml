  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, plays an important role in the disease
      development and tumor growth in many solid organ malignancies. Bevacizumab was the first
      anti-angiogenic drug to be approved in solid tumors and has shown advantageous activity with
      multiple tumor types. However, the responses from Bevacizumab are often transient due to the
      tumor's manipulative abilities to circumvent the usual pathways to find salvage pathways
      instead.

      Nintedanib has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,
      colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell cancer. The combination of Bevacizumab and
      Nintedanib are being proposed to target the tumor's manipulation processes to generate
      alternate pathways for angiogenesis thus creating a potential benefit to delay tumor growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation study of Nintedanib combined with
      standard-dose Bevacizumab for advanced solid tumors in which Bevacizumab has an indication.
      The primary endpoints will be safety and tolerability of the drug combination and a
      determination of recommended Phase II dose for Nintedanib in combination with standard dose
      Bevacizumab.

      The first three patients will be treated with Nintedanib daily plus Bevacizumab on day one of
      each three week cycle. If there are no dose limiting toxicities, then three additional
      patients will be treated with the same drugs with Nintedanib at a slightly higher level.
      Finally, a third cohort of three patients will be dosed at an even higher level. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose of Nintedanib is reached, then an additional six patients will be
      treated at that dose in combination with Bevacizumab until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities.
