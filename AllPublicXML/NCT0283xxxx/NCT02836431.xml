  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the absorption of the sedative dexmedetomidine (DEX) in the
      blood when given by nasal spray. The study will help us determine the best dosing amount for
      children undergoing sedation or anesthesia with DEX.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective study of plasma concentrations after intranasal (1 µg/kg and
      2µg/kg) and intravenous (1 µg /kg) DEX to determine the early pharmacokinetics (maximum
      concentration (peak) and time to peak) and bioavailability of a single intranasal dose in
      pediatric patients.

      Dexmedetomidine sedation is commonly utilized at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center (CCHMC)
      and other pediatric institutions. This compound is delivered intravenously or intranasally
      for sedation in children with and without congenital heart disease. Intranasal DEX, though
      very effective for sedation, has significant variability in its onset and peak effect.
      Patient care will be significantly improved if factors that determine this variability in
      onset and peak effect can be determined. Investigators will determine the important early
      clinical variables of peak plasma DEX concentration (Tmax and Cmax) and the 0 - 2 hour
      bioavailability of intranasal DEX in children.

    <measure>Bioavailability of intranasal DEX relative to intravenous DEX for distribution - plasma concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be drawn until immediately prior to Cardiopulmonary bypass, an expected average of 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Data will also be analyzed using population modeling using nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). Investigators are limited in sampling duration to the onset time for cardiopulmonary bypass in this patient population (approximately two hours), investigators will be measuring distribution for approximately one half-life of DEX. This will allow us to estimate the important clinical parameter of relative 0-2h bioavailability of intranasal vs intravenous DEX.</description>
