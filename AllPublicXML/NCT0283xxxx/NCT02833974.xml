  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated pharmacology, with
      intranasal (i.n.) GSK2245035 20 nanogram (ng) administered weekly for a period of 8 weeks,
      will lead to reduced allergic reactivity in the lower airways in subjects with mild allergic
      asthma.

      This will be a randomised, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      8-week treatment study.

      The study will consist of a screening period of up to approximately 4 weeks (involving two
      screening visits), a blinded treatment period of 8 weeks, followed by a follow-up period of
      up to 3 months. The total duration of the study for each subject will therefore be a maximum
      of approximately 6 months.

          -  EAR with &gt;=20 % FEV1 decrease between 5 and 30 minutes after the final allergen
             concentration is obtained at the screening bronchial allergen challenge (BAC)
             (decreases relative to the saline)

          -  LAR with three FEV1 decreases of &gt;= 15 % between 4 and 10 hours after the final
             allergen concentration is obtained at the screening bronchial allergen challenge, with
             two FEV1 decreases being at consecutive time points (decreases relative to the saline)

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers (defined as no use of any tobacco products in the
             6-month period preceding the screening visit) and have a pack history of &lt; 10 pack

             first dose of study medication until the final follow-up visit: Vasectomy with
             documentation of azoospermia, male condom plus partner use of one of the following
             contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or

             used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product
             label. For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines
             what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition
             provided by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements
             for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The investigator is
             responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of
             contraception

             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment
