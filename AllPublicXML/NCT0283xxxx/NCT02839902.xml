    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of 8-week treatment with omega-3-acid
      ethyl esters on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients
      receiving a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor by use of HPLC in comparison with the control group
      of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters.

      This study was designed to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and
      lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor in comparison with the control
      group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters in an unblinded manner by use of
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using highly-sensitive gel filtration columns,
      which is a technique for analyzing lipoprotein.

      Study participants who gave consent and were assessed as eligible in the eligibility
      assessment will be stratified by the factors of &quot;fasting triacylglycerol (TG; &lt;300 mg/dL or
      300 mg/dL≤) and age (&lt;65 years or 65 years≤) at the start of the screening period&quot; and
      allocated to either the group treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters or the group not treated
      with omega-3-acid ethyl esters (1:1 ratio).
