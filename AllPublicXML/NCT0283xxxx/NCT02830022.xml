  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which involves social and
      behavioural impairments. Autonomic dysfunctions and disturbed sleep were often associated to
      ASD. The investigators proposed to explore the impact of physical activity on these
      disorders. In this context, it is necessary to characterize the cardiorespiratory capacities
      of ASD children in order to promote physical activity for this population. To examine
      potential differences between ASD and control children, some explorations were proposed: a
      maximal treadmill test, motor evaluation, and orthostatic test (for the evaluation of
      autonomic nervous system).

      An actimetry during one week (evaluation of physical activity and sleep) completed this study
      in order to specify sleep characteristic and established the possible link between physical
      activity sleep characteristics and physical fitness in ASD children.
