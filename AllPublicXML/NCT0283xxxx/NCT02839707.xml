    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride with atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab work in treating patients with ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. block tumor growth Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab
      and bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not
      yet known which combination will work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the probability of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) following cycle 1 of
      experimental regimens (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride [pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin] [PLD] and atezolizumab and PLD/bevacizumab and atezolizumab). (Safety lead-in)
      II. Estimate and compare the hazard of first progression or death (progression free survival
      [PFS]) of each experimental regimen relative to the reference regimen, PLD and bevacizumab.
      (Phase II study) III. Estimate and compare the hazard of death and the hazard of first
      progression or death (PFS) of each experimental regimen relative to the reference regimen.
      (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate and compare the probabilities of response rate (objective response rate [ORR],
      either partial or complete response) defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria on each study regimen. (Phase II study) II. Estimate the
      frequency and severity of adverse events as classified and graded with Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) in those patients who initiate their randomly assigned
      study treatment. (Phase II study) III. Estimate and compare ORR in each treatment group.
      (Phase III study) IV. Estimate the frequency and severity of adverse events in those patients
      who initiate their randomly assigned study treatment. (Phase III study) V. Estimate and
      compare mean patient reported outcome scores (PROs) as measured by National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN)-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) ovarian symptom index
      (NFOSI)-18 disease-related symptoms (DRS). (Phase III study) VI. Estimate and compare the
      treatment groups on the basis of the PROs: treatment side effects (TSE), function/well-being
      (FWB), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-fatigue [F]
      subscale) and abdominal discomfort (FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG]-abdominal
      discomfort [AD] subscale). (Phase III study)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether biomarker levels in pre-treatment tissue, and pre- or on-treatment
      peripheral blood, and stool specimens are associated with ORR, PFS and/or overall survival
      (OS).

      II. To determine whether changes in quantitative biomarker parameters after the first 6 and
      12 weeks of therapy predict ORR, PFS and/or OS.

      OUTLINE: Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on day 1 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      ARM II: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, and atezolizumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 15.

      ARM III: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
