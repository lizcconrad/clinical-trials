      Study synopsis Objectives

        -  To determine whether delivering a semi-structured play therapy intervention can improve
           procedure-related anxiety / ability to cope with a procedure / procedure-related pain
           for children and young people.

        -  To determine whether delivering a semi-structured play therapy intervention can improve
           patient experience of blood monitoring.

      Patients

        -  Patients aged 5 - 17 years who are under the care of the rheumatology team.

        -  Patients expected to require at least two blood tests during a 12 week period. Design

        -  Recruitment over 24 weeks with each child in the study for a 12 week period.

        -  20 patients will receive play therapy intervention as outlined in the play therapy
           intervention for blood tests.

        -  20 patients will be the comparator group. They will be offered standard care for blood
           tests.

        -  All children will be offered local anaesthetic cream for each blood test. Blood tests
           will be performed by venepuncture unless specifically requested otherwise by patient.

        -  All children will complete outcome measures at baseline, beginning and end of each
           procedure session and at completion of the study at 16 weeks.

      Outcome Measures

        -  Procedure-related anxiety visual analogue scale (VAS) score - completed by child

        -  Observer procedure-related anxiety VAS score - completed by parent

        -  Procedure-related coping VAS score - completed by child

        -  Procedure-related pain VAS score - completed by child

        -  Patient experience VAS score - completed by child and parent separately

      Children and young people experience significant pain and distress related to procedures.
      There are many studies looking at psychological and pharmacological interventions
      demonstrating that these can reduce procedural-related pain and distress. Distraction is
      frequently studied and consistently demonstrated to reduce procedure-related pain and in some
      cases distress. It has also been shown that children choose different distractors, and this
      can be related to age and sex. Best practice for distraction should therefore include
      identifying and working with individual patient preferences and this can additionally help by
      giving children some control over the procedure. There are limited studies looking at other
      interventions such as preparation and parent positioning showing that these interventions can
      have a positive impact on distress and coping. Few trials examine effect of interventions
      over time and multiple procedures.

      Play specialists provide therapeutic play for children undergoing procedures. They use a
      combination of psychological interventions alongside pharmacological interventions which
      includes preparation for the procedure, support during the procedure and post-procedure.
      However, whilst there is information about what play therapy should involve and which
      standards should be met, we are unaware of any specific framework of how this should be
      delivered.

      Investigators have developed a semi-structured play therapy intervention, which is developed
      from standard play therapy theory and well-recognised techniques as well as expert
      experience. This play therapy intervention is designed to represent a gold standard of care
      for delivering play therapy to children requiring procedures. The intervention aims to
      deliver play therapy in a standardised fashion whilst utilising the skill of the play
      specialist to choose and implement techniques in an individualised approach to each child.

      This study aims to deliver this semi-structured play therapy intervention and examine its
      impact on procedure-related anxiety, coping, pain and patient experience.

    <description>The play therapy intervention consists of a standard of care delivered by a play specialist. The play specialist delivers interventions aimed in assisting the child through the process of undergoing procedures. The intervention is semi-structured in order to facilitate a systematic approach which remains individualised and child-centred.
The intervention requires patients to be classified as 'high risk' or 'low risk' for procedure-related anxiety. This is assessed for all patients at baseline based on parent and clinician opinion. The play specialist may re-classify patients at the initial assessment or at any point whilst working with the child. If this occurs, clear documentation of the rationale for this will be recorded. Patients classified as &quot;high risk&quot; receive additional preparation sessions as detailed in the standard of care.</description>

    <description>The comparator group will receive standard care of patients having blood tests within the Trust, which does not include the specific intervention of a play therapist routinely. As part of standard care if a child becomes particularly distressed a clinician may make a decision to refer the child for play therapy. If this occurs during the study period the child will be referred to the play specialist delivering the intervention for the study. The child will then receive play therapy as in the described intervention. They will be excluded from the main analysis but data will still be collected and analysed descriptively.</description>
