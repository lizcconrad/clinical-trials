  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on promising data from our laboratory demonstrating synergy between ablative local
      radiotherapy and FLT3 ligand immunotherapy in murine NSCLC models, investigators are
      performing a phase II study combining FLT3L immunotherapy and SBRT for patients with advanced
      NSCLC that has progressed following standard systemic therapy. All patients will receive
      daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 Âµg/kg) for 5 days, beginning on the first day of
      SBRT. SBRT will be delivered to a single pulmonary lesion. Depending on the size and location
      of the target lesion, the SBRT regimen will be 34 Gy x 1 (peripheral tumors smaller than 2 cm
      and not adjacent to the chest wall), 18 Gy x 3 (peripheral tumors not eligible for 34 Gy x
      1), or 10 Gy x 5 (central tumors). The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival at
      4 months, defined using immune-related response criteria (irRC). A total of 29 patients will
      be enrolled.

      Primary Objective

        -  To explore the efficacy of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with FLT3
           ligand immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To establish the feasibility and safety of combining SBRT with FLT3 ligand immunotherapy
           for advanced NSCLC.

        -  To quantify and evaluate potential surrogate outcomes for clinical efficacy of this
           treatment approach, including radiographic responses, immunologic responses, and
           circulating tumor cell levels.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs): For the purposes of this study, a DLT will be defined as any treatment-emergent grade 3-5 toxicity, scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and occurring within 30 days after treatment with SBRT in combination with FLT3 ligand therapy.Asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities (eg: leukocytosis) that do not require intervention will not be counted as DLTs. For subjects who receive more than one &quot;cycle&quot; of SBRT and FLT3 ligand, only adverse events that occur after the first cycle will be scored as potential DLTs.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a single pulmonary lesion as well as FLT3 immunotherapy.
FLT3 Ligand Therapy (CDX-301)
Daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 ug/kg) will be administered for 5 days, beginning on the first day of SBRT.
Additional cycles of SBRT (to distinct lesions) and CDX-301 may be administered every 2-4 months to subjects who demonstrate evidence of clinical benefit (lack of treatment-related toxicity and no disease progression).
Study therapy will be discontinued in cases of treatment-related toxicity or disease progression.</description>
