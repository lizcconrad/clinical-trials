  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) provides a promising method for diagnostic purposes
      by enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple gene mutations. This study is to evaluate
      the feasibility and application value by using NGS into identifying genomic mutations in
      multiple or multifocal primary lung cancers in cell-tumor DNA (ctDNA) from surgical patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor samples originating from clinically considered multiple or multifocal primary lung
      cancer patients were available for mutational analysis. DNA and RNA were extracted from fresh
      tumor tissue or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. A series of cancer-related
      genomic alterations including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short insertions and
      deletions (InDels), copy number variations (CNVs) and gene rearrangements were identified by
      Oncomine Comprehensive Panel(OCP). High frequency mutations were also identified in blood
      sample by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction(ddPCR).
