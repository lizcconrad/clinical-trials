    <textblock>
      Introduction; reception must be understood as the offered attention within the relationship
      between a healthcare worker and the patient, including attitudes of inclusion, hearing,
      valorization of complains and identification of needs, being these individual collective. As
      a part of this process, communication is a primary and indispensable toll through which the
      healthcare team and the patient interchange information.

      Objective: to evaluate the influence of perception of patients suffering of knee
      osteoarthritis over fear, catastrophizing of pain and effectiveness, related to
      intra-articular injection od corticosteroids.

      Material and method: it will be performed a prospective, controlled and randomized study eith
      a blind evaluator on patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis submitted to joint
      injection. A hundred patients suffering of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis coming from the
      outpatient area of Rheumatology Division of Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP) will be
      evaluated, 50 belonging to the intervention group (reception) and 50 to a control group.
