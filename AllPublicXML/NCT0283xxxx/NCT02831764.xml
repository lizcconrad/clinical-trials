  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a two drug regimen of
      dolutegravir (DTG) plus (+) lamivudine (3TC) administered once daily with DTG plus two
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      [TDF]/emtricitabine [FTC] fixed dose combination [FDC]) administered once daily in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 infected adult subjects that have not previously received
      antiretroviral therapy. The study is designed to demonstrate the non inferior antiviral
      activity of DTG + 3TC regimen to that of DTG + TDF/FTC FDC and will characterise the long
      term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG plus 3TC through Week 148.
      Approximately, 700 subjects will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG + 3TC or DTG + TDF/FTC FDC.
      Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV 1 ribonucleotide nucleic acid (RNA) levels and
      by screening CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count.
