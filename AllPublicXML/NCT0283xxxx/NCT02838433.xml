  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impressive clinical responses obtained with immune checkpoint inhibitors
      (anti-PD-1/PDL-1, anti-CTLA-4) indicate that the presence of preexisting antitumor immune
      response might be required for their efficacy and highlight the critical role of antitumor T
      cell immunity.

      Recent progresses on the field of tumor immunology underline the critical role of CD4 helper
      1 T lymphocyte (TH1) in the control of innate and adaptive anticancer immunity. Therefore,
      monitoring tumor specific TH1 response could be relevant in cancer patients.

      In order to monitor tumor-specific CD4 Th1 responses in most cancer patients, the
      investigators team have previously described novel promiscuous peptides (referred as UCP:
      Universal Cancer Peptides) derived from human telomerase (TERT), a prototype of shared tumor
      antigen.

      By using UCP-based immuno-assay, UCP specific Th1 immune responses will be evaluated in this
      study in melanoma before and after treatment.
