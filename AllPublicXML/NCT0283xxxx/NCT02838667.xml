    <description>If participants are randomized into the intervention group, participants' information will be checked by the study investigators daily for 7 days (2 days pre-op and 5 days post-op). When appropriate, investigators may give suggestions to minimize the participants' risk(s) for AKI. Participant's primary care providers may take the suggestions into consideration. Participants' primary care providers are not obligated to carry out the suggestions that are given.</description>
