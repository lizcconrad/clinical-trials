  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase
      2b trial designed to evaluate symptoms and signs in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye
      disease. Eligible patients, will be treated with placebo during 2-week placebo run-in period.
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned in a double-masked, 1:1 ratio to either 0.017% P-321
      Ophthalmic Solution or placebo TID for 28 days. This study is designed to evaluate the
      changes in symptoms. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by adverse events.
