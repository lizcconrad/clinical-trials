  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mood was influenced by many factors in children. Sport, such as high-altitude mountain
      trek activity was thought benefit for human's mood and health. The expedition therapy was
      more and more popular in many schools recently. However, as the investigators best knowledge,
      there was no article discuss the relation between the mood and high-altitude mountain trek
      activity such as benefit influence in children. So, the investigators conduct the study.

      Method: Demographic data will be recorded. The Professor Yeh's mood questionnaires were used
      to record the mood status of before and after the 3 days high-altitude mountain trek
      activity.

      Statistical analyses: Participants rated their emotional states (happiness, sadness,
      anticipation, and anger) on a Likert scale. Each variable will be presented as descriptive
      statistics. Student t test or other suitable statistical method(s) will be used to determine
      the correction among the variables with scores of mood status. The paired t test or other
      suitable statistical method(s) will be used to determine the correction among the scores of
      mood status before and after the mountain activity. A difference was considered statistically
      significant if the p value were less than 0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed
      using SPPS statistical software for Windows, version 14 or more updated version.

    <description>A 36-item instrument, including the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire was used to evaluate the four emotional states (happiness, anticipation, sadness, and anger). Specifically, 12 questions yielded the happy index, 10 questions yielded the sadness index, 9 questions yielded the anger index, and 5 questions yielded the anticipation index. A Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 was used to evaluate individual items (1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, agree; and 4, strongly agree).</description>
