      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study on the efficacy
      and safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in patients with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (age ≥ 13 years) whose
      clinical conditions have not been effectively controlled by current standard medical
      therapies (topical moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and
      oral antihistamines) for more than 2 months will be include.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study on the efficacy
      and safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in patients with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. After providing informed consent, patients will be
      assessed for study eligibility at the baseline visit. Patients will undergo screening within
      28 days prior to randomization as &quot;wash out period&quot;, and during the screening period,
      treatment with medications (including systemic corticosteroids and systemic immunomodulating
      agents) for atopic dermatitis will be wash-out for at least 28 days prior to baseline
      (exclude moisturizers).

      At screening, plasma will be separated from patients' venous blood (400ml) aseptically and
      autologous immunoglobulin (total IgG) will be purified from the plasma by chromatography
      using Protein A during the screening period. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive weekly treatment with autologous immunoglobulin or placebo (normal saline) will be
      administrated by intramuscular injection, once a week for 7 weeks (total 8 injections).

      The investigators will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intramuscular injections
      of autologous immunoglobulin in those patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis by
      measuring changes in the standardized clinical severity scoring system for atopic dermatitis
      (SCORAD) values, Eczema Area and Severity index (EASI) and quality of life together with
      laboratory parameters in blood samples before and after treatment. Systemic corticosteroids
      as a rescue treatment will be prescribed to control unacceptable symptoms of atopic
      dermatitis at the investigator's discretion.
