    <measure>Overall survival based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from start of treatment to the end of follow-up; Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the time from date of treatment start to either the first disease progression date or last known tumor assessment date or death; Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression is defined as time from start of therapy until tumor progression; Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate; defined as total number of patients whose Best Overall Response(BOR)= Complete Response(CR), Partial Response(PR) or Stable Disease(SD), divided by total number of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease; BOR: Best Overall Response, CR: Complete Response, PR: Partial Response, SD: Stable Disease</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Partial Response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Partial response is defined as a record of at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, from the baseline sum; Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response is defined as a record of disappearance of all target lesions; Clinical outcomes will be assessed among NSCLC patients with advanced (stage IIIB and above) and earlier stage (stages I to IIIA) disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Percent of patients with an adverse event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with advanced stage (stage IIIB and above) disease; AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product</description>
