  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Over 39% of approximately 3,000 doctors (The British Medical Association
      quarterly survey, 2015) admitted to frequently feeling drained, exhausted, overloaded, tired,
      low and lacking energy. Such occupational distress may link to psychological and physical
      difficulties in doctors and have negative outcomes for organization and patients. The aim of
      the current study is to investigate the impact of an induction programme on occupational
      distress of doctors.

      Methods/design: Doctors will be invited to take part in an online research. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Participants in the experimental
      groups will complete one of the induction topics (about stress at work). Before and after an
      induction programme participants will be asked to fill in an online survey about their
      current occupational distress and organizational well-being.

      Discussion: The investigators expect that doctors' psychological, physiological and
      organizational well-being will improve after an induction programme which should serve as a
      resource for better doctor's own health understanding.

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned (computer generated straight away after clicking the link to the research) to one of 4 experimental conditions: stress at work, dealing with a patient's death, managing stress at work or all topics together. Each module includes brief reflection parts and quizzes. Participants will be asked to fill in an online survey just before the induction and a week after. The survey is about current occupational distress and organizational factors.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will be asked to fill in an online survey, but will not have any task at time-1. However, participants in the control group will be invited to complete induction programme after time-2 (a week time after time-1) in ensure the same expectations in both, experimental and control, groups.</description>
