      This study evaluates whether altering the timing and frequency of social assistance
      disbursement reduces drug related-harms that increase on the days surrounding monthly
      synchronized government social assistance cheque issue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coordinated monthly income assistance payments, while seeking to alleviate poverty, can also
      have negative and unintended impacts, particularly among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD).
      Observational research has identified escalations in drug-related harm coinciding with
      monthly assistance payments, such as overdose, treatment interruption, hospital admissions
      and public disorder. This project varies the timing and frequency of income assistance
      disbursement, and evaluates whether varying income assistance disbursement reduces
      drug-related harm coinciding with coordinated income assistance.

      Conducted among 273 PWUD, participants will be allocated for 6 income assistance cycles to a
      control or one of two intervention arms. Participants in the control arm will receive
      payments according to the existing monthly government schedule. Participants in the
      intervention arm will receive their income assistance: (1) monthly on a day different from
      government cheque issue; or (2) semi-monthly on days different from government cheque issue.
      The intervention will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative methods for its impact
      on drug use and related harms.
