    <textblock>
      This study is a 24-weeks, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double- placebo, parallel
      controlled phase III trial being carried out in 19 centers around China. The study population
      includes mild to moderate VaD patients (planned a total of 637) aged 45-85 in both gender.
      Participants will be randomly allocated to TZK (15g/d) and placebo identified to donepezil,
      donepezil (5mg/d) and placebo identified to TZK, or placebo identified to TZK and placebo
      identified to donepezil for a 24-weeks double-blind treatment period and a 12-weeks follow up
      period after withdrawal of experimental medication. The primary outcome measure is change
      from baseline in the Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and Clinician's
      Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus carer Interview. The secondary outcomes are changes
      from baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination, Activity of Daily Living Scale, Clock
      Drawing Test, Trail Making Test and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Safety is being assessed by
      observing side effects and adverse reaction during the entire treatment period. Statistical
      analysis will be conducted according to per-protocol population and intend-to-treat
      population and the safety will be analyzed in safety set.

    <time_frame>week 0, 4, 12, 24, 36</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition : VaDAS-cog is a revision of the ADAS-cog to be a better measure in vascular conditions. The original ADAS-cog developed by Rosen et al., measures cognitive performance by combining ratings of 11 items. The cognitive domains mainly addressed by ADAS-cog are memory (short term), language, ability to orientate (reflects memory), construction/planning of simple designs and performance. In addition to ADAS-cog, the VaDAS-cog comprises additional frontal lobe tests reflecting attention, working memory, executive function, and verbal fluency.The VADAS-cog will conducted at baseline, 4weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks and follow-up</description>

    <time_frame>week 0, 4, 12, 24, 36</time_frame>
    <description>Overall clinical response: CIBIC-plus is a 7-point scale which provides an index of clinically important change for dementia patients. It is a global measure of detectable change in concentration, orientation, memory, language, behavior, initiative and activities of daily living, usually requiring separate interviews with patients and caregivers,the CIBIC-plus will be conducted at baseline, 4weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks and follow-up</description>

    <description>Global cognition will be assessed by the MMSE,which will be conducted at baseline, 4weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks and follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Activity of Daily Living Scale(ADL) from baseline after 24 week's intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, 4, 12, 24, 36</time_frame>
    <description>Function:The ADL mainly used to measure the basic activities of daily living (or self-care) and the instrumental activities of daily living. The ADL scale can be divided to Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) and the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The PSMS relate to physical activities, such as toileting, mobility, dressing and bathing , and the IADL contains 8 items ,such as shopping, cooking, doing laundry, handling finances, using telephone, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medication and housekeeping.The ADL wil be conducted baseline, 4weeks, 12weeks, 24weeks and follow-up</description>
