  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that reducing the time spent sitting can reduce the risk of many diseases,
      such as diabetes and heart disease, and improve health. It is estimated that many older
      adults typically spend 70% of their waking day sitting, but little is known about whether
      reducing sitting promotes health and well-being in this age group. The aim of this research
      is to investigate the health effects of reducing sitting time by replacing it with short
      periods of standing or walking in adults over the age of 65.

    <time_frame>3 experimental intervention study visits over an estimated period of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Semantic Verbal Fluency Test assesses semantic memory and language, and participants will be asked to name as many items as they can that belong to a particular category. The categories selected for each of the experimental days will be clothing and animals.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will remain sitting throughout the test period whilst undertaking typical sedentary behaviours such as watching TV, using a computer, reading and writing. Walking and standing will be restricted.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standing</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be asked to break their sitting time by standing for five minutes every 30 minutes. Participants will be asked to stand in the same position with no further instructions provided. In total, individuals will accumulate 12 bouts (60 minutes) of standing throughout the test period.</description>
