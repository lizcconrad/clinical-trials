  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's overall goal is to develop new strategies to enhance the recovery of
      upper-limb function after spinal cord injury (SCI). The investigator proposes to use modern
      electrophysiological methods to enhance the efficacy of residual corticospinal connections.
      Defining the neural basis by which corticospinal volleys generate muscle responses will
      provide crucial information required to maximize residual motor output. The investigator's
      specific goals are to: 1) determine the temporal and spatial organization of corticospinal
      volleys and motor cortical representations of upper-limb muscles after incomplete cervical
      SCI and 2) develop methodologies to promote recovery of function. The investigator's focus on
      reach and grasp movements because of their importance in daily life activities.

      This study will determine the temporal organization of corticospinal volleys during reach and
      grasp movements. Multiple descending volleys in the corticospinal tract generate multiple
      peaks in muscle responses (indirect (I)-waves). I-waves are a mechanism by which
      corticospinal neurons are transynaptically activated at periodic intervals of ~1.5 ms. This
      periodic activation contributes to the recruitment of spinal motoneurons and generation of
      movement. we will use paired-TMS to examine I-waves in surface EMG recordings from upper-limb
      muscles during reach and grasp movements.

      We will also identify motor cortical maps of upper-limb muscles involved in reach and grasp
      movements. We will use TMS guided by a frameless neuronavigation system to define the size
      and location of motor cortical maps of upper-limb muscles during reach and grasp movements.
      We will be able to determine overlaps and functional interactions between distal and proximal
      arm motor cortical representations. Our preliminary data shows that finger and biceps
      cortical maps largely overlap during reach and grasp movements in controls but considerable
      less in patients
