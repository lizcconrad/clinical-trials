  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether protein supplementation can improve recovery of
      muscle function following a strenuous combination of both endurance and resistance exercise.
      It will specifically investigate the effect of protein supplementation on the recovery of
      strength, power and endurance exercise performance, along with measures of damage and
      inflammation of the muscle.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>96 hours (h)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) will be assessed at the knee during a leg extension movement using an isokinetic dynamometer. MVIC will be used to assess strength. Participants will perform the exercise using the dominant leg at a knee joint angle of 70ยบ three times, with a contraction of 3 seconds (s) on each occasion (each contraction separated by 60 s rest). The peak force (measured in Newton) generated across the three repetitions will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>96 h</time_frame>
    <description>Power will be assessed using counter-movement jump. Participants will place their hands on their hips, descend rapidly to ~90ยบ knee joint angle, and then jump as high as possible using a counter-movement. Three jumps will be performed (each jump separated by 60 s rest) and the peak vertical jump height (measured in centimeters) will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>16.1 Kilometer (km) Cycling Time Trial (TT) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>96 h</time_frame>
    <description>The 16.1 km cycling TT assessment will be performed on a cycling ergometer. Participants will be required to complete a distance of 16.1 km in as short a time as possible, while being blinded to time elapsed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Creatine Kinase Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>96 h</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle damage will be assessed by analyzing serum creatine kinase (CK) using CK N-Acetyl-L Cysteine (NAC)-activated Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum C-Reactive Protein Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>96 h</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle inflammation will be assessed by analyzing serum high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) using hs-CRP ELISA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Muscle Soreness Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>96 h</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived muscle soreness will be measured on a 200 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 mm= no pain and 200 mm= unbearably painful. Participants will be required to hold a fixed squat position (90ยบ knee joint angle) while perceived muscle soreness is rated.</description>
