  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib),
      a hypoxia-activated prodrug, in patients with EGFR-Mutant, T790M-Negative, Advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm open label multi-center Phase 2 study in which the pharmacokinetics, safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib) will be assessed in patients with EGFR
      mutant, T790M negative advanced NSCLC. Patients must have demonstrated progression during
      EGFR TKI therapy.

      Hypoxia PET scans will be obtained in select centers to analyze potential predictors of tumor
      response.
