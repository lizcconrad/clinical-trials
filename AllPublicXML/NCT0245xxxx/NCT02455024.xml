  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry to further characterize the safety profile of patients with
      chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CP-CML), accelerated phase (AP-CML), blast
      phase (BP-CML), or Ph+ALL treated with Iclusig (ponatinib) in routine clinical practice in
      the US. The registry is focused on analysis of vascular occlusive events.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry is being conducted in an effort to better understand rates, risk factors, and
      outcomes associated with vascular occlusive events in patients treated with Iclusig
      (ponatinib) in real world settings. This registry study will collect information about
      patient demographics, leukemia diagnosis, previous anti-cancer treatments, history of
      cardiovascular disease, risk factors for vascular complications, and concurrent medications
      (including antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents).
