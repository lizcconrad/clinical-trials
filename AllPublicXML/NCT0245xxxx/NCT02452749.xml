      This single-arm, open-label study will assess the safety and tolerability of one daily tablet
      of a commercially available cardiovascular health dietary supplement by questionnaire and
      blood markers in adults with borderline to mild hypertension over a 6 month period. Although
      the cardiovascular health dietary supplement being investigated has been on the market for
      over 20 years, prospective safety data and blood markers of end organ function have not
      previously been reported.

      Hypertension is an important overall risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease in the
      United States, and is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular events, including myocardial
      infarction and stroke, and cardiovascular-related mortality with advancing age. Based on
      population based studies and clinical trials, both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) elevations are continuous, strong and independent risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease.

      The product being studies is a cardiovascular health dietary supplement that has been
      commercially available since 1993. It is currently sold to healthcare practitioners as well
      as directly to consumers. Some healthcare providers use the product as part of a plan to
      treat high blood pressure in their patients. This is the first study collecting prospective
      safety data on this product.
