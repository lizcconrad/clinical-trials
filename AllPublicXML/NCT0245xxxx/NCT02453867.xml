      Study outline Stable senior transplant recipients (&gt;65 years of age) participating in the
      European SENIOR transplant registry may enter the trial at month 3 post-transplant, if they
      fulfil all of the in- and none of the exclusion criteria. At this time patients will be
      randomized 1:1 either to continue

      Reference therapy:

      Tacrolimus once daily (Advagraf®) Mycophenolate (either MMF ≥1g/d or EC-MPS ≥720g/d) Steroids
      (≥5mg prednisolone or equivalent) or to Investigational therapy: Tacrolimus once daily
      (Advagraf®) Steroid stop at month 3 (tapering within 2 weeks) Mycophenolate stop at month 6
