  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who accept long-term parenteral nutrition tend to suffer from liver injury. The
      mechanism for this injury has two possible explanations. The first possible reason is
      intrinsic toxic effects of parenteral nutrition. The second is the basic pathological
      condition of intestinal failure which includes infection, bacterial translocation, etc.
      Cholestasis is the lethal presentation of this kind of liver disease. Farnesoid X receptor
      (FXR) is a member of ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily. FXR serves as a sensor
      for bile acids and promotes enterohepatic clearance of bile acids by controlling the
      expression of genes involved in their transport and metabolism. Considering the activation of
      vitamin D receptor (VDR) by vitamin D can induce FXR-related genes in the liver.The
      hypothesis of this study is that vitamin D plays a key role in the prevention and reversion
      of the liver via VDR and/or FXR signaling pathway. Using a mouse cholestasis model based on
      short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition, the researchers will investigate the dynamic
      change of plasma vitamin D level. Afterward, intravenous supplement of vitamin D was added to
      this model to demonstrate vitamin D can ameliorate cholestasis. An in vitro system was
      developed to investigate the importance of FXR signaling pathway in this effect.
