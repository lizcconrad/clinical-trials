    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nintedanib works
      compared to a placebo in treating against radiation-induced pneumonitis (inflammation of the
      lungs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery and are
      undergoing chemoradiation therapy. Nintedanib may help shrink or slow the growth of
      radiation-induced pneumonitis by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cells to grow and
      may prevent the growth of new blood vessels. It may also help reduce the recurrence of
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rate of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis at 6 months after completion of
      chemoradiation in patients with unresectable Stage II/III/ oligometastatic IV non-small cell
      lung carcinoma (NSCLC) who completed chemoradiation followed by nintedanib versus placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the quality of life (QOL) in patients who received nintedanib versus placebo
      during active treatment until 6 months after completion of treatment.

      II. To compare the progression-free survival, overall survival and 1-year progression-free
      survival rate in patients who received nintedanib versus placebo.

      III. To compare pulmonary function test (PFT) results and radiation pneumonitis (RP) score in
      patients who received nintedanib versus placebo.

      IV. To compare the composite index (based on PFT, RP score and QOL) at the end of active
      treatment and 6 months after completion of treatment between patients who received nintedanib
      versus placebo.

      V. To investigate blood-based biomarkers in evaluating risk of developing radiation
      pneumonitis as well as the efficacy of nintedanib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive nintedanib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive placebo
      capsules PO BID on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, between 76-97 days,
      between 166-187 days, and then between 2-2.5 years.
