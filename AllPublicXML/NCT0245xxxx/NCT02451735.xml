  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate the effectiveness of new educational
      materials (informational booklet &amp; DVD) that promote participation in genetic counseling
      among breast cancer survivors.

      There are two phases to this study:

      Part 1 - reviewing the newly developed educational materials, and Part 2 - evaluating the
      effectiveness of the newly developed educational materials

      Part 1: Intervention Development

      Aim 1: Develop a psychoeducational intervention (PEI) for high-risk breast cancer survivors
      about genetic counseling (GC) and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC).

      Part 2: Intervention Pilot

      Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a PEI from the perspective of the BC
      patients and health care professionals.

      Exploratory Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary efficacy of the PEI compared to standard clinical
      care. We hypothesize that women in the intervention group will have higher uptake of GC,
      greater increases in knowledge, and more perceived benefits related to GC compared to the
      control group.

    <description>Psychoeducational Intervention (PEI) development. PEIs include printed and DVD materials, and represent a commonly used and effective approach to implement theoretically based individual-level interventions. These materials serve as important sources of information for the general public, cancer patients, and survivors from a variety of backgrounds, including populations with limited health literacy. An interview and feedback collection process will take place to provide data to improve current PEI materials.</description>
