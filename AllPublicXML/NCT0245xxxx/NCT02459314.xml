    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled-trial study in
      hypercholesterolemic volunteers (serum LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL). Eligible subjects were randomized
      to receive either plant sterol and soluble fiber-enriched soymilk or plain soymilk 360 mL/day
      (2 packages a day) for 8 weeks. Venous blood samples were collected from the eligible
      subjects during pre-treatment (screening period; day -7), every 2 week after treatment (at
      the end of week 2, 4, 6 and 8) to test for lipid profiles and fasting blood sugar (FBS).

      This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled-trial study in
      hypercholesterolemic volunteers (serum LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL). After initial assessment at the
      screening period, eligible subjects were randomized to receive either plant sterol and
      soluble fiber-enriched soymilk (SFSM) or plain soymilk (SM) 360 mL/day (2 packages a day) for
      8 weeks. The participants might take the study product as snack, the first one in the morning
      and the second one in the afternoon. It was possible to take it before or after meal, however
      taken before meal was highly suggested. A physical examination (including vital signs,
      height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and systemic evaluation) was performed
      at each visit, every 2 weeks. Concurrent medications usage were record at each visit during
      the study as well.

      Three-day per week of food intake and weekly exercises were recorded and evaluated at every
      visit. It was recommended every participant to follow dietary control and lifestyle
      modification to improve hypercholesterolemia during the entire study. Details of overall
      product satisfaction were evaluated by the participants after 2 and 8 weeks of study products
      consumption (at visit 2 and 5). To evaluate compliance, the participants were asked to
      collect and return the empty packages to the investigator every 2 weeks at visit 2, 3, 4, and
      5. More than 90% of study product consumption would be considered as eligible on-going
      subjects.

      Venous blood samples were collected from the eligible subjects during pre-treatment
      (screening period; day -7), every 2 week after treatment (visit 2, 3, 4, 5; at the end of
      week 2, 4, 6 and 8) to test for lipid profiles and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Adverse events,
      if any, were recorded immediately after study enrollment.

    <description>Sterols compete with LDL-C for absorption in GI tract. A meta-analysis of 41 trials indicated that an intake of 2 g sterols/stanols reduces the LDL-C level by 10%. Additive effects occur when sterols are combined with statins; the combination being more efficacious than a 2 times up-dosing of statins alone. Soluble dietary fibers also have significant cholesterol lowering effects. In a meta-analysis, Brown et al estimate that a daily soluble fiber intake ranging from 9-30 g/d, were associated with 10.6% reduction in LDL-C levels.</description>

    <description>Soy protein is another LDL-C and total cholesterol lowering food. A meta-analysis by Reynolds K et al. discovered that volunteers receiving 20 to more than 61 g of soy protein had reductions in total cholesterol by 5.26 mg/dL (95% CI -7.14 to -3.38), and LDL-C by 4.25 mg/dL (95% CI -6.00 to -2.50), with an increase of HDL-C by 0.77 mg/dL (95% CI 0.20 to 1.34). Reductions in LDL cholesterol were larger in hypercholesterolemic than in normocholesterolemic subjects.</description>
