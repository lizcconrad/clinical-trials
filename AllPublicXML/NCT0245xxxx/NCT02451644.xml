  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the association between the amount of physical activity of the patient, ie
      the number of steps daily / weekly, and the pregnancy rate after embryo transfer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have investigated the matter until today and still no reliable information about
      the relationship between physical activity and / or its intensity and the pregnancy rate
      after embryo transfer.

      All patients that would take part in the study will be given a pedometer to measure steps for
      a month.

      Measuring steps will begin preparation for embryo transfer and two weeks after. Collected
      information about pregnancy rate (BHCG positive or negative).
