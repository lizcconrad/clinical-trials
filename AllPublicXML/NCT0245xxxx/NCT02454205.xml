      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a new injection-free six-to-nine month treatment
      regimen of linezolid, bedaquiline, levofloxacin, pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethionamide/high dose
      isoniazid (INH) compared to the conventional empiric injection-based regimen of 21-24 months
      treatment. The secondary aim is to determine if other treatment-related outcomes including
      adverse events, adherence to treatment, culture conversion, and cure/completion are
      significantly different in the intervention and conventional arms.

      Background:

      TB is completely out of control in South Africa and is now officially the most common cause
      of death in this country. Alarmingly, the gravity if this pandemic has now been compounded by
      the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which constitutes resistance to the two
      most potent anti-tuberculous drugs, namely rifampicin and isoniazid . XDR-TB refers to
      resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, any fluoroquinolone, and any second line injectable drug
      (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). MDR-TB is a burgeoning epidemic in South Africa, with
      rates trebling over the last decade. It is of considerable concern because mortality is high
      (up to 50% in South Africa) and it often affects economically active young adults. It is also
      a major threat to health care workers in South Africa. We recently showed a rate in SA health
      care workers 6 fold higher than the general population further exacerbating the shortage of
      this critical workforce in the country. The increasing cost to manage this disease is
      unsustainable.

      Although drug-resistant TB comprises less than 2% of the total caseload in the country
      (approximately ½ million patients with TB treated per year), it consumes almost 40% of the
      total national TB programme budget, and more than 60% of the total TB drug budget. This is
      not sustainable and drug-resistant TB therefore has the capacity to destabilise functional TB
      control programmes in many countries in Africa.

      The current treatment of MDR-TB is arduous, with a six to eight month intensive phase of
      daily painful injections of Kanamycin combined with oral pyrazinamide, a fluoroquinolone
      (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin), prothionamide and either cycloserine or para-aminosalicylic
      acid (if cycloserine cannot be used). Treatment continues for 18 months after consecutive
      negative sputum cultures, and lasts at least 20 months. There are substantial drug-associated
      toxicities and adverse events that frequently lead to interruption or cessation of treatment.

      This study proposes to test the efficacy of a new drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB
      which is of short term duration and which does not contain an injectable drug, thus making
      treatment easier to administer and thereby potentially increasing compliance. All the drugs
      will be available to the NTP if the study is shown to be successful. This regimen will
      comprise linezolid, bedaquiline, levofloxacin, PZA and either ethionamide or high dose INH or
      teridazone. A gene-directed diagnostic approach (mutational analysis) will be used in the
      interventional arm to individualise therapy and to inform on the use of high dose INH versus
      ethionamide. If both mutations are present then to administer teridazone.

      Furthermore, in the proposed study the key aim is to test a regimen (rather than an
      individual drug) and will look at how the outcomes (24 month), including treatment
      completion/cure (i.e. treatment success which is the primary outcome) and mortality, are
      impacted. It is expected that introduction of a shortened effective regimen will reduce drop
      out and drastically reduce mortality and on-going transmission. Moreover, the rates of XDR-TB
      and TDR-TB may also decline.

      The study will be conducted at 5 trial sites in South Africa that are designated MDR-TB
      treatment facilities and it many cases patients will be recruited from the satellite clinics
      of these centres reflecting the decentralized MDR-TB program. All the sites have the
      necessary expertise and facilities to carry out the proposed study. The study is a fully
      conceived and funded within South Africa.

             testing.

          -  Male or female aged 18 years and older.

          -  Body weight between 40 and 90 kg, inclusive.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential or participants of either sex who are using or
             willing to use effective methods of birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A participant who in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to cope with regular
             visits to the trial site either because of travel constraints, or because of drug or
             alcohol abuse, or other reason.

          -  Known at screening to have XDR-TB or pre-XDR-TB (i.e. fluoroquinolone or second-line
             injectable drug (SLID) resistance i.e. to capreomycin, amikacin and kanamycin).

          -  Previous history of treatment for MDR-TB or XDR-TB or previous treatment with
             bedaquiline.

          -  Currently on MDR-TB treatment for more than 2 weeks.

          -  Any participant with a Karnofsky score &lt; 50.

          -  Known allergy to any of the trial drugs or related substances.

          -  Having participated in other clinical studies within 8 weeks prior to trial start
             where investigational agents were used that may potentially impact current trial
             outcome.

          -  Presence (or evidence) of symptomatic neuropathy grade 3 or higher.

          -  Epilepsy where drugs prolonging QT interval are used.

          -  Participant who is pregnant, breast-feeding (and not willing to stop), or planning to
             conceive a child within 6 months of cessation of treatment.

          -  Incompatibility between microbiological and clinical/ radiological findings (i.e.
             where the clinical and/or radiological findings are discordant with microbiological
             testing suggesting laboratory contamination).

          -  Participants with ECG abnormalities, in particular QT prolongation.

          -  Any pre-existing laboratory abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator will
             place the participant at risk. Patients with any of the following baseline laboratory
             abnormalities will be excluded from the study:

               -  Creatinine grade 2 or worse (&gt;1.4 times ULN)

               -  Hemoglobin level grade 4 (HB &lt;6.5g/dL)

               -  Platelets grade 3 or worse (&lt;49999 x 109/L)

               -  ALT grade 3 or worse (&gt;5 times ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin grade 3 or worse (&gt;2.5 times ULN)

          -  Specific prior or concurrent medication/treatments (see Restrictions section below,
             Table 3).

          -  Rifampicin monoresistant TB.

          -  Fluoroquinolone and/or SLID resistance. Although in South Africa, the standard of care
             does not single out MDR-TB with fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside resistance at
             initiation of MDR-TB treatment, in this study the Hain MTBDRsl LPA will be used on the
             sputum sample to exclude any pre-XDR and XDR cases from participation in the study
             (results from the LPA and phenotypic DST testing on the isolate will be available 3-6
             weeks later).

        All inclusion and no exclusion criteria must be met prior to enrolment and randomisation.
        Whenever the investigator has reason to suspect that there might be a health problem (other
        than TB) participation should only be considered after discussing the case with the medical
        monitor. Note: Participants who are currently on, or have previously been on drug-sensitive
        TB treatment are not excluded from participation.

        Post-randomisation exclusion criteria:

        • Fluoroquinolone and/or SLID resistance detected on DST using the isolate. Note: A woman
        who falls pregnant during the treatment phase of the trial will not be excluded but will be
        counselled regarding potential termination of pregnancy.
