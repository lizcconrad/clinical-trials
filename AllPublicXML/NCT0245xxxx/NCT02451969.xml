      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational
      23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in healthy children, adults and elderly.
      The control vaccine is a commercialized 23-valent PPV.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational
      23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd.
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the
      investigational vaccine is non-inferior to that of a commercialized 23-valent PPV
      manufactured by Chengdu Institute of Biological products Co., Ltd.; the secondary objective
      is to assess the safety of the investigational and control vaccines. Participants will be
      grouped into three cohorts by age: child cohort (2 - 17 years old), adult cohort (18 - 60
      years old) and elderly cohort (≥ 61 years old). In each cohort, the participants will be
      randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the ratio 1:1.

    <measure>The seroconversion rates (SCR) of each of the 23 pneumococcal serotypes</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>For each serotype, the SCR is the percentage of participants with the increase of relative antibody concentration ≥ 2 folds after vaccination. The relative antibody concentrations were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).</description>

    <measure>The incidences of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>After each injection, a 30-minute safety observation was conducted immediately. The body temperature, occurrence of solicited local and general AEs on day 0 - 7 were reported. Unsolicited AEs occurred during day 0 - 28 were also reported. Each AE case was reviewed by the investigator to determine whether or not it was an adverse reaction (related to the vaccination).</description>
