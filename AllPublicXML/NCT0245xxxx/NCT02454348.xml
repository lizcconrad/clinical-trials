  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis, a systemic host response to the invasion of a pathogenic microorganism, may progress
      to severe sepsis, wherein the patient experiences acute dysfunction in at least one organ
      system, and further develop into septic shock if the patient cannot regain adequate systemic
      blood pressure and perfusion after adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation. Further
      prospective study of the potential mortality benefit with combination norepinephrine and
      vasopressin in critically ill patients with septic shock needs to be performed. Our research
      will resolve this essential question and improve the scientific knowledge surrounding
      vasoactive medications in patients with septic shock.

      Sepsis, a systemic host response to the invasion of a pathogenic microorganism, may progress
      to severe sepsis, wherein the patient experiences acute dysfunction in at least one organ
      system, and further develop into septic shock if the patient cannot regain adequate systemic
      blood pressure and perfusion after adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation. The exact
      societal burden from severe sepsis and septic shock in difficult to quantify: millions of
      individuals in both industrialized and developing nations experience these syndromes each
      year, the best medical centers in the world have only achieved a 22% mortality rate for
      severe sepsis, and caregivers as well as patients endure a long-lasting impact from caring
      from loved ones who have survived severe sepsis. Recently, the impactful work performed by
      Rivers and colleagues that established early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) as the standard of
      care for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock has been compared to usual care in three
      international trials. The results of these trials suggest that usual care is as effective as
      EGDT, which necessitates new research be conducted into each component of EGDT to determine
      how and to what extent specific therapies are safe and effective. One key aspect of the
      provision of care to patients with septic shock is the time to initiation and choice of
      vasoactive agents. This study will investigate the use of norepinephrine and vasopressin
      versus norepinephrine alone as the initial vasoactive regimen in critically ill adult
      patients with septic shock.
