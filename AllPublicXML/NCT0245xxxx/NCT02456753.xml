  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of ultrasounds increases in delivery rooms every year. Indeed, this method can
      help to visualize elements that may not be observable after clinical examination. Moreover,
      it is known that a fetal head engagement can lead to an instrumental extraction and in case
      of error, which happens in some cases, fetal and maternal risks are possible.

      These elements led to the investigators' hypothesis which is that a trans-perineal
      ultrasonography may facilitate the evaluation of a clinical fetal head engagement in case of
      doubt.

      It's a monocentric, transversal, clinical trial regarding women giving birth at the GHICL's
      hospital Saint Vincent de Paul.

      Clinical examinations will be done by the midwives following the indications given on the
      clinical form. A trans-perineal echography will then be done by technical operators following
      the ultrasonography form.

      These examinations will only last a few minutes, no further tests will be done afterwards.
