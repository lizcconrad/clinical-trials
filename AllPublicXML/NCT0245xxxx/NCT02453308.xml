    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label randomised trial comparing standard ACT treatment with matching
      triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs), evaluating efficacy in safety and
      tolerability. The estimated total sample size is 2040 patients from 16 sites in Asia and 1
      site in Africa. There are 2 arm study groups that have 2 treatment arms each.

      Study group A:

      A.1: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days. versus: A.2: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days plus
      Amodiaquine for 3 days.

      Study group B:

      B.1: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days. versus: B.2: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      for 3 days plus Mefloquine hydrochloride for 3 days.

      Study group C:

      C.1: Artesunate-mefloquine for 3 days versus: C.2: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days
      plus Mefloquine hydrochloride for 3 days.

      According to the WHO guideline, all patients except for children under the age of 1 year or a
      weight below 10 kilograms will also be treated with a single dose of low dose primaquine.

    <textblock>
      In Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and DRC, the following two combinations will be used:

        1. Artemether-lumefantrine combined with amodiaquine (TACT arm) or

        2. Artemether-lumefantrine (ACT arm)

      In Myanmar and Vietnam the following two combinations will be used:

        1. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combined with mefloquine (TACT arm) or

        2. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (ACT arm)

      In Cambodia and Thailand the following two combinations will be used:

        1. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus Mefloquine hydrochloride (TACT arm) or

        2. Artesunate-mefloquine (ACT arm)
