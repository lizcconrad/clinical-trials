  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia (lazy eye), is the leading treatable cause of vision loss in childhood. Uncorrected
      refractive errors (ie farsightedness) can lead to difficulties in school. Unfortunately, many
      children do not receive vision screening until they have already developed irreversible
      vision problems. This has led to the development of a variety of screening protocols and
      devices that attempt to identify patients at risk for vision problems early in life. This
      study aims to compare the leading vision screening devices/protocols to a new device, The
      Pediatric Vision Scanner, and compare their ability to detect vision problems against a &quot;gold
      standard&quot; eye exam.
