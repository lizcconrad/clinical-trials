    <textblock>
      The study is carried out in a prospective randomized controlled way. In the context of
      informed understanding from parents, compared with traditional process(no anesthesia; lying
      without the pillow and fasting water and food for four hours after lumbar puncture), randomly
      select lidocaine surface anesthesia and postoperative management (lying without the pillow
      for half an hour after lumbar puncture) . All children will be evaluated by the FLACC(The
      face,legs,activity,cry,consolability behavioral tool) scale to assess the degree of pain
      during and after lumbar puncture. Lumber puncture time, success rate and any postoperative
      condition will be recorded and analyzed.A questionaire about the operation for all parents
      and children will be investigated in order to establish an optimized lumbar puncture
      management process.

      The purpose of this study is to establish an optimized lumbar puncture management process on
      the basis of fully understanding of parents and children. An improved process consisting of
      painless lumbar puncture (LP),less postoperative complications and comfortable LP will be
      anticipated.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the reason that not all participants agree to have anesthesia and postoperative
    management at the same time
