  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a sight-threatening problem for diabetic patient who has
      swelling in macula. Patients with DMO can receive laser treatment and achieve good acuity
      finally. However, some patients still have difficulties in reading even after proper
      treatment.

      In this project, the investigators aimed to explore the effectiveness of different training
      paradigms in improving reading performance in patients with DMO.

    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO), after receiving laser photocoagulation, achieved
      good outcomes in distance acuity. However, some patients, particularly those developing
      parafoveal scotoma, still had difficulty in reading. Inability to read or reading very slowly
      leads to the potential loss of job, as well as the enjoyment of reading for leisure.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading
      rehabilitation using perceptual learning paradigms in enhancing reading performance in
      patients with reading difficulties due to DMO. Also, the fundamental mechanisms explaining
      the reading problems in patients with DMO reading Chinese will be examined.

      The investigators hypothesize that the perceptual training would show an improvement in
      reading. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that temporal visual processing speed and
      spatial visual span will be improved after perceptual training. The investigators' secondary
      hypothesis is that the reading speed and fixation stability will be improved after training.
