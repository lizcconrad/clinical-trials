    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INCB040093 as monotherapy
      and as combination therapy with itacitinib (INCB039110) in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    A decision was made to terminate the study due to the changing treatment landscape for the
    development of new agents in combination in Hodgkin lymphoma.
