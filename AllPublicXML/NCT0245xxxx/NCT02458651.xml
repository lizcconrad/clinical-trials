    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to describe patient and disease characteristics as
      well as treatment patterns in Chinese patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, this study characterizes the clinical outcomes for
      various populations of patients defined by clinical and tumor characteristics, treatment
      patterns, and hospital category defined by city tier and geographic region.
