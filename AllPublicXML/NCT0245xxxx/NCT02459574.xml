    <textblock>
      A streamlined AF ablation procedure done without PV mapping as a daycase is more effective
      than anti-arrhythmic drugs at reducing all hospital episodes for recurrent atrial
      fibrillation.

      AVATAR-AF is a multicentre, randomised controlled study comparing a streamlined
      AVATAR-protocol ablation procedure to anti-arrhythmic therapy in patients with documented
      paroxysmal AF who are considered to be failing current strategy for AF. A secondary control
      arm will also compare the AVATAR-protocol to conventional AF ablation. 300 patients who are
      on no prior anti-arrhythmic, 'pill-in-pocket' or taking regular anti-arrhythmics will be
      randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to a treatment strategy of either AVATAR-protocol ablation,
      anti-arrhythmic therapy or conventional AF ablation and followed-up for 1 year.

    <description>This will involve an ablation procedure carried out in the usual manner. The patient will have three sheaths placed in the leg veins. Catheters will be passed up to the patient's heart from these veins. Two crossing are required into the left atrium. The ablation will involve freeze technology using the Advance Cryoballoon. It will include measuring the electrical signals and may also involve radiofrequency or 'burning' technology in addition.</description>

    <description>Anti-arrhythmic drugs: On the treatment start date the patient will have a new tablet prescribed or a change in the dosage of the medication. The patient will be reviewed at 8wks (visit 1) later to see if the medication is working. If the tablets are working, the patients medication will be left unchanged. If not, an alternative tablet or a higher dose will be used.</description>

    <description>AF ablation with pulmonary vein isolation. The patient will have two sheaths in their leg veins instead of the usual three sheaths. Catheters will be passed up to the heart from these leg veins. The single crossing into the left atrium will be by the usual method. Veins will be ablated using freeze technology known as the Advance Cryoballoon. After the ablation is completed the patient will have scans on their heart and checks of the leg veins. If all the checks are satisfactory at six hours after the procedure the patient will be allowed to go home on the same day. The patient will be reviewed in clinic in 8 weeks (visit 1) after the procedure and if it has been successful, will be reviewed again a month later (visit 2) and if all is well, the patient will be discharged from clinic.</description>
