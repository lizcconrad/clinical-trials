  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to empirically evaluate the impact of a Dance/Movement Therapy
      program adapted to older adults. Participants over 60 years old are enrolled in one of three
      groups: Dance/Movement Therapy, Aerobic Exercise or Waiting List (control group) for 12
      weeks. The training groups occur 3 times a week for 1 hour each session. Physical condition,
      cognitive function, general health and lifestyle, and stress hormones are assessed at
      baseline, after 12 weeks and after 28 weeks.

    <description>Each DMT session follows a similar structure of Opening, Warm up, Development, Cool Down and Closure. Various themes dedicated to an aging population are addressed by the supervising dance/movement therapist through movement activities and using support material (i.e., props, music). This group is provided in a group setting of maximum 10 participants at a time and occurs 3 times per week for 1 hour each session over the course of 12 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Aerobics Exercise (AE)</intervention_name>
    <description>The aerobics exercise program is composed of warm up exercises followed by cardiovascular training on a recumbent bicycle. The intensity is set and progressively increased using each participants' individualized maximal aerobic power obtained in the baseline VO2 evaluation. This program respects the recommendations made by the American College of Sports Medicine and their adaptations for aging populations. Each session is supervised by a kinesiologist with 2 participants at a time. The training occurs 3 times per week for 1 hour each session over the course of 12 weeks.</description>
