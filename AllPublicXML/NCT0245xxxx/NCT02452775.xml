    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot trial to test the addition of 2 investigational agents, Montanide
      and poly-ICLC (a TLR3 agonist) to a backbone of autologous oxidized tumor cell lysate vaccine
      (OC-L) administered with GMCSF in subjects with primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cancer.

             preparation.

          5. Lysate must meet release criteria.
