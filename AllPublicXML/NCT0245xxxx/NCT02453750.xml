  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to examine Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) patients for evidence of airway
      inflammation as a first step to characterize the reported bronchodilator responsiveness.
      Airway biopsy studies are invasive and thus we propose to perform induced sputum studies to
      document the amount and type of inflammation present. Another ancillary non-invasive measure
      of airway inflammation that we will use is exhaled nitric oxide (NO). The primary objective
      of this study is to determine if CDH patients have any evidence of airway inflammation. The
      hypothesis of this study is that children with CDH do not have evidence of airway
      inflammation associated with bronchodilator responsiveness. Based on this information,
      treatment for CDH patients will hopefully be more accurate and appropriate for their specific
      needs.

    <measure>Sputum Eosinophil Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, +30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Children will be divided by sputum eosinophils into 2 groups:
or = 3% eosinophils = eosinophilic inflammation
&lt; 3% eosinophils = no inflammation
The mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV, calculated as 100 x SD/mean) will be calculated for each group. The proportion of children with CDH that have eosinophilic inflammation will be determined.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, +30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Children will be divided by sputum neutrophils into 2 groups

    <description>exhaled NO measurements will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines. These tests are performed routinely as part of the respiratory evaluation of these patients and are not additional tests added for this study.</description>

    <description>Subject will inhale 5 mls of 3% hypertonic saline for 7 minutes by nebulizer. Sputum production (with cough) will be attempted post inhalation. A maximum of 3 hypertonic saline inhalations will be attempted if inhalation does not generate a productive cough. If sputum induction is not successful and the FEV1 falls &lt;10%, the concentration of inhaled hypertonic saline will increase from 3 to 4%. If 5 mls of 4% hypertonic saline inhaled for 7 minutes does not produce a productive cough we will proceed to 5%. If 5 mls of 5% hypertonic saline inhaled for 7 minutes does not produce a productive cough the test is complete and the sample is labelled 'no sputum collected'. If FEV1 falls &gt;10%, the previous step will be repeated.</description>

    <description>A bronchodilator (Salbutamol 200 mcg or 2 puffs inhaled via spacer device) will be administered to all subjects in the pulmonary function laboratory. 15 minutes after administration of the bronchodilator spirometry will be repeated. This is performed routinely in CDH clinic and is not an additional test for this study.</description>
