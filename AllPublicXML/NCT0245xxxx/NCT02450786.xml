  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been growing interest in identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) which is susceptible to progress to PD dementia(PDD). PD-MCI is
      known to significantly correlates with low cerebrospinal beta-amyloid 1-42 and 1-40 levels,
      in which suggest the existence of something common with Alzheimer's dementia. PDD have showed
      more cholinergic deficits than Alzheimer's dementia and responds to donepezil. The
      investigators assume that PD-MCI patients also have cholinergic deficits. Donepezil improves
      cognition, and seems to be well tolerated and not to worsen parkinsonism in patients with
      cognitive impairment. Donepezil produced similar improvements in cognition and behaviour in
      DLB and PDD. This supports the hypothesis that the two disorders are closely related
      clinically and neurobiologically. Larger scale, placebo controlled clinical trials are needed
      to provide an evidence base to guide the clinical use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Lewy
      body disease.

      It is believed that earlier intervention, later appearance of dementia should be needed to
      lower the socioeconomic costs and to improve the quality of life on patients and caregivers.
      The investigators anticipate that donepezil may delay the development of dementia in patients
      with PD-MCI.
