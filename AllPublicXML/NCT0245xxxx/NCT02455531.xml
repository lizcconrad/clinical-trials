    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare direct and indirect measures of right ventricular
      (RV) systolic and diastolic function between 11 year old subjects who had been randomly
      assigned to receive a right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) vs. a modified
      Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) at the time of the Norwood operation.

      The Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial was the first multicenter, randomized
      clinical trial to compare two operations in the field of congenital heart disease.8,11
      Children with HLHS and other related single RV lesions were enrolled and randomized to
      receive either a MBTS or a RVPAS at the time of the initial Norwood procedure. This landmark
      study provided extraordinary insight not only into the consequences of both shunt types, but
      also into the course, treatment responses and short- and mid-term outcomes for these
      medically complex patients. Through the SVR Trial and SVR Extension Study (SVR II), outcomes,
      including but not limited to the primary outcome of transplant-free survival, have now been
      evaluated in this patient cohort when the last enrolled patient reached 12 months and again
      at 3 years of age. While early post-operative transplant-free survival during the interstage
      period7 and at one year8 was better for those children randomized to a RVPAS, survival by the
      3-year evaluation appeared equivalent between the two shunt types. Moreover, RVEF was
      somewhat diminished and the number of interventions was higher in the RVPAS group.12 These
      findings raised concern that the RV dysfunction in the RVPAS group may be progressive,
      leading to significantly worse long-term outcomes; if so, the benefits of the RVPAS for
      short-term survival may be outweighed by longer-term morbidity and mortality. Thus, the
      optimal surgical approach for newborns with HLHS and related single RV lesions remains
      unclear.

      The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) Investigators have a unique opportunity and responsibility
      to analyze the effect of the type of systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt placed during the
      Norwood procedure on longer-term survival, as well as to define its effect on other long-term
      outcomes in this multi-institutional cohort of exquisitely characterized subjects with single
      RV lesions. As subjects enrolled in the SVR cohort approach a decade of age, the
      investigators aim: 1) to determine if shunt type at the time of Norwood operation is
      associated with any long-term differences in cardiac function, survival, or contributors to
      quality of life; and 2) to characterize long-term outcomes and determine risk factors other
      than shunt type for adverse long-term outcomes in children with HLHS and other related single
      ventricle anomalies.

      Participants and their parents who have not yet contributed to the SVR Extension
      biorepository will be offered the opportunity to provide saliva for extraction and storage of
      DNA. If study participants have consented to participate in the biorepository through the SVR
      Extension study but not yet contributed a sample, they will be asked to contribute at the
      time of the SVR III participation. Families who were not previously approached, or who
      declined participation in the biorepository earlier, may be offered the opportunity to
      participate at the time of the SVR III participation.
