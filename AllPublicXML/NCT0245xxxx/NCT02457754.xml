  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown a high association between physical fitness and present and future
      health. Two of the main epidemics of the industrialized world are obesity and osteoporosis,
      diseases that could be prevented with early interventions from childhood. Both, physical
      activity and physical fitness have shown an association with these diseases, but tools for
      assessing them in early ages are still in development. Moreover, there is a lack of physical
      fitness reference values in preschool children and the relation of pathologies with physical
      fitness in these ages is still to be demonstrated. Therefore, through a simple and precise
      methodology displayed in the school and adapted for the younger we intend to: Provide a
      combination of safe and precise field tests to evaluate health related physical fitness in
      preschool children. Analyze body composition, risk of overweight, obesity and low mineral
      density and their relation with physical activity. The evaluation of these health-related
      physical fitness variables in early ages is of great interest to clinic and public health.
