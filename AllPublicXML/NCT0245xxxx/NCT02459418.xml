    <measure>Baseline Corrected FSH Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Zero to the Last Quantifiable Measurement [AUC(0-last)]</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 hours (predose) to 192 hours postdose.</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-last) was estimated for baseline corrected FSH in serum by noncompartmental methods using actual elapsed time from dosing. Baseline corrected concentrations were determined by subtracting the baseline concentration (collected immediately prior to dosing in that period) from the postdose concentration.
Geometric mean baseline corrected FSH exposure results are presented for all subjects who received active study drug and had at least 1 measured and valid concentration at a scheduled PK time point after administration of AFOLIA or Gonal-f® RFF.</description>

    <measure>Baseline Corrected FSH Apparent Terminal Half-life</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 hours (predose) to 192 hours postdose.</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent terminal half-life was defined as ln2/apparent terminal rate constant (λz). λz is determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the log-linear concentration-time curve. Visual assessment was used to identify the terminal linear phase of the baseline corrected concentration-time profile. A minimum of 3 data points was used for determination.
Terminal half-life was estimated for baseline corrected FSH in serum by noncompartmental methods using actual elapsed time from dosing. Baseline corrected concentrations were determined by subtracting the baseline concentration (collected immediately prior to dosing in that period) from the postdose concentration.

      <pre_assignment_details>Screening was conducted at more than 1 visit to the clinical unit during study days -28 to -1 to allow completion of all assessments. Only subjects taking oral contraception for at least 3 months could enter the study.

          <description>On study day -1 (10 days after administration of LupronDepot®) subjects were assessed for eligibility of treatment by confirmation of down regulation of endogenous FSH levels. If down regulation was not confirmed the evaluation may have been repeated up to 7 days later.
Period 1: On study day 1, eligible subjects received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of the first FSH preparation, 225 International Units (IU) AFOLIA, in the abdomen. On study day 16, subjects received a second LupronDepot® intramuscular (i.m.) injection.
Period 2: On study day 26, subjects underwent a further FSH down regulation assessment. This evaluation was repeated up to 7 days later if required and if down regulation was not confirmed after the second evaluation, the subject was no longer able to continue in the study. If eligibility was confirmed, the subject received the alternative FSH preparation, 225 IU Gonal-f® RFF, on study day 27. Exit examinations were performed on study day 35.</description>

          <description>On study day -1 (10 days after administration of LupronDepot®) subjects were assessed for eligibility of treatment by confirmation of down regulation of endogenous FSH levels. If down regulation was not confirmed the evaluation may have been repeated up to 7 days later.
Period 1: On study day 1, eligible subjects received a single s.c. dose of the first FSH preparation, 225 International Units (IU) AFOLIA, in the abdomen. On study day 16, subjects received a second LupronDepot® i.m. injection.
Period 2: On study day 26, subjects underwent a further FSH down regulation assessment. This evaluation was repeated up to 7 days later if required and if down regulation was not confirmed after the second evaluation, the subject was no longer able to continue in the study. If eligibility was confirmed, the subject received the alternative FSH preparation, 225 IU Gonal-f® RFF on study day 27.
Exit examinations were performed on study day 35.</description>

        <title>Baseline Corrected FSH Apparent Terminal Half-life</title>
        <description>Apparent terminal half-life was defined as ln2/apparent terminal rate constant (λz). λz is determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the log-linear concentration-time curve. Visual assessment was used to identify the terminal linear phase of the baseline corrected concentration-time profile. A minimum of 3 data points was used for determination.
Terminal half-life was estimated for baseline corrected FSH in serum by noncompartmental methods using actual elapsed time from dosing. Baseline corrected concentrations were determined by subtracting the baseline concentration (collected immediately prior to dosing in that period) from the postdose concentration.

        <description>Tmax was estimated for baseline corrected E2 in serum by noncompartmental methods using actual elapsed time from dosing. Baseline corrected concentrations were determined by subtracting the baseline concentration (collected immediately prior to dosing in that period) from the postdose concentration.
Geometric mean was not calculated for Tmax and the non-transformed results are presented are for all subjects who received active study drug and had Tmax estimated in both periods.</description>
