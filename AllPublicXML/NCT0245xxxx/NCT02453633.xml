    <textblock>
      The project will be done at the ear, nose and throat outpatient department at Lovisenberg
      Diakonale Hospital (LDS) in 2015-2016. About 12% of patients with appointments at the
      surgical outpatient clinic at LDS do not attend their appointment even after receiving both
      letters and shot message service (SMS) reminders. Persuasion theory suggests that the SMS
      reminders may be more effective if the text appeals more to the patient's feelings. The
      project is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which the control group receives the
      standard text that has neutral content and the intervention group receives a more
      emotion-based SMS reminder. The aim is to determine whether the more emotional text reduces
      the proportion of patients who do not show up for their scheduled appointment at the surgical
      outpatient clinic.

      Studies from Norway's Health South East (HSØ) show that the number of patients who do not
      attend their scheduled appointments account for 200 000 to 250 000 outpatient consultations
      each year. For comparison, there are 270,000 patients waiting for treatment. It has thus been
      recommended that regional health authorities take measures to reduce the number of patients
      who do not attend their scheduled appointment.

      This study will evaluate whether short message service (SMS) appointment reminders that
      appeal to the patient's emotions are more effective for reducing non-attendance to scheduled
      outpatient appointments at the ear, nose, and throat outpatient clinic at Lovisenberg
      Diakonale Hospital in Oslo, Norway. The study will be designed as randomized controlled trial
      in which 2000 patients are randomly assigned to either the intervention group (emotional SMS
      text) or the control group (standard SMS text with neutral content). Because theory suggests
      that emotion-based text messages will be more effective reminders, it is hypothesized that
      they will result in a 50% reduction in the number of patients who do not show for their
      appointment compared to the control group.
