    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, single institution, prospective clinical study. The purpose of this
      study is to assess whether the Jawbone Up 24, a consumer based accelerometer, can be a
      feasible tool to study physical activity in cancer patients and patients with Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; = 18 years of age.

          -  Patient must be able to ambulate and complete the 6 minute walk test without use of a
             walker, cane, or any assist devices.

          -  Cancer patients or ALS patients who meet the following criteria:

        Prostate cancer:

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer.

          -  Patients who are initiating any chemotherarpy (examples are docetaxel, cabazitaxel,
             etc.) and/or hormone directed treatment for prostate cancer. Examples of hormone
             directed therapy include GnRH agonist or antagonists (such as leuprolide, goserelin,
             triptorelin, histrelin and degarelix), androgen receptor blockers (such as
             bicalutamide or enzalutamide), or androgen biosynthesis inhibitors (such as
             abiraterone).

        Renal cancer:

          -  Histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

          -  Metastatic disease, in the opinion of the treating provider.

          -  Starting any systemic therapy for metastatic disease

        Brain cancer:

          -  Histologically confirmed high grade glioma.

          -  Status post concurrent radiation therapy and daily temozolomide.

          -  Starting adjuvant temozolomide therapy.

        ALS patients who are:

          -  Already on a stable dose of Riluzole for at least one month.

          -  ALSFRS-R with &lt;or equal to 2 point decline in last month.

          -  Must have ALSFRS-R walking score of at least 3 or 4 and FVC at least 50% (to ensure
             patients are fit enough for ambulation and physical activity).

             - Technology requirement:

          -  Patients will need to own a smart phone that can interface with the Jawbone Up 24.

          -  Patients willing to provide their own internet access for this study. This will
             include either a data plan or Wi-Fi access on the patient's smart phone for use of the
             Jawbone App. They will also need internet access (through their smart phone or home
             computer) for setting up a SGHIx account. Patients are welcome to use the free guest
             Wi-Fi access within the Duke Outpatient clinic area for the purpose of this study.

          -  Patients will need a home computer or adaptor with USB port to charge the Jawbone Up
             24.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-English Speaking or inability to read and understand English

          -  Presence of cardiovascular disease that would make physical activity risky at the
             discretion of the provider.

          -  Any patient who is unable to comprehend and operate the activity tracker at the
             discretion of the enrolling provider.
