      This is a pilot study of sunitinib in patients with RET fusion positive or FGFR2
      Amplification Refractory solid tumors.

      This study is a single-arm, pilot study of sunitinib in subjects with Refractory solid tumors
      harboring RET fusion positive or FGFR2 Amplification sunitinib 50mg will be administered
      orally once a day 42 days.Study treatment will be continued until objective disease
      progression.

      To investigate the efficacy of sunitinib in subjects with Refractory solid tumors harboring
      RET fusion positive or FGFR2 Amplification.
