  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled gilteritinib, in
      particular, the routes of excretion and extent of metabolism of gilteritinib following
      administration of a single dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib after repeated doses of
      gilteritinib.

      This study will also evaluate the safety of repeated oral administration of gilteritinib in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors as well as identify the metabolic profile of gilteritinib
      in plasma, urine and feces after a single oral dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib.

      Participants will be admitted for evaluation to the clinical research unit on day 14 for
      potentially up to 14 days (day 29). At approximately days 36 and 45 participants will return
      to the clinic (for 3 days) for additional sample collection.
