    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial that aims to investigate the effect of therapeutic
      listening anxiety and preoperative fear of patients hospitalized for surgical treatment of
      colorectal cancer. Physiological variables will be evaluated (heart rate, blood pressure and
      respiratory rate), cortisol and salivary amylase and anxiety scores by State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory and fear for Surgery Fear Questionnaire. The data of the variables will be compared
      at two different times (before and after the intervention).

      To calculate the sample size was chosen when using numerical scale IDATE. Considering that
      you want to detect a difference of 10 points (δ) in the range with a significance level of 5%
      (Z1-α = 1.96), a power of 80% (Z1-β = 1.96). The result obtained was 25 subjects for each
      group. Information related to variances of control and intervention groups were obtained
      through the pilot study and a correlation of 0.5 was assumed.
