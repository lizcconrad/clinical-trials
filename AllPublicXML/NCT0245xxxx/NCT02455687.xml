  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have worked on the efficacy and safety of Intravenous magnesium sulfate and
      inhaled steroids beside the standard treatment for patients with severe asthma attacks.

      Investigators hypothesize that, two doses if intravenous magnesium sulfate with or without
      inhaled budesonide, would make the stay at the Pediatric emergency center (PEC) lesser,and
      decrease the need of being admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for children with
      severe asthma attacks,compared to single dose of magnesium sulfate with or without inhaled
      budesonide.

      Patient with severe asthma attack, will be admitted to observation area in PEC and assessed
      for eligibility to the study by attending physician based on our study inclusion criteria.

      Eligible patient will be enrolled after obtaining written consent. Patient will receive
      routine treatment for severe asthma attack like,inhaled bronchodilators plus intravenous
      steroids,and oxygen supplements if needed. Standard blood work and chest XRay test will be
      obtained ,and bronchial asthma severity score will be measured initially before starting
      treatment then at 4,8,12,24,36,48 and thereafter. The medical team as well as parents and
      patient will be blinded to the medications delivered. Patient will be randomized into one of
      the four study groups and adverse effects of the medications in each group will be monitored
      and documented carefully.
