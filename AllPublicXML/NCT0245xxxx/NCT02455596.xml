      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-tumor
      and anti-virus protein for injection in treating patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors
      who have failed standard treatment or are unable to receive standard treatment.

      This is a Phase Ⅱ exploratory clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection in
      treating patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors who have failed standard treatment or
      are unable to receive standard treatment.

      Recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for injection, 10μg,im,3 times for the first
      week, followed by 20μg for two weeks, and followed a maintenance dose of 30μg, the frequency
      of administration is three times per week. Treatment continued until the patient died or had
      unacceptable toxicity or had disease progression or required to discontinue the treatment. At
      the time of disease progression, if investigators believe patients can continue to benefit
      from the investigational product, patients may be provided with recombinant anti-tumor and
      anti-virus protein for injection,but only survival follow-up datas will be recorded.
