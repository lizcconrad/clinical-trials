      Barriers to healthy eating and active living are at the heart of the obesity epidemic. This
      study focuses on a key factor underlying healthy eating: home food preparation. This study
      aims to test the effectiveness of a community-based, peer-mentored intervention to improve
      home food preparation practices in families with young children. The investigators will
      partner with community-based organizations serving families with children ages 1 to 3 years
      in West Philadelphia aiming specifically to:

        1. Test the intervention's effect on diet and physical health.

           Hypothesis 1: The intervention group will have improved home food preparation practices
           and a healthier diet compared to the control group.

        2. Test the intervention's effect on family health.

           Hypothesis 2: The intervention group will report improved parenting skills and more
           hopeful patterns of thinking.

        3. Identify factors present at baseline and during engagement with the intervention that
           distinguish intervention participants who have improved diet, physical health, and
           family health from those who do not.
