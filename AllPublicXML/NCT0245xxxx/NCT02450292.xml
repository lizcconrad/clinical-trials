        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18-50

          -  Patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction performed by one of the study
             investigators at least 5 years ago

          -  Isolated ACL tear

          -  Type of graft used was bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft

          -  Type of screw used to attach graft to the tibia and/or femur was a BioComposite
             interference screws (Arthrex, Inc.)

          -  No degenerative joint disease on preoperative X-rays (&gt; 50% joint space loss, presence

          -  ACL tear with concomitant pathology

          -  Degenerative joint disease on preoperative X-ray (&gt; 50% joint space loss, presence of
             osteophytes)

          -  Metal or other types of bioabsorbable screws other than BioComposite interference
             screws (Arthrex, Inc.) were used
