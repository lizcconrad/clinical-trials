  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amygdala Retraining Treatment (ART) is a new and promising therapy for patients with Chronic
      Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM), however, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are
      scarce. The investigators have added mindfulness to this therapy, based on preliminary
      reports of its efficacy on patients, obtaining Amygdala Retraining Treatment with Mindfulness
      (ART+MF).

      Other therapy that has been assessed in many psychiatric and medical disorders during the
      last years has been Compassion Therapy (CT). There are no studies on its efficacy in FM.

      Aims: The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of both ART+MF and CT on the general
      function of the patients with FM. A secondary objective is to assess the effect of these
      therapies on psychological (pain, depression, anxiety, etc.) and biological variables (some
      biomarkers related with inflammation).

      Methods:

        -  Design: Randomized, controlled trial with three arms: a) ART+MF, b) CT and c) Relaxation
           as control intervention.

        -  Sample: A sample (N=60 patients, about N=20 for each arm) will be recruited from primary
           care settings at the city of Zaragoza, Spain.
