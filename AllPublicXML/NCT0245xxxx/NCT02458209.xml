      This is an open label, single dose, randomized, parallel group study in healthy adult
      subjects to assess the comparability of bococizumab administered in a prefilled syringe vs.
      prefilled pen and comparability between drug substance manufactured at Pfizer Andover vs.
      Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma.
