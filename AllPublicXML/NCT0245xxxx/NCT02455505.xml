  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a screening tool to help identify family members who
      may need professional emotional support. The investigators are interested in enrolling family
      members of patients with advanced cancer care as well as family members who have lost a loved
      one to cancer. Some screening tools to identify family members who might need support do
      exist, but the investigators are hoping to develop one that is brief and easier for
      healthcare providers to use. The information learned in this study will help us refine the
      screening tool. The investigators are interviewing family members to identify which questions
      or items work well, which seem unclear, and to understand how a family member might approach
      completing the screening tool. Family member input will be essential in the development of
      this screening tool.
