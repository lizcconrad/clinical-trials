  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the present study is to investigate the neuronal correlates of self and of personal
      meaning as well as the role of the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor system in these processes
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychometric and cognitive measures.

      The present study aims at identifying the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor system to the
      formation of self and personal meaning in normal and altered states of consciousness.
      Specifically, the effect of the 5-HT2/1/6/7 receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
      on self-consciousness, perception and the making of meaning will be assessed in 25 healthy
      subjects using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over design.
      Furthermore, the contribution of the 5-HT2A receptor to these functions shall be assessed by
      pretreatment with the specific 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin.
