      tDCS can modify the attentional response of patients with fibromyalgia. Methods: This study
      deals with a randomized, blind, crossover, controlled tDCS-sham. The sample will consist of
      40 patients, divided into two groups with sham interventions and active crossover.

      Check that the tDCS can modify the attentional response of patients with fibromyalgia.
      Methods: This study deals with a randomized, blind, crossover, controlled tDCS-sham. The
      sample will consist of 40 patients, divided into two groups with sham interventions and
      active crossover. Patients answer the questionnaires in order to verify the Psychological
      Factors and Clinical. Will use the Impact of Fibromyalgia (QIF), Pittsburgh Sleep
      Questionnaire, Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), Beck Depression Scale II, Catastrophic
      Scale , Go noGo Test, Attention Network Task (ANT) to verify the ability attentional as well
      as to verify the Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain oxygenation. They will be used
      before, during and after the intervention with tDCS. Intervention with tDCS or sham will be
      held in a single session. Expected results: It is expected that fibromyalgia patients
      undergoing tDCS present, after the intervention, improved attention capacity .

    <description>The intervention session with tDCS lasts for 20 minutes. tDCS uses rubber electrodes that are within sponges that are moistened with saline. These electrodes are placed on the participant's head. Through these electrodes will pass a weak electrical current that can at most cause mild itching at the site where the electrode is positioned. The generated electric current is equivalent to a small common battery that we use to run toys or radios. The procedure does not require that the patient be subjected to shocks, cuts or surgery.
The participant will receive active tDCS or placebo, but receive both types of intervention during the performance of the two sessions.</description>
