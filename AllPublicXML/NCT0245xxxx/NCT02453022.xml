  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will help to increase our understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      danirixin. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the relative bioavailability of
      danirixin Hydrobromide (HBr) tablet, when compared to danirixin free base (FB). Safety and
      tolerability information for oral administration of danrixin HBr tablets in elderly subjects
      will also be obtained. Secondarily, this study will evaluate effect of food on PK of
      danirixin HBr, effect of gastric acid suppression, and within-subject PK variability of
      danirixin HBr. The outcome of this study will contribute to the selection of the most
      appropriate formulation/dosing regimen for future studies.

      This is an open-label, 5-period crossover study. Study will be conducted in 18 healthy
      elderly subjects. Screening will occur within 42 days prior to Day 1 of period 1. The
      Treatment Periods will be separated by a washout period of a minimum 5 days. Follow-up will
      be done within 3 to 10 days post last dose.

             of study medication until a cycle of spermatogenesis following five terminal half-
             lives after the last dose of study medication. a. Vasectomy with documentation of
             azoospermia. b. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options:
             Contraceptive subdermal implant, Intrauterine device or intrauterine system, Oral

        highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and
        correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product
        methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct
        use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the International Conference
        on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human
        Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to
        properly use these methods of contraception.

        therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
        highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior
        to study enrolment.
