  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase III, open-label, randomized, multicenter study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of adjuvant treatment with atezolizumab compared with observation in participants with
      muscle-invasive UC who are at high risk for recurrence following resection. Eligible
      participants will be randomized by a 1:1 ratio into atezolizumab group or control group.
