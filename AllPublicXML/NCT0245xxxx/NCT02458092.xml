        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • A male or non-lactating female 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive) at the time of

               -  Free of significant health problems as established by medical history and
                  clinical examination before entering into the study

               -  Available to participate for duration of study (approximately seven months)

        If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential (either surgically

        negative pregnancy test at the time of vaccination, be capable of preventing pregnancy for
        at least one month prior to determination of eligibility (to include abstinence or

        Norplant® or Depo-Provera® ), and must agree to continue such precautions for two months
        after completion of the vaccination series.

        Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject before screening procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Prior receipt of any investigational malaria vaccine

               -  Prior receipt of a vaccine containing either QS-21, MPL or AS02A or AS01B

               -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study

                  during the study period

               -  Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressants or
                  other immune modifying drugs within six months of vaccination. For
                  corticosteroids, this is defined as prednisone, or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day.
                  Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

               -  Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30
                  days of the first dose of the study vaccine.

               -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition,

                    -  Total white cell count below normal

               -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment (acute disease is defined as the presence
                  of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). All vaccines can be
                  administered to persons with a minor illness, such as diarrhea or mild upper
                  respiratory infection without fever, i.e. Oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C.

               -  Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness
