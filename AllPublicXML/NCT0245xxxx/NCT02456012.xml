      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a long-term prophylactic use of
      esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily or once daily has prevention effectiveness in reducing the
      recurrence of peptic ulcer bleeding after ulcer healed with 16-week oral esomeprazole therapy
      in high-risk patients whose Rockall score ≥ 6.

      This study is conducted at the inpatient wards of National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a
      tertiary health care center in Tainan, Taiwan. All participants give written informed consent
      before enrollment. Each enrolled patient receives an 80 mg loading dose of intravenous
      esomeprazole (Nexium®, AstraZeneca AB, Södertälje, Sweden) immediately after achieving
      haemostasis by gastroscopy. Patients then receive a 3-day continuous high-dose (8 mg/h)
      esomeprazole infusion and then receive 40 mg oral esomeprazole twice daily for 11 days and
      once daily for following 98 days. The total duration of intravenous and oral esomeprazole is
      16 weeks. After gastroscopy to confirm enrollment eligibility and ulcer healed, all patients
      are assessed using the Rockall risk scoring system at the primary endoscopy. Patients with
      Rockall scores ≥ 6 are randomized into the double-dose (D) group or the single-dose (S) group
      following simple randomization procedures with a 1:1 allocation ratio according to the result
      by the investigator who draw an envelope from a large box of sealed envelopes each containing
      a written code designating the D group or the S group. Patients in the D group and S groups
      receive 20 mg oral esomeprazole twice daily or once daily for 36 weeks, respectively. The
      cohort control group includes patients from a previous study who had peptic ulcer bleeding
      and Rockall scores ≥ 6 but who did not receive esomeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors
      after 16-week proton pump inhibitor treatment.

      One investigator generates the random allocation sequence and enrolls the participants and a
      different investigator assigns participants to interventions. The endoscopists and staff who
      check hemoglobin levels, hemodynamic status, melena, hematochezia or the aspirates through a
      nasogastric tube are blinded to the study group allocation. All enrolled patients are
      included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, but patients who are lost to follow-up,
      discontinued intervention because of adverse events, have a protocol violation or die are
      excluded from the per-protocol (PP) analysis of the primary endpoint.

      The range of co-morbidities evaluated by the Rockall scores include disseminated malignant
      diseases, liver disease (liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh A, B, or C), renal disease (end-stage
      renal disease, chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury with estimated glomerular
      filtration rates &lt;30 ml/min [a score of 3 for co-morbidity], or between 30 ml/min and 60
      ml/min [a score of 2 for co-morbidity]), heart disease (congestive heart failure, New York
      Heart Association Function I to IV or coronary artery disease). Other serious co-morbidities
      include lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary tuberculosis,
      pneumonia or empyema), rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, new onset cerebrovascular accident or
      recent history of any major surgery (on the thorax, abdomen, central nervous system, long
      bones or spinal bones) requiring general anesthesia within 14 days before bleeding.

      The estimated rebleeding rate within 12 months in the cohort control group is about 13.4%
      based on the previous study. We want to be able to detect a difference between the cohort
      control group and the D group, in which the rebleeding rate is proposed to be 2.5%, equal to
      patients with H. pylori ulcers after eradication. With a two-side α value of 0.05 and power
      of 80% (β=0.20), the total number of patients required in each group is 96. We use a nominal
      0.05 rate of the p value. Data related to baseline characteristics and end points are
      evaluated using the Student t test, Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test. In the survival analysis, the log-rank test is used to compare the
      Kaplan-Meier curves among the three study groups. All tests are two-tailed and p values of
      less than 0.05 indicate significant differences.

    <description>The recurrent bleeding is deﬁned as 1) recurrent melena, haematochezia, the presence of bloody aspirates through a nasogastric tube and 2) relapse of haemodynamic instability, including systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg, heart rate &gt;120 bpm or a drop in haemoglobin concentration of &gt;2 g/dL, or sudden increase in transfusion requirements. For each patient with either suspected or active rebleeding, the hemoglobin level and gastroscopy are performed to confirm any blood or coffee-ground-like materials in the stomach, or the persistence of stigmata indicating recent haemorrhage. The gastroscopy also determines whether the source of rebleeding was a peptic ulcer or some other non-ulcer bleeding source, such as varices.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants included patients ≥20 years who had undergone gastroscopy for
             melena, haematochezia, or haematemesis due to bleeding peptic ulcers with major
             stigmata of recent hemorrhage. The major stigmata of recent haemorrhage were
             classified as Forrest class Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb. All of the stigmata are given one or
             a combination of endoscopic therapies, including local injection of diluted
             epinephrine 1:10000, bipolar heated probe, argon plasma coagulation, band ligation, or
             hemoclip therapy. Patients will undergo a follow-up endoscopy about 12 to 16 weeks
             later to confirm that the ulcer has healed to be less than 0.5 cm; otherwise, patients
             are not enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are excluded if they had tumor bleeding or ulcer bleeding due to the presence
             of a Dieulafoy lesion or mechanical factors (e.g, gastrostomy tube induction),
             comorbid with reflux esophagitis grade C or D, Barrett's esophagus, or marginal ulcer
             bleeding, hypersensitivity to esomeprazole or any component of the formulation, or had
             previously participated in the study. Because of concern for patient safety with
             certain drug-drug interactions, patients who receive anti-platelet therapy, e.g.,
             aspirin, clopidogrel, or others for prophylaxis of established cardiovascular or
             cerebrovascular diseases will be excluded.
