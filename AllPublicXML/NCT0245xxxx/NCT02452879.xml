      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electroacupuncture is effective in the
      treatment of overactive bladder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient registry: Participants experiencing overactive bladder will be recruited from
      hospital outpatients and clinic-community. the diagnosis was made by the urologists. the
      random number table was generated by the Computer.

      Sample size: According to the preliminary experiment combined the literature. Sample size is
      based on the primary outcome. The first step: one-tailed test: the electroacupuncture group
      vs Solifenacin group is 79.5% VS 54.8%( α=0.05, β=0.20, n=51). The second step: two-tailed
      test :the electroacupuncture group vs Placebo group is 54.5% VS 20.9%,(α=0.05, β=0.20, n=37).
      To combine the first and second step, 51 cases in each group are needed. Allowing for a 10%
      dropout, 57 cases in each group are needed. So we set the sample size is 60.

      Quality control

        1. Strict training on staff participating in the trial.

        2. Rigorous control of the process of randomization.

        3. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        4. Strict outcome assessors and statisticians.

        5. The standard of the drugs, acupuncture apparatus, inspection equipment are consistant.

        6. Outcome assessment, completion of case report forms and data management will be under
           strict supervision.

    <measure>Change from baseline in mean frequency of micturitions per 24 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8 weeks in treatment, 12th and 24th weeks of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily micturition frequency = Sum of 3-day micturition frequency in a week/3 . The investigator gets the frequency of mictuitions by micturition diary.Mean daily micturition frequency will be calculated based on the micturition diary at week 0(baseline), 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 32.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The response rate of improvement in symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks in treatment, The average response rate of improvement in global response during 8 weeks in treatment. The response rate in first 4 weeks in treatment, 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up will also be evaluated</time_frame>
    <description>GRA（Global response assessments）will be used to grade:
The overall response will be assessed by patient self-rating scale. There are seven levels which will be graded by patients based on their situation: significant deterioration, moderate deterioration, mild deterioration, no change, mild improvement, moderate improvement, significant improvement in symptoms (compared with their condition before treatment). The moderate and significant improvement will be defined as effective treatment while others will be defined as ineffective ones according to the patients' options. The response rate will be calculated separately.
Response rate= Effective number of patients in each group/ Total number of patients in each group×100%</description>

    <time_frame>Week 4th , 8th in treatment , 12nd and 24th of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>For therapeutic benefit scores, treatment will be regarded beneficial if scores are above (3). The patient-Rated global assessment of treatment benefit will be calculated according to scores of patients in each group.
For treatment satisfaction scores, scores above (3) will be recorded as satisfaction. Treatment satisfaction scores will be calculated based on scores of patients in each group.
The willing to continue the treatment scores, scores above (3) will be recorded as willing to continue the treatment scores, the scores will be calculated based on the scores of patients in each group.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks, 8 weeks in treatment, 12nd and 24th weeks of follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>mean degree of daily urgency micturition will be captured at week 0(baseline), 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 32 based on the micturition diary.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0(baseline), 4, 8, 12 and 24 of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Daily mean incidence of urgency micturition and leakage of urine will be calculated. Urgency incontinence, stress incontinence and unconscious leakage of urine will be included.
Incidence of urgency micturition (%):the frequency of urgency micturition in a week based on three day urine diary/ three days' total times of urination in ×100% Incidence of leakage of urine (%): the frequency of leakage of urine in a week based on three day bladder diary/ three days' total times of urination ×100%</description>

    <description>The patients will be asked to write the questionnaires which have a total of 33 questions. The degree of which the patients suffer from overactive bladder including urgency micturition, pollakiuria , nocturia, urge incontinence will be assessed by the first 8 questions. 1-6 points will be given for each question and all the points will be added and converted to 0-100 points which suggest higher severity with higher scores. The effect of symptoms on life will be assessed by the rest questions which will be divided to disease problems, sociality, mood, sleeping. The points of each part which includes 2-5 questions will be added separately as subscale scores. All of them will be added and converted to 0-100 points which will be the score for quality of life representing better quality with higher points.</description>
