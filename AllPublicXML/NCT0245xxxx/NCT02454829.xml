    <textblock>
      Evaluation of ovarian function by a questionnaire and by medical file analysis of women and
      girls who underwent ovarian cortex cryopreservation for fertility preservation between 1997
      an 2013 in the investigators' institution in order to evaluate their residual ovarian
      function. A second part of the questionnaire concerns these women's satisfaction regarding
      the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1997 and december 2013, 546 girls and women underwent ovarian cortex cryopreservation
      in the investigators' institution for fertility preservation. The main indications were the
      need for a gonadotoxic treatment, repeated ovarian surgery and a genetic risk for premature
      ovarian failure . These women will be sent a questionnaire concerning their ovarian function
      since the procedure and a questionnaire about their satisfaction concerning the procedure.
      Six different questionnaires will be used adapted to the patient's initial indication for
      cryopreservation and the patient's age at the time of cryopreservation. Complementary data
      will be obtained by medical file analysis and by contacting the patient's family doctor or
      gynecologist.

      Data will be correlated with received gonadotoxic treatment and surgical interventions.

      The purpose of the study is to improve the indications and patient selection for ovarian
      cortex cryopreservation.

    <description>A questionnaire will be send concerning the patient's ovarian function since the cryopreservation procedure i.e: progression of puberty, menstrual cycle, hormonal treatment, desire for pregnancy, occurence of pregnancy, details of pregnancy, need for ART (Artificial Reproductive Techniques), and about the patient's satisfaction concerning the cryopreservation procedure. Data collected will be correlated with treatments received.</description>
