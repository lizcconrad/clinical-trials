  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A collimator is an accessory to a SPECT/CT scanner. It can be compared to a camera lens or
      filter that enhances or improves photos. The prototype collimators are able to magnify target
      organs about four times compared to the current collimators. In this study we are validating
      a new collimator design, which will allow for quantitative measurement of dopamine receptors
      within the brain, not previously performed using a single photon gamma camera.

    <textblock>
      Previously PET/CT has been used for this measurement but the L-DOPA is not FDA approved and
      thus of limited availability. DatScan (I123 ioflupane) is an FDA approved and clinically
      indicated biomarker, which has a high binding affinity for presynaptic dopamine transporters
      (DAT) in the brains of mammals, in particular the striatal region of the brain. A feature of
      Parkinson's disease is a marked reduction in dopaminergic neurons in the striatal region. By
      introducing an agent that binds to the dopamine transporters a quantitative measure and
      spatial distribution of the transporters can be obtained. The use of SPECT/CT (with the new
      validated collimators) and the FDA approved DATScan biomarker would allow for readily
      available diagnosis of Parkinson's disease

    <description>In DATScan SPECT scans, the UHRSZ collimator will be exchanged for the standard collimator following completion of the clinically ordered scan. A scanning sequence will be repeated with the prototype collimator in place. Images from the two scanning sequences will be compared.</description>
