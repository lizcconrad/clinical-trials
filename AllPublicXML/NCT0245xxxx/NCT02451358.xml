  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to generate immunogenicity and safety data in the whole population
      to support registration of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) in India:

      Primary objective:

        -  To describe in each age group the immune response induced by a single injection
           (participants aged &gt;9 years) or 2 injections (participants aged 6 months to 8 years) of
           QIV.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To describe in each age group the safety profile of QIV.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants were vaccinated with the QIV (split-virion, inactivated) Northern Hemisphere
      (NH) or Southern Hemisphere (SH) formulations by the intramuscular (IM) route. Immunogenicity
      of the vaccine was assessed at baseline (Day 0) and 28 days after the last injection. Safety
      data were collected up to 28 days after each injection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were
      collected throughout the trial.

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AE) data were collected from Day 0 (post-vaccination) up to 28 days after the final vaccination (up to Day 56 for Group 1 and 2; Day 28 for Group 3 and 4)</time_frame>
      <desc>A solicited reaction is an AE that is prelisted in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and considered to be related to vaccination. A solicited reaction is therefore an adverse drug reaction (ADR) observed and reported under the conditions (nature and time to onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the eCRF. An unsolicited AE is an observed AE that does not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the eCRF in terms of symptom and/or time to onset post-vaccination.</desc>
