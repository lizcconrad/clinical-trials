      Assessment of refraction measurements in children under general anesthesia, with or without

    <textblock>
      Comparing to adults, children have high ability to preform accommodation of the intraocular
      lens, that is due to the Ciliary muscle. In order to measure children's refraction in an
      accurate way the Ciliary muscle must be paralyzed and that is usually done be cycloplegic
      eye-drops .In case a child is undergoing a medical procedure under general anesthesia the
      assumption that the Ciliary muscle is paralyzed (complete or partially) due to anesthetic
      medications. In this study we would like to compare the refraction measurements in children
      under who undergo general anesthesia before and after applying cycloplegic eye-drops. In this
      way we can learn about the effect of anesthetic medication on the Ciliary muscle.
