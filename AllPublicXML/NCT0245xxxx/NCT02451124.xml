      This pilot clinical trial studies non-endoscopic brushing of the esophagus using a
      non-endoscopic inflatable balloon for the esophagus in screening for Barrett esophagus, a
      condition where the lining of the esophagus has changed or been replaced with abnormal cells
      that may lead to cancer. The non-endoscopic inflatable balloon for the esophagus is a capsule
      balloon that brushes against the walls of the esophagus to collect esophageal samples.
      Non-endoscopic brushing of the esophagus using a non-endoscopic inflatable balloon for the
      esophagus may help doctors find Barrett esophagus sooner, when it may be easier to treat.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine acceptability of non-endoscopic balloon brushing of esophagus.

      II. To demonstrate successful performance of the methylation of vimentin (mVIM) assay in
      balloon brushings from subjects with and without Barrett's Esophagus (BE).

      III. To examine molecular and histological factors that might lead to false negative and
      false positive mVIM assays in BE screening.

      IV. To assay additional methylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biomarkers that might improve
      the sensitivity and specificity of mVIM in balloon brushings.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo non-endoscopic brushing of the esophagus using a non-endoscopic inflatable
      balloon for the esophagus over 30-60 minutes followed by a standard
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

      After completion of study, patients with serious adverse events are followed up until
      resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or
      participation is not the cause.

    <description>Patient endoscopic and pathologic findings relating to the diagnosis of BE will be compared with mVIM analyses of corresponding esophageal balloon derived samples. The presence of at least 1% of methylated VIM in DNA extracted from the esophageal sampling balloon will be considered a positive assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the balloon mVIM assay for detecting BE will be calculated. Non-endoscopic inflatable balloon for the esophagus mVIM assays will be correlated with endoscopic brushing mVIM assays by calculating a Pearson's correlation coefficient.</description>

    <description>Any differences in histo-morphology between BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma that are mVIM negative and mVIM positive on brushings will be explored.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average methylation of methylated beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 2 assays</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be determined if any of the new biomarkers increase the sensitivity and specificity for BE screening when combined with mVIM. An independent analysis will then be performed where an independent panel of biomarkers for BE screening will be modeled. Using a receiver operating characteristics analysis, biomarkers will be ranked based on the highest area under the curve values. A rank list will also be determined with respect to the overall prevalence of significant methylation in primary BE cases, and the absence of DNA methylation in normal cases.</description>
