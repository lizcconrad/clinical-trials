    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endometrial biopsies (EB) will be taken as follows, a.During the follicular phase (between Day 9 and Day 12) of the baseline/control cycle, b. At the end of the 14th week of treatment (14 days after the 12 week LNG administration and end of CVR use), c. During the follicular phase (between Day 9 and Day 12 of the second menstrual cycle after ring removal). Also, endometrial changes will be measured by histological examination, immunohistochemistry, and assessment of proliferation markers (Ki67, Phospho H3 and bcl2).</description>
