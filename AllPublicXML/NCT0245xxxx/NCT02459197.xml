        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are men or women of at least 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (PNP) or knee or hip pain attributed to
             Osteoarthritis (OA) since at least 6 months

          -  Affiliated with national welfare

          -  Reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and
             are willing to follow study procedures

          -  Have given written informed consent approved by the relevant Ethics Committee (EC)
             governing the study sites

          -  Patients will be required to report pain with a score between 4 and 8 inclusive on the
             mean Average Pain Score (APS) during the baseline period preceding randomization and
             to have completed at least 10 days of pain assessments in their diary between Visit 1
             and Visit 2. If more than 10 days were completed, the mean APS will be calculated on
             the last 10 ones.

        Inclusion Disease Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis criterium for PNP: Patient with chronic PNP supported by a distinct
             neuroanatomical plausible distribution with sensory signs and symptoms, and
             consecutive to one of the following causes: a traumatic event, a surgical procedure
             (excluding limb amputation), radiculopathy, post- herpetic or post- zoster neuralgia,
             diabetic polyneuropathy or post chemotherapy. Diagnosis will have to be confirmed by
             the DN4 questionnaire at the screening visit (pain is considered as neuropathic if DN4
             score â‰¥ 4)

          -  Diagnosis criterium for OA: Patient with a unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee or
             hip diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria based
             on clinical and radiographic evidence (Altman et al. 1986). The clinical diagnosis of
             OA will be confirmed by the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification
             of idiopathic OA of the knee or hip based upon the following criteria:

               1. Knee or hip pain as an average at least half of the time for the last 3 months
                  before screening visit

               2. At least 1 of the following 3 conditions: Age &gt; 50 or morning stiffness &lt; 30
                  minutes or crepitus

               3. Kellgren and Lawrence grade &gt; 1 as assessed if possible by an X-ray of the
                  referred joint to confirm the diagnosis. If considered medically required by the
                  Investigator based on patient needs and as part of regular patient management, a
                  new anterior-posterior view X- ray should be obtained and reviewed by
                  Investigator or his delegates to verify that the patient meets the disease
                  diagnostic criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient changed his/her &quot; regular analgesic therapy &quot; for PNP or OA in the last 4
             weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the study.

          -  Patient's regular analgesic treatment for PNP or OA consists of more than 2 different
             treatments, with neurostimulation being considered as an analgesic treatment for PNP.

          -  Patient reported unvariable APS and WPS scores between Visit 1 and Visit 2
             (systematically the same APS score and the same WPS score reported).

          -  Use or plan to use non-topical corticosteroids during the study.

          -  Have initiated (or plan to initiate) a program (or modify an existing program in
             frequency and/or intensity) of physiotherapy or behavioral therapy such as pain
             self-management, hypnosis, sophrology, meditation program within 2 weeks prior to
             Visit 1 or during the study.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or willing to be pregnant within 3 months.

          -  Patients with a current or recent history, as determined by the Investigator, of
             severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or cerebral disease
             which would interfere with the patient's participation in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled epilepsy.

          -  Any current primary psychiatric condition, including depression or personality
             disorders (such as Axe II of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
             (DSM-IV); personality disorders and mental retardation).

          -  Alcohol dependence or regular use of known drugs of abuse (e.g., amphetamines,
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opiates, and
             phencyclidine).

          -  Any other relevant medical disorder/acute disease state judged by the Investigator as
             likely to interfere with the trial or represent a risk for the patient.

          -  Any close relationship with the Investigators or the Sponsor (i.e. belonging to
             immediate family or subordination link).

          -  Patient under legal protection, according to the national law.

          -  Are persons who have previously received T4P1001, have completed or withdrawn from
             this study or any other study investigating T4P1001.

          -  Patient currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving use of an investigational
             drug or device, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged
             not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study, or in an exclusion
             period according to the national law.

        Exclusion Disease Criteria for PNP patients:

          -  Neuropathic pain due to trigeminal neuralgia, central pain or phantom limb pain.

             neurostimulation) therapy or modify an existing neurostimulation within 4 weeks prior
             to Visit 1 or during study period.

        Exclusion disease criteria for OA patients:

          -  Non-ambulatory due to OA.

          -  Use of lower extremity assistive devices other than a cane such as crutches or walker
             or a knee brace or a &quot;shoe lift&quot; in relation to OA.

          -  Have used in relation to OA systemic corticosteroids 4 weeks prior to Visit 1;
             Intra-muscular corticosteroid injections or Intra-articular injection of steroids into
             the referred knee/hip within 3 months before Visit 1, Intra-articular injection of
             corticosteroids into any other sites than the referred knee/hip within 4 weeks prior
             to Visit 1(corticosteroids in topical use are allowed).

          -  Have used viscosupplementation or intra articular injection of hyaluronic acid in the
             referred joint within 3 months prior to Visit 1.
