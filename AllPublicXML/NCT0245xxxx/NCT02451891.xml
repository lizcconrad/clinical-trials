    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered experimental Ebola
      vaccines. The investigators will vaccinate four groups of volunteers.

      Group one will receive the MVA-EBO Z vaccine once at the dose of 1 x 10^8 pfu.

      Three groups will receive the prime vaccine cAd3-EBO Z followed by the boost vaccine, MVA EBO
      Z. The second group of volunteers will receive the boost vaccine after 14 +/-7 days at a dose
      of 1 x 10^8 pfu and the third and fourth group, after 28 +/- 7 days but at different
      concentrations of MVA-EBO Z (1 x 10^8 pfu for group 3 and 1.5 x 10^8 pfu for group 4).

      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to
      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples.

      The cAd3-EBO Z and MVA-EBO Z vaccines are called viral vectored vaccines. They are made from
      viruses which are modified so that they cannot multiply. The viruses have extra DNA in them
      so that after injection, the body makes Ebola proteins (but Ebola does not develop), so that
      the immune system builds a response to Ebola without having been infected by it.

      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in Oxford and London England. The study will be funded
      by the Wellcome Trust.

      It is important to answer this question to understand how best to deploy the vaccine in an
      outbreak setting, and to give an indication as to whether booster vaccinations may need to be
      considered to maintain immunity.

      In light of this, the extension study has invited volunteers to attend some further optional
      follow up visits. It would involve obtaining some further blood tests to look for the same
      markers of vaccine induced immune response that were looked for in the first part of the
      trial.
