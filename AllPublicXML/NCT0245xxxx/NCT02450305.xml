  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to determine if patients that are already undergoing Hyperbaric
      Oxygen (HBO) therapy one year post treatment with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer,
      experience improvement in xerostomia and/or taste alteration. The investigators will enroll a
      similar demographic one year post treatment with radiation therapy that does not receive HBO
      therapy. This is a quality of life study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is a commonly utilized treatment modality for head and neck cancer
      patients. Xerostomia (i.e. dry mouth) (and taste change) are common and most significant side
      effects of this treatment. Xerostomia leads to several complications for patients including
      difficulty in chewing, speaking, swallowing, taste and smell abnormalities, oral infections
      and inflammation, osteoradionecrosis, dental caries and periodontal disease. These conditions
      tend to lead to an overall decreased quality of life for patients affected.

      A possible modality for the treatment of xerostomia is the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)
      therapy. HBO is the medical use of oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. It has
      been proposed that HBO results in accelerated blood vessel growth and repair in tissue
      injuries by increasing the oxygen partial pressure gradient (Bennett, 2005). Today, the use
      of HBO is widely accepted for both the treatment and prevention of radiation induced
      toxicities such as osteoradionecrosis and soft tissue necrosis.

      Here at Upstate University Hospital, the investigators treat approximately 20 patients each
      year with hyperbaric oxygen for either the prevention or management of radiation induced
      complications such as osteoradionecrosis and /or soft tissue necrosis. The investigators
      would like to use this group of patients to evaluate the effect of HBO in the improvement of
      radiation induced xerostomia (and or taste change). The investigators' data will be collected
      from patients with the use of periodic quality of life questionnaires at 5 timepoints, as
      well as data relating to the treatment each patient was given. .
