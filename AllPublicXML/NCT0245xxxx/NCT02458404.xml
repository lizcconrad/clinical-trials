  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help determine the effect of varied estradiol levels on the uterine lining in
      healthy humans that are not undergoing a stimulated in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle.

    <textblock>
      Volunteers who wish to participate in the study, will undergo a diagnostic and screening
      phase to determine their eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, participants will
      undergo three, separate &quot;endometrial preparatory cycles&quot;. These cycles will consist of
      estrogen supplementation to mimic normal, above normal, and highly elevated estradiol levels.
      Once supplementation is complete uterine procedures will be done to hopefully determine the
      effects of the estrogen levels on the uterine lining. Subcutaneous leuprolide injections,
      intramuscular estrogen, and progesterone injections will be used to mimic the levels needed.
      Blood draws will monitor the needed estradiol and progesterone levels during the injection
      phase of the cycle. Once the injection phase is complete, transvaginal ultrasound, uterine
      aspiration, and endometrial biopsy will be done.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endometrial thickness in millimeters as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle, ~30 days; this is followed by 1 rest mentrual cycle, ~30 days; there are a total of 3 rest and 3 treatment cycles, ~180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo 3 transvaginal ultrasounds. Endometrial thickness will be recorded.
Purpose: The serum hormone levels serve as the immunoassays while the endometrial lining serves as the bioassay. This will allow for baseline evaluation of the uterine lining and myometrium as well as monitor biological response to the estrogen and progesterone.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mRNA and protein expression of known markers of secretory transformation as assessed by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry after uterine aspiration and disruption/biops</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle, ~30 days; this is followed by 1 rest mentrual cycle, ~30 days; there are a total of 3 rest and 3 treatment cycles, ~180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a uterine aspiration and endometrial disruption/biopsy. These will be analyzed for known markers involved in human reproduction utilizing established molecular biological assessment tools. In particular markers which will be evaluated will be: LIF, CXCL13, beta 2 integrin, DAF, OPN, and IL15</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endometrial echotexture as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle, ~30 days; this is followed by 1 rest mentrual cycle, ~30 days; there are a total of 3 rest and 3 treatment cycles, ~180 days</time_frame>
    <description>a. Participants will undergo 3 transvaginal ultrasounds. Endometrial echotexture will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak and trough estrogen and progesterone levels as assessed by peripheral phlebotomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle, ~30 days; this is followed by 1 rest mentrual cycle, ~30 days; there are a total of 3 rest and 3 treatment cycles, ~180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral phlebotomy will be performed in order to determine peak and trough levels of hormones.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uterine microbiome characterization by microbiota presence and prevalence as assessed after uterine aspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of 1 menstrual cycle, ~30 days; this is followed by 1 rest mentrual cycle, ~30 days; there are a total of 3 rest and 3 treatment cycles, ~180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo a uterine aspiration. The human microbiome project has revealed important things about the vaginal microbiome, but little is known about the uterine microbiome. Given the hormonal changes change the pH of the vagina, we will be able to characterize differences in the uterine microbiome with varied estrogen levels.</description>
