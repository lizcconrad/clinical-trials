  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A UCSF PI-initiated study with a primary goal to improve decision quality, anxiety, and
      uncertainty, thereby increasing appropriate uptake of active surveillance and reducing
      over-treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.

      This study involves: completion of questionnaires through the secure website; consultation by
      a health coach to aid men with prostate cancer in making informed treatment decision
      (personalized coaching session(s)).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A UCSF PI-initiated study which includes comprehensive decision support intervention that may
      incorporate clinical, lifestyle, tumor genomic, and germline gene variant data.

      The web and coaching intervention will: 1) summarize key prognostic data elements, 2)
      communicate relative and absolute risks of upgrading/upstaging based on each of these
      elements, individually and in aggregate, and 3) provide tailored educational information for
      informed decision making on treatment options. A key aspect of the intervention will be
      provision of tiered coaching to the men prior to their physician visits to help them enter
      information accurately into the system, understand the results of the prediction model,
      document their questions for their physicians, and prepare them to make better-informed
      treatment decisions. UCSF research team will develop the decision support intervention in
      phases, initially using only clinical variables, BMI (body mass index), and smoking data;and
      then extend it to include information from genomic and genetic inputs, as validation work
      progresses. Variables will be retained based on statistical evaluation of the predictive
      values.

    <description>A health coach (members of the Patient Support Corps at the University of California San Francisco) will contact each subject individually to discuss his tailored/personalized web-portal report on his risk of aggressive disease and the pro/cons of treatment versus active surveillance.
The contact between subject and the health coaches will be done before subject's visit with his primary urologist. Subjects will be asked to complete different questionnaires on four different occasions: one at first visit to the interactive secure web portal; one before coach's call; one after the coaching (after the urologist visit), and one at 6 months. The questionnaire after subject's visit with the urologist includes discussion about their management choice, decision quality, anxiety and satisfaction with care.</description>
