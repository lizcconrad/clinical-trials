    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug, IPH2201, to see what effects
      it has on this type of cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer.
      Although some types of chemotherapy may cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better
      options are needed. In laboratory tests and animals, IPH2201 has been shown to have effects
      which result in shrinkage of tumours. IPH2201 has been studied in people with rheumatoid
      arthritis but it has not yet been studied in people with cancer and the investigators do not
      know if it can offer better results than standard treatment.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease could include surgery, chemotherapy or
      radiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed gynecologic
             malignancy including high-grade serous ovarian/fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma,
             cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) or endometrial cancer (adenocarcinoma), that
             is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for which no curative therapy
             exists.

          -  For patients with HGSC: For Part 2 of this study, patients will be classified as
             either platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, as defined by their previous response
             to platinum-based therapy:

               -  The platinum resistant cohort will include patients with disease progression
                  within 6 months of the last line of platinum-based therapy dose.

               -  The platinum sensitive cohort will be defined by progression 6 months or longer
                  since last platinum-based therapy dose.

          -  All patients must have an available formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block
             (from their primary or metastatic tumour) and must have provided informed consent for
             the release of the block (or slides), as well as for samples for correlative studies
             and banking.

             • At least 4 patients registered to each cohort in Part 2 must also have provided
             informed consent for and be willing to undergo a tumour biopsy prior to treatment
             (after registration) and after treatment with IPH2201. Note: During accrual to Part 2,
             it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and have
             consented to, tumour biopsy before and after treatment.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology studies
             must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization/registration (within 35 days
             if negative).

        All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. The criteria for
        defining measurable disease are as follows:

          -  Cytotoxic Chemotherapy: All patients must have received at least one prior regimen of
             chemotherapy for advanced, metastatic, or recurrent disease, one of which must have
             been platinum-based. Patients may have received no more than 3 prior regimens.

          -  Other systemic therapy: All patients may have received other therapies including
             immunotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, PARP inhibitors or signal transduction
             inhibitors.

          -  Patients must have recovered from all reversible toxicity related to prior
             chemotherapy or systemic therapy and have adequate washout as follows:

        Longest of one of the following:

          -  Two weeks

          -  5 half lives for investigational agents

          -  Standard cycle length of standard therapies

               -  Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 28
                  days (4 weeks) have elapsed between the last dose of radiation and date of
                  randomization/registration. Exceptions may be made for low-dose,
                  non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with NCIC CTG.

               -  Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4
                  weeks) have elapsed between any major surgery and date of
                  randomization/registration, and that wound healing has occurred.

        Patients must have recovered from any treatment related toxicities prior to
        randomization/registration (unless grade 1, irreversible, or considered by investigator as
        not clinically significant).

          -  Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)

          -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN ; ≤ 5.0 x UNL if patient has known liver metastases

             IPH2201.

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to
             randomization/registration in the trial and prior to tests which are considered to be
             study specific to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or
             those physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into
             the study. Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have
             the document signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be
             provided with a full explanation of the study before consent is requested.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days
             of patient randomization (Part 1) or registration (Part 2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other active or current malignancies that require active
             treatment.

          -  Patients with serious illness or medical conditions that might be aggravated by
             treatment or limit compliance including, but not limited to:

               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements.

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes

               -  Active uncontrolled or serious infection (viral, bacterial or fungal)

               -  Other medical conditions that might be aggravated by study treatment

          -  Patients with active immune-mediated diseases or known HIV infection or hepatitis B or
             C.

          -  Patients receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy at doses equivalent to more than 5
             mg prednisone. Note: Topical applications (e.g. rash), inhaled sprays (e.g.
             obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g. intra-articular)
             are permitted.

          -  Patients receiving cytokines and/or growth factors.

          -  Patients who have experienced severe adverse effects from other immunotherapy-based
             treatment or monoclonal antibodies.
