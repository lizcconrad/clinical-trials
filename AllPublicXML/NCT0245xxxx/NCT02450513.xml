      Observational pharmacokinetics study of adalimumab in patients with active refractory Crohn's
      disease who are naïve to TNF antagonist therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab (ADM), a fully human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, is effective for
      treating patients with Crohn's disease (CD). A correlation between concentration and effect
      was observed at distinct time points.

      The aim was to evaluate the correlation of early longitudinal measurements of ADM with
      different biological markers for disease activity and induction and maintenance of clinical
      remission.

      This is a prospective two-center open-label observational study in anti-TNF naïve patients
      with moderate to severe CD induced with ADM 160/80 mg at week 0 and 2 and 40 mg every 2 weeks
      in monotherapy. All patients should be in need for TNF antagonist therapy and should fulfill
      standard reimbursement criteria (Belgium). Serum samples were taken pre and post first
      injection and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 26 and 52. Following parameters were determined:
      C-reactive protein, albumin, TNF, ADM, antibodies to ADM, hemoglobin, platelet count and
      leukocyte count. Clinical response and remission was evaluated using the Harvey-Bradshaw
      index.
