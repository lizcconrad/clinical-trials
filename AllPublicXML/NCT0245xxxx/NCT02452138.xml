  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotoxin is the major mediator of sepsis resulted from systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome induced by gram-negative bacteria infection. The endotoxin related inflammatory
      response and hypercoagulation can result in microcirculatory dysfunction. When
      microcirculatory dysfunction is severe, it can induce multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and
      death. This is a prospective observational study, and it will not influence the sepsis
      treatment decision of the medical care team. The critically ill severe sepsis patients will
      be enrolled only if they meet all inclusion criteria, do not meet any exclusion criteria and
      sign the consent form after explanation of the aim and process of the trial by the primary
      investigator or research personnel. After enrollment, the patient will receive serum assay of
      endotoxin activity (EAA) and endocan level. The patient will also receive examination of
      sublingual microcirculation by using the incident dark field video microscope. After 24
      hours, the patient will receive assay of endocan level and examination of sublingual
      microcirculation. This study will record the vital signs, laboratory data, dose of
      vasopressors and inotropic agents, and severity of organ dysfunction. After 28 days, this
      study will check the survival, stay of intensive care, stay of hospital, ventilator day, and
      the results of culture of pathogens. The patients will be assign to the following three
      groups by the EAA level: low EAA group (&lt; 0.40 EAA units); intermediate EAA group (0.40-0.59
      EAA units); and high EAA group (â‰§ 0.60 EAA units). This grouping will be used for statistical
      analysis and comparison. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the difference of
      the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria infection, pathogen, infection source,
      microcirculation, the severity of disease, and the prognosis among these three groups.
