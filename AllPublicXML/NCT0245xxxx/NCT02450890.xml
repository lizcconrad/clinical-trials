      This Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-way
      cross-over study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of ORADUR®-Methylphenidate in
      children and adolescents with ADHD age 6 to 18 years old.

      The study is comprised of four main phases: a screening period lasting about 14 days, an
      open-label titration period lasting 2 to 4 weeks, a double-blind and placebo controlled
      two-way cross-over study period of 4 weeks (2 weeks for Period 1 and 2 weeks for Period 2),
      then a follow-up phase of 2 weeks. Screening baseline is defined as Day 0 (Visit 2).

      At the last day of the titration period (Day 14 for 22 mg, Day 21 for 33 mg group, and Day 28
      for 44 mg group), subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ORADUR®-Methylphenidate at
      their optimal dose or placebo at a 1:1 ratio according to the randomization scheme during
      each study period (Period 1 and Period 2) at treatment phase; no washout period will be
      included between two treatment periods.
