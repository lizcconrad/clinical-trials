    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of
      TAK-536 (azilsartan) in pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 16 years with hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called azilsartan. Azilsartan was being tested to
      evaluate how it is processed by the body (pharmacokinetics). This study looked at lab results
      in pediatric participants who took azilsartan.

      The study enrolled 6 patients. Participants were assigned to study medication dose by body
      weight as follows:

        -  Body Weight &lt;50 kg: azilsartan 5 mg

        -  Body Weight ≥50 kg: azilsartan 10 mg

      All participants took a single oral dose of azilsartan on Day 1 of the study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 17 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone
      on Day 6 and Day 15 after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.</description>

          3. The participant is diagnosed as hypertensive (if the participant is not receiving
             antihypertensive therapy, the diagnosis will be based on the Age- and Gender-Based
             Blood Pressure Reference for Children. Sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] or
             systolic blood pressure [SBP] is to be in at least the 95th percentile if essential
             hypertension is present without concurrent hypertensive organ damage and at least the
             90th percentile if secondary hypertension is present with concurrent chronic renal
             disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or hypertensive organ damage).

          4. The participant is male or female and aged 6 to less than 16 years at the time of
             consent.

          5. The participant weighs at least 20 kg during the observation period.

          6. The participant is capable of taking the tablets provided as study drug.

             At least 6 months has elapsed from the transplant to the start of the observation
             period with stable graft function for more than 6 months (and estimated glomerular
             filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2) and historical documentation (Doppler
             echo or computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], etc.) which verify
             that arterial stenosis is not present in the transplanted kidney. For participants
             receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the dose should have been stable at least 30 days
             before study drug administration.

          8. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a
             nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing
             of informed consent to within 1 month after the completion of the study and have a

             the Age- and Gender-Based Blood Pressure Reference for Children).

          3. The participant is diagnosed with malignant hypertension or rapidly progressive
             hypertension.

          4. The participant has severe renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m^2), dialysis
             treatment, renovascular disease affecting both kidneys or a solitary kidney, severe

             due to aortic stenosis, aortic valve disease, or the like or is scheduled to have
             surgery affecting blood pressure (e.g., repair of arterial anomalies) during the
             study.

          7. The participant underwent a surgical procedure with major bleeding within 6 months
             before the start of the observation period.

          8. The participant has past or present clinically significant abnormalities on the
             12-lead electrocardiogram and is ineligible for the study in the opinion of the

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.</description>
