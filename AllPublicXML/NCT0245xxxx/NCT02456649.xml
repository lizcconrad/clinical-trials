  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) with radiation therapy has been
      shown to result in equivalent overall survival rates compared to mastectomy for the local
      treatment of breast cancer. As a result, the majority of patients diagnosed with breast
      cancer in the United States undergo lumpectomy as their primary surgical therapy. Multiple
      studies have demonstrated the association between positive lumpectomy margins and an
      increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, even with postoperative radiation.
      Studies report 20-40% of lumpectomy procedures result in one or more involved (positive)
      surgical margins, leading to the need for further surgery, emotional distress, poorer
      cosmesis, delay to adjuvant treatments, and increased cost. Current available intraoperative
      margin assessment techniques include specimen Xray, gross pathology, frozen section, and
      touch prep cytology. To reduce the incidence of positive margins, the MarginProbe (Dune
      Medical Devices, Caesarea, Israel) was developed to provide real-time, intraoperative
      assessment of the presence of tumor at the lumpectomy margin. In the current study, the
      investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of MarginProbe as an adjunctive tool to
      standard practice for intraoperative identification of tumor at lumpectomy margins, and its
      ability to reduce positive margins and decrease the need for additional surgical procedures.

      In the current study, the investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of MarginProbe as
      an adjunctive tool to standard practice for intraoperative identification of tumor at
      lumpectomy margins, and its ability to reduce positive margins and decrease the need for
      additional surgical procedures.

      Aims of the study:

      Primary objectives

      1. Determine positive margin rate following lumpectomy

      Secondary objectives

        1. Determine accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment with use of MarginProbe plus
           standard of care (gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen Xray)
           versus standard of care (gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen
           Xray) alone.

        2. Determine impact of MarginProbe on total tissue volume removed

        3. Determine the impact of MarginProbe on the need for additional surgical procedures.

    <description>Intraoperative MarginProbe use as adjunct to standard practice MarginProbe will be used on the lumpectomy specimen within 20 minutes of excision, prior to specimen Xray or gross pathology evaluation. This may take up to 5 minutes. MarginProbe will indicate a positive or negative reading for each of the 6 circumferential margins, and the results will be recorded. Any margins determined by to &lt; 5-10 mm by specimen Xray or gross pathology examination will be re-excised. In addition, any additional margins not already identified as &lt; 5-10 mm, but identified as positive by MarginProbe will be re-excised where feasible.</description>
