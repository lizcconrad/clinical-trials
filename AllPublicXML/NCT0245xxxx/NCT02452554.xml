    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lorvotuzumab mertansine works in treating younger
      patients with Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma,
      malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), or synovial sarcoma that has returned or
      that does not respond to treatment. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as lorvotuzumab
      mertansine, are created by attaching an antibody (protein used by the body's immune system to
      fight foreign or diseased cells) to an anti-cancer drug. The antibody is used to recognize
      tumor cells so the anti-cancer drug can kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) in Wilms tumor,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and other cluster of differentiation (CD)56-expressing tumors
      such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and
      synovial sarcoma.

      II. To determine the tolerability of the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN901
      administered as an intravenous infusion, administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, to
      children with refractory Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary
      blastoma, MPNST, or synovial sarcoma.

      III. To define and describe the toxicities of IMGN901 administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor response with tumor CD56+ expression. II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of IMGN901 in children with refractory cancer, including an assessment of
      impact on circulating CD56+ peripheral blood cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lorvotuzumab mertansine intravenously (IV) over 1-1.5 hours on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months (17 courses)</time_frame>

    <description>The best response of disease will be examined separately in each stratum. A responder is defined as a patient who achieves a best response of partial response or complete response on the study. Response rates will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patients who are responders, and confidence intervals will be constructed accounting for the two-stage design.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 and 8 of course 1 prior to lorvotuzumab mertansine</time_frame>
    <description>The association between CD56+ expression and response will be evaluated using the exact conditional test of proportions (Fisher's Exact test). Analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature.</description>

    <description>A descriptive analysis of PK parameters of lorvotuzumab mertansine will be performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters.
