    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center phase II study of AZD5363 in combination with
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring PIK3CA mutation or
      amplification as a second line chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive AZD 5363 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen. A arm is composed
      of 25 patients.

      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of enrollment, up to week 40, then every
      16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled
      date).

      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD5363 is a highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive AKT inhibitor with
      IC50&lt;10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms.

      AZD5363 is well designed to inhibit the important main signal pathway in various human
      cancer. AZD5363 is a specific inhibitor of the AKT pathway which is activated in a wide
      spectrum of tumours.The combination of AZD5363 to standard chemotherapy, paclitaxel, might
      improve the outcomes of 2nd line therapy in advanced gastric cancer patients .
