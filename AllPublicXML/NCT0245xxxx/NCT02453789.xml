    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of Alginate oligosaccharide (OligoG) dry
      powder for inhalation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with a Burkholderia spp. infection.

      Primary objective:

      To explore the efficacy of inhaled OligoG in reducing the microbial burden of Burkholderia
      spp. as measured in expectorated sputum samples.

      Secondary objectives:

      To explore the effect of inhaled OligoG on various efficacy variables such as lung function,
      Quality-of-Life, rheology and other microbiological outcome measures.

      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and subject compliance with treatment The study will
      also evaluate the effect of inhaled OligoG on various efficacy variables such as lung
      function, Quality-of-Life, rheology and other microbiological outcome measures, and evaluate
      the safety and patient compliance with treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis defined by:

               -  Clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of CF; AND

               -  Sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L by pilocarpine iontophoresis; OR

               -  Genotypic confirmation of CFTR mutation

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Ability to provide sputum samples for microbiological evaluation throughout the study
             either spontaneously or induced.

          -  Chronic colonization with Burkholderia spp. defined as at least two positive
             microbiological cultures in expectorated sputum within the last 12 months from Visit
             1.

          -  Use of inhaled aztreonam three times daily in a 4 weeks on/off cycle treatment regimen
             or a continuous intake regimen for at least 4 weeks before screening visit. For on/off
             cycles, screening visit should take place in the off phase. Randomization visit should
             take place the first day &quot;on&quot; to harmonize the aztreonam inhalation period with the
             IMP intake period.

          -  Willingness to stop treatment with other inhaled antibiotics.

          -  At Screening no clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of significant pulmonary
             illness, other than CF, which in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
             participation in the study.

          -  FEV1 greater than 25% of the predicted normal value following adjustment for age,
             gender, and height according to the Global Lung Initiative

             study who are sexually active must use acceptable contraception. Female subjects
             documented as being of non-child-bearing potential are exempt from the contraceptive
             requirements.

          -  Provision of written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Changes in underlying therapy within the 14 days prior to Day 0. Subjects must be
             willing to remain on the same underlying stable therapy regimens for the duration of
             the study until the final follow-up visit at Day 98.

          -  Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 14 days prior to Day 0.

          -  Prohibited medications within 7 days prior to Day 0. Concomitant administration of
             inhaled mannitol or hypertonic saline within 7 days prior to Day 0.

          -  Concomitant use of inhaled antibiotics other than aztreonam.

          -  Pulmonary exacerbation within 28 days of Screening.

          -  Lactose intolerance/milk allergy.

          -  On-going acute illness. Subjects must not have needed an outpatient visit,
             hospitalization or required any change in therapy for other pulmonary disease between
             Screening and Day 0.

          -  History of, or planned organ transplantation.

          -  Active allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in the last 12 months prior to
             Screening, defined as having received treatment for ABPA.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide sputum samples for microbiological evaluation
             throughout the study either spontaneously or induced by means of using inhaled
             hypertonic saline.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal findings on haematology or clinical chemistry. In
             addition, any value ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal will exclude the subject from
             participating in the study.

          -  Subjects unable to perform pulmonary function tests according to the ATS/ERS criteria.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. A negative urine pregnancy test must be demonstrated
             in females of child-bearing potential at Screening.

          -  Subjects who have participated in any interventional clinical trial within the 28 days
             prior to Day 0.

          -  Subjects with documented or suspected, clinically significant, alcohol or drug abuse,
             as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Current malignant disease (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma; BCC).

          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with subject treatment, assessment, or compliance with
             the protocol.

          -  Patients not willing/able to follow the study instructions.

          -  Resistance to aztreonam, or intolerance to aztreonam or any of its excipients.
