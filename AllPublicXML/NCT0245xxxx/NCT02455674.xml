  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight calculation based on age could be performed according to APLS (Advanced Pediatric Life
      Support) guideline recommendations in children requiring emergency treatment and intervention
      in the field or during resuscitation with no active weight and height measurements. The aim
      of the study is to investigate the suitability of weight calculation using mean ages on
      clothing size labels (ACL) to the actual weight in real emergencies with no known actual age
      of the patient (AA).

    <textblock>
      Weight calculation based on age could be performed according to APLS guideline
      recommendations in children requiring emergency treatment and intervention in the field or
      during resuscitation with no active weight and height measurements. Age formulas require only
      knowledge of the actual age of the child and widely used all over the world with being
      catchy. However, situations in which one has to intervene a child without having any patient
      data, including information on children's ages, especially in the field or during
      resuscitation are not uncommon. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      availability of age information contained in clothing size labels of children in weight
      calculation according to APLS recommendations. Usability of labels can protect victims from
      overdose and underdose problems in cases where the actual age is unknown and the measurements
      cannot be done

        Data of children, aged between 1 to 12 years, were consecutively collected. Patients were
        divided into two groups as under the age of 6 (age &lt;6) and over 6 years of age (age≥6).
