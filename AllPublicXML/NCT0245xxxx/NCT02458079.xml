    <textblock>
      Treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis patients not eligible for steroid therapy is a
      dilemma. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to have no improvement in outcomes as per current
      studies and liver transplantation is with great risk of recidivism in this difficult to treat
      cohort of patients. Dysbiosis forms the central role in severe alcoholic hepatitis patients
      and modulation of gut microbiota by way of healthy donor fecal transplantation could prove to
      be a novel way to treating these patients who are ineligible for standard therapy. This study
      utilizes correction of dysbiosis in severe alcoholic hepatitis and surveys outcomes with the
      same with respect to survival and liver disease severity scores.
