  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of contact isolation on the rate of hospital-acquired
      transmissions of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) and the rate of colonization and
      infection. On the basis of this study, it will be possible to re-evaluate the need for
      contact isolation for patients colonized or infected with ESBL-EC.

      The study aims to evaluate the impact of contact isolation on the rate of hospital-acquired
      transmissions of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and the rate of colonization and infection.

      Hematological and oncological wards in hospitals with a non-outbreak setting for ESBL-EC and
      adhering to at least the following standard of care are eligible for study participation:

        -  Fecal screening for the presence of ESBL-EC of all patients within 72 hours of each
           admission by use of a rectal swab or stool sample

        -  Follow-up fecal screening once a week and within 72 hours of discharge

        -  Implementation of clinical standards aimed at ESBL-EC decolonization is not allowed on
           wards participating in this study, including in the context of clinical studies.

      Sites will be grouped according to their approach regarding contact isolation (see group
      description).

      As a control for external factors a hand hygiene program, including training and adherence
      assessments, will be implemented.

    <description>In theory, the ability to produce ESBL can be transferred between species by plasmids. However, in clinical practice, this seems to be an extremely rare event. Nevertheless, it should be assessed to detect any potential risks to patients at sites not isolating for ESBL-EC.</description>

    <description>Isolation triggered by the detection of ESBL-EC at hospital admission in surveillance screening or during the hospitalization by weekly screening or clinical cultures
Contact isolation terminated, after at least two negative consecutive fecal screening cultures
Contact isolation resumed, if subsequent ESBL-EC positive cultures are identified for the same patient including readmissions
Contact isolation must include:
Patient placement in single rooms
Cohorting only possible, when no single rooms available and corresponding ESBL-EC strains are phenotypically identical
Staff and visitors wearing gloves and gowns as contact precautions when entering the room, patient when leaving the room</description>
