      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ASP1941 50mg once daily in
      combination with metformin and sitagliptin against placebo in combination with metformin and
      sitagliptin over a 24 week treatment period in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with
      inadequate glycemic control on metformin and sitagliptin.
