      Background and objective: Stroke, which means sudden onset of cerebral vascular accident. The
      earliest document was found in &quot;Neijing&quot;. The ancient physicians had different opinions and
      points of view on the etiology and pathogenesis of stroke. Before the Tang and Song dynasty,
      the &quot;exopathic wind&quot; theory was talked about. And, after then, the &quot;endogenous wind&quot; theory
      was put forward. While in the Ming dynasty, Zhang Jing-Yue advocated that &quot;Stroke is not
      caused by wind etiology'', highlighting the much difference of the thinking. Until nowadays,
      many famous physicians have their own unique way to determine the etiologic factor based on
      differentiation. To be practical, objectivity differentiating and determining the etiologic
      factor of stroke is the foundation of establishing the treatment guidelines. The
      investigators aim to establish the scientific epidemiological standard of traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) syndromes of acute ischemic stroke in Taiwan.

      Methods: The investigators use the ischemic stroke TCM syndromes Diagnostic Scale (ISTCMDS)
      and the Meridian Energy Analysis Device (M.E.A.D.) to objectively analyze the diagnostic
      elements and detect the deficiency or excess performance of meridians of acute ischemic
      stroke patients from Stroke Center at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The onset of
      stroke is set Within 7 days, and the investigators expected to collect 300 patients. The
      investigators initially establish the scientific epidemiological study of acute ischemic
      stroke with TCM syndromes and deficiency or excess of meridian performances through
      statistical analysis to become a standard of Chinese and Western medicine integration. The
      data collection can gradually become a library, which will facilitate the assessment of the
      clinical efficacy of TCM adjuvant therapy and become a basis to assist Western and Chinese
      medicine integration.
