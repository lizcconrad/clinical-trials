  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label safety study of a single 1200 mg intravenous (IV)
      infusion of oritavancin in adult subjects on chronic warfarin with acute bacterial skin and
      skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven to be caused by Gram-positive
      pathogens.

      An additional group of patients with ABSSSI, who are not on concomitant warfarin therapy,
      will also be enrolled to obtain information regarding the potential for antibody production
      following a single dose of oritavancin administration in patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome is the safety of the administration of oritavancin in subjects on chronic warfarin.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed through a composite assessment of vital signs, laboratory abnormalities, and the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical cure as assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>48-72 hours after start of oritavancin dose and at Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>A patient is classified as &quot;success&quot; if all of the following are met:
Cessation of spread or reduction of the lesion Resolution (absence) of fever (temperature less than 37.7C) No rescue antibiotic medication
A patient cannot be classified as a &quot;success&quot; at 48-72 hours (i.e., patient is a failure) if:
Death (all-cause mortality) from the start of oritavancin administration
Fever (one or more temperature readings of greater than or equal to 37.7Â°C between 48 and 72 hours) Spread of lesion defined as an increase in size (length, width, or area) of the redness, edema, and/or induration such that the size of the lesion is greater than the size at baseline Administration of rescue antibacterial drug therapy or any non-trial antibacterial drug therapy for the treatment of ABSSSI prior to the 48-72 hours clinical cure evaluation Requires an additional unplanned surgical procedure after start of therapy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Potential for antibody development following a single dose oritavancin administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>This will be a composite of tests with the single outcome measure of establishing the presence or absence of antibodies, and identifying the antibodies present, if any. To provide this single outcome measure, plasma samples taken after dosing will be tested for immunoglobulins, direct and indirect Coombs, and oritavancin antibodies.</description>
