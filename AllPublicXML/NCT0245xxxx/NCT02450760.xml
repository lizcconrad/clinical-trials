      The goal of this pilot project is to assess adherence with home blood pressure monitoring in
      hypertensive patients with a history of cerebral infarction and to determine if a social
      incentive improves adherence with monitoring. Enrolled subjects will all have a history of
      cerebral infarction and uncontrolled blood pressure, defined by SBP&gt;140 or DBP&gt;90 mm Hg at
      the time of enrollment. To be eligible subjects will also be required to own a smart phone
      (iOS or Android operating system). After enrollment, patients will be given a home blood
      pressure cuff with instructions to monitor their BP twice daily for 90 days. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to a social incentive program, in which a social supporter receives updates
      via email and/or text message on the subject's adherence with BP monitoring and their average
      blood pressure. This study will provide important pilot data which will inform the design of
      future studies utilizing connected health and automated systems to improve home blood
      pressure monitoring and blood pressure control in patients with a history of stroke.

    <description>Subjects will take their blood pressure twice daily using the provided Withings blood pressure cuff. Subjects in this arm will also identify a social supporter who may help subjects adhere to daily blood pressure readings. If the subject misses blood pressure readings, they will receive automated alerts reminding them to take their blood pressure. The identified social supporter will also receive these alerts, with the expectation that the social supporter will remind the subject to take their blood pressure. Both the subject and the social supporter will also receive weekly emails with their blood pressure data for the week.</description>
