  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia techniques that minimize anesthetic requirements and their effects may be
      beneficial. Esmolol, a short acting hyperselective β-adrenergic blocker is effective in
      blunting adrenergic response to several perioperative stimuli and so it might interfere in
      the effect of the anesthetic drugs on the brain. This study was designed to investigate the
      effect of esmolol on the consumption of propofol and sevoflurane in patients undergoing
      craniotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective craniotomy for aneurysm clipping or tumor dissection were
      randomly divided in two groups (four subgroups). Anesthesia was induced with propofol,
      fentanyl and a single dose of cis-atracurium, followed by continuous infusion of remifentanil
      and either propofol or sevoflurane. Patients in the esmolol group received 500 mcg/kg of
      esmolol bolus 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by additional 200 mcg/kg/min of
      esmolol. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia was also performed using the Bispectral
      Index-BIS. It was also performed monitoring of the cardiac output in order to evaluate the
      effect of esmolol on cardiac output.

      The inspired concentration of sevoflurane and the infusion rate of propofol were adjusted in
      order to maintain a BIS value between 40-50.

      Intraoperative emergence was detected by the elevation of BIS value, HR or MAP.

      It was recorded intraoperative fluctuations of propofol and sevoflurane in both groups. Data
      were expressed as mean ± SD. Differences in categorical data were evaluated using the student
      t test.
