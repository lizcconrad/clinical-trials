  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study, therefore, is to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial
      to investigate the blood-conservation effect of TXA in different TKA patients groups with
      rivaroxaban for VTE prophylaxis, first group by topical application, second group by infusion
      and a third group of placebo and observe whether there is difference in the occurrence of
      venous thromboembolism in those patient groups by venographic study
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators previous experiences in minimally invasive (MIS) TKA showed that intraoperative
      infusion of TXA reduced 45% of postoperative blood loss and needs for transfusion from 20% to
      4%. However, most of the orthopedic surgeons still hesitate to use TXA systemically in TKAs
      especially in high risk patients with a potential increase in thromboembolic events following
      surgery.

      Because of this concern, recently, there were few reports demonstrating the
      cost-effectiveness of topical application of TXA in TKA patients. However, most of the
      reports compared the topical TXA with placebo in TKA patients, not with intravenous TXA.
      Recently, Georgiadis et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial
      are demonstrated similar transfusion rate and perioperative blood loss between topical
      administration and intravenous injection of TXA in TKA patients. There were no significant
      safety differences between the two groups. Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used for
      thromboembolism prophylaxis in that study.

      Recently, chemical VTE prophylaxis such as rivaroxaban has been approved as a standard care
      after TKA because of its superior convenience and efficacy on VTE prophylaxis to LMWH in
      TKAs. However, because of direct blockage of the formation of thrombin from prothrombin by
      rivaroxaban, an increased postoperative bleeding has been reported. There have been little
      studies investigating the blood-conservation effect of TXA on TKA patients either by infusion
      or by topical application when rivaroxaban used as VTE prophylaxis.
