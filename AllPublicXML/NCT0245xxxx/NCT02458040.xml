    <textblock>
      This study is a meta-epidemiological study which aim is to quantify the clinical benefit of
      the biomarker-based strategy compared to conventional strategy across all drugs with such a
      strategy.

      Personalized medicine consist to differentially treat patients based on their individual
      characteristics (mainly genetics). It is of the most promising area of cancer research and
      cancer care. The label of more than 140 FDA- approved drugs mention a biomarker, the majority
      being indicated in oncology. However, it has also been suggested that the hopes of
      personalized medicine were not matched by evidence. Indeed, there is a threat that genetic
      biomarkers are used without evidence that this use translates in improved outcomes for
      patients, and the use of biomarkers is in need for thorough validation.

      In a previous work the investigators showed that the mention of a pharmacogenomic biomarker
      in a drug label can have different meanings depending on the drug, and that oncology had
      higher proportion of required or recommended genetic testing compared to other therapeutic
      areas. Hence, the investigators will include only the drug-biomarker pairs with (i) required
      or recommended genetic testing, or (ii) with biomarker-based indication and (iii) with at
      least one indication in oncology.
