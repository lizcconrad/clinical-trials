    <textblock>
      Male-to-female intimate partner violence accounts for 26% of violence-related injuries in
      women presenting in hospital emergency departments and 33% of all female homicides.
      Adolescence provides an excellent &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for the prevention of intimate
      partner violence. Patterns of relating in intimate relationships are still relatively
      undifferentiated and open to influence. However, the evidence supporting traditional,
      school-based programs for the prevention of teen dating violence is mixed. A major problem
      with existing programs is that they are &quot;one size fits all,&quot; making it difficult to meet the
      diverse needs of students—boys and girls, individuals who are dating and those who are not,
      individuals who have experienced dating violence as a victim, perpetrator, or both, and those
      who have not. Perhaps most importantly, these interventions neglect individual differences in
      readiness to use healthy, non-violent ways of relating to stay violence-free. In Phase I the
      objective was to use expert system technology to integrate best practices for teen dating
      violence prevention with the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM), the &quot;stage
      model,&quot; to develop an interactive, multimedia computer-administered change program that
      delivers individualized intervention sessions and exercises tailored to stage of change and
      other individual characteristics. In Phase II, the objective was to complete development of
      the intervention package and assess its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial involving
      3,901 teens from 20 Rhode Island high schools randomly assigned to intervention or
      comparison. Among youth exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was assessed by
      comparing the intervention and comparison groups on dating violence perpetration and
      victimization at follow-up. Among youth not exposed to risk for dating violence, efficacy was
      assessed by comparing intervention and comparison on peer violence perpetration and
      victimization.

      Twenty Rhode Island high schools agreed to participate in the study. A Multiattribute Utility
      Measurement Approach (Graham, Flay, Johnson, Hansen, &amp; Collins, 1984) was used to ensure that
      schools assigned to the intervention and comparison conditions were approximately equivalent
      on school size, student ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES, percent receiving free or
      reduced-price lunch), attendance, mobility, truancy, dropout, and standardized test
      performance. The most similar schools were paired, and one school within each pair was
      randomly assigned to intervention, and the other to comparison.

      The intervention trial was launched in the Fall of 2009. Both the intervention and comparison
      groups completed a computerized baseline assessment and two follow-up assessments
      approximately 6 and 12 months later—in the Spring and Fall of 2010. Students assigned to the
      intervention condition completed their first Teen Choices intervention session immediately
      following their baseline assessment. The second and third intervention sessions were
      administered at approximately 1 and 2 months follow-up. Students assigned to the comparison
      condition completed an alternative evidence-based online TTM-based intervention, Health In
      Motion, which targets physical activity, screen time, and healthy eating for obesity
      prevention (Mauriello et al., 2010). Health In Motion sessions were administered following
      the baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments to increase the benefits of study
      participation for comparison schools and students. Online assessment and intervention
      sessions were overseen by project research assistants with the assistance of school
      personnel.

      Dating violence outcomes at one year follow-up were were examined in intervention and
      comparison participants who completed the final assessment and were exposed to risk for
      dating violence—that is, students who had experienced or perpetrated emotional or physical
      dating violence in the year prior to the study, who were current daters at baseline, or who
      dated during the follow-up period. Peer violence outcomes were examined in participants who
      completed the final assessment and were not exposed to risk for dating violence.

    <description>A 30-item measure assessing five types of dating violence perpetration and victimization was developed to meet specific needs of this research (Levesque, 2007). Alphas for the five 3-item perpetrator scales are: .88 for emotional mistreatment, .87 for controlling behavior, .91 for threats, .92 for physical violence, and .94 for sexual coercion. At follow-up, in the spring and fall of 2010, the measure assessed dating violence perpetrated and experienced since January 1, 2010. Given the hierarchical structure of the perpetration measure, the emotional mistreatment and controlling behavior scales were combined to represent emotional dating violence perpetration, and the threats, physical violence, and sexual coercion scales were combined to represent physical perpetration. Given extreme non-normal distributions, the two measures were then dichotomized. One or more incidents of physical perpetration during the period in question were coded as &quot;yes,&quot; and no incidents as &quot;no&quot;.</description>

    <description>Among participants not exposed to risk for dating violence, an 18-item measure assessed three types of peer violence perpetration and victimization (Levesque, 2007). Alphas for the three 3-item perpetrator scales are: .89 for emotional mistreatment, .89 for physical violence, and .94 for sexual coercion.

    <description>A 3-session online, multimedia TTM-based intervention for teen dating violence prevention. For most students, the intervention seeks to reduce risk for dating violence by facilitating progress through the stages of change for using healthy relationship skills; daters are encouraged to use those skills in their dating relationships, and non-daters in their peer relationships, as relationships with peers serve as the foundation for experiences in romantic relationships. For victims of dating violence experiencing fear, the intervention does not focus on healthy relationship skills; instead, it seeks to facilitate progress through the stages of change for keeping oneself safe in relationships.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Perpetrating Physical Dating Violence During Follow-up</title>
        <description>A 30-item measure assessing five types of dating violence perpetration and victimization was developed to meet specific needs of this research (Levesque, 2007). Alphas for the five 3-item perpetrator scales are: .88 for emotional mistreatment, .87 for controlling behavior, .91 for threats, .92 for physical violence, and .94 for sexual coercion. At follow-up, in the spring and fall of 2010, the measure assessed dating violence perpetrated and experienced since January 1, 2010. Given the hierarchical structure of the perpetration measure, the emotional mistreatment and controlling behavior scales were combined to represent emotional dating violence perpetration, and the threats, physical violence, and sexual coercion scales were combined to represent physical perpetration. Given extreme non-normal distributions, the two measures were then dichotomized. One or more incidents of physical perpetration during the period in question were coded as &quot;yes,&quot; and no incidents as &quot;no&quot;.</description>

            <title>Intervention: Teen Choices</title>
            <description>A 3-session online, multimedia TTM-based intervention for teen dating violence prevention. For most students, the intervention seeks to reduce risk for dating violence by facilitating progress through the stages of change for using healthy relationship skills; daters are encouraged to use those skills in their dating relationships, and non-daters in their peer relationships, as relationships with peers serve as the foundation for experiences in romantic relationships. For victims of dating violence experiencing fear, the intervention does not focus on healthy relationship skills; instead, it seeks to facilitate progress through the stages of change for keeping oneself safe in relationships.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Perpetrating Physical Peer Violence During Follow-up</title>
        <description>Among participants not exposed to risk for dating violence, an 18-item measure assessed three types of peer violence perpetration and victimization (Levesque, 2007). Alphas for the three 3-item perpetrator scales are: .89 for emotional mistreatment, .89 for physical violence, and .94 for sexual coercion. At follow-up, in the spring and fall of 2010, the measure assessed peer violence experienced and perpetrated since January 1, 2010. Given the hierarchical structure of the perpetration measure, the physical violence and sexual coercion scales were combined to represent physical perpetration. One or more incidents of physical perpetration during the period in question were coded as &quot;yes,&quot; and no incidents coded as &quot;no&quot;.</description>

            <description>A 3-session online, multimedia TTM-based intervention for teen dating violence prevention. For most students, the intervention seeks to reduce risk for dating violence by facilitating progress through the stages of change for using healthy relationship skills; daters are encouraged to use those skills in their dating relationships, and non-daters in their peer relationships, as relationships with peers serve as the foundation for experiences in romantic relationships. For victims of dating violence experiencing fear, the intervention does not focus on healthy relationship skills; instead, it seeks to facilitate progress through the stages of change for keeping oneself safe in relationships.</description>
