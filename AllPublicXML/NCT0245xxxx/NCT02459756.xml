  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular consumption of fruits and vegetables may improve human health and reduce the risk of
      chronic diseases, such as heart disease, certain cancers and type 2 diabetes, but the active
      components and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Berry fruits are abundant in
      anthocyanins and this study aims to test the hypothesis that ingestion of an anthocyanin-rich
      blackcurrant beverage will improve markers of cardiovascular health (health of blood vessels,
      inflammation and platelet function). Further, the study will investigate the anthocyanin
      bioavailability from the blackcurrant beverage.
