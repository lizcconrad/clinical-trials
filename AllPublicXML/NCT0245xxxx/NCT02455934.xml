    <description>Eligible subjects will come for visit 1 to consume varying dose of D-allulose with sucrose beverage with 1 of 5 beverages in a random order which will be blinded for both subjects and investigators. They will have to do 24-hour dietary record a day prior to each visit. Subjects have to be abstained from energy diet within 8 hours prior to each visit. Venous blood samples will be collected 6 mL for measurement of FPG and insulin before taking any study product. Subjects have to drink all within 1 minute. Blood samples will be drawn again 6 mL at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after consumption for measurement of PG and insulin. Every subject will be asked to come back to finish OSTT with 5 study products in a random order, each at 7 days or &gt;5 days and &lt;12 days apart.</description>
