  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of exciting using drugs to target a
      specific pathway in the body, that relies on a natural chemical the body produces called
      'serotonin', in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) during sleep. During this part of the
      study participants will be asked to take buspirone (Buspar) (15-50mg per day), trazodone
      (100mg per day) and a placebo in a random fashion, each for a 2 week period (drug period) of
      time followed by two weeks without drugs (washout period). The drugs will not be taken all at
      the same time, but each will be taken separately for two weeks followed by a night study to
      look at the effect the medication/placebo pill has on the way the body responds during sleep.

      Randomized placebo controlled cross-over study. Each subject will be studied on three
      separate occasions: (1) Buspirone vs. Trazodone vs. placebo for 2 weeks; the patients will be
      blinded to whether they are taking trazodone or placebo; buspirone cannot be blinded because
      it is dosed twice a day and is up titrated during the two weeks of administration. The
      initial dose of Buspirone is 15 mg daily (7.5 mg bid.). To achieve an optimal therapeutic
      response, at intervals of 2 to 3 days the dosage may be increased 5 mg per day until a
      maximum dose 30mg/day is reached. After the two week treatment a sleep study will be
      repeated. Trazodone will be given at 100 mg dose before bed-time. (2) Cross over medication
      for two weeks will be followed by a second sleep study followed by two weeks washout. (3)
      Cross over medication for two weeks will be followed by another sleep study. To assess the
      clinical effect of the drug on breathing during sleep a qualitative polysomnography will be
      performed for 2 hours the same night after taking the drug/placebo. This will allow the
      determination of ventilatory changes and the determination of the number of respiratory
      events (apnea/hypopnea index).

Each subject will be studied on three separate occasions: (1) Buspirone vs. Trazodone vs. placebo for 2 weeks; After the two week treatment a noninvasive nasal mechanical ventilation study will be repeated to determine the hypocapnic apneic threshold. (2) Cross over medication for two weeks will be followed by a second noninvasive nasal mechanical ventilation study to determine the CO2 reserve (Delta-PETCO2-AT)and hypocapnic apneic threshold followed by two weeks washout.
