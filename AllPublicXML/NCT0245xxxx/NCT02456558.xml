  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, antiretroviral activity, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics of an intravenous formulation of deferiprone in HIV-infected subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 30 asymptomatic HIV-positive
      adults. There are two sequential cohorts, in which subjects will receive either one of 2
      doses of deferiprone or placebo twice daily.
