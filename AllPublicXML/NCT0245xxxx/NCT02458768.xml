  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of IVFM HP Inj. by
      evaluating its efficacy versus Menopur® Inj. in infertility women undergoing the in vitro
      fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) among the assisted reproductive technologies.
