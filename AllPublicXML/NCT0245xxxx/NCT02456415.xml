      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of biodegradable magnesium alloy screw, in
      patients with hand fractures who require internal fixation (to obtain a product license from
      the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in Korea (MFDS)).

      Rationale: Hand fractures including intra- and extra-articular phalanges and metacarpal are
      common and account for approximately 40% of upper extremity fractures and lead to functional
      loss of the hand.Fractures can be treated conservatively with a nonsurgical approach(Closed
      reduction) by placing the damaged figure in a splint; this may results in displacement,
      rotation, angulation and/or instability, therefore require surgery. Surgical techniques for
      treatment of hand fractures include internal fixation with metal plate or screws after Open
      reduction and external fixation with insertion of percutaneous pins or screws. Percutaneous
      external fixation is one of the widely used methods, but is difficult to maintained when
      accompanied by unstable fractures and soft tissue injuries or there are severely comminuted
      fractures and sometimes results in restricted motion of adjacent joints due to prolonged
      fixation. In comparison, internal fixation is an operation using internal fixators such as
      plates, wires, screws etc. solely or concurrently depending on the location and severity of
      hand fracture. With the recent advancement of implant design and fixation techniques, a
      variety of screws are widely used for fixation of small-bone fractures.

      The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of magnesium alloy screw
      as a novel bioabsorbable and biodegradable material.

      Study Duration: After an approval of clinical protocol from MFDS in Korea, total 20 months
      were required including 14 months for subject enrollment and 6 months of follow-up. An
      additional 1 month was required after completion of the study for handling of data,
      statistical analysis and preparation of study report.

      Target Subjects: Patients who require internal fixation using screws due to hand fractures

      Investigational Device: K-MET™ Bioresorbable Bone screw (manufactured by U&amp;I) This device
      divided into two type,Cortex screw and Headless compression screw.

      Number of Subjects: A total of 34 cases of bone fractures in 28 subjects.

    <measure>Bone union</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bone union was evaluated at 6-month after surgery according to the following definition.Definition of bone union is when simple X-ray findings reveal that bone trabeculae or cortical bone exceeds the fracture site. Non-union is defined as no union at 3-month post-surgery.</description>

    <measure>PROM(Passive Range of Motion)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This Passive Range of Motion(PROM) is measured by goniometer and is compared with the value of the normal hand that did not undergo surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TAM(Total Active Motion)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total Active Motion(TAM) is measured by goniometer and is compared with the value of the normal hand that did not undergo surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Power(grip strength and pick-up power)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Power was measured using a dynamometer and pick-up counter and is compared with the value of the hand that did not undergo surgery.</description>

    <measure>DASH scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3,6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire evaluates the ability of the hand to perform certain activities before and after surgery. It was directly completed by subjects.</description>

    <measure>Pain as measured by the NRS (1~10)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS (1~10) was used to measure the level of pain and was compared before and after surgery.</description>

    <description>The K-MET™ Bioresorbable Bone Screw, intended to be used for trauma therapy, consists of Cortex screws, Cannulated headless screws. For Headless screw and Cannulated headless screws, the design is similar to normal headless compression screws but the compression function was achieved by using different lengths for the front and rear pitches. These screws are dynamic and allow therewith the fracture at the Carpal, metacarpal, and small hand bone.</description>
