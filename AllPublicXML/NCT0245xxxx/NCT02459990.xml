      Assess Fetal Mortality and Malformations in Women treated with antihypertensive medication
      during preganancy. Mother - Child pairs will be analysed in a cohort selected from the UK in
      the CPRD database. Years covered are 1997 to 2014. Aim is to assess the risk of
      Antihypertensive treatment in women.

    <textblock>
      Women with chronic hypertension are at risk of experiencing severe complications such as
      adverse effects of fetal growth, survival, and renal function during pregnancy. General
      recommendations advocate the treatment of high blood pressure during pregnancy to decrease
      these risks to the mother and child, with extreme caution. Many studies assessing the risk of
      congenital malformations in infants whose mothers were treated with anti-hypertensive
      medication have been inconclusive, in part due to the variability of the original data
      sources and possibly the robustness of the analyses.2 Studies regarding this health issue
      have been unable to stratify anti-hypertensive medications sufficiently to truly assess the
      risk per drug class, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists/Blockers (ARBs) and
      Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) in particular.We will attempt to
      assess the prescription rate of ARBs and ACE inhibitors among women with very high blood
      pressure in the United Kingdom (UK) and estimate the risk of serious foetal outcomes in women
      treated with ARBs and/or ACEs and who may also have the following co-morbid conditions:
      Diabetes Types I or II, Diabetic Nephropathy, and Congestive Heart Failure.
