  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, paired, cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a
      safety huddle-based intervention on physiologic monitor alarm rates on pediatric inpatient
      units.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital physiologic monitors can alert clinicians to early signs of physiologic
      deterioration, and thus have great potential to be life-saving. However, monitors generate
      frequent alarms, most of which are non-actionable.

      When clinicians become overburdened with alarms, they begin to exhibit alarm fatigue:
      responding more slowly to alarms or ignoring alarms entirely. In this protocol the
      investigators outline the methods they will use to evaluate the impact of a safety
      huddle-based intervention on physiologic monitor alarm rates using a pragmatic, paired,
      cluster-randomized controlled trial with the intervention delivered at the unit level. This
      work is considered quality improvement research, and some of the approaches described in this
      protocol are from the field of quality improvement.

      Currently, at most hospitals data like this on the numbers of alarms that patients generate
      are only available to researchers with the software tools needed to interrogate and record
      data from the monitor network. The goal of this proposal is to bring this data to the safety
      huddles occurring daily on inpatient units in an accessible format to help teams make
      informed decisions about monitoring and minimize the potential of harm from alarm fatigue.
