  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to preliminarily validate a parent-focused obesity intervention
      program for parents of low-income, African American preschoolers who are currently overweight
      (&gt; 85th BMI %tile). Half of the participants will receive an intervention that is eight
      sessions in length and carried out in the participant's home. The sessions will target the
      nutrition and physical activity knowledge of parents and their motivation for changing
      parenting related to family eating habits and activity level. The remaining participants will
      receive an attention comparison control condition (ACCC), which includes one home visit, 7
      newsletters and 4 monthly support phone calls. It is hypothesized that children of parents
      receiving the intervention will have decreases in BMI %tile, consume more fruits/vegetables
      and fewer sugary beverages, and engage in more activity as compared to ACCC.

      This study will do a preliminarily validation of a parent-focused obesity intervention
      program for parents of low-income, African American preschoolers who are currently overweight
      (&gt; 85th BMI %tile). Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or attention
      control condition. Those in the intervention will receive an intervention that is eight
      sessions in length and carried out in the participant's home. The sessions will target the
      nutrition and physical activity knowledge of parents and their motivation for changing
      parenting related to family eating habits and activity level. Sessions include
      psycho-education and skills building exercises. The attention comparison control condition
      (ACCC) participants will receive one home visit, 7 newsletters and 4 monthly support phone
      calls. The content of this condition also focuses on nutrition and activity knowledge,
      motivation and parenting. Outcomes for the intervention and ACC conditions will be assessed
      at baseline, post-intervention and at a 6-month and 1-year followed up. Child BMI %tile,
      consumption of fruits/vegetables and sugary beverages, and activity level will be analyzed to
      examine intervention effectiveness across time.

    <description>Behavioral intervention that targets the parent of a preschool age child who is overweight. The intervention is 8 sessions in length. Each session is expected to last 1-1.5 hours and will be carried out in the participant's home over 4 months. The sessions will target the nutrition and physical activity knowledge of parents and their motivation for changing parenting related to these factors. Intervention content for the parent will be based on Motivational Interviewing principles.</description>

    <description>The attention control condition includes 1 initial Motivational Interviewing (MI) session conducted in the home. The content of the MI session will be the same as for the intervention participants. Following this session, parents will receive bi-monthly newsletters that will include content similar to what intervention participants receive. AC participants will receive a total of 7 newsletters; 2 on nutrition, 2 on physical activity, 2 on parenting behavior and 1 on community resources. AC participants will also receive a monthly 20-min phone call designed to review newsletter content and answer parent questions.</description>
