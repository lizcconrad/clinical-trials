  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Methylphenidate on neural activity
      underlying inhibitory control and error monitoring in healthy adults. More specifically, the
      investigators aim to establish the baseline modulatory effect of Mehtlylphenidate on
      bottom-up and top-down aspects of these cognitive processes. This work will further our
      understanding of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Methylphenidate, and executive
      functioning.

    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate (MPH) is the stimulant medication most commonly used in the treatment of
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). MPH suppresses the reuptake of dopamine by
      blocking dopamine transporter, which is elevated in ADHD. However, the precise mechanism by
      which suppressed dopamine transporter activity relieves ADHD symptoms is not fully
      understood, partly because dopamine pathways are implicated in various processes that could
      play a role in the deficits of ADHD and other disorders. MPH-induced dopamine variation has
      extensive effects in the brain and influences various executive functions in unknown ways.

      Hypotheses:

      Inhibitory Control: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the top-down activity
      in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with response restraint during go-phases
      and bottom-up activity in caudate and right inferior frontal cortex associated with response
      cancellation during successful stop trials. A greater modulation of top-down or bottom-up
      activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one pathway over the other.

      Error Processing: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the intensity of
      deactivation in the bottom-up dopamine pathway on error detection (substantia nigra, dorsal
      striatum and ACC), and increase the intensity of deactivation in the top-down pathway on
      post-error slowing (caudal OFC, ventral striatum, ventral substantia nigra). A greater
      modulation of top-down or bottom-up activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one
      pathway over the other.

    <description>oral dose of methylphenidate. The MPH dose was selected based on previous studies in healthy adults (Mehta et al., 2000; Volkow, Fowler, Wang, Ding, &amp; Gatley, 2002) and adults with ADHD (Aron et al., 2003). MPH reaches its peak plasma concentration 1-3 hours after an oral dose, and has a plasma half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours.</description>

             between 60-90 mmHg, inclusive, and heart rate between 50-100 bpm, inclusive, unless
             deemed not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator/ Sub-Investigator?
