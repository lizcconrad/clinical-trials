    <textblock>
      Radiation enteritis (RE) is by simple definition an inflammatory process occurring at the
      level of the intestines as a response to abdominal or pelvic radiation energy exposure. Due
      to the dosage of radiation, sensitivity of organs to radiation, and some patient
      characteristics, RE can present as either an acute or chronic syndrome. Clinical
      manifestations differ but may include abdominal pain, malabsorption, diarrhea, cachexia,
      intestinal bleeding, obstruction, and even perforation, which compromise quality of life. For
      many years, radiotherapy of the abdominal or pelvic region is commonly used for a significant
      percentage of patients with rectosigmoid and genitourinary system tumors. Different
      techniques have been developed to prevent the occurrence of radiation induced injury.
      However, the incidence of CRE is expected to continue to rise during the coming years. What's
      more, abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy can also lead to other side effects in addition to RE,
      such as skin desquamation, local soft tissue injury, and so on. Till now, lots of attention
      is only paid to local complications, there is little report on systemic damage of abdominal
      or pelvic radiotherapy.

      Low triiodothyronine syndrome (LT3S), a condition characterized by low circulating
      triiodothyronine (T3) levels, normal thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (FT4) and
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the absence of an intrinsic thyroid disease, is
      variously known as the &quot;nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)&quot;. This condition is frequently
      detected in critical illness. Reichlin et al. first noticed that some aspects of thyroid
      hormone metabolism might change during many chronic illnesses as early as 1973. Data has
      shown that about 35-70% of acute and chronic critical conditions were associated with a
      significant abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, of which LT3S was the most common type.
      Furthermore, these changes have been shown to be associated with disease severity and have
      been connected with poor short-term prognosis.

      To date, there are lots of literatures include detailed reports on the relationship between
      LT3S and chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
      sepsis, and so on. However, no systematic analysis of LT3S in patients with CRE has been
      undertaken. As such, the present study aimed to investigate the frequency of LT3S in CRE
      patients.
