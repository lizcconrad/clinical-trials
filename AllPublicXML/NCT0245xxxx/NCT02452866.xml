      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, prospective, open-label study to evaluate the safety of
      SYM-1219 granules containing 2 grams of secnidazole in women and postmenarchal adolescent
      girls with bacterial vaginosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 325 patients will be enrolled. Patients determined to be eligible for the study
      will receive SYM-1219 granules containing 2 grams of secnidazole orally as a single dose.

      Patients determined to be eligible at the Baseline visit will receive a single dose of
      SYM-1219 granules containing 2 grams of secnidazole in 4 ounces of unsweetened applesauce to
      be self-administered on Day 1. Patients will be contacted by telephone once between Days 8 to
      10 to inquire about possible adverse events. A final study visit will occur on Day 21 to 30
      to assess the patient for safety.
