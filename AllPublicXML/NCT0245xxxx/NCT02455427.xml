  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second cause of death worldwide and represented the first cause of death in
      Brazil between 2006 and 2010. Most patients survive, and there is a need to develop
      cost-effective rehabilitation strategies to decrease the burden of disability from stroke.

      This study addresses this important issue, by evaluating, in the early phase post-stroke,
      effects of motor conventional physical therapy associated or not with transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS).

      The investigators main goal is to confirm the safety of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) associated with conventional physical therapy, compared to conventional
      physical therapy associated with sham tDCS, for upper limb rehabilitation in an early phase
      (72 hours until 6 weeks) after stroke. Patients will be randomized to receive one of these
      two treatments, 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. Adverse effects will be monitored during each
      session. The working hypothesis is that conventional physical therapy associated with active
      tDCS in the subacute phase of ischemic stroke will be as safe as conventional therapy alone.
      The investigators will also preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of active tDCS associated
      with conventional therapy, compared to conventional therapy alone, in improvement of upper
      limb motor impairment. The investigators secondary goals are: 1) To compare effects of the
      above mentioned interventions on disability, spasticity and quality of life, in patients at
      an early stage after stroke ( subacute phase), immediately after treatment and 3 months
      later. The investigators hypothesis is that the association of conventional physical therapy
      and active tDCS will lead to better outcomes than conventional therapy alone. Patients will
      be assessed before the first session and after the last session of treatment, as well as 3
      months after the last session of treatment.

      Preliminary data about structural and functional connectivity will be collected in order to
      plan future studies related to mechanisms of tDCS in the subacute phase after stroke.
