  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is an extremely common cause of respiratory illness in infants caused by viral
      infection.This study evaluates whether treatment with nitazoxanide (NTZ) reduces the duration
      and severity of respiratory symptoms caused by bronchiolitis. Half of the participants will
      receive NTZ while the other half will receive a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a novel anti-infective medication that is licenced for use in the
      United States (US), including in children and infants for treating some infections. It is in
      the thiazolide class of antimicrobials and has been shown to have in vitro and/or clinical
      activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including a range of viruses, parasites and
      bacteria.

      This study will determine whether NTZ is an effective empirical treatment for bronchiolitis.
      It will also help us to understand what effect NTZ has on the amount of virus present and how
      viral load changes over the course of the disease. If this study shows that NTZ is a useful
      treatment, then a larger study will be conducted enrolling infants that present to primary
      care facilities.
