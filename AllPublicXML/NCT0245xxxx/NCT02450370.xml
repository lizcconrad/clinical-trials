  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome will be blinded and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups, the low FODMAP diet or the conventional IBS diet group. They
      will be referred to do three hydrogen breath tests prior to diet education. Upon completion,
      subjects will attend dietitian consultations at Week 0, 6 and 10 for diet assessment,
      education and reinforcement. At Week 4 and 8, dietitians will telephone patients to check on
      diet compliance and answer any diet question. Two sets of questionnaires, the IBS Global
      Improvement Scale and the IBSQOL will be given to patients to complete before each dietitian
      visit at week 0, 6 and 10. Two sample t-test and Chi square test will be used to test the
      difference between the two groups and the association between breath tests results and
      responds to the two diets.

           and consent form will be signed if they agreed to participate

        2. Subjects will be blinded and randomly assigned to Conventional IBS diet group (A) or Low
           FODMAP diet group (B)

        3. 3 Breath tests (lactulose, fructose, lactose) will be carried out for all subjects
           before diet education

        4. Subjects will be asked to come to the dietitians clinic and receive the first one hour

        6. Subjects will be asked to fill out the IBS Global Improvement Scale and the IBSQOL
           questionnaire at Week 0, 6 &amp; 10

        7. At week 4 and week 8, telephone interviews will be conducted by the dietitians to
           reinforce diets and answer diet questions

        8. Results of IBS Global Improvement Scale and IBSQOL questionnaire will be analyzed using
           two sample t-test to test the difference between control and treatment group

        9. Chi square test will be used to look at the association between breath tests results and
           responds to the two diets
