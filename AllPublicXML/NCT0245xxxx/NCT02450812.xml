      This observational prospective single arm cohort study is designed to assess overall
      survival, symptomatic skeletal event free survival and quality of life of metastatic
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving Radium- 223 under real life
      conditions. In addition, time to next tumor treatment (TTNT), mobility, quality of life and
      selfcare, independence in activities of daily living and safety will be assessed.
