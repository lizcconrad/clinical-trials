  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (n = 500) of a new single-session intervention,
      called Crisis Line Facilitation (CLF), compared to an enhanced usual care condition on
      utilization of the Veterans Crisis Line and other mental health services as well as suicide
      attempt(s). All participants will be recruited during an inpatient psychiatric stay for the
      treatment of a recent suicidal crisis and be re-assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post
      baseline. If successful, the proposed study will provide key data on the potential efficacy
      of a brief tool to improve the utilization of an existing resource, the Veterans Crisis Line,
      to reduce suicidal behaviors in VHA patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients are at a significantly elevated risk for fatal
      and non-fatal suicide attempts and identifying strategies to reduce the risk of suicidal
      behavior among members of the military and Veterans is a high national priority. The VHA has
      invested extensively in suicide prevention and, as part of these efforts; the Veterans Crisis
      Line was developed as an important resource for Veterans and their families. Utilization of
      the Veterans Crisis Line has expanded steadily since it first opened and, currently, it
      receives over 20,000 calls per month. Despite high utilization of the Crisis Line, no data
      are currently available on whether use of the Veterans Crisis Line reduces an individual's
      likelihood of a suicide attempt or death and it is not feasible to test the efficacy of the
      Crisis Line in a randomized controlled trial because it is nationally available to all
      Veterans and their families. More importantly, the Veterans Crisis Line may not reach those
      individuals at most acute risk for suicide. The investigators' study team conducted a small
      survey of Veterans treated for recent suicidal crisis in a VHA inpatient psychiatric unit and
      found that less than half had ever utilized the Veterans Crisis Line and less than a third
      had used it within the past year. Consequently, the investigators have developed and gathered
      pilot data on a brief intervention designed to increase utilization of the Veterans Crisis
      Line among high risk patients, called Crisis Line Facilitation (CLF). This single-session
      intervention involves a discussion of the patient's perceived barriers of crisis line use
      during periods of suicidal crisis. The CLF session ends with the patient calling the Crisis
      Line with the therapist in the room as a way for Veterans to practice the logistics of making
      the call and to have direct experiences that may counter any negative beliefs about Veterans
      Crisis Line use. The proposed study will recruit 500 participants who are currently treated
      for a suicidal crisis in VHA inpatient psychiatric but have not recently used the Veterans
      Crisis Line. This study will be a randomized controlled trial of the impact of CLF compared
      to enhanced usual care (EUC) on utilization of the Veterans Crisis Line and other mental
      health services as well as suicide attempt(s). All participants will be re-assessed at 3-, 6-
      and 12-months post baseline. Analyses will also examine the extent to which post-baseline
      Crisis Line use mediates the effect of random assignment to CLF on subsequent suicidal
      behaviors. Qualitative interviews at the end of the study will help understand barriers and
      facilitators of future implementation of the CLF intervention. If successful, the proposed
      study will provide key data on the potential efficacy of a brief intervention to improve the
      utilization of an existing resource, the Veterans Crisis Line, to reduce suicidal behaviors
      in VHA patients. Developing a brief and effective approach to encourage use of the Crisis
      Line has the potential to have a significant and substantial impact on suicide rates within
      the VHA and could be modified and exported to other populations and settings.

    <description>The primary data source for mental health treatment services will be participant medical records, collected through chart audits/abstraction. Additional questions about treatment utilization will be based on modified items from the Treatment Services Review. Information collected on treatment utilization may include whether a session was scheduled/attended, the number of sessions attended, type and location of provider (primary care doc, therapist, etc.), and type of treatment received (therapy vs. medications).</description>

    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a semi-structured interview that is mandated for use in medication trials by the Federal Drug Administration and has been uniquely recommended as a standalone measure of change in suicidal thoughts and behavior over time. The investigators will use the C-SSRS to measure suicide attempts and other suicidal behaviors, including &quot;preparatory behavior&quot;, within the follow-up period.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for screening (Part 1).

          -  adults age 18 years of age or older receiving care in an inpatient psychiatric unit at
             either the BC VAMC or AA VAMC;

          -  mention of a significant suicidal crisis within the intake note;

          -  medically stable and able to provide informed consent; and

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)58 score greater than or equal to 21.

        Additional inclusion criteria for the full randomized study (Part 2):

          -  no reported use of the Veterans Crisis Line within the past 12-months;

          -  report current suicidal ideation (BSS greater than or equals 5 during the week prior
             to hospitalization) as reported during the screening interview.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for screening and full study:

          -  patients who do not understand English;

          -  prisoners;

          -  patients deemed unable to provide informed consent as stated above;

          -  patients who recently received or are scheduled to receive electroconvulsive therapy
             (ECT); and

          -  profound psychotic symptoms and/or cognitive deficits that would prevent patients from
             understanding the content of the intervention and/or assessments.

               -  Similar to the investigators' ongoing IIR which recruited from VHA inpatient
                  units, the investigators do not have explicit exclusion criteria related to
                  psychotic or cognitive disorders.

               -  Instead of relying on diagnoses, the investigators will make judgments of
                  appropriateness for the trial based on the clinical judgment of the study staff
                  (supplemented with information in the clinical record).

               -  It has been the investigators' experience that patients often are unable to
                  provide informed consent early in a psychiatric stay but their status will
                  improve significantly prior to discharge.

               -  The investigators attempt to recruit participants during this period of improved
                  stability and will include individuals who meet the above inclusion/exclusion
                  criteria at that time.
