  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation study to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single and repeated SC doses of REMD-477 in Type 2
      diabetic subjects. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States and
      will enroll approximately 102 subjects with Type 2 diabetes who are either treatment-naïve,
      controlled with diet and exercise or treated with oral antidiabetic medications.

      The study will consist of three parts: Part A - Dose Escalation, Part B - Adaptive Dose
      Cohort, and Part C - REMD-477 in Combination with Metformin. Part A includes 5 cohorts that
      will be enrolled and dosed sequentially at escalating doses. Each cohort will consist of 12
      subjects randomized in a 3:1 (active: placebo) fashion. Part B includes a single dose cohort
      that will enroll 12 subjects (9 on active treatment and 3 on placebo) with dose level and
      frequency determined by a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM)Committee. Part C includes 2
      cohorts of T2DM patients currently treated with metformin alone, and each cohort will consist
      of 15 subjects (10 on active treatment and 3 on placebo).
