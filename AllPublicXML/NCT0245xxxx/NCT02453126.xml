  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol addresses a central hypothesis that fibrostenotic Eosinophilic Esophagitis
      (EoE) is characterized by abnormal esophageal structure and compliance compared to non
      fibrostenotic EoE and that distinctive cellular and molecular profiles predict the
      fibrostenotic phenotype. This study aims to define and assess the changes that occur in the
      structure and dynamics of the esophageal wall in pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis along
      with characterizing the histologic and molecular patterns in fibrostenotic EoE.
