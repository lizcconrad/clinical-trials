  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of youth with type 2 diabetes is predicted to quadruple by 2050, with a
      disproportionate increase among minority youth. The research proposed in this Career
      Development Award will use community-based participatory research methodology as well as
      novel strategies (peer education and mobile health technologies) to design, implement and
      evaluate a diabetes prevention intervention for at-risk ethnic minority youth in an urban
      community with high disease burden.

  <detailed_description>

      Approach: The proposed research addresses diabetes risk and prevention among racial/ethnic
      minority adolescents in East Harlem (EH), NY. Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to explore
      the best strategies for using peer education for diabetes risk reduction in youth and the
      potential role of mobile health technologies in improving adherence to behavioral
      modification plans. Aim 2 will utilize findings from preliminary studies and Aim 1 to design
      and evaluate a pilot community-based intervention to 1) maintain/reduce BMI (primary
      outcome), 2) improve adolescent dietary, physical activity and weight control behaviors, and
      3) improve other measures of diabetes risk. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately
      after the intervention (3 months) and at one year in the intervention and wait list control
      groups. Aim 3 involves refining the pilot intervention based on an examination of
      intervention feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability and planning for a future R01.
