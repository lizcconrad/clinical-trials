  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study on children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) aims to (i) characterize
      their self-regulation deficits, a process important for controlling emotions and behavior,
      (ii) describe brain structure and function underlying self-regulation, and (iii) determine
      whether training to improve self-regulation abilities changes brain and behavior. Individuals
      with FASD have a high risk of cognitive and social deficits, which reflect their difficulties
      in self-regulation and may lead to mental health concerns in adulthood. Importantly, early
      intervention improves long-term outcome. However the full extent of self-regulation problems
      in FASDs is unknown and the underlying neuroanatomy has not been fully described.
      Furthermore, information on how to best treat children with FASDs is lacking. Thus, the
      investigators propose three studies with a sample of 8-12 year old children, 40 with FASDs
      and 20 typically developing controls. In Study 1, the participants will be evaluated on
      cognitive and social self-regulation abilities using clinical and experimental tests. In
      Study 2, the participants will undergo a 1-hour MRI scanning session to obtain measures of
      their brain structure and function. In Study 3, FASDs will be randomly assigned to an
      immediate or delayed treatment group. The immediate group will undergo 12-weeks of therapy
      with the Alert Program for Self RegulationÂ®. On conclusion of training, all will repeat
      Studies 1 and 2 and following this retest, the delayed treatment group will undergo training.
      The investigators will evaluate change in cognitive and social behavior and in brain
      structure and function by comparing performance and neuroimaging findings before and after
      the intervention. The investigators expect Alert training to significantly improve behavior
      and alter brain regions important for self-regulation. The findings will yield important
      information for improving self-regulation in FASDs and mitigating the development of mental
      health challenges.
