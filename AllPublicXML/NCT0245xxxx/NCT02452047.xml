    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of imipenem+cilastatin/relebactam (MK-7655A)
      versus colistimethate sodium + imipenem+cilastatin in the treatment of imipenem-resistant
      bacterial infections. Infections evaluated in the study will be hospital-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), complicated
      intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), and complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalization that requires treatment with IV antibiotic therapy for a new,
             persistent or progressing bacterial infection involving at least 1 of 3 primary
             infection types (HABP, VABP, cIAI, or cUTI)

          -  Positive culture data from the primary infection-site specimen collected within 1 week
             of study entry. At least one of the suspected causative pathogens from the specimen
             meets all of the following: 1) identified as a Gram-negative bacterium, 2)
             culture-confirmed imipenem resistance (and colistin resistance for Group 3 only), 3)
             culture-confirmed susceptibility to imipenem/relebactam and to colistin (for Groups 1
             and 2 only)

             urinary tract, 2) known ileal loop, 3) intractable vesico-ureteral reflux, 4) presence
             of an indwelling urinary catheter which cannot be removed at study entry

          -  History of serious allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to listed
             antibiotics (per-protocol)

          -  Female who is pregnant or is expecting to conceive (or a male partner of a female who

             divalproex sodium, or concomitant systemic (e.g. IV, oral or inhaled) antimicrobial
             agents with known Gram-negative bacterial coverage

          -  Currently undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

          -  Participated or anticipates participating in any other clinical study involving
             administration of investigational medication up to 30 days before screening or during
             the course of the trial

          -  Concurrent endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, prosthetic joint infection,
             disseminated fungal infection, or active pulmonary tuberculosis
