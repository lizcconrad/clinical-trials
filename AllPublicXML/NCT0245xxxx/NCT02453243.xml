      Many patients at risk for suicide are discharged from the ED with little or no intervention.
      Evidence-based suicide prevention interventions, like universal screening and safety planning
      should be adopted in clinical practice to help prevent suicidal behavior. This study will
      test the long-term sustainability of the nurse administered universal screening implemented
      in the original ED-SAFE study. Also, the investigators will test what impact implementing a
      new personalized Safety Planning Intervention guided by Lean has on suicide composite
      outcomes.

      The ED-SAFE-2 will use a stepped wedge design where the original eight ED-SAFE sites will
      collect quantitative and qualitative data during the three phases: Baseline, Implementation,
      and Maintenance. Using this data, as well as data from the original ED-SAFE study, the
      ED-SAFE-2 will examine both within and between site differences for existing screening
      practices and new safety planning procedures. Most of the data collection on outcomes will be
      done by retrospective chart review.

      The Safety Plan Intervention will be adopted into routine clinical care for patients who
      screen positive but are set to be discharged. Each step is presented by the clinician and the
      responses are recorded on a templated form. After completion of the safety plan, the
      clinician helps the patient identify the most helpful aspects of the plan, ascertains the
      likelihood of actually using it, and addresses any potential barriers to use. The patient
      keeps the safety plan to use as a reminder during times of escalating distress or crisis.

      A Lean Implementation Strategy will be used to ensure that adoption of the intervention is
      fully supported vertically and horizontally within the organization, infrastructure is built
      that supports the efforts, and that the protocols fit naturally within roles,
      responsibilities, and clinical flow.

      Consistent with the RFA's emphasis, the intervention target will be the clinician's behavior
      of safety planning. All emergency mental health and nursing personnel at the sites will be
      trained on safety planning, and Lean will be used to help ensure the safety planning is being
      implemented properly and consistently. The mechanisms of action of the combination of the
      safety planning training and Lean will be studied, allowing the team to establish both the
      effect the intervention has on the intervention target but also on the mechanisms of action
      comprised of departmental culture change and infrastructure support.

    <textblock>
      Suicide risk is much more prevalent among general emergency department (ED) patients than in
      the general community but this risk often goes undetected, especially among patients
      presenting with non-psychiatric complaints. By definition, universal screening is the only
      way to identify occult risk among patients presenting for non-psychiatric complaints. Until
      recently, however, little was known about how to implement universal screening in a clinical
      ED setting or whether doing so had any effect on detecting risk. The ED-SAFE has shown that
      it is feasible to implement universal screening and that the screening increases detection of
      suicide risk.

      Simply identifying risk is not sufficient; efforts must be taken to mitigate risk and prevent
      suicidal behavior. However, many studies have shown that even those patients identified as
      having clinically significant risk are often discharged home without receiving any kind of
      active intervention during the ED visit, with many not even receiving a psychiatric
      evaluation.1-3 Brief interventions that are a good fit for the ED are needed. One such
      intervention has received strong research support and has already been accepted as a best
      practice in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs: Safety Planning Intervention.4
      This intervention, however, has not been adopted in civilian EDs and little is known about
      how to effectively implement it, and whether doing so impacts suicide-related outcomes.

      This study will address the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Test the long-term sustainability of nurse administered universal screening
      implemented in the original study across two new time periods. (a) The first is the period
      between the original ED-SAFE and the new study (ED-SAFE-2), which represents an ecologically
      valid &quot;natural&quot; state without any grant support, hereafter referred to as Baseline. (b) The
      second is the Maintenance phase of the new study, which will represent a time period spanning
      a minimum of four years after screening was initially implemented.

      • Primary hypothesis: Sites that sustained high screening rates (intervention target) will
      sustain improved suicide risk detection (patient outcome) during each time period examined.
      Sustained screening practices will be mediated through ED organizational characteristics and
      enabling infrastructure (mechanisms of action).

      Aim 2: Test the impact of implementing the new personalized Safety Planning Intervention for
      patients with suicide risk who are discharged from the ED.

      • Primary hypotheses: Clinician training in safety planning, combined with implementation
      guided by Lean, is expected to increase safety planning by clinicians (intervention target),
      which will result in reduced suicide and suicide-related acute healthcare in the 6-months
      post-visit (suicide composite outcome). This will be more likely in sites with organizational
      characteristics and infrastructure that supports safety planning (mechanisms of action).

      Aim 3: Test sustainability of safety planning during the Maintenance phase.

      • Primary hypotheses: Sustained safety planning will result in sustained reductions in the
      suicide composite outcome. Sustained safety planning will be mediated by strong
      organizational characteristics and a robust enabling infrastructure supporting safety
      planning.

    <description>Consistent with the parent ED-SAFE, a completed suicide screen will be defined as any chart documentation of the presence OR absence of suicidal ideation AND presence or absence of a past suicide attempt (0 = None documented, 1 = Partial (+/- ideation OR attempt noted), 2 = Complete (+/- ideation AND attempt noted). The proportion of general ED patients with a complete screen within each study phase will comprise the primary clinician-level outcome for analyses pertaining to screening (Aim 1). Sensitivity analyses will expand the definition to partial OR complete screens.</description>
