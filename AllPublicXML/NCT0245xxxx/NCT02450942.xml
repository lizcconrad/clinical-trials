    <textblock>
      This is an open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography) study for investigation of radiation dosimetry, plasma pharmacokinetics,
      biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 18F-FDS in healthy volunteers and
      patients with suspected infection. A single dose of nearly 370 MBq 18F-FDS will be
      intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and patients with suspected infection. Visual
      and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of blood
      pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be collected from the
      volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.

      In clinical microbiology, pathogenic enterobacteriaceae are differentiated from other
      organisms by selectively metabolizing sorbitol. They exclusively express the enzyme
      sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the enzyme responsible for initiating sorbitol
      metabolism. 2-[18F]-fluorodeoxysorbitol (18F-FDS) is a positron-emitting analog of sorbitol.
      The substitution of the hydroxyl group by fluorine at the C-2 position, however, completely
      abrogates the recognition by mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase.18F-FDS could be a suitable
      probe to selectively label and tomographically image enterobacteriaceae in vivo.

      For further interests in clinical translation of 18F-FDS, an open-label dynamic whole-body
      PET/CT study was designed to investigate radiation dosimetry, plasma pharmacokinetics,
      biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 18F-FDS in healthy volunteers and
      patients with suspected infection. A single dose of nearly 370 MBq 18F-FDS will be
      intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and patients with suspected infection. Visual
      and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of blood
      pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be collected from the
      volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.

                  Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosing infection. They rely on a combination of
                  clinical, radiological, operative, microbiological, and histological findings, in
                  addition to results of other laboratory tests, such as the white blood cell
                  count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein value.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females planning to bear a child recently or with childbearing potential

          -  Renal function: serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (270 μM/L)

          -  Liver function: any hepatic enzyme level more than 5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast.

          -  Patients not able to enter the bore of the PET/CT scanner.

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time because of cough, pain, etc.

          -  Inability to complete the needed examinations due to severe claustrophobia, radiation
             phobia, etc.

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.
