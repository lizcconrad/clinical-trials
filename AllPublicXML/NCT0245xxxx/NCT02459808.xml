      Constipation is a common condition among patients with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. It is
      believed, that the constipation is caused by autonomic neuropathy. However, the severity of
      the constipation, and its relation to autonomic function have not previously been studied.

    <description>Linear regression with GITT as dependent variable, and high frequency power spectral density analysis of the heart rate (HF) as the independent variable. The mean HF of the first and second HRV measurement is used for this regression.</description>
