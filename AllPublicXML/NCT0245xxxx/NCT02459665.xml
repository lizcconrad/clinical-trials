    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to prepare for larger clinical trials. Sixty HIV-negative,
      non-pregnant, sexually active women aged 18-45 with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by Amsel
      criteria and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) on wet mount or by culture will be treated using
      oral metronidazole for 7 days. After successful treatment, and when they are free of vaginal
      candidiasis, other curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and urinary tract infection
      (UTI)), they will be randomised to 4 different vaginal microbiome (VMB) maintenance
      interventions (15 per group) within 3 days of completing oral metronidazole treatment: 1)
      Behavioral 'vaginal practices cessation and safer sex' counselling only (control); 2)
      Behavioral counselling plus 500mg metronidazole pills twice per week for two months; 3)
      Behavioral counselling plus Ecologic Femi vaginal capsule, once per day for 5 days
      immediately after oral metronidazole treatment followed by thrice weekly, for two months; 4)
      Group 4: Behavioral counselling plus Gynophilus vaginal tablet, once every 4 days for two
      months. In all 3 biomedical intervention groups, vaginal product use may be ceased
      temporarily during menstruation. Participants will be asked to adhere to the interventions
      for 2 months, and VMB assessments will take place before (screening and enrolment visits),
      during (Day 7, Month 1 and Month 2 visits), and after the interventions (Month 6 visit).
