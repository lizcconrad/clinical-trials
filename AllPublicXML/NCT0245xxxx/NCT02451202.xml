  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown the impact of deep neuromuscular paralysis and using a novel agent, sugammadex
      as an reversal in endolaryngeal surgery.

      We will conduct a clinical study aiming to compare two treatment strategies; Deep
      neuromuscular Blockade and moderate Neuromuscular Blockade. We hypothesize that deep NMB will
      offer better stillness. We will also descriptively examine if patients would be safely
      discharged from a recovery room.

    <description>After initial doses of 0.6 mg Rocuronium, a continuous infusion can be initiated to maintain 0 responses to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation or 1-2 responses to Post-Tetanic Count (PTC) (Deep NMB). The pump rate will vary and depends on the PTC value. The initial pump rate will be set at 0.5 mg/kg per hour. In case of a deviation from the required PTC value the pump rate can be increased or decreased. This was left to the discretion of the attending anaesthetist. Deep NMB should be maintained throughout the operation.
The infusion of Rocuronium will be discontinued and Sugammadex will be given 4 mg/kg at the end of surgery, which is from deep NMB (PTC = 1-2).</description>

    <description>After evidence of early spontaneous recovery (&lt; 10% of control T1) from initial doses of 0.6 mg rocuronium, a continuous infusion can be initiated to maintain 1 to 2 responses to train-of-four stimulation (Moderate NMB). The initial pump rate will be set at 0.5 mg/kg per hour. In case of a deviation from the required TOF value the pump rate can be increased or decreased. This was left to the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist. Moderate paralysis should be maintained throughout an operation.
At the end of surgery, the infusion of Rocuronium will be discontinued and Sugammadex 2 mg/kg via bolus injections]will be administered at least reappearance of T2.</description>

At the end of surgery, continuous infusion Rocuronium and Propofol are discontinued and paralysis will be simultaneously reversed by Sugammadex 4mg/kg from PTC 1-2.</description>
