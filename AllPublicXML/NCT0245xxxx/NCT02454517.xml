    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies a diet and exercise program based on the Diabetes
      Prevention Program to promote weight loss and improve health in men with low-risk or
      low-intermediate-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. A lifestyle intervention that
      promotes weight loss may influence prostate health. A combined diet and exercise program that
      is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program may affect markers (or &quot;biomarkers&quot;) of prostate
      cancer progression. Gathering this information may help doctors understand how obesity
      affects prostate cancer progression and may help lead to a program that can reduce the risk
      of prostate cancer progression.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention (versus [vs.]
      control) improves serum fasting glucose.

      II. To test whether the DPP lifestyle intervention (vs. control) improves serum biomarkers of
      glucose regulation (insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], IGF binding
      protein 3 [IGF-BP3] and adiponectin).

      III. To test whether the DPP lifestyle intervention decreases the levels of insulin receptor
      or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue epithelium
      on follow-up prostate biopsy.

      IV. To test whether PCa patients randomized to the DPP lifestyle intervention sustain the
      lifestyle changes for at least 6 months after the end of the intervention period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the DPP lifestyle intervention improves health-related quality of
      life.

      II. To evaluate whether the DPP lifestyle intervention effects on pathologic features of
      follow-up prostate biopsies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients meet with a nutritionist 11 times during the first 6 months to receive the
      structured diet and exercise instruction. Participants complete exercise sessions supervised
      by an exercise specialist, and will wear a heart rate monitor periodically during the study.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral and written information based on general U.S. dietary and
      physical activity guidelines along with a 20-30 minute individual session with a dietitian
      and a goal of 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <time_frame>Baseline (6 months prior to randomization) to follow-up surveillance biopsy (6 months post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>Global assessment of intervention effects will be evaluated using a two-sided t-test (or Wilcoxon rank sum test). Linear regression will be used to assess associations of IR, IGF-1R, and AKT expression with systemic measures of glycemic control at 6 months. Exploratory analyses will also evaluate associations between adverse pathology, biomarkers of glycemic control and IR/IGF-1R/AKT expression.</description>

    <description>Global assessment of intervention effects will be evaluated using a two-sided t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test if normality of the measurement is questionable (as determined by QQ-normal plots). Further analysis will quantify effects of patient age, body mass index (BMI) and other body composition measures on change in fasting glucose using linear regression. Differential effects between intervention and control arms will be quantified using interaction terms. All analyses will compare effects based on intention-to-treat.</description>

    <measure>Sustainability of beneficial changes in weight and glucose regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after active intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) research group will be followed for characterization of sustained weight loss as maintenance of a 7% reduction in weight and sustained glucose regulation as maintenance within 5% of 6-month levels. The subset of participants who did and did not achieve this goal both separately and combined will be evaluated. A one-sample test of proportions will be used to determine whether the proportion of participants that are able to sustain lifestyle changes differs from zero.</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life (HRQOL), namely urinary and sexual quality of life (QOL) and bother</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention effects will be evaluated using a two-sided t-test, and models will be adjusted for age, socioeconomic status (SES), marital status, and baseline BMI. The minimally important difference for the HRQOL instruments will be a mean difference of at least 5 points.</description>
