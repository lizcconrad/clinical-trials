  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this experiment is:

      To determine if nicotine chewing gum will improve acute episodes of orthostatic hypotension
      in PD subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to sit and rest for 10 minutes. Blood pressure will be taken in this
      resting position after the 10 minutes.

      After all inclusion criteria has been met, subjects will then wear an automated BP cuff and
      be administered 4mg of nicotine gum (Nicoretteâ„¢). They will be instructed to use it according
      to manufacturer's directions and remain chewing the gum for 30 minutes. The subject will
      remain in a seated position and BP and HR will be recorded every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.
      After 30 minutes the gum will be removed and subjects will still have HR and BP monitored in
      the seated position for another hour every 10 minutes. All values will be compared to
      pretreatment values. After 120 minutes if the subject is non-symptomatic, they can go home.
