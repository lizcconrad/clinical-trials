    <textblock>
      An intervention consisting of group and home based exercise will be used over 6 months to
      assess whether this is helpful in managing urinary incontinence in elderly village women in
      Bangladesh. This intervention, supplemented by education about managing incontinence, will be
      used in half the villages in the trial. In the other half women will receive only the
      education component.

    <description>Women will be included in group mobility and pelvic floor exercise classes for one and a half hours twice weekly for 12 weeks and encouraged to carry out independent exercises each day when there is no group session.
A research paramedics will meet with the woman each month for six months from the initial training session to encourage her continued participation and adherence to the individual exercise program. At this meeting the research paramedic will also provide and reinforce simple education about how to manage urinary incontinence.</description>
