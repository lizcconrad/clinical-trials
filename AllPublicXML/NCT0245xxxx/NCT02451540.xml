  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the efficacy of Roflumilast in addition to LAMA/LABA therapy will be assessed
      using Functional Respiratory Imaging.

      In total 40 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, Global Initiative for
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages C and D, who are stable on LABA/LAMA therapy
      and who are prone to dynamics hyperinflation will be included in this study. To indicate the
      susceptibility to dynamics hyperinflation patients should have a baseline Borg Fatigue score
      after the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) above 4.

      The patients will be randomized in such a way that 1 out of 2 patients will receive placebo
      and 1 the active component.

      Image parameters will be assessed and the correlation with lung function and health related
      quality of life will be checked before and after treatment.
