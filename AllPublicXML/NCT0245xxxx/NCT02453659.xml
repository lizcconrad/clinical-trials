    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop and disseminate an efficacious,
      group-based distress tolerance treatment for weight concern (DT-W) that will significantly
      increase smoking cessation rates among women. The objective of this project is to conduct a
      preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 60) comparing DT-W to a Health Education
      (HE) comparison intervention, in which both groups also receive standard behavioral smoking
      cessation treatment (ST) including counseling and transdermal nicotine patch (TNP), and
      examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of DT-W in improving smoking
      outcomes at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.
