      This is a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and
      Pharmacokinetics of CM082 tablets in Chinese Patients With wet-AMD. Patients will receive one
      of four doses for up to four weeks. Single/multiple dose pharmacokinetics in these patients
      will be studied. At the end of four weeks, investigator will evaluate safety and tolerability
      and decide whether to continue treatment for a total of six months to further evaluate safety
      and preliminary efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with AMD, as evidenced on
             fluorescein angiography (FA) and OCT.

          -  Patients with either no previous anti-VEGF therapy or prior anti-VEGF therapy with
             evidence of response to treatment and the need for additional treatment.

          -  Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA 20/40 to 20/320 in the study
             eye(s).

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functions.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent, comply with the investigational
             study protocol and return for all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) as evidenced on Indocyanine
             Green Angiography (ICG).

          -  Previous treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT), external beam radiation, subfoveal
             focal laser photocoagulation, submacular surgery, or transpupillary thermotherapy.

          -  CNV due to causes other than AMD, including ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid
             streaks, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal rupture, or pathologic myopia.

          -  Geographic atrophy involving the foveal center in the study eye.

          -  Any retinal vascular disease or retinal degeneration other than AMD in the study eye.

          -  Any significant disease in the study eye that could compromise best-corrected visual
             acuity.

          -  Cataract surgery in the study eye within three months of screening.

          -  Trabeculectomy or aqueous shunt or valve in the study eye.

          -  Use of any investigational agent or participation in any other clinical trial of an
             investigational agent or investigational therapy within thirty (30) days of baseline.

          -  Females of child bearing potential that are pregnant or not using medically acceptable
             contraception; males unwilling to take adequate contraceptive measures.

          -  Serious allergy to or prior significant adverse reaction to fluorescein.

          -  Undiagnosed acute illness first observed during screening or between screening and
             baseline, or severe concurrent medical conditions that, in the investigators judgment,
             represent a safety concern.

          -  Severe cardiac disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, acute
             coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization, or
             arterial thrombosis within 12 months of start of study drug, inadequately controlled
             hypertension, or ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring ongoing treatment.

             CM082.

          -  Serious active infection, other serious medical condition or any other condition that
