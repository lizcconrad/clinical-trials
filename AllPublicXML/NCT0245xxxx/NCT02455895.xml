    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of Novabay iLid Cleanser, as compared to its
      Vehicle, on the ocular skin flora.

      In the pre-randomization phase, subjects will receive a single application of open-label
      NovaBay iLid Cleanser.

      In the randomization phase of Stages 1 and 2, subjects will self-treat with masked
      Investigational Product twice daily for ten (10) days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive design, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel group study with two treatment arms: NovaBay iLid Cleanser (&quot;Cleanser&quot;) and Cleanser
      Vehicle (&quot;Vehicle&quot;).

      The study will be conducted in two Stages, each preceded by a pre-randomization phase.
      Randomization of Cleanser:Vehicle will be 1:1 and 2:1 in Stages 1 and 2 respectively.

      In the pre-randomization phase for Stages 1 and 2, subjects who meet all inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will be evaluated by clinical examination at a single visit prior to
      having ocular skin specimens taken before and after treatment with open-label Cleanser.

      In the randomization phase for both Stages 1 and 2, subjects who meet all inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will be randomized and evaluated at three visits:

        -  Visit 1: Screening, Day 1

        -  Visit 2: Day 11 (+2) End of Treatment (EOT)

        -  Visit 3: Day 18 (±2) Post Treatment Evaluation/Exit Subjects will have ocular skin
           specimens taken at Visit 1, Day 1. The specimens will be collected before and 20 minutes
           after the first application of the study Investigational Product performed by study
           personnel.
