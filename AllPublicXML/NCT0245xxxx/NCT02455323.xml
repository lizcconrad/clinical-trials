      Object: The present study aims to assess the quality of life of patients suffering from
      tension-type headache (TTH) treated for 4 weeks with different manual therapy-based
      techniques.

      Methods: The study design involved a factorial, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of
      76 subjects. They were divided into 4 groups: suboccipital inhibitory pressure was applied to
      the first group; suboccipital spinal manipulation was applied to the second group; a
      combination of the two treatments was applied to the third group; and the fourth group was a
      control group. Quality of life was assessed using the SF-12 questionnaire (both overall and
      in its different dimensions) at the beginning and at the end of treatment, and after one
      month as a follow-up.

    <description>To assess the subject's quality of life, we applied the health status questionnaire SF-12v2 (Short Form 12 Health Survey) which has shown to be highly reliable. This questionnaire has been adapted to the Spanish context by Alonso et al. and Monteagudo et al.</description>

    <description>Suboccipital inhibitory pressure technique. According to this technique, the suboccipital musculature is palpated until contact is made with the posterior arch of the atlas, and progressive and deep gliding pressure is applied, pushing the atlas anteriorly. The occiput rests on the hands while the atlas is supported by the fingertips. Finger pressure must be maintained for 10 minutes to produce the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the suboccipital soft tissues.</description>

    <description>Suboccipital inhibitory pressure technique. This technique is performed along an imaginary vertical line passing through the odontoid process of the axis. No flexion or extension and very little lateroflexion are used. Application is bilateral. First, cephalic decompression is performed lightly, followed by small circumductions. Selective tension is applied to take up tissue slack and create a firm joint barrier. Manipulation is then performed with rotation towards the manipulated side in a helicoidal cranial movement. This technique is designed to correct a generalized dysfunction with the aim of restoring occiput, atlas, and axis joint mobility.</description>

The occiput rests on the hands while the atlas is supported by the fingertips. Finger pressure must be maintained for 10 minutes to produce the therapeutic effect of inhibiting the suboccipital soft tissues. The aim is to suppress spasm of the muscles and in general of the suboccipital soft tissues which are responsible for any dysfunctional mobility of the occiput, atlas, or even the axis.</description>
