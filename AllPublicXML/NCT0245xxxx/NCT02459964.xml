  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare fentanyl nasal spray with a standard
      drug given by vein (hydromorphone hydrochloride) to help reduce pain related to cancer in
      patients coming to the emergency department.

      Study Groups and Drug Administration:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group
      is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant will have an equal chance of
      being in either group:

        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will receive the fentanyl nasal spray. The study
           staff will help participant use the nasal spray.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, the emergency center nurse will give them the
           hydromorphone hydrochloride by vein.

      Study Procedures:

      Participant will stay in the emergency department for at least 4 hours and will be monitored
      after receiving fentanyl or hydromorphone hydrochloride. During this time, participant will
      be asked about their pain and any side effects they may be having every 15 minutes for 2
      hours and then every 30 minutes for another 2 hours. The study staff will also monitor
      participant's vital signs, and ask them a few more questions at the end of the study.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Although participant will stay in the emergency department for at least 4 hours, the average
      length of stay for participants with severe pain is about 9 hours. When participant is
      discharged from the emergency department or admitted to the hospital, their active
      participation in the study is over.

      Follow-Up Phone Call:

      About 24 hours after patient's active participation is over, the study nurse will call them
      to ask if they had any other side effects since taking part in the study. The phone call
      should last about 5 minutes. If participant is still an inpatient at the hospital, the study
      nurse may visit them and ask them these questions in person.

      This is an investigational study. Hydromorphone hydrochloride is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of pain. Fentanyl nasal spray is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of pain. Its use to help with cancer pain in the
      emergency department is investigational.

      Up to 84 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Non-Inferiority of Nasal Fentanyl versus Hydromorphone Hydrochloride: mean change in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for another 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in pain intensity from treatment initiation until one hour after treatment initiation compared between the two arms. Non-inferiority evaluated by testing whether the lower bound of the 90% CI for difference in pain change scores is greater than -0.9, the margin of equivalence. Specifically, the mean change in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (assessed on an 11-point Likert scale with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain) from treatment initiation to one hour post-initiation calculated for both groups. Group difference in pain change scores (mean pain change in the fentanyl group minus that in the IV hydromorphone group) and the associated two-sided 95% CI for the difference estimated. Non-inferiority of nasal fentanyl over IV hydromorphone concluded if the lower bound of the 90% CI around the estimated difference in pain score change lies above -0.9 points.</description>

    <time_frame>1 hour after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary efficacy endpoint is the change in NRS pain scores from randomization to one hour after randomization, summarized using mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum values. A two-sample t-test used to assess group difference in pain score change. In addition, analysis of covariance used to determine whether significant differences exist between the nasal fentanyl and IV hydromorphone groups in pain intensity scores at one hour post randomization with treatment group (fentanyl vs. IV hydromorphone) and baseline pain intensity included as independent variables.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cancer patients with severe pain (i.e., &gt;=7 on NRS, see Table 1) already on opioid
             therapy for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day, 25 mcg of
             transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg of oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg
             oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

          2. Ability to give informed consent before any trial-related activities (Trial-related
             activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during normal
             management of the subject.)

          3. Ability and willingness to communicate the intensity of pain using NRS at the
             frequency dictated by the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatic
             encephalopathy

          2. Inability to give informed consent

          3. Known or suspected hypersensitivity or intolerance to fentanyl or hydromorphone or
             excipients in the study medications

          4. Patients with sinusitis, obstruction of nasal passages, nasopharyngeal cancer,
             paranasal sinus malignancies, or any conditions in the nasopharyngeal anatomical area
             that may affect the absorption of fentanyl nasal spray.

          5. Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intending to become pregnant. This
             exclusion criterion will be assessed by questioning the patient about the pregnancy
             status, breast-feeding status, the intent to become pregnant, the menopausal status,
             and the date of the last menstrual period.

          6. Females of child-bearing potential, who are not using adequate contraceptive measures
             (including condoms, birth control pills, intrauterine devices, contraceptive implants,
             or other US FDA-approved contraceptives)

          7. Previous participation in randomization in this trial

          8. Has taken oral immediate release opioids within 4 hours prior to arrival.
