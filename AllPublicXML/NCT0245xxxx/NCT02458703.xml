  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are a rare vascular condition affecting the
      lungs. PAVMs lead to low blood oxygen levels, yet are very well tolerated by patients. This
      study will examine the exercise capacity of PAVM patients using formal cardiopulmonary
      exercise tests performed on a stationary bicycle, and whether this is affected by the
      presence of concurrent airflow obstruction, such as due to asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that the lung is the site at which oxygen enters the blood stream, diffusing
      from the alveolar air sacs into the pulmonary capillaries. This newly oxygenated blood is
      carried to the heart in the pulmonary veins, then passes into the systemic circulation to
      provide oxygen to the tissues.

      Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have abnormal vascular
      connections between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins in the lung. Blood flowing through
      PAVMs therefore bypasses the oxygenation sites in the pulmonary capillaries. Low blood oxygen
      levels (hypoxemia) is frequent in PAVM patients but breathlessness (dyspnea) is not. The
      investigators have shown that dyspnea was not a common presenting complaint in a large UK
      series, and that there is little correlation between severity of dyspnea in PAVM patients,
      and blood oxygen levels.

      In this study the investigators will address the question &quot;Do PAVM patients have lower
      exercise tolerance if they have concurrent airflow obstruction?&quot; The primary outcome measure
      will be the total body oxygen consumption in mls/min/kg, at peak exercise (the V[dot]O2 peak
      (also known as &quot;VO2 max&quot;)).

      The investigators will address this by first performing standardised cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing, as used in the clinic and our previous study (11/H0803/9), on age and sex matched
      patients with PAVMs. 30 will be recruited with airflow obstruction, and 30 without airflow
      obstruction. Physiological parameters will be compared, to test the null hypothesis that the
      impact of exercise on PAVM patients' cardiopulmonary systems does not differ according to the
      presence or absence of airflow obstruction. Cellular and molecular methods will be used to
      dissect mechanistic pathways.

    <description>Of the many measurements and derived indices that can be measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the peak consumption of oxygen (VO2 max) is perhaps the best indicator of integrated cardiorespiratory capacity. The principle research question will therefore test the null hypothesis that &quot;The VO2 max does not differ between PAVM patients with and without airflow obstruction.&quot;</description>

    <description>Subjects will have the test in the Exercise Suite of Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. They will have painless skin probes placed on their fingers, chest, and legs to monitor heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen levels, and oxygen delivery during the test. Subjects will also be shown how to breathe through a mouthpiece with a nose clip on, and how to indicate on a sliding device whether they feel breathless. They will then start cycling against a very low resistance at a steady speed. As long as they feel comfortable, there will be a gradual increase in work load until they feel they cannot keep going at the same speed. They can also stop sooner for any reason. Afterwards, while they are &quot;cooling down&quot;, they will fill in a short questionnaire describing how they feel. 20-30mls of blood will be taken for analysis.</description>
