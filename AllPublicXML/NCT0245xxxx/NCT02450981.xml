      This clinical study is a phase 1 study which carried out to to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of BCD-021(bevacizumab
      biosimilar candidate manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) when used in patients with
      neovascular wet age-related macular degeneration.

      BCD-021-1 is an open label, non-comparative, non-randomized, multicenter phase 1 clinical
      study evaluating pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal
      injections of BCD-021 (bevacizumab biosimilar, CJSC BIOCAD) when given in patients with
      exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration.

      The study will enrol 10 patients with confirmed neovascular wet age-related macular
      degeneration. Before inclusion into the active phase of the study, patients will undergo a
      diagnostic examination during the screening period with a maximum duration of 28 days.

      The principal part of the study includes the period from the first intravitreal injection and
      until 28 days after the third intravitreal injection. The goal of this stage is to evaluate
      pharmacokinetics, the safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of BCD-021
      (CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) when used in patients with neovascular wet age-related macular
      degeneration.

      Extension phase of the study (month 4 - month 12) is required to assess the long-term effects
      of the therapy and get full information about the immunogenicity of the study drug.
