  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rare diseases frequently affect women of childbearing age. Pregnancy in these women has
      become less rare, but remains associated with high levels of complications. One obstacle to
      their optimal management during pregnancy is that there are no prospective studies of
      pregnancy during rare diseases and several connective tissue diseases. As a consequence, the
      management of these pregnancies is non-standardised in terms of treatment, monitoring
      (frequency of consultations, laboratory tests and ultrasound), and organisation of care.

      Moreover, although these women (all diseases combined) are frequently exposed to medications
      potentially incompatible with pregnancy, little is known about the frequency of these
      exposures and especially their consequences to mother and child.

      For these reasons, researchers and clinicians from different specialties created an
      interdisciplinary research group on pregnancy and rare diseases (GR2), intended to improve
      the management of these patients' pregnancies. Using a single computer server, the
      investigators plan to set up a large prospective study of pregnancies in patients with rare
      diseases: various forms of myositis, lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Sjogren syndrome,
      scleroderma, and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The investigators objective is to analyse
      the complications of pregnancies in women with rare diseases and then to improve their
      management and their quality of life.
