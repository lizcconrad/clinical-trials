      A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the extent to
      which lifestyle was associated with osteoporosis among the Chinese population by using
      self-reported questionnaire methods. More than 3000 participants were recruited in
      communities in Shanghai. Data involved in demographic information, lifestyle, dietary habits,
      medical history and clinical biomarkers were collected. Every participants were measured bone
      mineral density (BMD g/cm2) at calcaneus by standardized quantitative ultrasound (QUS,
      Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) utilizing T-scores based on WHO criteria. A standard
      statistical analysis including univariate and multiple variables regression analysis to
      explore the risk or preventive factors involved in Chinese lifestyle associated with
      osteoporosis.

    <description>The bone mineral density (BMD g/cm2) was measured at calcaneus by standardized quantitative ultrasound (QUS, Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) utilizing T-scores based on WHO criteria, which were obtained from the automated equipment. T-score refers to the ratio between patient's BMD and that of young adult population of same sex and ethnicity. T-score of &gt; -1 was taken as normal, between -1 and -2.5 osteopenic and &lt; -2.5 as osteoporotic.</description>

        We performed a risk-factor study for osteoporosis using a random sample of the Chinese
        population. Participants were recruited from rural and urban communities in Shanghai.
        Survey participants aged 30-90 years were included in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants aged 30-90 years were recruited from rural and urban communities in
             Shanghai.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Some participants with chronic diseases and conditions that might potentially affect
             bone mass, structure, or metabolism were excluded. Briefly, the exclusion criteria
             were as follows: a history of

               1. serious residual effects of cerebral vascular disease;

               2. serious chronic renal disease (Glomerular filtration rate - GFR &lt; 30
                  mL/min/1.73m2);

               3. serious chronic liver disease or alcoholism;

               4. significant chronic lung disease;

               5. corticosteroid therapy at pharmacologic levels;

               6. evidence of other metabolic or inherited bone disease, such as hyper- or
                  hypoparathyroidism, Paget disease, osteomalacia, or osteogenesis imperfecta;

               7. recent (within the past year) major gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic
                  ulcer, malabsorption, chronic ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, or
                  significant chronic diarrhea;

               8. Cushing syndrome;

               9. hyperthyroidism; and

              10. any neurologic or musculoskeletal condition that would be a non-genetic cause of
                  low bone mass.
