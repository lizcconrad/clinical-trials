  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baseline self-report outcome measures will be completed and additional assessments will occur
      mid-treatment , post-treatment , 3 months following completion of all sessions, and 6 months
      following completion of all sessions. Patients and therapists will complete the evaluation
      measures in private (at home, in an office).

      At the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, BBI treatment is offered in group and
      individual formats. The course of individual treatment varies and group treatment consists of
      10 1.5-hour weekly sessions in the &quot;intensive&quot; phase, followed by 2 1.5-hour bi-weekly
      maintenance sessions. Individual treatment is one-on-one. In group treatment, there are
      typically 6-12 patients per group and 1 or 2 therapists. The intervention helps patients to
      learn adaptive coping strategies and how to apply them to daily stressors. Additional content
      discusses use of seeking information, enhancing social support, enhancing body esteem and
      intimacy, and maintaining positive changes.
