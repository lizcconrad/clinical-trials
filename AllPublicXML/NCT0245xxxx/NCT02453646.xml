    <textblock>
      A U.S. multi-centre post approval registry to analyse the CRBSI rate in patients with the
      NexSite HD Catheter for long term vascular access for hemodialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a U.S. multi - centre, prospective, non-randomized post approval registry.
      Approximately one hundred and twenty patients will be implanted with a NexSite HD catheter at
      four to eight U.S. sites where hemodialysis catheters are routinely implanted. Each site may
      enrol a maximum of 50 patients. Enrolled patients will be followed from device placement to
      device removal or 180 days post device placement. Patients will be enrolled once only.

      The primary endpoint is CRBSI rate related to the NexSite HD catheter. Determination of
      infection will be decided by the investigator and if necessary adjudicated by the CEC
      (Clinical Events Committee) based on blood culture results, regardless of whether the
      catheter is removed.

      Secondary endpoints for the study are

        -  Successful placement and continued use of the NexSite HD device designed for use in
           patients requiring long term hemodialysis.

        -  Healing of catheter exit site

        -  Tunnel Infections

        -  Exit site infections

        -  Early non-infectious complications associated with CVCs

        -  Late non-infectious complications associated with Central Venous Catheters

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient shall be 18 - 80 years old.

             administration of hemodialysis.

          3. The patient has anticipated survival in excess of 90 days from the anticipated date of
             catheter placement.

             procedure to create a graft or fistula) within the study timeframe.

         17. Any other condition that the Investigator believes should exclude the patient from the
