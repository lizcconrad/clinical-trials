      - This is a multi-center, AZD9291 expanded access protocol for the treatment of adult
      patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who have received prior EGFR TKI therapy and at least one additional line of therapy
      (â‰¥ 3rd line). Local testing is accepted for confirmation of T790 mutation status. Eligible
      patients will be enrolled to receive AZD9291 (80mg orally, once daily) for as long as the
      access program remains open and they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by
      the treating physician

             radiotherapy with confirmation of the presence of the T790M mutation

          -  Two lines of prior therapy including at least one EGFR TKI

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0-2.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must use adequate contraceptive measures, not be
             breast-feeding and have negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with AZD9291

          -  Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop use at least 1 week prior to receiving

             CYP3A4

          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, or significantly impaired bone marrow reserve
             or organ function, including hepatic and renal impairment, which in the clinician's
             opinion would significantly alter the risk/benefit balance, or active infection
             including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases who are neurologically unstable

          -  Past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis requiring steroid
             treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               1. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc using Fredericia's formula) &gt; 470 msec

               2. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of
                  resting ECG (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block,
                  second degree heart block)

               3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT
                  interval

          -  Any unresolved toxicity from prior therapy Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) &gt; grade 3 at the time of starting treatment in the access program

          -  History of hypersensitivity to AZD9291 (or drugs with a similar chemical structure or
             class to AZD9291) or any excipients of these agents

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of
