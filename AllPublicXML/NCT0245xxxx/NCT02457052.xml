    <textblock>
      When the seat is a vehicle for disabled person, postural adaptation methodology is known and,
      on prescription, there is possibility of financial support for technical posture assists. For
      people who use a standard seat, a chair for example, there is no satisfactory existing
      hardware.

      A transportable customisable and scalable sitting positioning device (DATP device), to be
      placed on a standard seat, is a solution that might fit in the home, in specialized foster
      homes or in institutions for the elderly. Such a device has been developed but earnings on
      swallowing disorders have to be validated.

    <description>Compare the laryngeal movement during swallowing in dysphagic population with DATP device compare to a population without device after one month of care.
At Visit 1, patients were included and randomized
1 month later the patients in both groups will be invited for specific education session positioning. The introduction of the device will be carried out before the meeting for patients DATP + group, which will include a training session in the use of DATP. Patients who have the DATP will be contacted by telephone within the first 15 days to verify compliance with the use of the device.
All patients returned 1 month for the last visit.</description>
