  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot study are to: (1) evaluate acute effects of biofeedback and
      mindfulness training on pain, anxiety, and stress during a hand therapy visit and (2) gain
      understanding of patient perceptions, preferences, and experiences with mind-body
      interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year more than $5.7 billion is spent on outpatient therapy, which is projected to grow
      6% annually over the next decade. Subsequently, healthcare reform is mandating more
      efficient, high-quality care to control spending. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to
      develop an integrative health intervention for hand therapy that improves efficiency,
      enhances outcomes and reduce costs. Biofeedback and mindfulness training are two mind-body
      interventions that can increase patient engagement and self-efficacy. No research has
      investigated the integration of these mind-body interventions into treatment for hand therapy
      patients. This pilot research will explore the acute effects of these techniques in hand
      therapy patients. This study utilizes a repeated-measures crossover design with 20
      participants to explore the effects of mindfulness training and the dynamic biofeedback with
      sonographic imaging on acute pain, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, the study will evaluate
      hand therapy patient preferences and perceptions of mind-body techniques. This
      patient-centered, clinical translational work will provide valuable feasibility data
      regarding the direct, acute effects of mind-body interventions to inform the development and
      further study of an integrative hand rehabilitation approach. This responds to a need for
      best practices for maximizing the mind-body connection and the call to investigate innovative
      uses of mindfulness to enhance patient outcomes.

    <description>The DASH Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any of several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The tool gives clinicians and researchers the advantage of having a single, reliable instrument that can be used to assess any or all joints in the upper extremity.</description>
