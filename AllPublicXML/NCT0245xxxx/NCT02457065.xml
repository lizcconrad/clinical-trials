  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A patient's sun-related behavior greatly influences the likelihood of that patient developing
      melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Prior research shows current education
      strategies on inducing preventative behaviors such as wearing sun-protection clothing and
      wearing sunscreen are inadequate at effectively changing behavior when used in isolation --
      patients are aware of the dangers of not engaging in these preventative measures but forgo
      them nonetheless.

      We are investigating methods to positively influence sun protection behaviors among melanoma
      survivors and their families. The first objective is to compare patient and familial sun
      exposure and cancer screening activity before and after patients' diagnosis with primary
      melanoma. The second objective is to note if hanging a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; plaque in a
      melanoma survivor's bathroom will significantly affect the survivor's and broader family's
      sun exposure and cancer screening activity.

      Our sample of patients consists of survivors of primary cutaneous melanoma less than 4.0 mm
      in depth who come through the Dermatology Clinic at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and
      voluntarily choose to participate in the study after being informed of the nature of the
      research. These patients complete a confidential survey assessing a change in sun exposure
      related activities immediately after their diagnosis. After they fill out the survey, we will
      ask them if they could nominate a family member to whom we will explain the purpose of our
      research and confidentially ask an additional set of questions to evaluate the broader impact
      of a melanoma diagnosis. From our original sample, we will randomly choose a few families who
      would display the survivor plaque in their primary bathroom. After six-twelve months, during
      the patient's follow up visit, will ask again both groups of patients and family members to
      fill out another survey to assess sun exposure related activity.

      On the surveys, no names are recorded. Everything is anonymous.
