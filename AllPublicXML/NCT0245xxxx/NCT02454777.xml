    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of high-intensity interval
      training in improving cardiovascular fitness in patients with stage I-III breast cancer
      undergoing chemotherapy with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab helps patients live longer, but may
      cause side effects to the heart. Aerobic exercise may help the heart function better, which
      may help protect it against side effects from trastuzumab. Exercise may also help reduce
      fatigue and prevent cancer from coming back. High-intensity interval training involves short
      bursts of higher intensity efforts with longer periods of recovery. This may also allow
      patients who cannot exercise for a long period of time to still be physically active. This
      trial studies whether patients can tolerate high-intensity interval training, and how well it
      works in improving fitness in patients with breast cancer receiving trastuzumab.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility (completion of &gt; 80% exercise sessions) of utilizing
      high-intensity interval training (HIT).

      II. To determine the effects of HIT on aerobic exercise adaptation when compared to delayed
      group.

      III. To examine the effects of HIT on left ventricular function when compared to delayed
      group.

      IV. To determine the effects of HIT on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and vascular
      atherosclerosis when compared to delayed group.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      ARM I: Participants undergo HIT over 30 minutes, thrice weekly for 8 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants maintain their current sedentary activity level (&lt; 60 minutes of total
      exercise per week) for 8 weeks. Participants document their weekly activity in an exercise
      log. Following completion of all study visits, participants are given the option to complete
      the HIT exercise program as in Arm I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at weeks 9 and 17.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of utilizing HIT under clinical trial conditions, assessed using participant attendance rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The exercise program will be considered feasible if participants complete greater than 80% of exercise sessions. Participant attendance rates will be used to establish compliance and will be used to provide a perspective on how and to what extent cancer patients will participate in an experimental exercise intervention and what variations in exercise intensities may be tolerated. Feasibility will be assessed based on both program attendance as well as exercise time completed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in aerobic exercise adaptation measured by the maximum volume of oxygen uptake (VO2peak) (ml/kg/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>A mixed-effect regression model will be fit to compare the mean changes in VO2peak (ml/kg/min) between groups. The effect of other covariates such as the menopausal age, severity of disease and the class of chemotherapy treatment and compliance rate on VO2peak (ml/kg/min) over time will also be examined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in left ventricular function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to week 17</time_frame>
    <description>A mixed-effect model will be fit to compare the mean changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, and peak filling time. The effect of other covariates such as the menopausal age, severity of disease and the class of chemotherapy treatment and compliance rate on left ventricular function over time will also be examined.</description>
