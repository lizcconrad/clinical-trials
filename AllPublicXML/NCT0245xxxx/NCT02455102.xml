  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate whether a newly designed
      electronic warning system will increase the initiation rate of adequate stroke preventive
      measures in patients with atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive stroke prevention
      therapy in line with the guidelines, in spite of the presence of an increased risk of stroke.
      It will be investigated whether an electronic alert to physicians, whose patients with atrial
      fibrillation do not receive stroke preventive measures, will increase the rate of adequate
      stroke preventive measures as compared to a control group of patients without an electronic
      alert. The electronic alerts will be sent if patients with atrial fibrillation but without
      adequate stroke preventive measures receive in-patient treatment at the University Hospital
      Bern. The electronic alert system includes a feature that helps the physicians in charge to
      evaluate the CHA2DS2VASC Score. At the end of the hospital stay medical discharge letters
      will be reviewed for initiation of adequate stroke preventive measures.
