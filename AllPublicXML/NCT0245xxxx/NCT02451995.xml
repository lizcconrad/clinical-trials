    <textblock>
      Tachycardia's (fast heart rhythms) can lead to troublesome palpitations, dizziness, blackouts
      and breathlessness. They are caused either by a cluster of abnormal cells within the heart,
      or an electrical short circuit which rotates rapidly around the heart. Sometimes these can be
      controlled with tablets, though owing to side effects many patients want something else. Many
      tachycardia's can be cured by a procedure known as an &quot;ablation&quot;. In essence, either the
      focus of abnormal cells or the narrowest point of the short circuit causing the abnormal
      heart rhythm (the source) is electrically destroyed (burnt) resulting in restoration of the
      normal heart beat.

      One form of tachycardia is known is Atrial Tachycardia (AT). These arise from the top two
      chambers of the heart (the atrium). Interestingly, this problem is frequently seen in
      patients who have previously undergone an ablation or surgical procedure for a condition
      called Atrial Fibrillation. In others the reason for its occurrence is unknown. Current
      strategies to find the &quot;source&quot; during an ablation procedure are technically challenging
      resulting in long procedure times. Sometimes the wrong source is found resulting in ablation
      at the incorrect site.

      Ripple Mapping (RM) is a novel system that Investigators at Imperial College are looking to
      study. RM displays electrical information within the heart as a series of bars coming out of
      the chamber, with each bar representing signals travelling down the heart. By seeing the
      pattern of electrical information, they believe it will show the pattern of the tachycardia
      better than conventional techniques. In a previous study that they conducted, RM found the
      source of the tachycardia in 80% of the maps, compared to only 50% with the current system.
      Investigators at Imperial College have identified why they did not get 100% and they believe
      that, in future, RM will find the source of the tachycardia first time, and every time.

      Conventional mapping strategies used to find the &quot;source&quot; of &quot;atrial tachycardia&quot; within the
      heart are technically challenging resulting in long procedure times. Sometimes the wrong
      source is found resulting in ablation at the incorrect site.

      In a retrospective study conducted by investigators at Imperial College, Ripple Mapping found
      the source of the tachycardia 80% of the time, compared to only 50% with conventional maps.
      They have since studied the reasons why did not achieve 100%, but could not improve matters
      with a retrospective dataset. They believe that, in future, Ripple mapping will find the
      source of the tachycardia first time, and every time. The purpose of this study is to
      prospectively test whether Ripple Mapping is better at finding the source of the &quot;atrial
      tachycardia&quot; (AT) than conventional mapping.

      Patients referred for clinically indicated AT ablation by their electrophysiologist will be
      recruited. For each patient recruited to the study, they will be block randomized into 2
      arms: Ripple Mapping guided AT substrate ablation, or Conventional AT guided Ablation
      (activation mapping and entrainment). Following explanation of the study the patients will be
      allowed time to decide on whether they would like to participate.

      Following completion of the consent procedure the patient will undergo the electrophysiology
      study as is routine standard practice. This is usually performed by inserting plastic tubes
      (catheters) into the heart using the vessels in the groin under local anaesthetic. Once the
      catheter is in the atrium (top chambers of the heart) the catheter will be moved to different
      locations in the chamber to gather the electrical information of the tissue. Using
      &quot;CARTO3v4&quot;, a 3D map of the geometry of the heart chambers will be constructed.

      Patient randomized to RM will proceed as follows: Once sufficient points have been collected,
      the Ripple Map will be played in order to diagnose the source of the tachycardia. The time to
      diagnosis will be recorded. The operator's confidence in their diagnosis will be defined in a
      4 point scale (Grade I High diagnostic confidence to Grade IV diagnosis Nondiagnostic).

      In the context of a grade 1 diagnosis, the operator can proceed to ablation at the defined
      source from the Ripple map.

      Termination of the tachycardia with ablation will be used to confirm the diagnosis was
      correct. The time to tachycardia termination will be recorded. Alternatively, a new map can
      be created if the operator cannot diagnose the source using the Ripple map. The operator is
      free to revert to conventional mapping approaches at any time.

      Patients randomized to conventional ablation will proceed according to standard practice of
      the operator (activation mapping and entrainment). When the operator is satisfied adequate
      number of points have been collected, the same Diagnostic Grading analysis will be used. Once
      again, ablation will be used to confirm the diagnosis in the context of a Grade 1 ablation.
      The key data to be compared includes:

        1. Diagnostic confidence with RM vs conventional mapping

        2. Tachycardia termination following first series of ablations with RM vs conventional
           mapping.
