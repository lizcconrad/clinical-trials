      The primary objectives of the LIFE Study are to demonstrate the clinical cost and benefits
      associated with using the Ovation Prime Abdominal Stent Graft System under the least invasive
      conditions defined in the Fast-Track EVAR protocol. The key elements of the Fast-Track EVAR
      protocol include: appropriate patient selection, bilateral percutaneous access, no general
      anesthesia, no ICU admission post procedure, and next day discharge.
