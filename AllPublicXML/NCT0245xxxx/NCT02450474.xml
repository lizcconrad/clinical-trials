  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death of dialysis patients and poor fluid
      management is associated with the increased risk. One of the principal limitations in
      avoiding chronic fluid overload in this patient group is the refilling rate the rate at which
      fluid is transferred from tissues into the vascular system. If this rate cannot match the
      prescribed rate of fluid removal during dialysis the patient will end up with chronic fluid
      overload.

      Two proposed methods of increasing the rate of refilling are intermittent pneumatic
      compression (IPC) devices, which increase the pressure of the fluid in tissue, and
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) which activates the muscle pump and lymphatic
      drainage.

      This investigation will trial the use of these two methods in patients suspected of having
      inadequate refilling rates. Outcome measures will be based on fluid status, presence of
      oedema and quality of life.
