  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate persistence of bactericidal antibodies for N.
      meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains approximately 4 years
      after primary vaccination in subjects who previously received a 2-dose series of
      MenABCWY+Outer membrane Vesicles (OMV) or a single dose of MenACWY, to evaluate immune
      response against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y and serogroup B test strains 30
      days after a dose of MenABCWY+OMV in previously vaccinated subjects, and 30 days after a
      2-dose series in vaccine-naive subjects of similar age, to evaluate kinetics of immune
      response at 3, 7, and 30 days after a booster dose of MenABCWY+OMV in previously vaccinated
      subjects and to explore differences in the kinetics of immune response 3, 7 and 30 days after
      an accelerated 2 dose series of MenABCWY+OMV separated by 30 days given to vaccine-naive
      subjects, and to assess immunogenicity of 2 doses of MenABCWY+OMV at Day 61 in vaccine-naive
      subjects and subjects who previously received one dose of MenACWY
