  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial study will assess the inflammatory response of brain tumors or
      other central nervous system conditions in pediatric and adult patients using
      ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI. Imaging features will be correlated with the number of inflammatory
      cells (macrophages) at histopathology. Determining the extent of inflammation associated with
      pathologies in the central nervous system may be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic
      purposes as well as monitoring treatment response of current and future immunotherapies.

    <textblock>
      In this study, we will establish the MR imaging characteristics of macrophages in malignant
      brain tumors and other CNS conditions in the pediatric and adult populations using
      ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle that is approved for
      the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. The
      investigators will correlate the MR signal of ferumoxytol uptake with the number of
      macrophages in surgical specimen at histopathology. This information may potentially offer
      clinicians a new means for risk stratification and monitoring treatment efficacy.

    <description>All subjects in the experimental arm will have a single intravenous dose of ferumoxytol (5 mg Fe/kg), to be administered 24 hours before the subject undergoes ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These subjects will subsequently undergo surgery, and tissue analysis of surgically resected samples (specifically the number of iron-containing and non-iron-containing macrophages) will be correlated with imaging features on ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with suspected brain tumor diagnosed by MRI

          -  Patients undergoing neuro-imaging evaluation by the neurosurgical service for other
             indications (e.g. vascular malformations, traumatic brain injury, ischemic and
             hemorrhagic stroke, CNS infections, and neuro-degenerative diseases)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent cannot be obtained either from the patient or legal representative

          -  Severe coexisting or terminal systemic disease that limits life expectancy or that may
             interfere with the conduct of the study

          -  Contraindication to MRI (metal implants)

          -  Hemosiderosis/hemochromatosis

          -  Need for sedation or anesthesia (claustrophobia) that will not otherwise be undertaken
             as part of routine clinical care (e.g. routine MRI under sedation already planned)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Feraheme (ferumoxytol) or any of its components

          -  Iron overload from any cause (not just hemosiderosis or hemochromatosis), even if
             secondary to frequent blood transfusions, severe chronic hemolysis, excess dietary or
             parenteral iron, or any other etiology
