    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of a supervised 12-week high-intensity aerobic interval
      exercise program (versus a self-directed exercise usual care group) on traditional and novel
      cardiovascular disease risk factors and surrogate markers of cardiovascular- and
      overall-mortality in a population-based sample of testicular cancer survivors.

    <description>Subjects in the exercise group will attend supervised exercise sessions three times a week, for 12 weeks. The exercise intervention will consist of uphill walking or jogging on a treadmill between 50% and 95% of VO2peak for 35 minutes (including a 5-minute warm up and cool down). The participants will complete four, 4-minute, high-intensity intervals at 85-95% of VO2peak. The work period intervals will be interspersed with three, 3-minute periods of active recovery at an intensity below that of their ventilatory threshold.</description>
