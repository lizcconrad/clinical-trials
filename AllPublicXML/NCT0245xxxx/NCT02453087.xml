  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of DCDS0780A in participants with relapsed or refractory
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the combination portion of the study, the safety and
      tolerability of DCDS0780A in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab will be assessed.
