  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized control trial is to investigate the efficacy of an adjunct
      positive airway pressure (PAP) nebulizer device known as &quot;AccuPAP&quot; in the treatment of
      moderate-severity acute asthma exacerbations in children ages 6 - 17 years in comparison with
      an institutional standard continuous dual-therapy nebulizer treatment.

      The investigators main goal, more specifically, is to determine if the additional positive
      airway pressure provided by the AccuPAP device when used in treating children with
      moderate-severity asthma exacerbations provides a more optimal delivery of bronchodilator
      therapy when compared to institutional standard protocol nebulizer delivery mask which does
      not employ the use of positive airway pressure in medication delivery. The investigators have
      determined that the change in a study-validated Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (AAIRS)
      which will be considered statistically significant for a patient is 2 points or greater after
      the first treatment has been completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard of care for acute asthma exacerbations in children involves immediate
      administration of an inhaled short acting beta agonist (SABA), most commonly Albuterol,
      paired with parasympatholytic (Ipratropium) both of which are administered via continuous
      nebulizer. Additionally, a course of oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroid such as
      methylprednisolone or decadron are also given to combat acute airway inflammation. Medical
      providers may also initiate the use of a respiratory support device that can range from
      supplemental oxygen delivered via nasal cannula (NC) and escalate to the use of Bi-level
      Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) or endotracheal intubation in order to increase delivery of
      medication to distal airways. Because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood,
      there have been ongoing studies on many fronts which are being undertaken to minimize
      morbidity, shorten hospitalization duration and more rapidly reduce a patient's level of
      respiratory distress.

      When nebulized medication is delivered to a patient with active bronchospasm it might not be
      immediately delivered to the smallest bronchioles and terminal airways which are most
      affected by bronchospasm causing air trapping and poor gas exchange. Current modalities rely
      on dilation of larger airways first thus allowing medication to diffuse passively to the
      smaller airways as dilation occurs down the bronchial tree. Medication delivery is passive
      and dependent upon the progressive relaxation of these larger airways before reaching the
      smaller airways which is the ultimate goal of nebulized therapies. The critical pressure
      required for medication to reach these obstructed airways and keep them stented open is
      higher than in an otherwise healthy individual due to the natural consequences of airway
      remodeling seen in asthmatics which includes narrowing of the diameter of the airways,
      increased atelectasis of hypoventilated areas, and overall increased ventilation-perfusion
      (V/Q) mismatch. The concomitant processes of mucous plugging also commonly seen in asthma
      further complicates the efficient distribution of these medications in a thoracic cross
      section. However, application of positive pressure in patients with obstructive airways
      diseases such as asthma has potential to increase air-trapping, dynamic hyperinflation, and
      auto-peep and, in turn, aggravate ventilation-perfusion mismatch, all of which has potential
      to delay clinical improvement. With these considerations, we seek to determine if the
      physiologic benefit of proposed improved bronchodilator delivery by using added positive
      airway pressure (ie, active delivery of medication) is of sufficient magnitude to provide
      overall benefit to patients with acute asthma exacerbation.

      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis through the following aim: To conduct a
      single-blinded (clinical team), randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of the
      AccuPAP device in comparison with the standard nebulizer to decrease acute exacerbation
      severity measured with the Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (AAIRS), an objective and
      validated asthma scoring system, at 0, 1 and 2 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary
      outcomes will include Emergency Department (ED) length-of-stay (LOS), general pediatrics
      floor hospitalization rate, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission rate, number of
      patients who do not improve with AccuPAP, and rate of relapse within 24 hours of discharge
      from the ED. The investigators propose that outcome of the study findings have potential to
      not only shorten hospital stay duration which is cost efficient but also decrease the burden
      of the disease process on patient by implementing improved medication delivery strategies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators will enroll children ages 6 - 17 years (inclusive) with a previous
             diagnosis of asthma who present in an acute exacerbation to the Pediatric Emergency
             Department.

          -  Patients will be evaluated using the Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (AAIRS)
             which has been validated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and is currently the
             standard of care when triaging patients with asthma.

          -  An included patient's severity of current exacerbation must be qualified using the
             AAIRS and fall in the moderate category of 7 to 11 points.

          -  Patients who have received nebulized bronchodilator medications at either a referring
             facility or at home will be included.

          -  Patients who present from a referring facility or Primary Care Physician (PCP) and
             have received systemic corticosteroids (SCS) within one hour of initial AAIRS scoring
             will also be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include the following: other medical conditions contributing
             to respiratory distress (e.g., pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, anaphylaxis),

          -  developmental delay or any impedance to following basic AccuPAP use instructions,

          -  any condition precluding a patient from receiving beta-agonist therapy (ie-
             predisposition to Supraventricular Tachycardia).

          -  Patients with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, recent facial, oral or skull
             surgery/trauma, history of esophageal surgery, known or suspected tympanic membrane
             rupture or other middle ear pathology, acute sinusitis, epistaxis, active hemoptysis
             or nausea will be excluded as these are contraindications for AccuPAP use.

          -  Patients who have received additional adjunctive therapies beyond repeated SABA and
             atrovent nebulizers or those who have received SCS greater than 1 hour prior to
             initial ED evaluation, those who have received intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion,
             or subcutaneous terbutaline or epinephrine will be excluded.

          -  Those patients whose parents are require a translator for consent will also be
             excluded (ie, exclusively Spanish speaking or other non-English speaking
             families/patients). The justification for this exclusion is that patients with
             respiratory distress often need rapid initiation of treatment and the delay that may
             be caused by coordination efforts required in order to obtain a translator for study
             consent and explanation may delay care for these patients and result in adverse
             outcomes that may potentially result in harm.
