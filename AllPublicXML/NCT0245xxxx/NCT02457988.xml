      A prospective series comparing care incorporating home monitoring and liver care coordination
      to conventional care for patients with cirrhosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemonitoring has been suggested to have potential benefits in patients with cirrhosis.
      However, to date, no prospective studies exist to support this idea. Hence, the investigators
      study would like to explore the use of home telemonitoring devices with vital sign capturing
      capabilities in recently-discharged patients with cirrhosis to decrease 30-day readmissions,
      mortality and costs.

      This is prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing two strategies of post-discharged
      care in patients with cirrhosis-related hospitalizations.

      First treatment arm will incorporate the Vivify home monitoring device into post hospital
      care.Home monitoring kits include a tablet with wireless internet and vital sign monitoring
      capabilities (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, weight and pulse oximetry if needed)
      and the device has the ability to trigger an alert to the &quot;liver care coordinator.&quot;

      Second treatment arm will continue the standard of care therapy that all post- hospitalized
      patients receive upon discharge, i.e. return to clinic appointments, education regarding any
      signs or worsening symptoms to watch for, as well as contact numbers to connect with their
      doctor or nurse.
