  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Individuals suffering from
      depression typically exhibit impairments in various mental abilities, such as the ability to
      effectively direct and control attention and the ability to switch between thinking about
      different things and concepts (commonly referred to as &quot;cognitive flexibility&quot;).

      Mindfulness meditation training is a technique which involves focusing one's awareness on the
      present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily
      sensations. It has been well documented to improve depressive symptoms and prevent recurrence
      of depressive episodes, yet little is known about how mindfulness does so and what are the
      underlying mental mechanisms involved. Here the investigators propose to examine the efficacy
      of an 8-week mindfulness training program in improving the ability to direct and control
      attention, as well as in cognitive flexibility.

      Individuals diagnosed with recurrent depression will undergo an 8-week mindfulness training
      program. Participants' depressive symptoms as well as their performance on measures of
      attention and cognitive flexibility will be examined. Participants will be assigned to
      mindfulness training or a wait-list control group. Half of the participants will be examined
      before and after the mindfulness training program and the other half will be tested 8-weeks
      apart and then begin their training.
