  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery for breast cancer is associated with significant pain. The serratus nerve block
      targets the interfascial plane either below or above the serratus muscle, blocking thereby
      the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. The purpose of this randomized
      controlled double-blinded study is to see whether the addition of a serratus nerve block to a
      general anesthesia results in a better postoperative pain control in patients undergoing
      surgery for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of severe acute postoperative pain after breast surgery is high. Regional
      anesthesia has the potential to provide superior pain relief with fewer side effects compared
      to standard systemic opioid therapy. The search for a regional anesthesia technique for
      breast surgery has been ongoing as this technique needs to be time efficient, relatively
      risk-free and also practicable in an out-patient setting. The serratus block is a promising
      technique that may combine these advantages.
