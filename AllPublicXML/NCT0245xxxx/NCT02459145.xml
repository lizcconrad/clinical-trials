      The general consensus in sports medicine demonstrates a graduated return to activity protocol
      for individuals with post-concussion syndrome. This is commonly practiced but there is
      insufficient literature to indicate evidence-based practice. This study will provide evidence
      of the effectiveness of the clinical gradual return to exercise protocols beginning after
      diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome through standardization and measurement of outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion is referred to as a mild form of traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that can result in
      temporary loss of consciousness, memory, or awareness. mTBI can also cause physiologic
      symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, headaches, vestibulo-ocular dysfunction, and balance
      errors. The majority of individuals with mTBI will fully recover within a 7-10 day period,
      although adolescents may require more time to recover than adults. The American Medical
      Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement on concussion management indicates
      that there are no standardized guidelines for return to school and return to play
      recommendations involve a graduated activity program once all symptoms have resolved.[1]
      Treatment varies amongst physicians, but it is widely held that a minimum of 5 days strict
      rest at home (specifically, no school, work, or physical activity) followed by a stepwise
      return to activity. Recent articles, however have questioned the validity of strict rest for
      that many days as for other similar injuries (whiplash) recommendations involve attempts to
      gradually resume normal activities of daily living.[2]

      Individuals whose concussion symptoms do not resolve within 7-10 days are considered to have
      post concussion syndrome (PCS) which is ill-defined and poorly understood, however the AMSSM
      describes the benefit of supervised progressive exercise programs that increase tolerance as
      symptoms permit. The protocols in the literature for adults involve assessing the maximum
      threshold at which symptoms are exacerbated then have individuals perform supervised exercise
      at 80% of that rate,[3, 4] however this has not been done in the pediatric population and
      most pediatric physicians instead perform graduated activity protocols starting at a lower
      thresholds and increasing unless an exacerbation occurs (SORT Level of Evidence C).[5, 6] It
      is proposed that the fundamental cause of PCS is physiological dysfunction that fails to
      return to normal after a concussion. Essentially patients with a concussion are in a state of
      sympathetic nervous system predominance. This results in the subsequent altering of autonomic
      function and impaired cerebral auto regulation.[7] Aerobic exercise training may help
      concussion-related physiological dysfunction because exercise increases parasympathetic
      activity, reduces sympathetic activation, and improves cerebral blood flow. Recent articles
      have compared rest to activity and found slower recovery from PCS in most of the rest
      groups.[8]

      The aim of this research is to provide documentation in the literature for an adolescent
      graduated activity protocol that is currently practiced in the University of Arizona
      Pediatric Sports Medicine Clinic.

    <description>Intervention involves exercise starting at 50% of maximum age-adjusted heart rate (MHR) for 10 minutes (warm-up and Recovery)_ plus 5 minutes of target heart rate per day 5 days a week for 2 weeks, supervised by the athletic trainer or parent. The protocol increases the intensity of target heart rate by 10% MHR and duration of 50% MHR by 2 minutes every 2 weeks if there is no symptom exacerbation. The exercise protocol includes treadmill speed and track minutes per lap conversion, rate of perceived exertion and talk test for each stage of exercise plus total time to execute for 5 days each week.</description>
