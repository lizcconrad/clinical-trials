    <measure>The Total Grade of Conjunctival Hyperemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperemia (Redness) was assessed using two different parts of the eye, the Bulbar and the Limbal. Hypemeria was measured using the Efron Scale in 0.5 step units. Grade 0= No Findings, Grade 1= Slight, Grade 2= Mild , Grade 3= Moderate and Grade 4 = severe. Hypermia was assessed in four regions of the eye (Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior). The total grade of Conjunctival Hypermia across all regions and grades is reported. The total grade can range from 0 to 8. Where a higher grade implies worsening conjunctival hypermia</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Lid Margin Staining Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Upper Lid Margin Staining was assessed using Fluorescein Staining and was measured on the Graded Scale is Grade 0: No Staining is present, Grade 1= 1% to 25% Stains, Grade 2= 26% to 50% Stains, Grade 3= 51% to 75% Stains, Grade 4 76% to 100% Stains. The percentage of eyes with upper lid margin staining for each Grade is reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Corneal Staining Area Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4- Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining Area Grade was assessed in throughout five (5) regions in the eye (Central, Nasal, Temporal, Inferior, Superior). Corneal Staining was Graded using the Efron scale from 0 to 4 in 0.1 unit steps and converted to a percentage of region that was stained. The average percent of region that was stained was calculated and reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult males or females age 40 to 70 and has full legal capacity to volunteer.

          2. The subject is a current spherical silicone hydrogel multifocal (SiHy) contact lens
             wearer (defined as a minimum of 2 days per week for at least 6 hours of Daily Wear
             contact lenses, for a minimum of one month prior to the study) and willing to wear the
             study lenses on a daily basis (defined as a minimum of 6 hours of wear per day) for
             the duration of the study.

          3. The subject must own a pair of wearable spectacles to wear when they cannot wear the
             study lenses.

          4. The subject's optimal vertexed spherical equivalent distance correction must be
             between +3.50 and -5.50 Diopters (D) (inclusive) in both eyes.

          5. Subjective refraction cylinder power must be less than or equal to 0.75 D in both
             eyes.

          6. Requires a reading addition of +0.75 D to +2.50 D in each eye.

          7. The subject must have distance and near visual acuity best correctable to logMAR 0.1
             (20/25) or better at both distance and near with subjective refraction for each eye.

          8. The subject must read and sign the Informed Consent form.
