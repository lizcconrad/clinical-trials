  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease, which affects an estimated 300,000 people in Ireland and over 50
      million people in the developed world, is responsible for a considerable burden of premature
      mortality and morbidity. All patients with chronic kidney disease are recommended low salt
      diets, i.e. less than a teaspoon of salt per day (which is &lt;5-6g of salt, which contains
      &lt;2-2.3g of sodium). The average intake in the general population is double the recommended
      intake, between 1-2 teaspoons per day, which is considered 'moderate' intake. In patients
      with hypertension, reducing from moderate (average) to low intake is associated with a small
      reduction in blood pressure. However, achieving this low target salt intake is difficult, and
      can have a negative knock-on effect on other healthy dietary factors and kidney hormones. In
      addition, there is no convincing research to show that patients with chronic kidney disease
      and normal blood pressure benefit from low salt intake. In fact, the small amount of research
      that does exist shows that the change in kidney function is the same in people who consume
      low salt diets (&lt;1 teaspoon) and moderate (1-2 teaspoons=average intake) salt diets.
      Moreover, there are some small studies that report that low-salt diets may increase the risk
      of death due to heart disease. Given that all patients with chronic kidney impairment are
      recommended a low-salt diet, it is important that we confirm that this recommendation truly
      benefits patients. In this randomized controlled trial, we hope to determine whether
      recommending a low salt intake, compared to average/moderate intake, is associated with a
      slower rate of decline in kidney function in patients with chronic kidney impairment. The
      results of this study will provide information to guide future research that will have
      critical implications for management of patients with chronic kidney disease.
