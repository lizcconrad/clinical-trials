  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MOMS Partnership aims to create &quot;MOMS Zones&quot; in New Haven neighborhoods where the hardest
      to reach families live. These &quot;MOMS Zones&quot; will have two unique features: (1) a MOMS &quot;Hub&quot; to
      deliver centralized mental health and family economic success services to the hardest to
      reach families living in New Haven's most impoverished neighborhoods, as measured by actual
      socio-economic status as well as by access to resources; (2) a neighborhood workforce of
      Community Mental Health Ambassadors (CMHAs--mothers who themselves live in New Haven). The
      MOMS Workforce Program and MOMS Mental Health Program will be offered at all three Hubs.

    <textblock>
      The MOMs workforce program will involve teaching, coaching, and supportive services for
      participants as they navigate their journeys to sustainable employment that pays a
      family-supporting wage. Participants will be guided through an individualized progression of
      services designed to increase their employability, to increase their ability to earn higher
      incomes in career-track employment, and to improve their chances of retaining jobs and
      advancing in them.

      The MOMS Mental Health program centers around a manualized Stress Management Course 8-class
      group treatment, delivered once per week. The course was adapted from &quot;The Mother and Child
      Course&quot; by Munoz and Le (2011) for the population of New Haven mothers who are served by the
      MOMS Partnership.
