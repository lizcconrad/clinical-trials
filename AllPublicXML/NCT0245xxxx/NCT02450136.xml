      This is a pilot study of Pazopanib in patients with FGFR2 Amplification or FGFR2 mutation
      Refractory solid tumors.

      This study is a single-arm, pilot study of Pazopanib in subjects with Refractory solid tumors
      harboring FGFR2 Amplification or FGFR2 mutation Pazopanib 800mg will be administered orally
      once a day 28 days.Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression.

      To investigate the efficacy of Pazopanib in subjects with Refractory solid tumors harboring
      FGFR2 Amplification or FGFR2 mutation.
