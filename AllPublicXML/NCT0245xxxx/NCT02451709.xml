      To determine whether electronic adherence monitoring with feedback and reminder alarms can
      improve adherence and health outcomes in childhood asthma.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether adding an electronic adherence monitor to inhaled
      steroids, and feeding this information back to patients and families can improve adherence
      and outcomes in childhood asthma. The devices will also sound twice daily reminder alarms to
      act as direct medication prompts. This intervention will be compared to a control group in
      which adherence is monitored, but with no feedback or alarms.

    <description>Standard education about importance of inhaled steroids and regular adherence to inhaled steroids after recruitment to study.
Randomized to receive an electronic adherence device ( activated smartinhaler or smartturbo - Nexus 6) with twice daily alarm reminders activated. Patient decides times, different times on weekdays and weekends if required. This device fitted to their regular preventer inhaler, patient aware of its presence and its purpose in the context of the study.
Reviewed in standard asthma clinic every 3 months for 12 months. At each clinic visit, adherence information downloaded from device and data shared with patient and family (feedback of adherence data). Discussion about adherence rates, and action planning for the next 3 months to improve adherence if necessary.</description>
