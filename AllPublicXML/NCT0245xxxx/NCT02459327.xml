  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests a comprehensive approach to the promotion of school readiness in low-income
      families, beginning shortly after the birth of the child, through enhancement of positive
      parenting practices (and when present, reduction of psychosocial stressors) within the
      pediatric primary care platform. The investigators do so by integrating two evidence-based
      interventions: 1) a universal primary prevention strategy (Video Interaction Project [VIP]);
      and 2) a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-up [FCU]) for families
      with infants/toddlers identified as having additional risks. VIP provides parents with a
      developmental specialist who videotapes the parent and child and coaches the parent on
      effective parenting practices at each pediatric primary care visit. FCU is a home-based,
      family-centered intervention that utilizes an initial ecologically-focused assessment to
      promote motivation for parents to change child-rearing behaviors, with follow-up sessions on
      parenting and factors that compromise parenting quality.

      Two primary care settings serving low-income communities in New York City, NY and Pittsburgh,
      PA will be utilized to test this integrated intervention in hospital-based clinics, providing
      information about translation across venues where one of the two interventions has been
      previously used alone.

      The investigators plan to test the VIP/FCU model in a randomized trial of 400 families
      utilizing parent surveys, observational data on parent-child interactions, and direct
      assessments of children's development, at key points during intervention follow-up. Analyses
      will address questions of program impact for the integrated program across all families and
      by key subgroups.

      The largest single contribution made by this study is to test whether an integrated primary
      and secondary/tertiary prevention strategy implemented in pediatric primary care can produce
      impacts on early school readiness outcomes, including social-emotional, pre-academic, and
      self-regulation. As such, this study has the potential to provide the scientific and practice
      communities with information about an innovative approach to promoting school readiness
      skills among low-income children.
