    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia have abnormal skin flush response to niacin, but the niacin skin
      test accuracy is not well studied in these patients. The study evaluated the niacin skin test
      accuracy in adult hospitalized schizophrenia patients and their first degree relatives,
      bipolar disorder patients, and healthy controls.

    <description>Skin response was assessed by a single physician every 5 minutes for 20 minutes after removal of the substance. The outcome assessor was not blinded to the applied solution dosages. The strength of the flushing reaction was classified as 0 = no redness, 1 = faint redness, 2 = distinct redness, and 3 = extreme or maximum redness.</description>
