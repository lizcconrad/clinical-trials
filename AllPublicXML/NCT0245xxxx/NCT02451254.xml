  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation confers up to 5-fold increased risk of stroke in the absence of valvular
      heart disease. Although epidemiological studies have linked various clinical and
      echocardiographic risk factors to stroke, the exact mechanism of increased risk of stroke in
      AF remains poorly understood. Previous reports have suggested that loss of effective atrial
      contraction because of AF is associated with thrombogenesis. Microthrombi are most likely to
      form in the left atrial appendage. In contrast, intravascular thrombotic events in patients
      without AF are generally associated with abnormalities of vascular endothelial function
      and/or the coagulation system. On the assumption that more than 90% of all cardiac thrombi in
      patients with AF form in the LA appendage, and the fact that thrombi have been identified in
      15-20% of patients with AF who have clinical risk factors for ischemic stroke, it has been
      deemed to be &quot;our most lethal attachment&quot;. Administration of anticoagulant therapy is
      generally thought to be necessary as a preventive measure for patients at high risk of
      thromboembolism, but data indicating inadequate implementation of this highly effective
      therapy]. Several studies have found regional differences in platelet activation and
      hypercoagulability in the LA compared with systemic circulation in patients with valvular and
      nonvalvular AF, suggesting local contributing factors. Animal studies have demonstrated
      increased platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction with acute AF. The ability of
      antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk of cardioembolic events in AF suggests that platelets
      may contribute to the pathophysiology. Platelet activation occurs with AF and rapid atrial
      pacing, providing a possible mechanistic link. Other biomarkers that have proposed to improve
      the prediction of thromboembolotic events in this patient population include von Willebrand
      factor and D-dimer and cerebral imaging. A comprehensive understanding of the
      pathophysiological sequence leading to thrombus formation in the LAA of patients with AF
      could be helpful to characterize those at high risk for thromboembolic events, and
      subsequently to optimize the management of high risk patients.

      Aim: To compare biomarkers and mediators associated with arterial and venous thrombosis from
      blood sampling from the LA, RA, and systemic circulation in patients with AF.

      Methods and population: A prospective trial of patients who undergo circumferential ablation
      of the pulmonary veins. For the clinical procedure, a conventional transeptal puncture is
      performed. In the beginning of the procedure, following transeptal puncture, and before
      intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin (bolus of 50-100 IU/kg), blood samples
      will simultaneously be collected from the peripheral femoral venous sheath, arterial line,
      right atrial sheath, and LA sheath. Samples from the RA and LA will be collected with the
      sheath positioned in the midchamber and close to the appendages. Each Patient will provide up
      to 40ml of blood for the following blood tests: (1) Blood count. (2) Fibrinogen (3) Factor
      VIII (4) D-dimer (5) P-selectin (6) von Willebrand factor (7) TEG - Thromboelastography Serum
      and plasma samples will be stored for future tests.
