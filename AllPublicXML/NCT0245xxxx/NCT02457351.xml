          -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt;3 months from
             definitive therapy, has no evidence of tumor growth on an imaging study within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry, and is clinically stable with respect to the tumor at the time
             of study entry.

          -  Seizure disorder requiring therapy (such as steroids or anti-epileptics).

          -  History of organ allograft.

          -  Use of strong inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP3A4 in the 14 days before study
