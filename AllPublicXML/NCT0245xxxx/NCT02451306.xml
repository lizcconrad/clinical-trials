  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BPD) is often misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. This leads to inadequate
      treatment and can have negative impact on the course of the disease. There is now preliminary
      evidence that patients with unipolar and bipolar depression as well as healthy individuals
      with a heightened risk of BPD can be distinguished from each other based on their brain
      activity patterns and functional connectivity during resting state.

      However, the impact of pharmacological treatment on these functional brain measures have not
      yet been clarified. For common antidepressants it has been shown that they seem to normalise
      aberrant brain activity patterns and functional connectivity. The problem is that some
      antidepressants can induce mania or accelerate pathological cycling in depressive patients
      with unrecognised BPD. Therefore, pharmacological drugs with mood-stabilising properties such
      as quetiapine are more and more prescribed. Although the effectiveness and tolerability have
      been proven, the neuronal effects of these adjunctive treatments are not clear. The aim of
      the study is thus to investigate the impact of quetiapine on measures of brain activity in
      depressive patients with a heightened risk of BPD. Moreover, the investigators want to
      examine whether the investigators can distinguish depressive patients with a heightened risk
      of BPD from depressive patients without a heightened risk of BPD using neuroimaging
      techniques, and whether these measures can predict the course of the disease.
