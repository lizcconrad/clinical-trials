    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility of forced fluid removal in
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with high-risk AKI and severe fluid
      overload. The intervention will use furosemide infusion and/or continuous renal replacement
      therapy (CRRT) to achieve and maintain a neutral cumulative fluid balance. The intervention
      will be compared to standard of care as reflected in the kidney disease improving global
      outcome (KDIGO) guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in patients admitted to ICU. A
      core element of critical care is resuscitation with crystalloid solutions. In many cases
      fluid accumulates and patients become fluid overloaded (positive fluid balance &gt; 10% of
      bodyweight). This is especially true in patients with AKI, since they often have impaired
      ability to excrete salt and water. Most observational suggests harm with increased positive
      fluid balance.

      Objectives: To assess feasibility of forced fluid removal with diuretics and/or CRRT in ICU
      patients with AKI and severe fluid overload, compared to current clinical practice.

      Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomized, assessor blinded pilot-trial with adequate
      generation of allocation sequence, and allocation concealment.

      Trial Size: The pilot study is planned to include 50 patients. Inclusion is expected to start
      in August 2015.

    <description>The experimental intervention is guided by a therapeutic goal of average negative fluid balance ≥ 1 ml/kg/h and safety variables indicating inadequate circulation (lactate ≥ 4, MAP &lt; 50 or mottling beyond the edge of kneecaps).
The effect of fluid removal is evaluated three times daily (06:00. 14:00 and 22:00), while the safety variables are evaluated continuously. Resuscitation is started if one or more signs of inadequate circulation is present.
The first choice for fluid removal is diuretic therapy with furosemide, which is continued for a minimum of 8 hours. If the therapeutic goal (negative fluid balance ≥ 1 ml/kg/h) is not achieved and/or maintained by furosemide alone, then fluid removal with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is initiated.</description>

    <description>The physiologic response to fluid removal is monitored with three variables indicating inadequate circulation. These are:
Mottling beyond the edge of kneecaps
Hypotension (MAP &lt; 50) resistant to inotropes and vasopressors
Plasma lactate ≥ 4 mmol/l
Mottling and MAP are monitored continuously and lactate is measured routinely 4-6 times each day and on clinical indication. If one or more variable is present:
Fluid removal is paused
A crystalloid fluid bolus of 250-500 ml is given
Circulatory status is reevaluated within 30 minutes
Step 1-3 is repeated until signs of inadequate circulation have been resolved for minimum 1 hour
Fluid removal is restarted in 25% reduced dose for minimum 4 hours before evaluation of effect.</description>

Severe metabolic acidosis attributable to AKI (pH &lt; 7.25 and standard base excess &lt; -10 mmol/l) resistant to IV bicarbonate infusion
Severe respiratory failure with PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 13 kPa and bilateral infiltrates/oedema on the chest x-ray.
