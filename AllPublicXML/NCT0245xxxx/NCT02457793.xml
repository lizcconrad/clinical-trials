  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and effects of
      oral dosing of cobimetinib and GDC-0994 administered in combination in patients with
      histologically confirmed, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors for which standard
      therapies either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable.
