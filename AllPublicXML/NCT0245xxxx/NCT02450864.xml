  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators recent data showed anti-inflammatory effect of Effect of Extracorporeal
      Shockwave Technology (ESWT). Little studies focused on the effect and pathomechanism of ESWT
      on shoulder stiffness.

      1. First year:Investigators intend to further delineate the inflammatory mechanism, such as
           IL-1β, CB1, HSP in the incidence of shoulder stiffness.

        2. Second year: Investigators intend to conduct a prospective randomized double-blind study
           for the clinical effect of ESWT on patients with shoulder stiffness.

        3. Third year: Investigators wish to test the biologic effect of ESWT on patients with
           shoulder stiffness and to elucidate the molecular mechanism for this effect through a
           randomized comparative study.

    <measure>the range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder as a measure</measure>
    <time_frame>1weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperatively, the ROM of the shoulder is measure with the patient in a sitting position. A goniometer is used to measure the angle to which the patient could maximally passively forward flex or abduct the shoulder. External rotation and internal rotation of the shoulders are determined with the patient's arm in a resting position. The investigators assessed shoulder ROM using the SROMD. Normal shoulder ROM without scapular stabilization is considered to be 180° of forward flexion, 180° of abduction, 90° of external rotation, and 90° of internal rotation with the arm at the side. By summation of the measured deficit of ROM, the SROMD is obtained. Patients are defined as having shoulder stiffness if SROMD &gt;270degrees.</description>
