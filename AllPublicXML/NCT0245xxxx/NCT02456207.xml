      The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of SCT400
      versus rituximab (MabThera®) in patients with CD20+ B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of
      SCT400 versus rituximab (MabThera®), as well as the presence of human anti-chimeric
      antibodies (HACA).
