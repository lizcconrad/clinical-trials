    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the changes of factors including Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor(VEGF), VEGFReceptor-2, Nitric Oxide and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α),
      measurements of oxygen saturation in peripheral blood and wound surface area and
      ankle-brachial index (ABI) in ischemic diabetic foot ulcers after Low Level Laser
      Therapy(LLLT).

      Defects in vessels and neovascularization makes diabetic chronic wounds difficult to treat, A
      decrease of angiogenic factor expression such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor(VEGF) and
      its receptors is involved in angiogenesis inhibition in diabetic ulcers. LLLT as a
      therapeutic treatment modality can effect on release of these factors and angiogenesis in
      wound site.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the changes of factors including VEGF,
      VEGFReceptor-2, Nitric Oxide and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), measurements of oxygen
      saturation in peripheral blood and wound surface area in ischemic diabetic foot ulcers after
      LLLT, Therefore, the investigators can evaluate molecular process of angiogenesis, as a
      mechanism of useful effects of LLLT.

      In order to patients with ischemic diabetic foot ulcers(DFU) assigned into LLLT with
      Ga-As(904 nm) laser and placebo groups and will be treated for 12 sessions, every other day.
      On the first and last (twelfth) treatment session, before and after intervention, Blood
      sample are taken from all patients in the both groups for VEGF, VEGFreceptor-2, NO and HIF-1α
      measurement. Wound surface area and oxygen saturation of peripheral blood and ankle-brachial
      index (ABI) are measured at first and twelfth treatment.
