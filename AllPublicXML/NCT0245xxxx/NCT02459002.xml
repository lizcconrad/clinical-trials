      The goal of this study is to learn about the quality of life (QOL) in participants with
      advanced lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced lung cancer (ALC) will be assessed for participant outcomes in a sample which is
      prior initiation of palliative consultation and in a sample after the initiation of early
      palliative consultation.

      Study goals are:

      I. To determine the differences in participant outcomes including quality of life (QOL);
      symptom distress [Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS)] and caregiver outcomes [Zarit
      Burden Interview {ZBI}, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale(HADS) and FAMCARE] at week 12
      in advanced lung cancer (ALC) patients receiving early palliative care consultation versus
      those who don't.

      II. Identify the cellular, molecular, and immune basis for the development of symptoms in
      patients with ALC.

    <description>Impact of early palliative consultation (defined as palliative consultation within 8 weeks of initial advanced cancer diagnosis) on participant outcomes including improvement QOL [FACT-L trial outcome index [TOI] score)]. QOL assessed with FACT-L instrument, widely used to assess QOL of advanced NSCLC. FACT-L consists of 4 general &amp; 1 lung cancer symptom-specific subscale. General subscales include physical well-being (PWB; seven items), social/family well-being (seven items), emotional well-being (five items), and functional well-being (FWB; seven items). The seven-item lung cancer subscale (LCS) assesses symptoms commonly reported by lung cancer patients (e.g., shortness of breath, loss of weight, tightness in chest). The 21-item TOI (Trial Outcome Index) is derived by adding PWB, FWB, and LCS scores. All FACT-L items are rated on five-point scales ranging from 0 for &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 for &quot;very much.&quot; Higher scores are representative of better QOL or fewer symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnoses of advanced NSCLC (defined as locally advanced or metastatic)

          2. Have no clinical evidence of cognitive failure, as evidenced by a Memorial Delirium
             Assessment Score of less than or equal to 7 of 30 ‚Å≠at the time of consent.
