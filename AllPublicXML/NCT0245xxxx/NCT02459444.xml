  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a feasible and safe strategy for patients and
      athletes, your goal is to recondition the respiratory muscles, providing optimization of lung
      capacity, either for high performance sport as to support metabolic wear caused by illness.
      It is generally agreed the positive impact of the application of a TMI Protocol on maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MIP), this benefit encourages individuals sick since weaning from
      mechanical ventilation (MV), to the optimization of physical performance in cardiac and / or
      pulmonary rehabilitation. The TMI is based on the principles: the burden imposed on the
      muscle; the specificity of training; the reversibility of the gain and muscle atrophy.

      This prospective double-blind (patient and evaluator) randomised controlled trial compared
      the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training and inspiratory muscle training. The study
      protocol for this trial was described elsewhere. This study was conducted in accordance with
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials recommendations. The trial was performed at the
      Roberto Santos General Hospital in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. This study was approved by the
      institutional hospital ethics committee (approval reference number 03/2014). Before
      enrolment, written informed consent was obtained from participants or their legal guardians.
