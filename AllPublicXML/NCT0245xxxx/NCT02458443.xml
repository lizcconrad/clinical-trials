  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent meta-analyses suggest isometric resistance training (IRT) may be superior to aerobic
      exercise for lowering blood pressure. The investigators intend to conduct the largest,
      longest, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial using isometric resistance
      training to reduce blood pressure to reduce hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are looking to assess the effect of isometric exercise on ambulatory blood pressure in
      participants aged 40-70 years who are either pre- or mild hypertensive; either un-medicated
      or taking medication to control their blood pressure. Our secondary aims are to examine
      whether the size of blood pressure change is different in those people taking or not taking
      anti-hypertensive medication, to determine the anti-hypertensive mechanism to IRT, and to
      establish rate of de-training effects after participants have ceased IRT.
