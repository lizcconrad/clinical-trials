  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test different types of exercise training for people with
      multiple sclerosis (MS). The exercise program is based on physical activity guidelines that
      have been developed specifically for people with MS. The investigators believe these
      guidelines will be effective for improving physical fitness and function in persons with
      mild-to-moderate MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) are physically inactive. One approach to address
      physical inactivity in this population has involved the provision of physical activity
      guidelines. Such physical activity guidelines are an important tool for exercise
      prescription, promotion, and monitoring, and recommend that people with MS &quot;participate in at
      least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity 2 times per week and strength
      training exercises for major muscle groups 2 times per week.&quot; The guidelines were developed
      from a systematic literature review and have yet to be tested for efficacy in improving
      fitness or other outcomes. This study will test that efficacy of aerobic and resistance
      training alone and in combination (based on the MS physical activity guidelines) for
      improving physical fitness and other outcomes (e.g., walking, thinking, MS symptoms) in
      persons with MS who have mild-to-moderate disability. Such an examination will be important
      to confirm the efficacy of the exercise prescription for people with MS and health-care
      providers. The investigators will further perform an exploratory analysis of blood biomarkers
      and eye imaging parameters to examine some of the mechanisms of exercise training effects in
      persons with MS.
