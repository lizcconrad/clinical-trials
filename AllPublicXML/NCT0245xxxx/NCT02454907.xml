  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience &quot;relapses&quot; of disease activity during
      which they have increased numbness, weakness, visual problems, or other symptoms. If a person
      with MS has new symptoms that are concerning to them, their doctor may want to see them in
      the office in order to confirm that these symptoms are due to a true &quot;relapse&quot; of activity
      before starting relapse treatment. This requirement can be frustrating for patients, who may
      have to take time off from work or travel long distances for such unexpected doctors' visits.
      In this study, the investigators will use input from patients with MS and MS physicians to
      create a relapse questionnaire that can be used to confirm a relapse has occurred. The
      investigators will also evaluate if having a more direct line of communication with the
      provider's office improves overall patient care and satisfaction.

      This research is being done to study if a relapse questionnaire for people with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) may help more easily determine if a relapse has occurred.

      A further goal of this study is to determine if receiving periodic messages from the doctor's
      office, as well as having the direct contact information of a person in the office, improves
      the care of the patients and their experience thereof.
