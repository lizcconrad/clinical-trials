      Background

      The treatment of haemophilia A and B has been revolutionized by the use of factor
      concentrate, both as prophylaxis and to treat bleeding episodes (on-demand treatment).
      However, despite its advantages, repeated treatment with factor concentrate can lead to
      development of inhibitors (antibodies) towards the coagulation factor in the concentrate.
      Another patient group in which the bleeding symptoms are difficult to treat because of
      inhibitors towards coagulation factors, most commonly FVIII, is patients with acquired
      haemophilia. Patients with high antibody titers exhibit a deficient or no response to factor
      concentrates and usually need treatment with bypassing agents, namely factor eight inhibitor
      bypassing agent (FEIBA®, Baxter) och recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, Novo-Seven®,
      Novo Nordisk). The effect of the treatment cannot be accurately monitored by traditional
      coagulation tests.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the utility of the global haemostatic methods in patients
      with haemophilia with inhibitors. The objective is to improve the monitoring of the treatment
      effect and thus increase the safety of the patient and the effectiveness of the treatment.

      Patients and methods

      Patients

      The primary cohort will consist of fifteen patients with inherited haemophilia with
      inhibitors as well as five adult patients with acquired haemophilia who are followed up at
      the Coagulation Department of the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

      Blood samples will be collected from those patients at specific time points (see Design of
      the study) during the course of two years (for each patient). The treatment (type, dose,
      duration) will be determined by the treating physician.

      Methods (selection)

        -  Thrombin generation (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram, CAT® and a commercial kit from
           Siemens®).

        -  Overall haemostatic potential (OHP)

      Design of the study

      Timeframe for blood sampling: i) baseline (inclusion in the study), and ii) prior and after
      administration of bypassing agents to either treat bleeding symptoms or before an invasive
      procedure or as prophylaxis.

      Data analysis

      The variations in coagulation markers measured as described above (Methods) will be
      associated to the clinical symptoms (bleeding), the level of coagulation factors (if
      measurable) and the titers of the inhibitors.
