      This study compares the results of current standard coagulation measurement devices to the
      Quantra System, a new device, using small amount of extra blood obtained during routine blood
      draws in cardiac surgery patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HemoSonics is developing a novel POC diagnostic device, the Quantra System, to perform whole
      blood coagulation analysis and which is suitable for use in surgical and intensive care
      settings. The Quantra System employs a patented technology named sonorheometry, which was
      invented at the University of Virginia. Sonorheometry uses ultrasound pulses to characterize
      the dynamic changes in viscoelastic properties of a blood sample during coagulation and clot
      lysis. The initial assay performed on the Quantra System will be the surgical assay for
      monitoring hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients.

      A clinical study will be conducted to evaluate the analytical performance as well as provide
      a preliminary evaluation of the performance comparability of the HemoSonics' device as
      compared to existing coagulation monitoring technology in heart surgery. This study will be
      performed at HemoSonics and the University of Virginia Health System and will involve
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring bypass.
