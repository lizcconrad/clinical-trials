  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate whether adding nutritional supplements to the diet will have
      beneficial effects on the development of infant brain networks (assessed at 4 and 9 months of
      age). The nutritional supplement will contain lutein (typically found in leafy
      vegetables),docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a fatty acid typically found in cold-water fish such
      as salmon or tuna), and of vitamin E.

      This project will investigate whether adding nutritional supplements to the diet will have
      beneficial effects on the development of infant brain networks (assessed at 4 and 9 months of
      age). The nutritional supplement will contain lutein (typically found in leafy
      vegetables),docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; a fatty acid typically found in cold-water fish such
      as salmon or tuna), and of vitamin E. This supplement will be taken orally, once a day for
      9-10 months starting immediately after delivery. The investigators will also collect a dry
      blood spot (DBS) from the heel of the infant at 4 and 9 months of age to assess the amount of
      these nutrients reaching the infants' blood. At these same ages, the investigators will use
      the Event-Related Optical Signal (EROS) to non-invasively record brain activity in the
      infants as they passively listen to sounds (e.g., novel sounds, speech sounds, words, etc.)
      and watch short video clips of moving objects (e.g., toys, children playing, etc) to look at
      whether the nutritional supplement influences brain development.
