  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label Phase II study of MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody
      administered as neoadjuvant therapy to subjects with either BCG-refractory non-muscle
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, or muscle-invasive TCC appropriate
      for cystectomy and refusing or ineligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Enrolled patients
      will be assigned sequentially to dose levels in cohorts of 6 patients per dose level. The
      starting dose level is 1200mg x 1 dose and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 1200mg
      q 3 weeks x 2 doses, and finally 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 doses to determine the impact of
      increasing number of treatments on the modulated immune response with the tumor tissue.
      Subjects with adverse pathology (pT3/pT4 or N+) will be offered the option of adjuvant
      MPDL3280A for up to 16 cumulative cycles of treatment.

      After all neoadjuvant study therapy is administered, each subject will undergo cystectomy to
      evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic characterization in the
      resected tissue. Serum and urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune
      responses. After the multi-dose portion of the study has completed accrual two expansion
      cohorts of up to 15 patients each with NMIBC or MIBC will be accrued at the highest dose
      level for further characterization of safety, efficacy, and immunologic analysis. Patients
      with pT3, pT4, or N+ disease at the time of cystectomy and no metastatic disease will be
      offered the option of adjuvant MPDL3280A for up to a total of 16 cumulative cycles. All
      subjects will be followed clinically for up to 2 years to assess for disease recurrence.

             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for 90 days after study
             treatment discontinuation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and for 90 days after completion of study drug administration.
