    <textblock>
      Purpose: Intracranial atherosclerosis is a common condition in Korean population consisting
      over 25% of ischemic stroke etiology. American Stroke Association and Korean Stroke Society
      recommend antiplatelet and statin for the treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis. Besides
      lowering blood cholesterol levels statin also stabilize atherosclerotic plaque and eventually
      lower the risk of ischemic stroke. However, little evidence resides on the effect of statin
      treatment on intracranial atherosclerosis. Recent advance in high-tesla magnetic resonance
      imaging enables direct imaging of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque and further assessment
      of treatment efficacy of statin in stabilization of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque
      became possible.
