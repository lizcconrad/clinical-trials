      Laparoscopic ultrasound examination performed during surgery for primary cancer of the colon
      and rectum (CRC) has been shown to be able to detect liver metastasis that are not recognized
      by conventional computer tomography (CT scan) prior to surgery.

      Today most of the colorectal cancer resections are performed by laparoscopy, but robotic
      technology is gradually developed in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations
      characterized by laparoscopy. The use of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound
      examination (CE-LUS) of the liver during robot-assisted CRC surgery has not been studied, and
      this despite the fact that it seems technically possible to perform.

      With this project we will investigate whether CE-LUS associated with robotic surgery for CRC
      is technically feasible and whether it will be able to detect synchronous liver metastases
      that have not been detected on the preoperative imaging modalities.

      Title:

      The value of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound examination during robot-assisted
      resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery.

      Project:

      The following project evaluates the value of contrast enhanced Laparoscopic Ultrasound
      examination (CE-LUS) in robot-assisted surgery for CRC.

      The project &quot;The value of contrast enhanced laparoscopic ultrasound examination during
      robot-assisted resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery&quot; is a part of a Ph.D study at
      the University of Southern Denmark.

      Purpose:

      1.1: The primary purpose is to investigate whether the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound
      examination in connection with LUS procedure increases the number of detected liver
      metastases.

      1.2: As a secondary objective; an evaluation of the technical feasibility of the CE-LUS
      procedure during robot-assisted resection for primary colorectal cancer surgery.

      Background:

      Laparoscopic surgery for cancer in the colon or rectum seems to be equal standing to open
      surgery with regards to the morbidity, mortality and the oncologic results (radicality and
      re-lapse frequency and long-term survival). Laparoscopic surgery for CRC is now a
      well-understood and well-established surgical method, but there are only few randomized
      trials dealing with the long-term results. The latest inventory work calls for better
      documentation of long-term results and calls for further randomized studies. Despite this,
      the number of laparoscopic operations for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Denmark is increasing,
      and laparoscopic surgery has become established as standard treatment for CRC. The
      development of minimally invasive surgery is not stopped by the laparoscopic approach, and
      robotic surgery is currently under evaluation in particular rectal surgery for CRC. Robot
      technology has been developed in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations that
      characterize the laparoscopic surgery. The establishment of a stable platform with
      instruments witch have increased rotating movements is an essential part of the robotic
      surgery. A motion-scaling and filtering makes sure that the image does not shake during the
      operation. The picture resolution is enhanced with 3D visualization and have visual
      magnification of the operating field. A combination of these features allows more precise
      dissection of tissue, suturing and improved bleeding-control compared to conventional
      laparoscopy.

      Liver metastases are frequent in patients with CRC and about 15-20% of patients already have
      metastases at the diagnosis (synchronous metastases). Ultrasound examination during open
      surgery (IOUS) has shown to be an important diagnostic tool with high sensitivity (98%) and
      positive predictive value (86%) for detection liver metastases that are undiagnosed on
      preoperative CT or positron emission tomography (PET-CT). IOUS is considered as the gold
      standard for hepatic metastases within open surgery for CRC. In laparoscopic surgery this
      option disappears, but it is likely that laparoscopic ultrasound examination (LUS), may
      provide the same information as found by IOUS.

      While laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound examination (LUS) is well established in the
      staging and treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancers, this method is only sparsely
      evaluated in the treatment of CRC. There are only very few and older data dealing with the
      use of LUS in the TNM staging in patients with cancer in the colon and rectum. Several small
      studies have investigated the use of LUS to evaluate the M-stage in laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery and all studies show an increased detection of liver metastases. Overall, seems LUS
      to be better than the current pre-operative image modalities.

      In prospective and blinded studies a percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination
      (CEUS) of the liver proved to be able to detect significantly more liver-metastases from CRC
      than conventional percutaneous ultrasound.

      With the new second-generation contrast agents CEUS seems to be equivalent to the
      contrast-enhanced CT and (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI for detection liver-metastases.

      Liver metastases are frequent in patients with CRC and the use of intraoperative ultrasound
      (IOUS) during open surgery for CRC, has previously been regarded as the gold standard.
      Contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) during open surgery for CRC is only sparsely evaluated, but
      has been shown to increase sensitivity for detection liver-metastases.

      Many patients with rectum cancer receive pre-treatment with chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy, and chemotherapy may make it difficult to identify existing metastases in the liver.
      Studies have shown an increased detection of metastases with contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      after pretreatment with chemotherapy.

      The sensitivity of ultrasound examination can be improved by use of contrast enhanced
      ultrasound.There is a single pilot study dealing with contrast-enhanced laparoscopic
      ultrasound (CE-LUS) during primary CRC resection and the study revealed an improved detection
      of metastases.

      In the same manner as in the laparoscopic resection of CRC, there is a need in the robot-
      assisted surgery to be able to compensate for the lack of intraoperative palpation and IOUS.
      The use of CE-LUS associated with robotic surgery in CRC patients has not been studied and
      this despite the fact that it appears technically possible to carry out the procedure for the
      robot procedure.

      With this project we want to elucidate whether the use of CE-LUS in robot-assisted surgery
      for CRC will increases detection rate for liver metastases and evaluate the technical
      feasibility of the CE-LUS procedure.

      Method:

      The project is a prospective, descriptive study with 50 consecutive patients scheduled for
      robot-assisted surgery for primary CRC.

      All patients had, prior to the scheduled surgery, completed a contrast enhanced CT of the
      chest and abdomen, as part of their Tumor, Lymph node and Metastases (TNM) evaluation. The CT
      scan was made according to current guidelines.

      At the beginning of the surgery the patient will get the LUS examination by a specialist with
      skills in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. All liver segments are systematically scanned and any
      findings will be recorded on a registration form. After the LUS examination of the liver the
      procedure will supplied with a contrast enhanced examination. CE-LUS is performed with a
      contrast agent SonoVue® containing Sulphurhexafluoride which is a according to the
      department's instructions for CE-LUS procedure. A bolus of 2.5 ml is injected into a
      peripheral vein followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline. The liver is then systematically
      scanned in 3 phases (arterial, venous and parenchymatous phase) searching for unrecognized
      liver metastases. The procedure is repeated after 5 minutes.

      The time it takes to do the LUS and CE-LUS is measured and any technical challenges are
      reported. Time, challenges and findings of liver metastases (number, segment and size) are
      entered on a registration form.

      If there at the CE-LUS examination is found undiagnosed liver metastases, then the patient
      get an intraoperative LUS-guided fine-needle aspirations- biopsy (FNA) or tru-cut biopsy
      performed by a liver surgeon specialist and the lesion will be marked with a little silver
      pin. The latter is used for follow-up after pretreatment and to locate potential rest tumor.
      The patient will then be sent to the Department of Surgery A, Odense University Hospital, for
      a multidisciplinary tumor conference (MDT).

      All other patients follow the Departments usual routines for adjuvant therapy. All patients
      included in the project will undergo a three-phase control CT scan 3 months after surgery.
      This is to evaluate whether there might be overlooked metastases during the CE-LUS
      evaluation.

      All the information about the patients are entered and recorded in a database.

      Ethics:

      The project was reviewed and approved by the Science Ethics Committee, Project No:

      S- 20140154. The project is reported to the Data Protection Agency. The studies will be
      registered in ClinicalTrials.com database. Participation in the project is voluntary, and
      patients may at any time withdraw their commitment to participation.

      To date no reports of serious or life-threatening complications of LUS examinations or its
      probe is reported.

      The LUS instrument/ probe is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the small holes
      (&quot;gates&quot;) that the surgeon uses to do the operation with. Patients are not getting more scars
      / sores on the stomach than usual.

      It is a specialist with expertise in ultrasound scanning, which handles the actual scan.

      If there during the ultrasound scan is found spread of the cancer, which was not known before
      surgery, it may be necessary to take tissue samples from the suspicious area and perhaps mark
      this with a small silver pin. This is in order to regain these areas later, and to determine
      whether it is about the spread of cancer. In this case the patient will be further diagnosed
      and treated by the department's usual guidelines in this area.

      The contrast agent used in this context is not associated with any serious risks and is a
      well-known and approved contrast agent. The ultrasound scan itself is not dangerous, and the
      contrast agent can give temporarily problems in form of headaches and nausea (prevalence
      1-10%), and, rarely, transient weakness, vasodilation, hyperglycemia, sensory disturbances,
      rash and visual disturbances (frequency 0.1-1%). The contrast medium circulates only briefly
      in the body and the patient is monitored and are in general anesthetic, when administered.
      [26].

      There is a minimal risk of bleeding in connection with a tissue sampling, but otherwise there
      are no side effects associated with the operation or construction of a small silver pin.

      In the follow-up there is included an extra CT scan in relation to the department's usual
      procedure. There is a theoretical, but very modest risk- 0.01% in order to develop a new
      cancer disease.

      Time and place The project is carried out at The RAK-Center at the department of Surgery A,
      Odense University Hospital, and the management at Department of Surgery A, Odense University
      Hospital, approves the project.
