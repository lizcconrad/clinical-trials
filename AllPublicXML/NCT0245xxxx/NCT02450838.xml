  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Each year, dengue viruses infect millions of
      people throughout the tropics and subtropics. This study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine (V180)
      in healthy adults who previously received a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TV003
      or TV005).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever is caused by any one of four viral serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4)
      and infection by any serotype creates life-long immunity against that serotype. V180 is an
      experimental tetravalent recombinant subunit dengue vaccine that would protect against all
      four serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of adjuvanted (with Alhydrogel™) and nonadjuvanted
      formulations of V180 in healthy adults who have previously received the live-attenuated
      tetravalent dengue vaccine TV003 or TV005.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one intramuscular injection of either
      adjuvanted V180, nonadjuvanted V180, or placebo at study entry (Day 1). Participants will
      record their temperature and any adverse events for 14 days after receiving the vaccination.
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 15, 28 and 180. Visits will include a physical
      examination and blood and urine collection. Study staff will contact participants by
      telephone at Days 7 and 90 (and at other occasional time points between Days 90 and 180) for
      health and safety follow-up monitoring.
