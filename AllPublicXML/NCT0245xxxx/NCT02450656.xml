    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open-label proof-of-concept study consisting of two parts: PART A - a
      phase I dose-finding study (3 + 3 classical design) evaluating the RP2D of afatinib in
      combination with selumetinib in KRASm NSCLC; and PART B - a randomized phase II study
      investigating the progression free survival and safety of selumetinib/afatinib combination
      therapy compared to standard of care chemotherapy in KRASm NSCLC.
