    <textblock>
      1. The purpose of the study is to evaluate prospectively the clinical benefits of High flow
           nasal canula (HFNC: 2l/kg/min) versus nasal CPAP( continuous positive airway pressure)
           (n-CPAP: 7 cmH2O) in the initial management of bronchiolitis in infants.

        2. Design: non-inferiority study, prospective, controlled, randomized, multi-center.

        3. Design: Infants less than 6 month admitted in pediatric intensive care unit for
           respiratory distress (mWCAS &gt;3) secondary to bronchiolitis but not requiring mechanical
           ventilation will be randomized in two groups: &quot;n-CPAP&quot;(nasal continuous positive airway
           pressure) or &quot;HFNC&quot; during 24 hours.

        4. Conditions of measurements:

           Primary endpoint: Proportion of failure in both arms during the first 24 hours. Failure
           criteria: A raise of the Clinical score for respiratory distress (mWCAS) (1 point) or
           respiratory rate (10/min /H0 and above 60/min) or discomfort (EDIN) (1point /H0 and
           above 4) or apnea.

           Secondary outcomes: Assessment at H1, H12, H24 of mWCAS, respiratory and heart rate,
           EDIN score, skin lesions, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen

           ) required to achieve an oxygen saturation between 94 and 97%, transcutaneous PCO2
           (carbon dioxide partial pressure) (correlated to an initial gas analysis), Report SpO2 /
           FiO2

        5. Statistic: Intention to treat Analysis. Expected number of patients: 71 per arm: 142
           children.

        6. Study Schedule: October 2014-April 2016
