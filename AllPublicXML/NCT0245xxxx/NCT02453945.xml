  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether a properly fitted support bra on
      females improves their quality of life post-sternotomy. Specifically, does a support bra
      reduce discomfort, pain and wound dehiscence.

      Participants will be randomized to one arm of the study. One group will be fitted for a
      support bra and will be asked to wear this bra 24 hours a day for their 6 week post-course.
      They will submit to 3 questionnaires (at hospital discharge, at 3 weeks post-op and at their
      6 week post-op visit with their surgeon. They will diary over this 6 week period re: pain,
      comfort, wound healing. The group in the no bra arm will also be measured for breast size and
      will submit to 3 questionnaires (at the same intervals) and will be asked to diary over their
      6 week post-op course re: pain, comfort, wound healing. Chronic pain and quality of life
      markers will be assessed through a 6month and 1 year follow-up telephone call and
      questionnaire.
