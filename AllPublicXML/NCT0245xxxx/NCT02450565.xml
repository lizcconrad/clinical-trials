  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain, described as 'pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease
      on the somatosensory system', affects up to 3-9.8% of the investigators' population, but is
      often underdiagnosed and undertreated. As treatment is different for patients with
      neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain, it is important to screen for neuropathic pain.
      Commonly employed questionnaire-based diagnostic tools in English speaking countries include
      the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale (LANSS) and Neuropathic
      pain questionnaire (NPQ). Self-completed LANSS is particularly useful as it is not restricted
      to clinician's examination and can be applied in large-scale research. S-LANSS has been
      successfully translated, validated and used successfully in Arabic and Turkish, but it has
      not been utilised in the Chinese population. As verbal translations of the English
      questionnaires used at the bedside may be prone to errors in interpretation and requires
      medical practitioners to interpret the questions. Therefore a translation and validation
      study is essential.

        A total of 200 pain patients will be recruited. One hundred of these patients will be
        patients suffering from neuropathic pain, and 100 will be patients with nociceptive pain.
        The diagnosis of neuropathic or nociceptive pain will be made by pain specialists based on
        a detailed history, physical examination, investigation results and medical records. The
        pain specialists' diagnosis will be used for distinguishing between nociceptive and
        neuropathic pain. Demographic information including age, sex, pain diagnosis and duration,
        education level, co-existing medical problems and employment status will be recorded. The
        Cantonese S-LANSS will then be administered to patients to be completed without the help of
        staff.
