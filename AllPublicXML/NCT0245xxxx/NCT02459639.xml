  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a comprehensive prospective clinical study design, the investigators intend to compare
      changes in health-related markers in patients with chronic widespread pain (CWP), undergoing
      one of two intervention &quot;packages&quot; of multimodal health care, namely anthroposophical
      integrative care (AIC) or standard care (SC), respectively. AIC combines evidence-based
      conventional care with complementary/alternative (CAM) treatments. As markers, the
      investigators will use indicators of drug utilization and sick leave, as well as constructs
      mirroring possible changes in psychological and existential factors and genomic stability
      (such as telomere length and telomerase levels).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this comprehensive prospective clinical study is to compare and contrast two
      different but well-established multimodal chronic widespread pain rehabilitation programmes,
      i.e. one at a conventional county council hospital (CC) and one involving integrative care at
      a private non-profit hospital (IC), in terms of changes in health-related outcomes, ranging
      from DNA stability to health economy, in patients with chronic pain. Notably, for the first
      time, differences can be seen and correlations made between CC and IC outcomes with relevance
      for clinical care development and implementation of multimodal interventions for people with
      chronic pain.

      The overall aim of the present prospective clinical trial is to achieve a better
      understanding of the possible effects of, and useful measure for evaluating, two different
      multimodal treatment interventions for pain.

      More specifically, the aims of this trial are to explore two different, but well-established
      multimodal pain rehabilitation programmes. The investigators will specifically investigate 1.
      If chronic pain impacts on patients' telomerase activity and telomere length over time; 2. If
      multimodal rehabilitation can be linked to positive changes in telomerase activity and
      telomere length after rehabilitation, and if these changes can be correlated to: Clinical
      diagnosis, pain characteristics (e.g. intensity, duration, frequency and spread of pain),
      co-morbidities (e.g. anxiety, depression and catastrophizing), time lost from work/sick-leave
      and self-rated health and stress, and; 3. If and how the two programmes and their treatment
      components differ in outcomes over time.

      The project outcomes will be of great relevance for clinical rehabilitation development and
      the implementation of multimodal interventions for people with chronic pain. Given that the
      most significant demographic and clinical factors associated with pain help-seeking are
      increasing age, female gender, pain severity and disability, we will also address such issues
      including gender differences when relevant.

      Specific work packages (WP): WP1 - Genomics (telomerase activity and telomere length); WP2 -
      Patient-reported outcomes (&quot;existential&quot; validated questionnaires regarding depression,
      anxiety, stress, quality of life, pain, mindfulness, spirituality/religiosity); WP3 - Health
      care experiences (interviews); WP4 - Registry data (drugs, health care, sick leave,
      return-to-work, morbidity, mortality); WP5 - The design of treatment programs; WP6 -
      Standardized and exploratory statistical analyses of differences and correlations between the
      collected data and the conventional and integrated care programs. WP7 - Implementation of the
      results problematized through the participation of representatives of the patient and care
      provider organizations.

    <description>The programme for chronic pain at AIC consists of two phases:
A three-week in-patient period. During the first three-week in-patient stay, patients meet regularly with a multi-professional team. Usually, each patient receives two of the following therapies 2-4 times per week: art therapy, massage, physiotherapy, eurhythmy and baths. Nursing care is provided twice daily. Moreover, patients are offered to participate in group activities.
Two-three day inpatient follow-up and treatment period closure. The second phase of the treatment programme consists of a 2-3 day inpatient stay, 6 months after closure. During this time, physician, nurse and therapist appointments are made according to individual needs. The patients who have been engaged in group activities are gathered in groups.</description>

    <description>The standard approach at Linköping University Hospital admits patients for bio-psycho-social assessment, pharmacological treatment and multimodal rehabilitation (main components: education, intense physical exercise, cognitive behavioural therapy and workplace interventions) for a 6 week intensive phase period (75%) followed by 4 weeks (25%). Here a number of professional disciplines collaborate and form a team of professionals focused on individual patient needs The multimodal rehabilitation outpatient program delivered by this team has the following aims: 1) reduce pain and psychological burden, 2) improve work capacity and decrease sick-leave and 3) increase perceived health and quality of life. These general aims are combined with the aims of the patient in a plan of rehabilitation.</description>
