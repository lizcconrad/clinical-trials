    <measure>Tolerability Survey Score Using a 100 Unit Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in Period 1</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment in Period 1 (Follow-up 1 Day 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed using an 8-item survey consisting of 4 positive questions: comfort, soothing, moistening/lubricating and vision clarity and 4 negative questions: stickiness, blur, burning/stinging and discomfort. Participants were instructed to think about their experience over the past week and place a vertical line on the line that best captured how they felt the first 30 minutes after the study drops were administered using the scale: 0 far left of the line to 100 far right on the line. The individual positive scores are added together to obtain the total positive tolerability score from 0 (worst) to 400 (best) and the individual negative scores are added together to obtain the total negative tolerability score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 400 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©) Score Using a 5-Point Scale in Period 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 14 days of treatment in Period 1 (Follow-up 1 Day 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI Questionnaire consisted of 12 questions: ocular symptoms (sensitive to light, feel gritty, painful or sore), vision-related functions (blurred vision, poor vision, reading, driving at night, working on a computer and watching TV) and environmental triggers (windy conditions, low humidity/dry areas and air-conditioned areas). Participants were asked to base their evaluation on the frequency of their symptoms over the last week, using a 5-point scale: 0=none of the time to 4=all of time. The total score is converted to a 0 to 100 score where 0 is best and 100 is worst.</description>

    <description>SESoD assessed the severity of dryness (defined as discomfort/irritation due to dry feeling in the eye) evaluated by the participant on a 5-point scale: 0=none, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate and 4=severe (always notice the symptom and interferes with activities).</description>

        <description>Tolerability was assessed using an 8-item survey consisting of 4 positive questions: comfort, soothing, moistening/lubricating and vision clarity and 4 negative questions: stickiness, blur, burning/stinging and discomfort. Participants were instructed to think about their experience over the past week and place a vertical line on the line that best captured how they felt the first 30 minutes after the study drops were administered using the scale: 0 far left of the line to 100 far right on the line. The individual positive scores are added together to obtain the total positive tolerability score from 0 (worst) to 400 (best) and the individual negative scores are added together to obtain the total negative tolerability score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 400 (worst).</description>

        <title>Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©) Score Using a 5-Point Scale in Period 1</title>
        <description>The OSDI Questionnaire consisted of 12 questions: ocular symptoms (sensitive to light, feel gritty, painful or sore), vision-related functions (blurred vision, poor vision, reading, driving at night, working on a computer and watching TV) and environmental triggers (windy conditions, low humidity/dry areas and air-conditioned areas). Participants were asked to base their evaluation on the frequency of their symptoms over the last week, using a 5-point scale: 0=none of the time to 4=all of time. The total score is converted to a 0 to 100 score where 0 is best and 100 is worst.</description>

        <description>Acceptability Survey is comprised of 8 questions (Q): Q1-effective dry-eye relief, Q2-eyes feel comfortable, Q3-vision did not blur, Q4-vision normal within 10 minutes, Q5-substantial feel/optimally thick, Q6-eyelashes not matted/crusty, Q7- satisfied overall and Q8-switch to this product/if my doctor recommended. The participant answered the questions using the following scale: a=strongly agree, b=agree, c=neither agree nor disagree, d=disagree and e=strongly disagree. The percentage of participants who selected Strongly Agree or Agree is reported.</description>

          <title>Tear Break-Up Time With Fluorescein in Period 2</title>
          <description>Fluorescein was applied to the eyes and three consecutive TBUTs are performed in each eye at 5 and 30 minutes post drop instillation. TBUT is defined as the time (seconds) required for dry spots to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film.</description>
