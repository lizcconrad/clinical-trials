      A prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing blood product use and bleeding events
      during and after endoscopic or neurosurgical procedures in patients with cirrhosis and
      coagulopathy: Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) vs. conventional therapy (SCARLET).

    <measure>Total amount of pre-procedure blood products transfused in patients undergoing endoscopy and neurosurgical procedures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be evaluated for the duration of their transfusion (no greater than 24 hour span).</time_frame>

    <measure>Bleeding Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be assessed for bleeding events from time of consent in the hospital to the time of discharge from the hospitalization (up to a maximum of 6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of hospitalization is patient dependent, and is not affected by study interventions. Bleeding events (such as post-procedure bleeding, signs/symptoms of bleeding, or active hemorrhage) will be evaluated by chart review for the duration of each subject's hospitalization (up to a maximum of 6 months).</description>
