  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We collect prospectively and retrospectively, patients' demographic, pathological, surgical,
      therapeutic and prognosis informations in a database. After patient's consent to collect
      tumoural samples of their colorectal cancer after resection.

      We will then be able to evaluate the impact of HSP110, a chaperon protein, on their
      prognosis. Other proteins (to be determined) will also be study, after.

      To investigate the importance of HSP110DE9 as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer, we
      will analyze genotyping fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and / or immunomarquage the presence
      of this mutant in a large cohort of patients (more than 2000 patients had or having a
      colorectal cancer). All patients have been or will be made in general and digestive surgery
      department at Saint-Antoine hospital. Tumor fragments samples were or will be made on their
      tumor and keep it in the tumor bank of the Saint-Antoine hospital. All patients reported
      their no objection to the use of these tumor fragments for research purposes. A database will
      be built and correlated with the tumor fragments. This project is intended that the
      constitution of a clinical database including prognostic so that we make discoveries on
      HSP110DE9 or other molecular biology to discover markers can be correlated with clinical
      data. In the absence of other studies on the subject, with no real knowledge of the
      prognostic impact of this mutant, we cannot provide an effective computation. We therefore
      propose to make a database of 2000 patients retrospectively and prospectively to obtain
      statistical results valid and powerful.
