      This prospective, multi-center study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of extended-infusion cefepime in CRRT. Patients on CRRT who are being
      initiated on cefepime 2000 mg IV every eight hours with a four-hour infusion will be
      considered for enrollment. Pre- and post-membrane serum levels will be drawn at scheduled
      intervals for both the first dose and again during another dose at steady state. Concomitant
      effluent and urine levels will also be obtained. A pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed
      and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to determine the probability of target attainment
      for various pharmacodynamic endpoints. Documented organism MICs will be used to determine the
      cumulative fraction of response.

    <description>Each patient will have samples collected on both the first dose and another dose at presumed steady state (dose four, five, or six) to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of extended-infusion cefepime in CRRT. Pharmacokinetic outcomes calculated include half life, volume of distribution, and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve. Sieving and saturation coefficients will also be calculated as appropriate. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration will be the primary pharmacodynamic outcome studied.</description>

      Samples that are being collected are as follows: serum, continuous renal replacement therapy
      effluent, and urine (if patient is making urine during sample collection). Drug assays will
      be performed for each sample and samples will be disposed of after the final analysis is
      complete. The assays are not interventional and patient care does not change as a result of
      study enrollment.
