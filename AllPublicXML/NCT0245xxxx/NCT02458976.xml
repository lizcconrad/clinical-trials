      This prospective pilot study will investigate whether use of a pulsed dye laser (PDL) prior
      to surgical excision can improve the appearance and symptoms of scars. The primary outcome
      measurement for the study is the quality of the scar in areas pre-treated with PDL vs.
      control (cryogen spray only). For this study, subjects who are scheduled for a dermatologic
      surgical excision will have half of the surgical area pre-treated with PDL and the other half
      pre-treated with cryogen spray.
