      A Phase III, Multi-Centre, Open Label, Randomized Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of
      AZD9291 in Combination with MEDI4736 versus AZD9291 Monotherapy in patients with Locally

      This a phase III, Multi Centre, Open Label, Randomized, Study to Assess the Efficacy and
      Safety of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in Combination with MEDI4736 (10 mg/kg (IV)
      infusion q2w) versus AZD9291 Monotherapy (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation positive NSCLC,
      who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The randomization will be stratified by previous
      lines of treatment (2nd or 3rd+) and ethnicity (Asian or Non-Asian). A mandatory biopsy will
      be needed for central testing of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease
      progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study is To
      investigate the safety and tolerability profile of AZD9291 in combination with MEDI4736.

      350 patients were originally planned to be evaluated across the two below populations. The
      recruitment was stopped due to new information on safety of the combination, received from
      another trial in similar patient population

        1. 2nd line: patients who have progressed following an approved first-line EGFR-TKI
           treatment but who have not received further treatment.

        2. 3rd line or higher: patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an
           approved EGFR-TKI and an additional anti-cancer treatment. Patients may have also
           received additional lines of treatment.
