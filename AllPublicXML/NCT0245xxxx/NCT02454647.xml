  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a neoadjuvant approach in patients with
      locally advanced gastric cancer and the identification of prognostic factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (T3-4 and/or N+) are included. Initially,
      patients are diagnosed by computerized tomography scan and endoscopic ultrasound.

      The neoadjuvant strategy consists of 3-4 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy comprises weekly chemotherapy concurrently
      with daily external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy). Surgery is scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after
      the end of CRT. Pathological response is graded according to the Becker criteria. Statistical
      analysis is performed IBM SPSS v20.

      Estimate whether R0 resection rate, pathological response degree, patterns of recurrence and
      long-term outcomes may be initially predicted by dynamic prognostic factors as tumor size,
      neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR)

        Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach treated with a neoadjuvant
        protocol consisting of induction chemotherapy (ICT), chemoradiotherapy (CRT)and salvage
        surgery. Patients must have a medically fit condition to complete the protocol.

        Initial staging comprises a thoracic and abdominal computerised tomography scan, endoscopic
        ultrasound endoscopy (EUS), biopsy and blood test including blood cell count, hepatic and
        renal function.

        Radiological and endoscopic evaluations are performed at baseline and at the completion of
        ICT and CRT.

        Blood tests are acquired at baseline, before each chemotherapy course and concurrently with
        evaluations. Blood tests are also obtained during follow-up and at the time progression.
