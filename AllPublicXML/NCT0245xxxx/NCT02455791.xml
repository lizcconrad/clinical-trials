  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of an ultrasound-guided biopsy
      with what is found during surgery in finding evidence of the disease.

    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the
      tumor site. To perform this biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using an
      ultrasound to collect cells or tissue from a tumor mass. The doctor will use the ultrasound
      to guide the needle into the area. Two (2) types of samples will be collected: a fine needle
      aspirate (FNA) that collects cells and a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue.
      If the tumor is not seen well by the ultrasound, the study doctor may use a mammogram to
      perform the biopsy.

      You will then have the same planned surgery and post-operative care that you would normally
      have. You will sign a separate consent for your surgery.

      Your medical records may be reviewed and information recorded from your routine follow-up
      visits in order to follow your general health and the outcome of your surgery.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your active participation in this study will be finished when you have had your surgery and
      completed your post-operative care.

      This is an investigational study. It is investigational to compare the use of an
      ultrasound-guided biopsy with what is found during surgery in finding evidence of the
      disease.

      Up to 40 participants will take part on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
