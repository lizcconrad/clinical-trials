    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a multimodal Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
      immunization program carried out in pediatric and family medicine practices would be more
      effective in improving adolescent patients' HPV immunization rates than the usual care
      provided to adolescents in pediatric and family medicine practices.

    <description>Efforts will be made to collaborate with pediatric and family medicine offices to utilize a multimodal intervention to improve adolescents' HPV immunization rates. As part of the overall intervention, four intervention strategies will be used: 1) a tailored website, iVac -HPV , 2) Motivational Interview Training for providers, 3) HPV Fact Sheets and 4) The Decision Aid for HPV Vaccines</description>
