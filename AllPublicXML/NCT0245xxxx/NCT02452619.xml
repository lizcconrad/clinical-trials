    <textblock>
      In our institute there is ongoing treatment of brain injury patients with Hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy. These patients undergo neuro-cognitive function tests in addition to brain imaging
      studies before and after treatment.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the perfusion and microstructure changes seen in MRI in
      addition to the cognitive tests before and after the treatment.

      Retrospective analysis of patients suffering from chronic neuro-cognitive damage due to TBI
      treated at Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center,
      Israel

      Patients included if they had at least two perfusion MRIs + DTI and two neurocognitive tests,
      before and after Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The study was approved by the
      institutional review board of the hospital.

      Patients are treated with 50-70 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days per week. Each session
      consists of 60 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 1.5 ATA.

      All patients that underwent MRI before and after HBOT. The MRI protocol included DSC, DCE,
      DTI, FLAIR, T2 and SWI.

      MRI scans sequences parameters:

      * DSC: 50 T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired, 2
      repetitions before a bolus injection of Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA), 48 repetitions after
      injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: TR=2,300 ms, TE= 40ms, flip angle = 30Â°, voxel
      size = 1.8 x1.8, Matrix = 128x128, No. of slices = 25, Slice thickness = 3.9 mm.

        -  DCE: three T1 weighted Fast Low Angle SHot (FLASH) volumes were acquired with different
           flip angles (2, 7 and 15 degrees) followed by 70 dynamic T1 weighted FLASH volumes with
           flip angle of 15 degrees after bolus injection of Gd-DTPA. Sequence parameters: before
           injection: TR=4.09, after injection - TR=4.86 ms, TE= 1.76 ms, Voxel size = 1.5x1.5,
           Matrix = 192X192, No. of slices = 26, Slice thickness = 3.5mm.

        -  DTI: 30 diffusion weighted images were scanned with different gradient directions
           (b=1000) and one volume without diffusion weighting, with the following parameters:
           TR=10,300 ms, TE=89 ms, Voxel size = 1.8X1.8, Matrix = 128 X 128, No. of slices = 63,
           Slice thickness = 2.2mm
