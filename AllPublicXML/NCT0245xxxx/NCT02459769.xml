  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test preliminary efficacy, as well as acceptability and
      feasibility, of a dyadic exercise intervention, the current study will randomize LGBT cancer
      survivors and their non-professional caregivers as dyads to either an individual or a dyadic
      Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP) intervention. The primary outcome assessed will be
      psychological distress. Analyses will involve pre-post comparisons of outcomes across the
      study arms, testing the hypothesis that a 6 week, daily, dyadic exercise intervention will
      result in greater improvements in psychological distress than an individual intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 70 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
      transgender (LGBT) cancer survivors who have completed treatment (surgery, radiation, or
      chemotherapy) within the past 24 months, so as to have a final, evaluable sample of 60 LGBT
      survivors after attrition. The proposed RCT will also recruit caregivers (broadly defined) of
      the above cancer survivors. Each recruited cancer survivor will be asked to name a person who
      they feel provided care (emotional, informational, tangible, etc.) during their cancer
      experience, with no further strictures placed on this relationship in terms of type or
      duration. The caregiver will be approached to participate in the RCT. Thus the sample will
      consist of 70 LGBT survivors (60 evaluable) and their caregivers (140 individuals total/120
      evaluable). Recruitment and primary analyses will specifically target the LGBT cancer
      survivor.

      All data will be gathered from participants 21 years of age or older. Participants are cancer
      survivors who have completed treatments or caregivers of cancer survivors; both survivors and
      caregivers are able to read and understand English.
