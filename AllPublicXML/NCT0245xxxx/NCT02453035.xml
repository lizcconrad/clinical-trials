      The X-Pand Registry is intended to facilitate analysis of acute &amp; long-term safety as well as
      treatment outcomes with DESolve in patients with CAD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Xpand Registry is a single-arm, multi-center, clinical Follow up study of patients with
      significant coronary stenosis who are treated with a commercially available DESolve Scaffold.

      The Registry is an observational study. The patients should be treated according to the
      current DESolve IFU, professional societies guidelines &amp; internal hospital guidelines.
