      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a nurse telephone interview in
      the management of cancer patients treated by oral chemotherapy. This is a multicenter
      prospective randomized controlled pragmatic interventional trial conducted in collaboration
      with two oncology care facilities. Eligible population consists of all patients suffering
      from advanced cancer and treated by oral chemotherapy except hormonotherapy. 184 patients
      will be enrolled in the study. The experimental group will receive a standard followed by a
      medical oncologist, hematologist or radiation therapist as part of routine care, and
      telephone interviews by a nurse every 14 +/- 2 days for 6 months. The control group will
      receive a standard followed by a medical oncologist, hematologist or radiation therapist as
      part of routine care.

      The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by a toxicity score of the 9 most
      common side effects of oral cancer (oral mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, nausea,
      vomiting, pain, asthenia, rash and anorexia) officers from NCI CTCAE v4.0-(Common Toxicity
      Criteria for Adverse Events) and turned into a single composite criterion (sum of 9 Toxicity
      grades).
