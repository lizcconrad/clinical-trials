      The patients who have undergone cardiac surgery have higher likelihood of postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is associated with
      cognitive dysfunction in the old. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of carotid
      IMT in patients undergoing OPCAB(off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery) on postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction. Two hundred twenty four patients, aged 20 to 79 years, scheduled for
      OPCAB will be divided into increased IMT (n=112) and normal IMT (n=112) group by preoperative
      B-mode ultrasonography. The cognitive function measured by K-MMSE, MOCA-K before the
      operation, and on the 7 day, 3 months after operation. The patients in the non-surgical group
      are measured three times: baseline, after 7days, after 3 months.
