  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the reference values for the short-term heart rate variable
      (HRV), estimate the performance of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) diagnostic tests
      in the absence of a gold standard, and assess CAN prevalence in our cross-sectional dataset.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAN prevalence is rapidly growing in all populations worldwide. No document has been
      reported about normal reference values for CAN using this test in the Chinese population.
      This study aimed to evaluate the reference values for the short-term HRV in a large
      cross-sectional dataset, and to estimate sensitivities and specificities of CAN diagnostic
      tests using the Bayesian approach, in the absence of a gold standard in another independence
      dataset. Finally, CAN prevalence was estimated in the investigators' cross-sectional dataset.
      Firstly, the reference the values for the short-term HRV were calculated in the
      investigators' previous study (including 371 healthy subjects). This study dataset contained
      88 subjects who completed both the short-term HRV test and Ewing's test. Simultaneous
      inferences about the population prevalence and the performance of each diagnostic test were
      possible using the Bayesian approach without a gold standard.

        Individuals with inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited from healthy examination
        centres to assess cardiovascular autonomic function using both the short-term heart rate
        variability and Ewing's tests.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Survey participants with undiagnosed CAN, aged 30-80 years, were included in this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Some subjects were excluded from the study to eliminate potential confounding factors
             that may have influenced their CA function 11. Briefly, the exclusion criteria were as
             follows:

               1. history or findings of arrhythmia, and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism;

               2. pregnancy or lactation; and/or

               3. serious hepatic or renal dysfunctions.
