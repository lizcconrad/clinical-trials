      Evaluation of the utility of a multi-modal assessment tool in distinguishing between
      individuals with and without a history of mild traumatic brain injury.

    <textblock>
      This was a preliminary validational study of a multi-modal concussion assessment battery
      incorporating eye-tracking, balance, and neurocognitive tests on a new hardware platform, the
      Computerized Brain Injury Assessment System (CBIAS). Using receiver operator curve (ROC)
      analyses, 1) a subset of the most discriminating neuro-physiological assessment tests
      involving smooth pursuit eye motion (SPEM) tracking errors, corrective saccade counts, a
      balance score ratio sensitive to vestibular balance performance and two neurocognitive tests
      of response speed and memory/incidental learning, was identified, 2) the enhancement in
      discriminatory capability of detecting concussion-related deficits through the combination of
      the identified subset of assessments was demonstrated, and 3) the effectiveness of a robust
      and readily implemented global scoring approach was demonstrated for both eye track and
      balance assessment tests. These results are significant in introducing a comprehensive
      solution for concussion assessment that incorporates an economical, compact and mobile
      hardware system and an assessment battery that is multi-modal, time efficient and whose
      efficacy has been demonstrated on a preliminary basis. This represents a significant step
      toward the goal of a system capable of making a dependable return-to-play/duty determination
      based on concussion likelihood.
