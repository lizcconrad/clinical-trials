  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the relative effectiveness of 20 and 60 minutes of
      Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation in relieving symptoms in patients with major depression who
      are treatment resistant.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study:

        -  To compare the relative efficacy, as measured by a change in the 6-item Hamilton Rating
           Scale for Depression (HAM-D6), of 20 and 60 minutes of LFMS compared to sham (placebo)
           in subjects with treatment resistant depression (TRD).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if subjects with TRD may respond to 120 minutes of LFMS.

        -  To determine the persistence of response to LFMS therapy during the observation period.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LFMS.

    <time_frame>Week 1 Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression were designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in subjects with primary depressive illness. HAM-D6 is a subset of the HAM-D17 that assesses 6 items associated with major depression. The scale uses HAM-D17 items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13. Item 13 is scored 0 to 2 and all others are scored 0 to 4. Total score ranges from 0 to 22; higher score indicates more depression. Change from baseline: mean score at Week 1 Day 4 minus mean score at baseline&quot;.
Week 1 Day 4 : Change from baseline to the end of the efficacy period ( Day 4) in the 6-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D6) total score .Responders at Day 4 will be defined as those subjects who achieve a decrease in HAM-D6 total score of 50% or more compared to baseline (Day 1, Week 1). All other subjects will be deemed to be non-responders at Day 4. Each patient's total score is his/her own reference for determining a decrease of 50% or more.</description>

To determine if subjects with TRD who are non-responders to 0, 20 or 60 minutes of LFMS on Day 4 may respond to 120 minutes of LFMS at the end of Day 11.

    <measure>Day 4 Responders: Persistence of Effect Based on Pre-specified HAM-D6 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the persistence of response to LFMS therapy during a four-week follow-up period in subjects who were responders at Day 4. Persistence of response was achieved if during Week 2 post baseline visits and follow-up visits subjects' 6-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D6) total scores were lower than or equal to 50% of the baseline ( Day1 Week1) scores. Non-responder imputation method was used where missing post-baseline dichotomous (&quot;yes or no&quot;) were imputed as non-responder. Logistic regression model used to compare treatment groups for each visit, where the model considers the treatment, age and gender as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to ( Day 4) in the 6-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D6) Total Score.</title>
        <description>Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression were designed to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in subjects with primary depressive illness. HAM-D6 is a subset of the HAM-D17 that assesses 6 items associated with major depression. The scale uses HAM-D17 items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13. Item 13 is scored 0 to 2 and all others are scored 0 to 4. Total score ranges from 0 to 22; higher score indicates more depression. Change from baseline: mean score at Week 1 Day 4 minus mean score at baseline&quot;.
Week 1 Day 4 : Change from baseline to the end of the efficacy period ( Day 4) in the 6-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D6) total score .Responders at Day 4 will be defined as those subjects who achieve a decrease in HAM-D6 total score of 50% or more compared to baseline (Day 1, Week 1). All other subjects will be deemed to be non-responders at Day 4. Each patient's total score is his/her own reference for determining a decrease of 50% or more.</description>

        <title>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): Change From Week 1 Baseline (Day 1) to End of Week 1 (Day 4)</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item checklist designed to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms in subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Individual items are rated on a scale of 0 to 6 in which a score of 6 represents the most severe symptoms for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60.
Remission of depression based on the MADRS is defined as a subject with a MADRS total score of ≤11 at endpoint. A responder on the MADRS is defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in total MADRS score</description>

        <description>The PANAS comprises two mood scales, one that measures positive affect and the other that measures negative affect. Used as a psychometric scale, the PANAS can show relationships between positive and negative affect with personality stats and traits. Descriptors are used to define their meanings. Subjects completing the PANAS are required to respond to a 20-item test using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5).To calculate the positive affect score, added scores on items 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19. Scores can range from 10-50, which higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect, or the extent to which the individual feels enthusiastic, active and alert.</description>

Subjects completing the PANAS are required to respond to a 20-item test using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5).Negative affect scores can be obtained by adding up scores for items 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18 and 20. The negative affect score can range from 10 to 50, with lower scores representing lower level of negative affect, or the extent to which the individual feels aversive mood states and general distress.

        <title>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Change From Baseline in Negative Score at Day 4</title>
        <description>The PANAS comprises two mood scales, one that measures positive affect and the other that measures negative affect. Subjects completing the PANAS are required to respond to a 20-item test using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5).Negative affect scores can be obtained by adding up scores for items 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18 and 20. The negative affect score can range from 10 to 50, with lower scores representing lower level of negative affect, or the extent to which the individual feels aversive mood states and general distress.
