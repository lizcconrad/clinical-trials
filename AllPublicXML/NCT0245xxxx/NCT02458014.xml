  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Blinacyto (blinatumomab) can help to
      control ALL with positive MRD. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Blinatumomab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of ALL. It is considered investigational to use blinatumomab to treat ALL
      patients with MRD. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 6 weeks.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive blinatumomab by
      a central venous catheter (CVC) continuously for Weeks 1-4 of each cycle. A CVC is a sterile
      flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia.
      Your doctor will explain this to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a
      separate consent form for this procedure.

      During Cycle 1, the blinatumomab infusion will be started in the hospital. You will be in the
      hospital for up to 9 nights so that you can be checked for side effects. Your doctor will
      decide when you can leave the hospital.

      Blinatumomab will be delivered by a small pump, which you will carry with you for the whole
      time you receive the drug. You will be given a shoulder or belt bag to hold the pump and
      infusion bag. You will be able to wear regular clothes, walk around, and perform daily living
      activities. You will be given instructions for taking a shower and other activities. There
      will be some things that you should not do, such as go swimming. The study staff will give
      you more information on activities you should not do while receiving the drug.

      You will need to come to MD Anderson to have the infusion bags changed every 48 hours. The
      study staff will let you know when you need to return to the clinic.

      You will be given standard drugs, such as dexamethasone, to help decrease the risk of side
      effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their
      risks.

      If you have severe side effects, your study doctor may decide to stop treatment permanently
      or temporarily. If you recover or if the symptoms have improved, the treatment may be
      continued. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) before you restart treatment.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive blinatumomab for up to 5 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      You participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      At the beginning of every cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      One (1) time each week during Cycles 1-5, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      During Week 6 of Cycle 1 and then 1 time every cycle after that, you will have a bone marrow
      biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      You will be called by the study staff and asked about your health 1 time each month for up to
      18 months after all participants have been enrolled in the study. These calls should last
      about 5-10 minutes each.

    <description>Patients receive Blinatumomab as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 28 Mcg/24 hours over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free period of 2 weeks, defined as one 6-week treatment cycle. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab is 9 Mcg/day for the first 7 days of treatment (to mitigate for potential CRS and CNS events associated with introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be escalated (dose step) to 28 Mcg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles, 28 Mcg/day is the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment.
Participants called by study staff 1 time each month for up to 18 months after all participants have been enrolled in the study.</description>
