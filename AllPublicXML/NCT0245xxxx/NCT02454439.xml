  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the NICD-CRT study is to assess whether CRT may be clinically beneficial in HF
      patients with NICD and reduced ejection fraction on 12-month HF status.

      In effect, the effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure (HF) with
      reduced ejection fraction patients with non specific intraventricular conduction delay (NICD)
      has never been confirmed even if it is recommended.

      At the moment, no dedicated study has already been performed to assess the benefit of CRT in
      patients with NICD. Results from CRT therapy are contradictory in this patient group and have
      only been obtained from subgroup analysis. Some of them don't show clinical benefit but
      others show a benefit in term of an end-diastolic and/or end-systolic left ventricular volume
      (decrease of the size and the volumes of left ventricule).

      The AHA/ACCF guidelines, published in 2005 and updated in 2009, considered only QRS duration
      (≥120 ms) for the indication of CRT implantation, without any consideration for the type of
      conduction disorder (i.e. LBBB vs. non-LBBB), current updated 2012 ACCF/AHA/HRS guidelines,
      consider QRS morphology (i.e. LBBB) as the first step for CRT candidate selection in addition
      to QRS duration (&gt;150 ms). Indications for resynchronization have been restricted since
      indication of CRT in non-LBBB patients (e.g. NICD) is only a class IIa (&gt;150 ms, only in NYHA
      III and ambulatory IV; level of evidence A). The same modifications have been applied between
      2011 and 2013 in the European guidelines. None is known about patients with NICD and QRS &gt;
      130 ms.

      This is a pilot, prospective, controlled, two-parallel arm, randomized, double-blind design
      and multicentric clinical trial comparing a CRT-D or CRT-P ON group vs. CRT-D or CRT-P OFF
      group in HF with reduced ejection fraction patients with NICD.

      Patients will be included in twelve French centers (Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital,
      Côte Basque Hospital, Bordeaux University Hospital, Saint-Augustin Clinic, Limoges University
      Hospital, Grenoble University Hospital, Nantes University Hospital, Nantes New Clinic, Rennes
      University Hospital, Saint-Etienne University Hospital, Tours University Hospital, Toulouse
      University Hospital).

        1. At baseline a preimplantation evaluation is performed: clinical examination, ECG, six
           minute walk test, biology analysis, quality of life assessment, echocardiography, peak
           oxygen consumption.

        2. At 6 months, evaluation of efficacy which is the secondary assessment criteria:

             -  Quality of life: Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnary: MLWHFQ) :
                improvement of at least 20 points

             -  Functionnal capacity :

           NYHA classification reduction ≥ 1 class, 6-minute walk test improvement of at least 10 %
           in distance, Peak oxygen consumption increased by 1.0 ml/kg/minNYHA response to CRT is
           the primary endpoint. It is a composite primary endpoint, including modification of:
           Quality of Life Score (MINNESOTA scale), NYHA functional status , 6-minute walk test and
           volume of the left ventricle.

           - Percentage of hospitalizations for HF, for cardiovascular reasons and for all causes
           Decrease &gt;15% in end-diastolic and/or end-systolic volumes of the left ventricle.

        3. At 12 months, comparison of the proportion of improved, unchanged and worsend patients
           (Packer Score) in both group which is the primary endpoint and new evaluation of the CRT
           efficacy (same as 6 months)

    <description>According to composite Packer classification:
Patients are considered improved if at the final visit they experienced a favorable change in NYHA functional class or in the patient global assessment (or both) of a prespecified magnitude but did not experience any major adverse clinical events during the course of the trial.
Patients are considered worse if they experienced a major clinical event during the planned duration of double-blind treatment or reported worsening of their NYHA class or global assessment at the final visit.
Patients are considered unchanged if they are neither improved nor worse.</description>
