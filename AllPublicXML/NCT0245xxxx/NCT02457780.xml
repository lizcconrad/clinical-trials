  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster continue to experience significant
      mental and physical health problems. Two of the most common health problems, post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and respiratory illness, often occur together. Mental health
      conditions, such as PTSD, make physical illnesses worse and interfere with treatment. The
      primary goal of this study is to test a mind-body treatment designed to reduce both PTSD and
      respiratory symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mind-body interventions including relaxation training and other coping skills are effective
      for patients with both mental and physical health problems. A leading mind-body treatment is
      the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) developed at Harvard. This treatment has
      been shown to reduce both mental and physical health symptoms.

      The objective of this study is to adapt the 3RP to WTC responders and test its ability to
      reduce both PTSD and respiratory symptoms. This treatment will be compared to a Health
      Enhancement Program that addresses negative health behaviors. The investigators will randomly
      assign 175 patients with ongoing WTC-related PTSD and respiratory illness to the 3RP or
      Health Enhancement Program and will assess outcomes immediately after the treatment and at 3
      and 6 month follow-ups.

    <description>The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) is an 8-session (90min/session) group based intervention which includes a variety of skills and techniques designed to address chronic stress. Techniques used include psychoeducation on healthy lifestyle behaviors, goal-setting, CBT skills, relaxation training and self-monitoring.</description>

    <description>The Health Enhancement Program (HEP) is an 8-session (90min/session) group based intervention which includes psychoeducation and self-monitoring of health behaviors (e.g., sleep hygiene, nutrition, exercise, substance use etc).</description>

    <intervention_name>Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP)</intervention_name>
    <description>The 3RP is designed to decrease psychiatric and physical health symptoms and build resiliency by teaching skills to (1) elicit the relaxation response, (2) decrease stress reactivity and (3) increase social connectedness. Eliciting the relaxation response involves sustained mental focus with an attitude of receptive awareness with strategies aimed at reducing muscle tension, breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure. Decreasing stress reactivity involves increasing awareness of the stress response and learning skills to proactively address stress. Increasing connectedness involves skills to promote positive growth, self-efficacy and social support. Other skills and experiential exercises focus on increasing acceptance, optimism, empathy, and appreciation to promote resiliency.</description>

    <description>The HEP is designed to address comorbid physical and mental health symptoms via psychoeducation, self-monitoring and goal setting techniques. It is an 8 session manualized group intervention which addresses topics including sleep hygiene, nutrition, exercise, working with a healthcare team, and substance use. The program uses a variety of in-session activities to engage participants in discussion related to self-care and wellness principles. Relapse prevention and long-term goal setting are addressed. The program is designed to be implemented by professionals with a background in mental health.</description>
