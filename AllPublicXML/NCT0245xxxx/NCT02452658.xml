  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be exposed to a hypothetical fast food menu, asked to place a hypothetical
      lunch order, and will then be exposed to a second menu with several changes made to the menu.
      Participants will be asked to identify as many changes as possible on this second menu, and
      then complete a survey about their eating tendencies and demographics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The menu with changes will feature changes to both calories and prices, allowing for measures
      of whether participants notice such changes and the order in which changes are noticed.
