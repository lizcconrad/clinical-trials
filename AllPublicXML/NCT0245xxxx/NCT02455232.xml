  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determinate what are the main muscles regularly involved in the
      spastic pattern in flexion of the elbow using the selective motor nerve blocks of the elbow
      flexors. Three selective motor block nerves will be carry out in order to assess the gain of
      the range of motion (passive and active) of the elbow after each Motor Block Nerve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the impact of selective motor block nerves (successively brachialis motor branch,
      radialis motor nerve and musculocutaneous motor branch) on passive and active ranges of
      motion of the elbow in stroke patients with spastic flexion pattern.

      Procedure: Following the morphological landmarks already described, the brachialis motor
      nerve of 30 patients was blocked with 4cc of lidocaïne® 1% (electro stimulation 0.8 to 1mA)
      (ref). Twenty minutes after the injection, the measurement of the degree of the spasticity,
      the passive angle in extension and the active range of motion in flexion of the elbow were
      performed. Then the radialis motor nerve block was performed (at the union of the median
      third and lower third of the arm, medial view, 3 finger widths above the medial epicondyle)
      using the same procedure, in order to block the brachioradialis and the brachialis in case of
      double innervation. Twenty minutes after the injection, the measurement of the passive and
      active ranges of motion of the elbow was performed. At the end the musculocutaneous motor
      block nerve was performed (proximal quarter of the arm, medial view, at the base of the
      inferior limit of the pectoralis major and along the biceps brachii tendon) in order to make
      the final difference with muscle contracture if it existed a doubt.
