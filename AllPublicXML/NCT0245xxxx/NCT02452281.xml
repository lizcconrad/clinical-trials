  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if the combination of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab is
      safe and effective in the treatment of advanced melanoma. HSPPC-96 is an investigational
      vaccine created from tissue from the patient's tumor. The vaccine is designed to capture the
      cancer's &quot;fingerprint.&quot; Injection of the vaccine may cause the patient's immune system to
      recognize and attack any cells with the specific cancer fingerprint. Ipilimumab is a drug
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma that boosts immune response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, single-center, phase I-II trial to determine the safety,
      feasibility and immunogenicity of combination treatment of HSPPC-96 and ipilimumab in
      patients with therapeutically unresectable Stage III or Stage IV malignant melanoma.

      The main purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of the combination of
      ipilimumab and HSPPC-96 is safe. The rationale for combining the two treatments resides in
      their respective roles on the immune system as described below and based on the clinical
      experience collected so far. HSPPC-96 is able to initiate a tumor specific immune response
      that ipilimumab could theoretically amplify by blocking a checkpoint that naturally
      down-regulates T cells.

    <description>Ipilimumab is administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg one day (a minimum of 12 hours and not more than 48 hours) before HSPPC-96 every 21-25 days for a total of 4 cycles.
HSPPC-96 is administered at a dose of 25 μg by intradermal injection always 12 - 48 hours following ipilimumab on a weekly basis for the first 4 weeks and then every 3 weeks always 12 - 48 hours after ipilimumab.
Length of Treatment: 4 cycles of ipilimumab and at least 6 cycles of HSPPC-96 up to 12 doses.
Booster doses of HSPCC-96 following 6 administrations on subsequent cycles will be administered every 21-23 days according to availability of vaccine.</description>
