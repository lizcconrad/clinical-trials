  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo bone marrow transplant for different types of cancer are exposed to many
      treatments such as steroids and whole body radiation. These treatments make the transplant
      possible but also make their bones weaker and more prone to fractures which can be a source
      of significant disability and decreased quality of life for cancer survivors. Our trial will
      investigate whether giving one dose of Zoledronic acid (a commonly used drug given to
      preserve bone mass in osteoporosis) before bone marrow transplant can protect from the bone
      loss caused by the transplant procedures. The investigators are also interested in studying
      the complex interactions of bone, muscle and fat which are greatly affected after bone marrow
      transplant.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine whether a single dose of zoledronic acid pre-transplant will prevent
      HSCT-related bone loss without impeding engraftment, compared with placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To identify bone and muscle deficits and alterations in fat distribution prior to HSCT,
      compared with healthy controls.
