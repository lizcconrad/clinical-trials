      The purpose of this study is to investigate the genetic variants of clock and narcolepsy
      genes that determine the therapeutic effects of Stalevo® on the quality of sleep in patients
      with Parkinson's Disease.

    <measure>The effectiveness about improving the EDS(Excessive daytime sleepiness) in PD patients with motor fluctuation after taking Stalevo® in bedtime.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months from enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is characterized by persistent sleepiness and often a general lack of energy, even after apparently adequate or even prolonged night time sleep. EDS can be considered as one of features of sleep disturbance in parkinson's disease. It will be assessed using a composite measurement consisting of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr stage, Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Parkinson's Disease Wearing Off Questionnaire-9 (PDWOQ-9), and Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).</description>
