  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody (Sevacizumab)
      Injection in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with previously treated metastatic
      colorectal cancer. This study includes two stages. Stage 1 is the dose-escalation stage. Once
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Sevacizumab has been established, additional patients
      will be enrolled in the cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2).
