      Office hysteroscopy through vaginoscopic approach was done in gynecology out-patient clinic
      with saline distension medium. The presence or absence of lower abdominal pain and the side
      of pain were recorded. Then, transvaginal sonography within 20 minutes was done to detect the
      presence of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas. Then, laparoscopy with tubal
      chromopertubation was done.

      Office hysteroscopy through vaginoscopic approach was done in gynecology out-patient clinic
      using a 4 mm endoscopic sheath &amp; 30 ᵒ endoscopic camera with saline distension medium using
      90-100 mmHg pressure. Meanwhile, the presence or absence of lower abdominal pain and the side
      of pain were recorded. Then, transvaginal sonography within 20 minutes was done to detect the
      presence of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas.Then, laparoscopy with tubal chromopertubation
      was done.
