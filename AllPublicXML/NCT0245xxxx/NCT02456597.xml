  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the function of a novel catheter for continuous peripheral nerve blocks in the
      popliteal nerve: Two key issues are investigated 1) Successful primary placement and function
      of the catheter for continuous peripheral nerve blocks confirmed by a decrease in motor
      function following injection of local analgesics through the catheter; 2) The rate of
      displacement after standardized movement of the limb where the catheter for continuous
      peripheral nerve blocks is inserted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although peripheral nerve blocks are known to provide superior postoperative analgesia.
      Continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) are not used to the extent they deserve. This is
      predominantly due to variable success rates. Furthermore, the existing techniques for placing
      catheters for CPNBs are technically complicated and time consuming.4,5 Major problems include
      difficult insertion of the catheter tip past the needle, difficult visualization of catheter
      advancement, secondary displacement of the local anesthetic (LA) injection orifice(s) and
      limited possibility of repositioning the catheter once it has been left in situ. We have
      developed a new catheter for CPNBs to address and overcome these limitations.

      Hence, the new catheter should primarily provide precise initial placement of the catheter,
      less risk of secondary displacement and a possibility to readjust the new catheter at any
      time point after initial placement. Furthermore, in-plane ultrasound (US) visualization
      during the entire procedure and during readjustment should be possible. The new catheter
      should also provide a simple and rapid technique with few components. Initial proof of
      concept studies in cadavers are promising with success rates close to 100 % both for initial
      placement and readjustment
