        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cutaneous and soft tissue atrophy in the dorsum of both hands, as indicated by the

             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A subject with any uncontrolled systemic disease. A potential subject in whom therapy
             for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized will not be considered for entry into the
             study.

          2. A Subject that is currently using systemic steroids.

          3. A subject with a significant history or current evidence of a medical, psychological

          4. A subject with history of or the presence of any skin condition/disease that might
             interfere with the diagnosis or evaluation of study parameters (i.e., atopic

             the study area within the past five years.

         10. A subject with a previous history of calcium hydroxylapatite to the treatment area
             within the past year.

         11. A subject with a previous history of ablative laser surgery to the treatment area
             within the past year.

         12. A female subject who is pregnant, nursing an infant or planning a pregnancy during the
