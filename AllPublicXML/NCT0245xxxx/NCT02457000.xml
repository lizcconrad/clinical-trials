    <measure>Analysis of Sleep Pattern via Actigraphy, Polysomnography &amp; Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteers may be asked to wear a wrist actigraph to measure movement. This watch would be worn for 24 hours per day for 7-14 days. The volunteer may also be asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their sleep patterns. Note: Other methods of assessing sleep patterns may also be used including a portable polysomnogram or a standard, overnight sleep study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of skin (both in terms of skin aging and skin disease)</measure>
    <time_frame>Only once during the study or at specific time points depending on what other procedures are being performed</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteers may have their skin evaluated for skin aging using the SCINEXA tool. Volunteers with psoriasis may have their skin evaluated via PASI and/or PGA assessments. Volunteers may have photographs taken to compare clinical appearance with laboratory and research findings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sample Analysis (from skin, blood, urine, saliva and hair follicle samples)</measure>
    <time_frame>Only once during the study or at specific time points depending on what other procedures are being performed</time_frame>
    <description>Skin, blood, urine, saliva and hair follicle samples may be collected from some volunteers to look at various markers related to sleep, the circadian rhythm and skin disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Barrier Recovery (via TEWL measurement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Only once during the study or at specific time points depending on what other procedures are being performed</time_frame>
    <description>Skin barrier recovery via Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) measurement may be assessed in some volunteers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
