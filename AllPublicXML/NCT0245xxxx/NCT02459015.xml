      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to confirm the medium- and long-term safety and
      performance of the chitosan-based nerve guide (Reaxon® Nerve Guide) in comparison to an
      autologous nerve graft to bridge nerve defects in the finger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation NG-001 is a multicenter, parallel, controlled, randomized, blind
      evaluation of the repair of digital nerve lesions.

      Medovent will perform this clinical investigation as a post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF)
      study in accordance with the MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev2 guidelines to confirm the medium- and
      long-term safety and performance of its chitosan-based nerve guide (Reaxon® Nerve Guide). The
      results of this investigation will be used by Medovent to update the clinical evaluation
      throughout the life-cycle of Reaxon® Nerve Guide and to ensure its long term safety and
      performance in the market. Additionally, Medovent will include the application of Reaxon®
      Nerve Guide in digital nerves to confirm the safety of applying Reaxon® Nerve Guide over
      joints.

      The study will be performed in specialized German centers. A total number of 76 subjects with
      traumatic digital nerve injuries in whom surgical repair may not allow end-to-end direct
      suture of the nerve ends, and in whom the nerve tissue gap would indicate the use of an
      autograft of equal or less than 26 mm, are eligible for inclusion.

      The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate that the static 2-point
      discrimination (2-PD) 12 months after surgery will be not inferior in the Reaxon® Nerve Guide
      test group compared to the control group receiving an autologous nerve graft.

      The secondary objective is to document the long-term effects (up to 18 months after surgery)
      in nerve repair. The non-inferiority test is to demonstrate that it can be excluded that the
      treatment difference is larger than 20% in favor for the control group.

    <time_frame>Primary outcome analysis will be performed from the clinical evaluations at 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The perception of either one or two points of touch is assessed using a small tool with prongs at fixed spacing's from 2 to 15 mm. One or two points will be applied randomly in a longitudinal direction on the distal phalanx of all fingers.
Grades/scores:
0 = &gt; 15 mm (poor)
= 11-15 mm (fair)
= 6-10 mm (good)
= &lt; 6 mm (excellent)
Scores of 2 or 3 will be evaluated as (meaningful) response. At a score of 0 it will further be determined if the subject has protective sensibility or is anesthetic. A disposable cannula can be used.
Single point is noticeable = protective sensibility No point is noticeable = anesthetic</description>

    <description>A moving stimulus of either one or two points is assessed using a small tool with prongs at fixed spacing's from 2 to 15 mm. One or two points will be moved randomly in a longitudinal direction from proximal to distal of all fingers.

    <measure>Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up examinations 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 5 kit monofilaments will be used. A monofilament is pressed against the skin at specific locations (see protocol) starting with the thinnest filament (i.e. 2.83) and then, depending on the response, thicker filaments are applied until the subject feels the pressure.
Grades/scores:
0 = not testable
= filament 6.65, perception of deep pressure
= filament 4.56, no protective sensation
= filament 4.31, diminished protective sensation
= filament 3.61, diminished perception of light touch
