  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about brain activity when individuals
      with and without Parkinson disease (PD) move their lower limbs. The investigators also want
      to see if and how two different types of partnered dance affect brain activity in individuals
      with and without PD. Testing will take place at the Atlanta VA Medical Center and at Emory
      University. The investigators expect to enroll about 140 people for this study over a
      five-year period.

    <textblock>
      Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired mobility, which adversely affects their
      quality of life. The effectiveness of adapted tango dance, in which participants both lead
      (internally guide: IG) and follow (externally guide: EG) movement has been shown. To improve
      outcomes in those with PD, the underlying brain mechanisms for both motor impairments and
      improvement must be studied. IG and EG movements have distinct brain activity patterns.
      Individuals with PD have trouble with IG movement but this problem is helped by strategies
      used while &quot;leading.&quot; During &quot;following&quot;, participants with PD can use many external cues,
      which helps movement in PD, because EG tasks bypass the basal ganglia, the part of the brain
      affected by PD. In older persons with PD, the investigators aim to:

        -  determine brain activation patterns during IG and EG foot movement.

        -  look into effects of IG and EG training on brain activation along with mobility
           improvements.

      The investigators will begin with a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging test in a scanner.
      The investigators will look at brain area correlates of a clinically-used foot-tapping task,
      during IG and EG conditions in older persons with and without PD. Then, the investigators
      will assess the relative effectiveness of IG versus EG training during an adapted tango
      class, compared to a group that participates in health education, for improved mobility and
      foot tapping. Participants with PD will be assessed for disease severity. They will receive
      tests of outcome measures while &quot;OFF&quot; and &quot;ON&quot; PD-specific medications at the following time
      points:

        -  1 week before training

        -  1 week after training

        -  1 month after training Participants must attend 20 lessons of IG or EG adapted tango in
           12 weeks, taught by an experienced instructor. In the functional MRI (fMRI) scanner, the
           investigators will assess participants for improved foot tapping after training. The
           investigators will also look at changes in activation in specific brain circuits along
           with training effects upon mobility.

      The long-term goal is to improve motor training as much as possible for persons with PD by
      understanding foot movement brain circuitry in PD as well as brain changes in circuitry
      through which training is effective. This work proposes to illumine information about brain
      function that is very important to continued progress in rehabilitative care of persons with
      PD.

    <description>Adapted tango dancing is a sophisticated, yet accessible system of tactile communication that conveys motor intentions and goals between a leader and follower. Those in IG training will choose direction, timing and amplitude of each successive step, and will communicate this information to their partner through moving their frame and center of mass.</description>

    <description>Those in EG will learn to attend to sensory cues for movement direction, timing and amplitude of steps, communicated from their partner to them via the frame and center of mass. The 'follower' will wait to receive the movement cue before moving.</description>

    <intervention_name>Adapted Tango Dancing</intervention_name>
    <description>Composed of simple steps, tango involves frequent movement initiation and cessation, multi-directional perturbations and varied rhythms. Participants focus on trunk control and stepping strategies, coordination, somatosensory awareness, attention to partner, path of movement, and aesthetics. Sessions will begin with a typical dance class warm-up consisting of breathing, limbering and postural alignment to upbeat music. Novel step elements will be introduced every class period. Those with PD will partner with an individual without PD. After novel step introduction, the instructor will present rhythmic training, which is indispensable to partnered dancing. Participants will learn 'typical' rhythms from tango and Latin dances, based upon the system of quicks (Q) and slows (S), ubiquitously used in ballroom dance training to understand the temporal relationship of movement to music.</description>
