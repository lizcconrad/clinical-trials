  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main long-term complication of lung transplantation is chronic lung allograft dysfunction
      (CLAD). Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most frequent presentation of CLAD.
      BOS leads to a progressive loss of lung allograft function, with recurrence of dyspnea and
      airflow limitation. In some advanced cases, patients need a lung re transplantation. The
      mechanisms of BOS are not completely elucidated, and there are no early markers or specific
      treatment available for this condition.

      Microparticles (MPs) are submicron plasma membrane fragments released into the vascular
      compartment or the pericellular space in response to cell activation, injury or apoptosis.
      Broncho alveolar and circulating MPs may reflect cellular insults of the lung allografts.
      Therefore, MPs could be viewed either as biomarkers or as effectors of the chronic
      inflammatory or procoagulant processes leading to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

      The investigators plan to include 60 patients before lung transplantation at our centre in
      Strasbourg (France). Follow-up will be requested at the base of usual care (spirometry, blood
      sampling, bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage [BAL]). The investigators will measure at
      one month, one, two and three year post transplantation, the total concentration of MPs in
      plasma and BAL and characterize their phenotype.

      The investigators objective is to demonstrate correlation between total MPs concentration in
      broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
      at three years post lung transplantation.

    <description>We will measure at three years post transplantation, the total concentration of MPs in plasma and BAL and characterize their phenotype Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) will be graded according to guidelines of the the International Society for Heart and Lung transplantation. Percentage of decrease of lung function based on actual FEV1 compared to the average of the two best FEV1, distant for three week, post lung transplantation.

    <time_frame>Lung transplanted patients will have spirometry and bronchoscopy with BALF at three years after transplantation as it's usually done for each lung transplanted.</time_frame>
    <description>MPs expose to the surface phosphatidylserine (PhtdSer), tissue factor and membrane antigens from the parental cells.
MPs collected from plasma and BALF will have differential centrifugation and concentrations of MPs will be measured using original functional multiwell assays.
MPs will be captured onto annexin-5 (total MPs) or onto specific antibodies directed against membrane antigens borne by MPs and testifying their cell origin (CD104, CD66b, CD62E, CD62P, CD35, E105, CD14, CD3, CD20).</description>

        60 patients with a lung transplantation will be included in one center (Strasbourg) 30 -40
        lung transplantations are performed each year in our centre, with a survival rate of 80% at
        three year post transplantation. Approx. 30% patients will develop BOS at three year post
        transplantation. So we expect at three year post transplantation 15 patients with BOS and
        37 patients without BOS (52 patients alive at three years post transplantation).

        Consequently, the total duration of the study will be five years (two years for inclusion
        and three years of follow-up)
