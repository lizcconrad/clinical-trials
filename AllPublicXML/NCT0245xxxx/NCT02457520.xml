    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled, open-label study being conducted in approximately 200 healthy males,
      non-pregnant, non-nursing females, age 12 to 45 years, with severe recalcitrant nodular acne.

      ABSORICA® (isotretinoin) capsules 0.5 mg/kg/day will be administered for 4 weeks followed by
      1.0 mg/kg/day for 16 weeks. Female subjects consenting to use two forms of birth control or
      abstinence are included.

      This study is designed to collect efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QOL) data from
      subjects who receive Absorica® without food. The study will investigate the treatment
      efficacy, frequency of relapse once the treatment has been discontinued, quality of life
      during the active treatment and during a 2-year post treatment period and the overall safety
      of treatment with Absorica®.

      This is a single-arm, open-label study consisting of 2 phases: a 20-week (5-month) open-label
      Active Treatment Period (ATP) and a 104-week (2-year) post treatment period (PTP). The total
      study duration is to be 124 weeks, excluding a screening period. During the ATP, after week 2
      visit, visits will be scheduled at 4-week intervals for a total of 8 visits (1 screening
      visit, 1 baseline visit, and 6 on-study visits). During the PTP, the first visit will be 4
      weeks after End of Treatment (EOT), the second visit will be 12 weeks after EOT, and
      subsequent visits will be scheduled at 26-week (± 2 weeks) intervals for a total of 6 visits.
