  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of Prednisone alone
      and combination therapy of Prednisone and Mycophenolate mofetil in IgG4RD patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with IgG4-RD will be randomized in two therapeutic groups: Prednisone alone and
      combination therapy with Prednisone and Mycophenolate mofetil. These patients will be
      followed in 12 months. Treatment response and relapse will be recorded, as well as side
      effects.
