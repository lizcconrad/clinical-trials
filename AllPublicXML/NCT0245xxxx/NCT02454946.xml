      This retrospective study is done in Ordu university Hospital among patients who administered
      to urology polyclinic between April 2013 and April 2014. Sexually active 102 patients whose
      blood types were known were included in this study. While 56 patients had sexual intercourse
      problems 46 had not and this group was taken as a control group. Individuals who had a sexual
      partner and whose sexual intercourse were continuing unproblematic ally were accepted as
      normal. Individuals who had not have sexual intercourse though having a sexual partner or
      unable to maintain the intercourse were accepted to have sexual dysfunction. Patients' sexual
      function was evaluated via the İEFF-5 questioning form. In the same session the patients'
      blood types were also recorded and their İEFF-5 (Erectile Function International Evaluation
      Form) symptom scores were compared with their blood types.
