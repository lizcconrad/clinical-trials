  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant unmet medical need for rapidly acting treatment of subjects with
      severe major depressive disorder (MDD) who have not adequately responded to antidepressant
      therapy. Alternative therapies require weeks to achieve full efficacy, may have significant
      side effects, and still fail in a high percentage of subjects. Rapid reduction of severe
      depression by pharmacological therapy is important to reduce the need for hospitalization and
      risk of self-harm and mortality. CERC-301, a highly selective, orally bioavailable,
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2B (NR2B), also referred to as Glutamate NMDA
      receptor subunit epsilon-2 (GluN2B) antagonist, would be a therapeutic breakthrough if it
      provides rapid onset of antidepressant effects and an effect size similar to that seen with
      experimental intravenous NMDA modulators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the antidepressant effect of one or two administrations of two doses
      of CERC-301 (12 mg and 20 mg) in subjects with MDD who are currently experiencing a severe
      depressive episode despite stable ongoing treatment with a selective serotonin- or
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI or SNRI).

             bilirubin) elevations at screening above 2 × the ULN.

         16. Clinically significant renal impairment defined as estimated creatinine clearance
             [CrCl] &lt;50 mL/min at screening measured using Cockcroft-Gault formula.

         17. Fasting serum glucose &gt;140 mg/dL.

         18. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not appropriate for a 21-day
             placebo-controlled study due to risk of significant threat to self or others during
             screening or study conduct.

         19. Previous participation in an investigational study using CERC-301.

         20. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within the 6 months prior to
