  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social processes that impact the health of individuals have been labeled the social
      determinants of health (SDOH). These are &quot;the conditions in which people are born, grow,
      live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and
      resources at global, national and local levels&quot;. Perhaps the most important SDOH is income
      security, a person's actual, perceived and expected income. Our objective is to carry out a
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of an income-focused health
      promoter.

      This study aims to answer the question: What is the impact of an income security health
      promotion service based in a primary care setting on the income security of people living in
      poverty? We hypothesize that an income security health promotion service for adults living in
      poverty will increase monthly income relative to usual care. We will carry out a pragmatic
      randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of such a new service focused on income
      security health promotion. The St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team has
      received ongoing funding from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) to support
      this service. The primary outcome is income security, and secondary outcomes include quality
      of life, financial literacy and community integration.

      Population - Adults living in poverty Intervention - Income security health promotion Control
      - Usual care Outcome - Primary: Improvement in income per month in the intervention group at
      6 months (post-intervention) compared to income in control group at 6 months
      (pre-intervention). Secondary: quality of life, self-rated health, community engagement.
