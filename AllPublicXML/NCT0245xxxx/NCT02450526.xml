      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Dysport for the improvement in
      appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines and to assess the short term and long term
      safety of Dysport, used for the improvement in appearance of moderate to severe glabellar
      lines in Chinese subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first treatment cycle will be double blind and subjects will be randomised to receive
      Dysport, Botox or placebo. After the first treatment cycle, all subjects will receive a
      maximum of four treatment cycles with Dysport, occurring at intervals of no less than 84 Days
      (12 weeks) between each treatment cycle, depending upon individual duration of response to
      Dysport treatment.

    <description>For the ILA, a responder is defined as having a severity grade of none (0) or mild (1) at maximum frown at Treatment Cycle 1, Day 29 and a severity grade of moderate (2) or severe (3) at maximum frown at baseline (Treatment Cycle 1, Day 1).
For the SSA, a responder is defined as having a severity grade of no wrinkles (0) or mild wrinkles (1) at maximum frown at Treatment Cycle 1, Day 29 and a severity grade of moderate wrinkles (2) or severe wrinkles (3) at maximum frown at baseline (Treatment Cycle 1, Day 1).</description>
