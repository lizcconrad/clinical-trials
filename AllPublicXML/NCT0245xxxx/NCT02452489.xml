      With Diabetic gastroparesis as the research object, by the method of multi-center RCT and
      single cavity and different acupuncture acupoints compatibility treatment of diabetic
      gastroparesis, the inspection of gastric emptying, gastric dynamic inspection, such as
      validity checking means, for single cavity with different acupoints compatibility evaluate
      clinical efficacy of treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.

    <textblock>
      In order to establish a spectrum of acupoints compatibility of the law, is clear about the
      factors affecting the compatibility effect of acupoints, the formation of strong operability
      of acupoints compatibility optimization evaluation method, the project choice of the clinical
      acupuncture and moxibustion have curative effect of diabetic gastroparesis as the
      breakthrough point of the study, carried out clinical multi-center RCT research, through
      objective and scientific evaluation method, comparing the effect of different acupoints
      compatibility.

      Diabetic gastroparesis in clinical common disease, frequently-occurring disease, acupuncture
      curative effect is distinct, disease diagnosis, curative effect evaluation standard. Previous
      clinical data also show that the diabetic gastroparesis is acupuncture clinical diseases.
      This project by diabetic gastroparesis as the research object, research to better guide
      clinical practice, improve the clinical curative effect, promote acupuncture of the
      inheritance and innovation, promote scientification of acupuncture and moxibustion,
      modernization and internationalization, and will have broad prospect of application and
      significant scientific research value.
