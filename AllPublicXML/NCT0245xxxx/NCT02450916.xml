      Objective: In addition to physical discomforts, work-related injuries and illnesses often
      result in various forms of hardships, including economic hardship, labor conflicts and legal
      disputes. The physical and psychological health conditions are likely to be worsen when the
      social supporting systems are not well functioning. In this study, the investigators aim to
      conduct in-depth interviews with injured workers to study their experiences with the social
      systems, including employment protection system, workers' compensation system, health care
      system and other social welfare systems, and to explore how the systems may affect workers'
      physical and psychological health.

      Methods: Face-to-face interviews will be conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire.
      Subjects who had ever experienced work-related injuries or diseases (including muscular
      skeletal disorders and work-related cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases) over the past
      3 years are invited. The investigators anticipate to recruit a total of 60~100 cases, whom
      will be recruited through the assistance of occupational physicians, occupational health
      centers, labor groups and unions. Interview time will be limited to 1 hour.

      Anticipated results and contribution: Findings of this study will help to advance our
      knowledge concerning the functions of current social systems and the hardships of workers who
      suffer from work-related injuries and diseases. Suggestions will be provided for the
      improvements of current systems.

      Keywords: work-related injury, occupational disease, workers' compensation, psychological,
      policy.

This survey technique is commonly used in health research for its ease of use and its power in measuring health.</description>
