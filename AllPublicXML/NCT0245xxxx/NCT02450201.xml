    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical study of hyperpolarized pyruvate (13C) injection that includes the
      acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) data and will be performed in men with localized
      prostate cancer. Part 1: Five patients will be evaluated for reproducibility of 13C HP MR
      imaging measurements obtained 2-3 weeks apart with no interim treatment. Part 2: Five
      patients will be evaluated for the change in 13C HP MR imaging measurements after 2 months of
      ADT.

      13C HP MR data will be acquired in two parts of the study (which can occur simultaneously):
      Part 1: Patients will undergo imaging at baseline and will be repeated two to three weeks
      later (with no intervention in the interim) to evaluate reproducibility.

      Part 2: Patients will undergo imaging at baseline, initiate androgen deprivation therapy, and
      undergo repeat imaging two months after initiation of ADT to evaluate the ability of the
      imaging to reflect a metabolic response to treatment.

      The change in pyruvate/lactate ratio and lactate levels will be measured and compared to
      baseline at these timepoints.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with intermediate to high
             risk disease by UCSF CAPRA scoring and possesses a Gleason 4 component to the tumor.
             Subjects will be enrolled either prior to radical prostatectomy (N=5) or prior to 2
             months of androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist +/- antiandrogen) followed by
             definitive radiation therapy as their primary treatment for prostate cancer (N=5).

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and
             dated informed consent.

          -  At least 5 mm of tumor on biopsy (can have multiple cores to comprise 5 mm).

          -  The subject has concordant MRI/1H MRSI findings from a MR staging exam at UCSF
             performed prior to the 13C MRSI exam performed in this study with IMP, or is willing
             to undergo MRI/1H MRSI in connection with the study exam.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Laboratory criteria for protocol entry:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 cells/µL

          -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 gm/dL

          -  Platelets ≥75,000 cells/µL

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min

          -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN (or if ≤4 gm/dL and direct bilirubin is WNL)

             but can not be used prior to baseline imaging. An antiandrogen is allowed but not
             required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has received, or is scheduled to receive, another IMP from 1 month before
             to 1 month after inclusion in this study.

          -  Current or prior androgen deprivation therapy; previous use of a 5-α reductase

          -  Contraindication for or inability to tolerate MRI examination.

          -  Prostate biopsy within 12 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  BMI of less than 18.5 or greater than 32. Subject body weight should be less than or
             equal to 100 kg owing to limitations in the amount of IMP available.

          -  Congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association (NYHA) status≥2.

          -  A history of clinically significant EKG abnormalities, including QT prolongation, a
             family history of prolonged QT interval syndrome, or myocardial infarction (MI) less
             than 1 year ago with ensuing unstable EKG.

          -  Ongoing acute or chronic pulmonary bronchospastic disease, including a history of
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, with an exacerbation within the past
             year.
