  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is defined according to the International Continence Society as any
      involuntary loss of urine, which may bring several negative consequences on women's lives,
      and among incontinent women, about 50% have urinary incontinence, 30% mixed and 20%
      emergency.

      The overactive bladder present in urge incontinence and mixed cause significant impacts on
      people's lives and has a prevalence of 16.5% in the US population.

      Behavioral therapies, exercises the pelvic muscles and drugs are the main forms of treatment.
      Drug therapy using drugs which are not specific for the bladder and are associated with many
      unwanted systemic side effects.

      The results obtained by researchers in several countries using conservative techniques in the
      treatment of patients with urinary incontinence are encouraging and this study aims to
      evaluate carefully and systematically the effectiveness of tibial stimulation technique.

      Importantly, also, that conservative techniques have lower cost than the surgical treatment
      and have virtually no side effects as most of the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment
      of female urinary incontinence.

      Goal

      Development of instrumentation for home treatment of overactive bladder and urgency / mixed
      incontinence using tibial stimulation and pelvic floor exercises.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Development of an innovative portable equipment, with domestic technology for home
           application of the posterior tibial nerve stimulation technique using the type SSP
           surface electrodes (Silver Spike Point).

        -  Comparison of the effectiveness of tibial stimulation techniques and pelvic floor
           exercises in the treatment of overactive bladder and urgency / mixed incontinence.

      Design Randomized Clinical Trial

      Sample Women over the age of 18, complaining of urinary incontinence Urgency or Mixed (with
      main urgency component), catered in Urogynecology Ambulatory of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto
      Alegre.
