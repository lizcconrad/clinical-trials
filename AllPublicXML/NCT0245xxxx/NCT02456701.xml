      This is a patient pilot study testing the hypothesis that vemurafenib with the addition of
      KTN3379 can restore iodine incorporation in BRAF mutant (MUT), radioiodine-refractory (RAIR)
      thyroid cancer patients.

      This is a patient pilot study testing the hypothesis that vemurafenib with the addition of
      KTN3379 can restore iodine incorporation in BRAF mutant (MUT), radioiodine-refractory (RAIR)
      thyroid cancer patients. Eligible patients with BRAF MUT, RAIR thyroid cancer will undergo
      human recombinant TSH (rhTSH or Thyrogen)-stimulated 124I PET/CT lesional dosimetry to
      quantify the baseline RAI avidity of index metastatic lesion(s). Patients will then receive
      vemurafenib followed by the addition of KTN3379 after which a second Thyrogen-stimulated 124I
      PET/CT lesional dosimetry will be performed. For patients whose tumor(s) demonstrate
      sufficient iodine incorporation warranting 131I therapy, Thyrogen-stimulated standard
      dosimetry will be performed and therapeutic 131I will be administered concurrently with
      vemurafenib and KTN3379. Subsequent to discontinuation of vemurafenib, tumor assessments will
      be conducted with serial radiologic scan(s) and thyroglobulins (scans will be performed at
      baseline, before 131I, 3 months (+/- 1 month) following 131I, and 6 months after 131I).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of
             follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, or poorly differentiated subtypes
             and their respective variants).

          -  Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory or in an FDA-approved assay that one of
             the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) possesses
             a BRAF mutation at V600.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease defined by RECIST criteria 1.1.

          -  Tumors in previously irradiated fields may be considered measureable if there is
             evidence of tumor progression after radiation treatment.
