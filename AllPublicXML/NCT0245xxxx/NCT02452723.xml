  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of an investigational cell transplantation therapy,
      ISC-hpNSC, in patients with Parkinson's disease. All patients will receive the therapy, which
      consists of human neural stem cells. Three dose levels will be examined in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ISC-hpNSC is a cellular therapeutic consisting of human parthenogenetic neural stem cells
      (hpNSC). ISC-hpNSC will be injected intracerebrally to the striatum and substantia nigra of
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The study will enroll 4 patients for cell injection at each of three different doses. A total
      of 12 patients with moderate to severe PD will be treated. Each patient receives a single
      dose. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the cell transplantation.

             potential benefits, side-effects, risks, and discomforts

          -  Patient diagnosed with idiopathic PD of ≤ 13 years duration, as defined by the United
             Kingdom (UK) Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria

          -  Outpatients (male and female) 30 - 70 years old. Females must be of non-child bearing
             potential, or with a negative pregnancy test and not breast-feeding

          -  Patients receiving a stable dose of levodopa for at least 3 months with the
             expectation that the treatment will remain unchanged throughout the course of the
             patient's participation in the trial

          -  Patients receiving an anti-parkinsonian treatment at a stable dose for at least 3
             months with the expectation that the treatment will remain unchanged throughout the
             course of the patient's participation in the trial

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage II-IV during &quot;ON&quot; time

          -  Positive dopaminergic response of ≥ 33% decrease in UPDRS motor scores between &quot;OFF&quot;
             and &quot;ON&quot; states at screening, and unequivocal clinical off periods

          -  Patient is experiencing motor fluctuations with at least two cumulative hours of daily
             &quot;OFF&quot; -time during the waking period, which is measured on at least two consecutive
             days

          -  History of anti-parkinsonian treatment with sufficient doses of levodopa

          -  Stable, well-controlled concomitant disorders that would not contraindicate general
             anesthesia or stereotactic neurosurgery
