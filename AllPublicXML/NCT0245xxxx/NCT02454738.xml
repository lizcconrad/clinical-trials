      To evaluate CT abnormalities in the lung parenchyma in close contacts at high risk for
      developing multidrug- or extensively drug-resistant Tb by using a follow-up ultralow dose CT
      scan.

    <textblock>
      Multidrug- or extensively resistant tuberculosis tuberculosis is a major public health threat
      worldwide and the global burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing. Drug-resistant
      tuberculosis is associated with long period and high costs for treatment, high rates of
      default, treatment failure and death.

      Drug-resistant tuberculosis should be diagnosed rapidly so as to reduce potential
      transmission. In the United States, at least one-fifths cases of multidrug-resistant
      tuberculosis can be linked to transmission. Close contacts to drug-resistant tuberculosis are
      at high risk for being transmitted and developing drug-resistant tuberculosis. There are two
      options suggested for close contacts to drug-resistant tuberculosis: preventive therapy and
      close observation. But both strategies are lack of sufficient evidence.

      Ultralow chest CT scan may be an alternative for early identification and risk stratification
      of developing active tuberculosis in close contacts to drug-resistant tuberculosis with
      minimal radiation exposure similar to that of chest x-ray.
