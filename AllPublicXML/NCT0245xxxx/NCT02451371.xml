  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to exploratively evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with schizophrenia who experience
      persistent auditory verbal hallucinations after adequate antipsychotics therapy for over
      three months.
