    <textblock>
      This study will determine the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tirabrutinib in
      adults in a prior tirabrutinib study and whose disease had not progressed on the parent
      study. The dosing regimen will be based on the prior dosing regimen from the parent study.
