    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate non-progression rate (NPR) at 18
      weeks in participants with advanced solid tumors treated with atezolizumab, defined as the
      percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
      disease (SD) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1, or according to disease-specific criteria for prostate
      cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.
