  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a serious and growing health problem in the United States. Obesity is associated
      with health problems such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, leading to decreased
      quality of life and increased mortality. Given the health and quality-of-life effects of
      obesity, developing effective treatments clearly is an important goal.

      This study plans to learn more about the effects of an investigational new drug (DMXB-A
      (3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine)) and its effects on obesity. The study drug has
      similar effects to nicotine. Since nicotine has been found to affect appetite, the
      investigators are interested in studying effects of the study drug, which has some
      similarities to nicotine, on how your brain responds to such things as pictures of food. The
      study drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is considered
      experimental.
