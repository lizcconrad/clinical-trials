      The purpose of the study is to obtain data regarding safety and efficacy of drug-eluting
      balloon luminor 14 &amp; luminor 35 in the treatment of infrainguinal occlusive lesions
      (superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery (PA) and tibial arteries (ATs)) and
      restenosis from prior endovascular procedures in this sector.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both sexes aged at least 18

          -  Primary injuries and restenosis of the infrainguinal sector of AFS, AP and ATs, and
             intrastent restenosis or post-ATP prior in that sector.

               -  Stenosis &gt;50% and occlusions. (image test)

               -  Length: 20 to 200 mm

               -  Artery diameter: 2-7 mm.

          -  Symptomatic patients (grades 2-5 Rutherford-Baker both included; Fontaine II-IV),
             affected in their quality of life and that accept treatment (moderate / severe
             claudication patients, critical ischemia without gangrene or injuries severe enough to
             foresee limb amputation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acute or subacute ischemia will be excluded.

          -  Existence of flow-limiting lesions in arteries of the &quot;in flow&quot; or the &quot;out flow&quot; of
             the sector or artery under treatment (&gt; 50 % of the arterial diameter).

          -  Aneurysmal dilatation in the ipsilateral arterial axis.

          -  Intolerance / allergy to heparin, thienopyridine derivatives (clopidogrel ,
             ticlopidine) and aspirin.

          -  Hemorrhagic diathesis during the 3 months prior to inclusion.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  Serious allergy to contrasts or PTX.

          -  Inability to cross the lesion with the guide (these cases will be recorded for the
             analysis as &quot;intention to treat).

          -  Those participating simultaneously in another clinical trial.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation (pregnancy tests on fertiles).
