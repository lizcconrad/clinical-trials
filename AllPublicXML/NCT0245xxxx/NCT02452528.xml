    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a medically important event or reaction. An AE was classified as a TEAE if the AE was not present prior to the first study medication administration and started at or after the time of initiation of administration of study medication, or if the AE presented prior to initiation of administration of study medication, continued and increased in intensity after administration of study medication.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a medically important event or reaction. An AE was classified as a TEAE if the AE was not present prior to the first study medication administration and started at or after the time of initiation of administration of study medication, or if the AE presented prior to initiation of administration of study medication, continued and increased in intensity after administration of study medication.</description>
