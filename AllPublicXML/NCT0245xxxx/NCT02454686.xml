  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the postoperative complications that may occur after hepatectomy are related to the
      underlying liver background, and the common preoperative tests do not completely predict such
      complications. Transient elastography by Fibroscan is used to calculate the stiffness and the
      steatosis of the liver, and it may be also used to predict postoperative complications after
      hepatectomy

      A prospective cohort study on consecutive patients scheduled for hepatectomy was planned.
      Fibroscan was performed during the preoperative workup. Accuracy of the liver stiffness and
      steatosis measured by Fibroscan in predicting the presence of cirrhosis, of steatosis, and
      the development of postoperative complications was assessed by ROC curve, and multivariate
      analysis.
