  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a major public health problem that places many burdens on individuals,
      including impairment of physical and psychological functioning, lost productivity, and side
      effects of medications used to treat pain. There is also substantial evidence that minority
      populations differ both in prevalence and outcomes of chronic pain; access to care is a key
      component in these differences. Strong evidence now supports the use of acupuncture in the
      treatment of chronic pain conditions, including when provided in the primary care setting to
      patients from ethnically diverse, medically underserved populations. Acupuncture is slowly
      being integrated into pain management in many conventional health care settings, but cost and
      reimbursement for this service remain obstacles to offering acupuncture, especially in
      primary care and safety net settings. Because group acupuncture can be offered at much lower
      cost, demonstrating that individual and group delivery are equally effective could reduce
      barriers to use of this effective pain management approach.

      The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate whether acupuncture delivered in the group
      setting for patients with chronic pain is equal to acupuncture delivered in the individual
      setting. A secondary objective will be to use qualitative analysis to understand and describe
      the patient experience of both acupuncture approaches, and to utilize this data to inform
      intervention delivery and dissemination, to better incorporate the patient perspective.

    <description>Comparing the effectiveness of group and individual acupuncture to reduce pain and improve function among primary care patients with chronic pain from an ethnically diverse, medically underserved population. We will access pain, pain interference with function, health status and pain-related disability at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form will serve as the primary measure for pain. We hope to see a 30% or greater improvement of the BPI pain measure between baseline and week 12.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be measured through administering the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Quality of LIfe, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) standardized health-related quality of life questionnaires post intervention. We will also use qualitative methods to understand and incorporate the patient experience of acupuncture, to maximize patient centeredness of intervention and dissemination efforts, through conducting semi-structured interviews, with a subset of participants from each group (n=40), post intervention.</description>
