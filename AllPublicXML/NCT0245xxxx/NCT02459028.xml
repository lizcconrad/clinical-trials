    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic pain is one of the most burdensome potential consequences of a physical disability,
      such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Estimates of the incidence of chronic pain in SCI range
      between 65 - 80%. A recent pilot-study of a computer-based tailored positive psychology
      intervention showed a significant reduction in pain intensity, pain interference, pain
      catastrophizing and depression and an enhancement of subjective well-being and control over
      pain in persons with chronic pain secondary to a physical disability.

      Study Objective:

      Objective 1: To determine the efficacy of a tailored positive psychology intervention (T3P)
      in a community-based, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial on
      subjective well-being and pain in individuals with chronic pain secondary to SCI.

      Hypothesis 1: T3P will result in (1) greater immediate and long-lasting increase in
      subjective well-being, and perceived control over pain and (2) greater immediate and
      long-lasting decrease in depression, pain intensity, pain interference and catastrophizing,
      relative to an active control treatment.

      Specific aim 1: To increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying T3P by determining
      potential mediation effects.

      Hypothesis 2: (1) Pain catastrophizing and pain control mediate the effect of T3P on pain
      intensity, and (2) positive and negative affect mediate the effect of T3P on life
      satisfaction and depression.

      Objective 2: To identify for whom T3P is most effective by exploring potential moderator
      effects.

      Study Design:

      The proposed study is a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with a parallel group
      design to determine the effects and mechanisms of T3P in a Swiss community sample of persons
      with chronic pain secondary to SCI.
