  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether glucagon administered by microneedle patch
      is comparable to glucagon administered by injection pen in the treatment of insulin-induced
      hypoglycemia.

      The purpose of this study is to compare ZP-Glucagon transdermal patch system at doses of 0.5
      mg and 1 mg to glucagon by injection at doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg by means of a 4 way
      crossover open label design. Eligible subjects giving informed consent will be randomised to
      a treatment sequence of each of the four treatments in one week intervals. At each treatment
      visit, subjects will undergo an insulin induction procedure designed to safely induce
      hypoglycemia, and then have a treatment applied, either by injection or by patch, and then
      monitored for return to normoglycemia.
