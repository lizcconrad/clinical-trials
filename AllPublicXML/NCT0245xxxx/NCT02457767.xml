  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators measure and optimize the patients waiting time in the
      preanesthetic assessment by integrating an interactive mobile device. The aim of this study
      is to observe whether the patients mean waiting-time is reduced by the use of a special
      mobile application (Anaest-App) and, as a result , raises patient-satisfaction.

      3000 patients as well as medical doctors receive tablet-devices. The Software (App) installed
      on these devices coordinates the virtual waiting numbers assigned to each patient-tablet. The
      medical doctor can virtually call up the next patient in line for preanesthesiologic
      assessment. After the examination both medical doctors and patients complete a brief
      questionaire regarding educational level, usability and overall satisfaction
