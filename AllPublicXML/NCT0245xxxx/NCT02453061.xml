  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the study the investigators plan to include 100 early affected HD patients (5 ≤ UHDRS ≤
      40) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study in 2 centers (France and the
      Netherlands). Patients will receive either triheptanoin at 1g/kg of body weight per day (n =
      50), or a control oil (n = 50) at 1g/kg of body weight per day for 6 months followed by an
      open label phase using triheptanoin for another 6 months. Efficacy of triheptanoin will be
      evaluated by measurements of caudate volume using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and
      brain energy metabolism as evaluated by the ratio of inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine,
      during visual stimulation, using 31P-MRS. Clinical improvement will be evaluated by UHDRS,
      TFC, and PBA-S scores as well as performance on the neuropsychological battery; patient
      quality of life will be evaluated with qualitative research methods after 6 months and with
      the SF-36 questionnaire before and after treatment; biological tolerance and compliance will
      be evaluated by routine biochemical blood tests, plasma and urine measurements of
      triheptanoin oil derivatives and patient report.
