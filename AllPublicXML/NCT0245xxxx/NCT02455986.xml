  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A school based pedometer competition among Year 9 pupils (12 - 14 years old) to promote
      physical activity (PA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is separated into three main phases.

      Phase One: A 10-week school competition using pedometers and a range of non-financial
      incentives e.g. t-shirts, pens, badges etc. (April - June 2015).

      Phase Two: End of school competition but participants will still keep the pedometers. We will
      set them various challenges over the summer to keep active (July - Oct 2015).

      Phase Three: Removal of all extrinsically motivation factors. Focus on PA maintenance.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mental wellbeing measured by the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale is a validated, self-report instrument assessing mental wellbeing. Possible scores range from range from 14-70, with higher scores indicating higher mental well-being</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in social support for physical activity measured by the social support for physical activity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Social support for physical activity scale is a validated 5-item scale. Social support is measured as tghe sum of responses to four sub-scales including parental social support (3 items), parental encouragement (2 items), peer support (3 items), and teacher support (3 items). Each question is answered with a 4-point response format ranging from 1 (hardly ever or never) to 4 (every day).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in future orientation and impulsivity measured using 8-item time preference scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A previously validated 8-item time preference scale is included. Responses are summed to obtain a a future orientation and impulsivity score. High scores reflect future time orientation and greater impulsivity in decision making.</description>

    <description>The intervention group includes 150 participants aged 12-14 across three schools. Each participant has been given a Fitbit Zip pedometer to wear for a six month period and enrolled on the StepSmart challenge. Participants within the intervention group will take part in two competitions during this period.
School and team based competition. 27/05/15 - 22/06/15 (8 weeks)
Individually focused competition. 22/06/15 - 26/10/15 (18 weeks)
Prizes of low monetary value will be given to participants based on competition performance</description>

    <description>The control group for the study involves approximately 90 participants aged 12 - 14. across two schools. Participants within the control group will complete the same measures as the intervention group including wearing an actigraph GT3X accelerometer for a seven day period and completing all questionnaires at the same time points as the intervention group.</description>
