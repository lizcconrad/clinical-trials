      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat and nivolumab when
      given together with ipilimumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to
      other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment
      (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it started to
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Entinostat may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth (locally
      advanced/metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving entinostat and nivolumab together
      with ipilimumab may be a better treatment in patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of entinostat and nivolumab
      with or without ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of entinostat and
      nivolumab with ipilimumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to further confirm the
      safety of the combination therapy in subjects with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether treatment with entinostat alone or in combination with nivolumab and
      ipilimumab results in an increase in the ratio of tumor antigen-specific effector T cells
      (Teff) to regulatory T cell (Treg) in tumor biopsies compared to baseline.

      II. To describe preliminary anti-tumor activity of entinostat and nivolumab in combination
      with or without ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity in an expansion cohort of patients with
      advanced breast cancer treated at the RP2D.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore changes in immune-related biomarkers (e.g., expression of checkpoint receptors
      [PD-1/PD-L1], the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], inflammatory T cell
      signature, T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire) in tumor biopsies or peripheral blood
      lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy.

      II. To correlate changes in immune-related biomarkers pre- and post-combination therapy with
      response.

      III. To measure tumor-specific mutations and mutant neo-antigens recognized by patient T
      cells in tumor biopsies and to describe association with response.

      IV. To evaluate changes in frequency of T cells recognizing tumor-specific mutant
      neo-antigens in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) pre- and post-therapy.

      V. To evaluate changes in candidate gene expression, including the azacitidine (AZA) immune
      genes (AIM genes) in malignant tissue, gene methylation silencing in circulating
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and malignant tissue pre- and post-therapy.

      VI. To correlate the pharmacodynamic outcomes (e.g., safety, efficacy, and changes in gene
      methylation status) with the exposure of entinostat (i.e., pharmacokinetics) when
      co-administered with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.

      VII. To conduct pharmacogenomic association analyses to assess the potential clinical utility
      of CD86 gene polymorphisms as genetic determinants of immune mediated adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days -14 and -7 and then weekly, nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and then every 2 weeks, and ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1 and then every 6 weeks for 4 doses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

          -  Known sensitivity to or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition entinostat, nivolumab, or ipilimumab; history
             of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded; these include but are not
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia
             gravis, systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
             connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's,
             ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and patients with a history of toxic
             epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should
             be excluded; patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis
             managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible;
             patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and
             psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive serology, such
             as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the
             presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but
             should otherwise be eligible

          -  NOTE: patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)

          -  Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the
             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity; NOTE: subjects
             must have baseline oxygen/saturation level requirements as above

          -  Patients with active or untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are
             excluded from this clinical trial; NOTE: patients with previously treated brain
             metastases must have stable neurologic status and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             imaging following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at least 4 weeks, with no
             requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day
             prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration
             (stable low dose dexamethasone allowed at discretion of protocol chair)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the judgment of the
             investigator would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; patients who have a positive test for hepatitis
             B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C antibody (hepatitis C virus [HCV]
             Ab)/ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) indicating acute or chronic infection are also
             ineligible (baseline testing required)

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted

          -  Patients requiring concurrent administration of valproic acid are also excluded

          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need
             for additional treatment before coming on study

          -  Another active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration with the exception of
             non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of any type; NOTE: if there is a
             history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment for
             their cancer; any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has never required
             therapy may allowed at the discretion of the protocol chair
