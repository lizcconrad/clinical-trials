      A 4 week-duration cross-over study on Ticagrelor and Clopidogrel for the Acute Coronary
      Syndrome (ACS) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) subjects, focusing on the platelet inhibition
      and safety observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome is a high mortality and costly disease. Antiplatelet therapies,
      including aspirin and P2Y12 antagonist, play important roles at the acute and subacute stage
      treatment for acute coronary syndrome, especially after coronary stent implantation. Patients
      with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) experience higher cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. Clopidogrel, one of P2Y12 receptor antagonists, inhibits the
      receptor's activation by blocking its interaction with ADP. However, the efficacy of
      clopidogrel shows substantial variation and residual platelet reactivity, which is related to
      adverse cardiovascular outcome, especially in impaired renal function. Our study aims to
      check the platelet inhibition rate comparing both medication with a cross-over study among
      CKD subjects and ACS condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Female and male, age between 20-75 years

          3. Stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR&lt;60ml/min) patients or ESRD

          4. Taking standard treatment dose of clopidogrel (75mg/day) for more than 1 week

          5. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were hospitalized for an acute coronary
             syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation, with an onset of symptoms during the
             past 6 months.

          6. For patients who had an acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation, at least
             two of the following three criteria had to be met: ST-segment changes on
             electrocardiography, indicating ischemia; a positive test of a biomarker, indicating
             myocardial necrosis; or one of several risk factors (age ≥60 years; previous

             disease with stenosis of ≥50% in at least two vessels; previous ischemic stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, carotid stenosis of at least 50%, or cerebral
             revascularization; diabetes mellitus; peripheral arterial disease).

             following two inclusion criteria had to be met: persistent ST-segment elevation of at
             least 0.1 mV in at least two contiguous leads or a new left bundle-branch block.
