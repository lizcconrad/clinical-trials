      The purpose of the study is to identify prognostic markers and possible success rate of
      tolerance induction to peanut allergens in children allergic to peanut.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open randomized controlled study on oral immunotherapy including 60 children
      (40 on active treatment, 20 controls) with primary peanut allergy. The study has 4 phases: 1:
      inclusion/randomization including a double blind placebo controlled food Challenge 2: bi
      weekly up-dosing to maintenance dose after 48 weeks, 3: maintenance period of 3 years 4: 1
      year follow up after end of treatment.

      Clinical parameters as well as immunological (serological and cellular) will be recorded at
      inclusion, after 3 months of up-dosing, at end of up-dosing, after 1 and 3 years of
      maintenance treatment and after 3 and 12 year of follow up.
