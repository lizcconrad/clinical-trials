      The study will enrol adult female and male patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma and brain
      metastases who are not eligible for surgery or radiosurgery and failed prior therapy with
      ipilimumab, and patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma and brain metastases who
      are not eligible for surgery or radiosurgery and who failed prior therapy with a BRAF
      inhibitor.

             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL). Patients with elevated hCG at baseline that
             is judged to be related to the tumor are eligible if hCG levels do not show the
             expected doubling when repeated 5-7 days later, or pregnancy has been ruled out by
             vaginal ultrasound

         17. Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during during the study and
             through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

             a. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and
             for 16 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in
             this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom
             is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the
             drug via seminal fluid.

             b. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
             through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment c. Highly effective
             contraception is defined as either: i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception].

        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate
        post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study
        subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient] iv.
        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/ cream/vaginal suppository.

          3. Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not
             allowed as buparlisib decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.

        NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)
        agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of ovarian
        suppression.

        18. Patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8%) or
        poorly controlled steroid-induced diabetes mellitus (glycosolated hemoglobin &gt; 8%)
