  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic abnormalities (including
      insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia) that are risk factors for
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can improve all of the cardiometabolic
      abnormalities associated with obesity. Up to ~25% of lean people (Body Mass Index[BMI]
      18.5-24.9kg/m2) have many of the cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and
      are referred to as metabolically abnormal lean (MAL) people. However, the MAL phenotype is
      not well characterized and it is unclear whether weight loss has beneficial metabolic effects
      in already lean people. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to: 1) carefully phenotype MAL
      people and 2) evaluate the effect of moderate (8-10%) diet-induced weight loss in MAL people.
      This will be investigated in 15 MAL (defined as intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content
      ≥5.6% and glycated hemoglobin ≥5.7%, or fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dl, or
      2-hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose concentration ≥140 mg/dl) men and
      women. Only lean people who have a BMI&gt;/= 21.0 but &lt;25.0kg/m2 will be asked to lose weight to
      avoid the risk that participants become underweight (BMI &lt;18.5kg/m2) during weight loss
      therapy..
