      CUT*HIVTHER 001 is a randomised placebo-controlled Phase I/II study aimed at exploring the
      safety and immunogenicity of two different modes of delivery of a GTU® DNA plasmid vaccine
      (GTU®-multiHIV B clade) in HIV infected volunteers on antiretroviral therapy (ART):

        -  Transcutaneous (TC) delivery to enhance intramuscular delivery and

        -  Electroporation (EP) enhanced intramuscular delivery Participants will be randomised
           1:1:1 to TC:EP:saline for the purposes of analysis. Half the saline group will receive
           TC saline and half will receive EP saline.

           30 HIV infected male and female volunteers aged 18-45 years, who have been on ART for at
           least 6 months with 2 or more HIV plasma viral load measurements &lt; 50 copies HIV RNA/ml
           prior to enrolment.

      The investigational HIV-1 vaccine GTU®-MultiHIV B clade encodes for a MultiHIV antigen which
      is a synthetic fusion protein consisting of full-length polypeptides of Rev, Nef, Tat, p17
      and p24 and containing more than 20 Th and CTL epitopes of protease, reverse transcriptase
      (RT) and gp160 regions of the HAN2 HIV-1 B clade.

      Vaccine is provided in sealed vials at 2mg/ml, and a single 1ml IM injection of 2mg
      GTU®-MultiHIV DNA IM (into the thigh) is required to deliver a 2mg dose. Individuals in Group
      2 will receive a further 0.4mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA in 0.2ml administered by TC, a novel
      needle-free method of vaccine delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are exploring combination regimens with the overall aims of (i) optimising
      immune responses and (ii) developing safe and well tolerated strategies which will favour the
      development of T-cell responses that may enhance anti-HIV HIV therapy with the forward
      looking goal of working towards functional eradication of infection. The investigator
      proposes to combine the previously used IM and TC methods because preclinical data suggest
      that the combination of methods will favour the development of CD8 T cell responses. All
      groups will receive 6.0mg of the vaccine IM given in 3 doses over 12 weeks. Group 1 will
      receive the 6.0mg IM with electroporation (EP) and Group 2 will receive the 6.0mg IM without
      EP but together with an additional 1.2mg vaccine TC. The primary immunogenicity endpoint will
      be to determine whether either intervention group augments the cellular responses to vaccine
      specific peptides in relation to baseline. It is anticipated that none of subjects receiving
      saline placebo would have an increase in vaccine specific responses relative to those at
      baseline. Therefore if the differences between the active groups and saline placebo are
      sufficiently large, for example 80% responders in a GTU®-MultiHIV DNA active group, &lt;10% in
      the control group, this would be significant.

      Should the regimes prove safe, acceptable and induce significant immunogenicity then the
      intention is to move one or both regimes into a larger study powered to determine their
      potential long-term impact on therapy when used in combination with conventional ARV
      regimens. Proof of concept that DNA vaccination can induce de novo HIV specific responses
      that are associated with control of viral replication, would justify further investigation of
      their use in immunotherapies combined with ART intensification and/or anti-latency drugs.

    <description>Group 1 (Transcutaneous and Placebo) Participants will receive 1.0ml intramuscular injections of the vaccine Sodium Chloride BP into the upper thigh. Participants will also have a further 0.2ml of Sodium Chloride BP delivered transcutaneously. An area of skin of approximately 4 x 4cm will be photographed and prepared first. During this preparation, the area is shaved to remove the hair, and then superglue is applied to remove the top layer of skin (like waxing). The vaccine is spread onto the skin surface. Once applied, the area is covered with a comfeel bandage, the investigator will ask volunteers to not engage in strenuous exercise, shower, or bathe for 24 hours afterwards.</description>

    <description>Group 3 (Electroporation and Placebo) Participants will receive 1.0ml intramuscular injections of Sodium Chloride BP into the upper thigh using the ICHOR TriGridTM delivery system for intramuscular (TDS-IM) delivery with electroporation. Electroporation (EP) improves the delivery of the product into muscle cells, by delivering an electrical pulse with the injection using a hand held device that is pressed against your thigh. This will cause a muscle twitch with a sharp cramp-like feeling in the thigh lasting a few seconds. Once the procedure is carried out, the muscle will feel sore for up to 72 hours. The investigator will ask volunteers not to engage in any strenuous exercise for at least 24 hours after the procedure.</description>
