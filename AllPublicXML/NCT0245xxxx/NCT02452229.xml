      Herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus infection are purported to
      play a pivotal role in morbidity and mortality in burns. Thus far, there is no existing
      systematic review (Level of Evidence III or higher) describing the unique role as well as
      concurrent infections of these viruses in burns. The aim of this review is to point out the
      clinical differences between these human herpes virus subtypes, to outline established
      therapy approaches, and to provide evidence for virus related morbidity and mortality in
      burns.

      This systematic review was created according the PRIMSA (preferred reporting items for
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines and checklist.

      We performed an review of the medical literature to identify all studies that contain HSV,
      CMV and VZV infections in burns.Therefore, systematic review of the Medline database by using
      PubMed and Ovid interface was conducted. Also the Web of Science interface was used for
      systematic literature search.

      On the PubMed interface, we used the following search terms: (&quot;HSV&quot;[All Fields] OR
      &quot;herpes&quot;[All Fields] OR &quot;CMV&quot;[All Fields] OR &quot;cytomegalovirus&quot;[All Fields] OR &quot;VZV&quot;[All
      Fields] OR &quot;varicella-zoster&quot;[All Fields]) AND (&quot;burns&quot;[MeSH Terms] OR &quot;burns&quot;[All Fields] OR
      &quot;burn&quot;[All Fields] OR &quot;thermal trauma&quot;[All Fields]). For Ovid we used: exp Burns/ AND (exp
      Herpes Zoster/ or exp Encephalitis, Herpes Simplex/ or exp Herpes Simplex/ or exp Herpes
      Simples Virus Vaccines/), exp Burns/ AND (exp Cytomegalovirus/ or exp Cytomegalovirus
      Infections/), exp Burns/ AND (exp Chickenpox/ or Herpesvirus 3. Human/ or exp Herpes
      Zoster/). And for Web of Science we used: (TS=(HSV OR herpes OR CMV OR cytomegalovirus OR VZV
      OR varicella-zoster) AND TS=(burn OR burns OR thermal trauma)) AND LANGUAGE: (English) AND
      DOCUMENT TYPES: (Article); Timespan: All years; Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&amp;HCI, CPCI-S.

        Every year, about 500,000 citizens of the United States of America were burned; 50,000 of
        them were admitted to Burn Center. Bacterial and viral infections including cellulitis,
        pneumonia, wound infections and septicemia are among the top ten complications of burn
        injuries. Severe burn injury causes an increased inflammatory response and an overall
        immunosuppression. As a result severely burned patients are more prone to infections and
        septicemia. Early treatment of sepsis and prevention of infections are key to reducing
        morbidity and improving the long-term outcome of burn victims.
