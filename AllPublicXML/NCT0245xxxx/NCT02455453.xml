    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the uptake of a radioactive tracer
      21-18F-fluoro-16α,17α-[(R)-(1'-α-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (FFNP)
      uptake, which binds to breast cancer progesterone receptors (PgRs) on a PET/CT scan before
      and after administration of estradiol for one day (estrogen challenge) to determine if the
      change in uptake is a predictor of response to endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with
      hormone-sensitive estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Estradiol is the most potent of the naturally occurring
      estrogens, and can be administered to treat menopausal symptoms and also sometimes to treat
      metastatic breast cancer. The investigators propose to study patients with biopsy-proven
      newly diagnosed, locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer who are going to be
      treated with endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifen,aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as
      standard of care therapy.

      Subjects will undergo a total of two FFNP-PET/CT scans; one before and a second one
      immediately following the one day estradiol challenge before the start of standard of care
      ET. The estradiol challenge will consist of administering a total of 6 mg of estradiol orally
      (three doses of 2 mg each) given at approximately 8 hour intervals and over a 24 hour period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be postmenopausal defined as meeting one or more of the following:

               -  Amenorrheic for at least 12 months

               -  Surgically sterile- having undergone bilateral oophorectomy,

                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) laboratory testing must be ordered as standard
                  of care to determine optimal treatment and should not be ordered simply to
                  confirm eligibility to this study)

                  period is needed if the patient was treated with tamoxifen) who are going to be
                  treated with ET.

          -  Patient must have any one of the following types of breast cancer (primary or
             metastatic): ER+/PgR+/HER2- or ER+/PgR-/HER2-.

               -  ER+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater.

               -  PgR+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater.

               -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the primary assay methodology for HER2. HER2-
                  refers to HER2 of 0, 1+ by IHC or negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization
                  (FISH)

          -  Patient must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 by
             radiological evaluation (ultrasound, mammography, MRI, CT, PET) or physical

                  is peripheral or not too close to hepatic ducts. Decision on hepatic lesion
                  eligibility will be made by the principal investigator or sub-investigator after
                  careful review of all available imaging to ensure evaluation of the lesion will
                  not be obscured by normal hepatobiliary excretion of 18F-FFNP.
