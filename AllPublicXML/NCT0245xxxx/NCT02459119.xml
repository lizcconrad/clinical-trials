  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well Regorafenib controls disease progression in urothelial cancer
      (cancer occurring in the urinary bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis) following previous
      therapy with chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor long-term prognosis. The disease has not seen
      improved outcomes despite research efforts in over two decades. Novel therapeutic options are
      needed. Regorafenib is a novel oral multikinase inhibitor but is more potent than a similar
      multikinase inhibitor drug that treats advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular
      carcinoma. Regorafenib has been shown to have a broader capacity to inhibit blood supply to
      tumor sources.

      This trial evaluates a proof-of-concept using Regorafenib in patients with metastatic
      progressive urothelial carcinoma following chemotherapy but still have a high level of
      activity performance in their daily living. The initial dose of Regorafenib will be 120 mg
      daily and then be escalated to 160 mg daily before gradually tapering.

    <description>Regorafenib will be administered orally to all patients on study. The drug will be taken once a day for 3 of every 4 week cycle (3 weeks on/1 week off). The dose is 120 mg once daily for the first cycle, then 160 mg once daily from the second cycle if no significant Regorafenib-associated toxicities occur during the first cycle. Drug dosage may be modified if toxicities occur. Patients will undergo up to 4 cycles of treatment and may continue on additional at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
