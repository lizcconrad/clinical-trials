      -  Background and study aims : The investigators conducted this study to compare the
           movement of extraocular muscle after two types of recession surgery with non-invasive
           tool called AS-OCT.

        -  Who can participate? patients who will undergo two types (conventional method and
           hang-back method) of typical bilateral lateral rectus recession surgery for correcting
           intermittent exotropia

        -  What does the study involve? Volunteers will attend a clinic for four visits over three
           months. They will undergo AS-OCT at every visits during follow up period. AS-OCT is
           non-invasive test to evaluate operation site. The test only requires their cooperation
           when they undergo AS-OCT.

        -  What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? This is non-invasive test for
           your postoperative follow up. Therefore, there will be no risks about this test.

        -  Where is the study run from? Samsung Medical Center

        -  When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? From April 2015 to
           Dec 2015

      This study is a following study of our prior study about AS-OCT in strabismus. The aim of
      this study is to compare the longitudinal changes of lateral rectus (LR) muscle insertion
      between two types of bilateral recession surgery. An AS-OCT scan of the LR muscle was
      performed every visits. Data on gender, age, degree of deviation (prism diopter), and spur-LR
      insertion distance using AS-OCT were collected at postoperative months 1,3 in each group.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>conventional lateral rectus recession</arm_group_label>
    <description>This is the standard technique for recession with two single-armed sutures.Exposure of the rectus muscle insertion includes freeing the insertion and proximal muscle borders sufficiently to place the sutures. And the needle is passed through the tendon avoiding the anterior ciliary arteries. If the sutures are passed as shown a true knot is formed, and the muscle is detached. Then a caliper measures from the limbus or the original insertion. A passage of the needle through sclera. The recessed muscle is ideally parallel to the old insertion (or nearly so). Conjunctival incision was finally sutured.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>hang-back lateral rectus recession</arm_group_label>
    <description>The hang-back recession has been described as &quot;a simple, safe alternative to conventional recession.&quot; The procedure is said to be less likely to result in scleral perforation because needles are placed through relatively thicker sclera near the insertion site. It is the modified techique for recession with one double-armed sutures.</description>
