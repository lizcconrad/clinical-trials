  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the proposed project is to test the efficacy of a relatively new,
      well-developed math program on the math achievement of elementary school students in
      mainstream classes in urban schools. Use of this program is increasing in Canada and the
      United Kingdom. Preliminary findings derived from uncontrolled trials and our own pilot,
      randomized controlled trial suggest it may yield meaningful gains in math achievement for
      both at-risk and achieving students, as indexed by their performance on national exams, in
      national math competitions, as well as on standardized measures of math achievement. However,
      the program has yet to be rigorously evaluated to determine its relative efficacy compared to
      the math programs typically used by school boards. The program provision of grade-specific
      teacher's guides and student workbooks (for grades 1 to 8), and minimal teacher training,
      points to its potential utility for full-scale implementation, should its efficacy be
      confirmed.

    <description>The JUMP method focuses more on the mental activity involved in constructing mathematical knowledge. There is a strong emphasis on symbolic math (numbers, letters, mathematical symbols). Manipulatives are used prescriptively, in lessons carefully scaffolded to help students connect the objects (e.g., three buttons) to what they are intended to stand for (the magnitude &quot;3&quot;).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The students must: have sufficient command of English to understand their teacher's
             instructions (as judged by their teacher, ELL students will be included provided they
             meet this criterion). They must have a signed parental consent form and also assent to
             participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The students must have no uncorrected sensory, neurological, or physical impairments
             that would preclude the use of manipulatives, perceiving written math materials and
             figures, or hearing the teacher's instructions.
