      This is a prospective, post-marketing, non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm clinical
      study that will be conducted at up to 15 sites in the United States (US). All subjects will
      be treated with the NIRxcell Stent System and followed at 30 days, 9 months and 1, 2 and 3
      years post-index stenting procedure. An unscheduled follow up may be conducted as clinically
      warranted.

      The main objective of this study is to collect and analyze additional information about the
      safety and effectiveness of the NIRxcell Stent System in the treatment of de novo stenotic
      lesions in native coronary arteries in the US population. The primary endpoint will be the
      rate of target vessel failure (TVF) at 3 years of treatment with the NIRxcell Stent System.
      This rate will be compared with a performance goal derived from a meta-analysis of coronary
      stenting with bare metal stents (BMS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints.

          2. Subject was enrolled in another stent trial within 2 years prior to the index
             procedure.
