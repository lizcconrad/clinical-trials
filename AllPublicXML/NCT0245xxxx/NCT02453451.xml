  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients received a MitraClip procedure because of a leakiness of their mitral valves. During
      this procedure the atrioventricular valves were stuck together permanently via a clip which
      leads to a reduction of leakiness. As a result of this procedure a small hole remains at the
      cardiac septum which is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). In most cases the hole will
      close after a few weeks or months, but in many other cases not. Until now there is no exact
      data about the effect of this hole on the filling pressure in the heart or on the blood flow
      behaviour. So the aim of this study is a precise analysis of the blood flow mechanics during
      and after the MitraClip procedure to identify criteria to get more informations for a better
      strategy and regulation of the MitraClip procedure.

    <textblock>
      The percutaneous mitral valve reconstruction (PMVR) using the MitraClip system has become an
      established therapeutic alternative for patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation and
      high operative risk. The MitraClip technology represent a catheter-based non-surgical
      procedure in which a metal cramp (clip) is transported to the place of the defective mitral
      valve. At the same time, it occurs also a 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram
      (3D-TEE) with a transseptal puncture to control this procedure. After removal of the guiding
      catheter a new atrial septal defect can develop which can close spontaneously after weeks or
      months.

      In this study criteria for a standardized evaluation about the effect of the new ASD on
      hemodynamic parameters - before and after the MitraClip procedure - shall be validated for
      the first time. The investigators expect to obtain new findings through the exact analysis of
      the newly formed ASD for the planning, regulation and follow-up of the mitral insufficiency
      treatment.
