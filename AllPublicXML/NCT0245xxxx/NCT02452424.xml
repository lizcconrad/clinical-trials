  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how PLX3397 and pembrolizumab work
      together to affect cancer cells.

      PLX3397 is designed to target the receptor for CSF1 (CSF1R). Pembrolizumab is designed to
      block the interaction between the receptor PD-1 and molecules that bind PD-1. In this study,
      PLX3397 and pembrolizumab are being given together in order to study their combined effects
      on patients' immune responses to their tumors. Tumor-specific immune responses have been
      shown to kill cancer cells and/or to stop tumors from growing.

      Part 1 of the study (dose-escalation phase) will establish the safest dose of PLX3397 to be
      given in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 of the study (expansion phase) will include
      an evaluation of efficacy of this combination in the following tumor types:

        -  Advanced melanoma: prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy but never responded

        -  Advanced melanoma: prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and responded but later progressed as
           defined by irRECIST while on therapy

        -  Non-small cell lung cancer

        -  Ovarian cancer

        -  Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)

        -  Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck

        A subject must satisfy all of the following criteria to be considered for inclusion in the
        study:

          -  Subjects with histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of cancer that is
             recurrent, metastatic, or persistent, who have relapsed from or are refractory to
             treatment and who also meet the following corresponding requirements for the cohort or
             phase of the study into which they will enroll:

               -  Dose-escalation Phase: Subjects with advanced solid tumors (any tumor type)
                  considered to have no standard-of-care treatment for their malignancy with a
                  curative intent, either as initial therapy or after progressing to prior
                  therapies; subjects who have been treated previously with a CSF1R inhibitor or an
                  anti PD1/PDL1 inhibitor may enroll.

               -  Expansion Phase: Subjects with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer
                  (non-squamous; EGFR, ALK wild type), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and

             antiPD1/anti-PDL1 therapy. They must have tumor accessible for sequential biopsy (core
             needle biopsy or excision required) and be willing to provide on study tumor tissue
             biopsy. Subjects for whom newly obtained samples cannot be obtained (e.g. inaccessible
