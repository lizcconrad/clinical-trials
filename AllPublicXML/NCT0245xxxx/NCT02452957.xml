    <description>The Simpliciti™ nucleus is a humeral prosthesis intended for total and hemi shoulder arthroplasty in patients with a severely painful and/or disabled joint resulting from osteoarthritis or traumatic arthritis.
The implant is sized to match and replicate the anatomy of the proximal humerus, while maintaining a bone conserving approach. It does not extend beyond the metaphysis, leaving the humeral canal untouched. Fixation is enhanced through a porous coating with a high coefficient of friction; resulting in a solid initial fit and long term fixation.
The Simpliciti™ nucleus is designed to receive a humeral head. The Simpliciti™ system is authorized to bear the CE mark and will be investigated within this clinical study in accordance with its intended use.</description>
