  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the incidence and transmission of avian influenza viruses in
      humans exposed to poultry. Enrolled subjects will be selected from five different rural areas
      (villages) in the Nile delta region in Egypt where poultry are commonly raised. From those
      study sites, 2400 healthy subjects will be monitored for 6 years with annual follow up visits
      to measure sero-prevalence and exposure variables, and more importantly, biweekly or weekly
      visits to measure incidence of infection, measure secondary transmission rates, monitor
      symptoms, and assess immunological response.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the incidence of avian influenza (AI) in poultry-exposed human populations.

        -  To estimate sero-prevalent of AI in poultry-exposed human populations.

        -  To investigate potential risk factors associated with AI human infections in
           poultry-exposed individuals.

        -  To investigate secondary infection risk for household contacts.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the antigenic and genetic makeup of AI viruses infecting humans.

        -  To monitor the pathogenicity and disease severity of AI viruses causing human infections
           and the associated immune response.

        -  To investigate the serologic response following confirmed influenza virus infection.

      All residents of a household will be invited to participate. After study enrollment,
      participants will complete a questionnaire to collect data on the demographics and health
      status of the subjects and the poultry kept at the household. A 3-ml blood sample will be
      obtained from each subject for serological testing.

      Field nurses or physicians will visit each household biweekly (October through March) or
      weekly (April through September) to determine if any subject has influenza-like illness
      (ILI), defined according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria as having measured
      fever of ≥38ºC. and cough and/or sore throat. Subjects with confirmed ILI (index case) will
      provide two nasal swabs for a point-of-care rapid influenza A test and PCR. For those who
      test positive for influenza A by rapid test or PCR on nasal swab (day 1), two 3-ml blood
      samples will be obtained. In addition, nasal washes, throat swabs, and blood samples will be
      obtained from all household contacts.

      Cloacal swabs will also be collected from the poultry in the household on day 1.

      The index case and household contacts will be re-sampled by nasal wash and throat swab on
      days 3, 6, 9 and 14 post initial diagnosis data, and an additional 3-ml blood sample will be
      obtained on day 14 for serological testing.

      Household contacts who report ILI symptoms during follow-up visits to the index case will
      then be followed with the same follow-up regimen as the original index case.

      At annual follow-up and final visits, questionnaire data will be updated if needed, and a
      3-ml blood sample will be obtained from each subject for serological testing.

      Subjects who agree to participate in this study will have blood samples collected for
      influenza testing, antibody determination and viral typing. Subjects will be asked for
      permission to keep any remaining samples for possible use in future research studies such as
      testing for antibodies or evidence of infection with another influenza virus or other
      pathogen. Some samples will be stored indefinitely at the laboratory at the National Research
      Centre (NRC), Egypt, or St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Poultry-exposed individuals with poultry in the household willing to participate by
             signing a consent or assent form as appropriate for age, completing the study

          -  Any known immunosuppressive condition or immune deficiency disease (including HIV
             infection), or ongoing receipt of any immunosuppressive therapy. (Note that we have
             chosen to exclude such populations because of their increased risk of acquiring
             infections, they are relatively few, and are not representative of a national sample.)
