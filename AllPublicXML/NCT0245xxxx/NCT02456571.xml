  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore the prevalence of expression of four immune checkpoint
      biomarkers on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from men with metastatic prostate cancer that
      are captured by EpCAM via the CellSearch method, and specifically defined as co expressing
      DAPI and cytokeratin, and lacking CD45 expression.

             neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate are also permitted.

          2. Clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive metastatic disease, with progression
             defined as a rising PSA, new metastatic lesions (bone or soft tissue), or radiographic
             evidence of tumor growth on CT or MRI.

          3. Age ≥ 18 years.

          4. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        In addition to meeting all of the above criteria, patients must meet all of the criteria
        for one of the following groups:

             small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, or those receiving ADT therapy):
             Castrate levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dl)

          2. Patient planning to start sipuleucel-T.

             small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, or those receiving ADT therapy):
             Castrate levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dl)

          2. Visceral OR high risk disease - must meet one of the following categories:

               -  Visceral disease: Radiographic evidence of liver, adrenal, pulmonary, or brain

             small cell or neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, or those receiving ADT therapy):
             Castrate levels of testosterone (≤ 50 ng/dl)

          2. Evidence of disease progression on or following enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate,
             as defined by one of the following:

               -  Radiographic evidence of disease progression as defined by new bone scan lesions
                  or growth of existing soft tissue/visceral/lymph node/bone metastases as
                  determined by the investigator

               -  Clinical progression of disease with cutaneous lesions or palpable lesions in
                  absence of radiographic progression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
             participation in a blood drawing protocol difficult or not feasible at the discretion
             of the principal investigator or co-investigator(s).

          2. Treatment with an anthracycline (including mitoxantrone) within 1 week of CTC
             collection, as anthracyclines cause auto-fluorescence of cells.
