  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, multi-center study, 200 patients from four participating Texas burn
      hospitals will be enrolled from admission to discharge. The clinical research study team will
      collect approximately 11 serum samples and clinical data related to sepsis and infection
      predictors from severely burned adult patients, ages 18-80 years old. All serum samples from
      participating sites will be shipped to the lead site, University of Texas Medical Branch. The
      University of Texas Medical Branch will then validate previously identified biomarkers while
      simultaneously identifying novel biomarkers through discovery proteomics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burn literature is replete with suggested biomarkers of infections for identifying sepsis
      or other infections in burn patients, however, these reports are largely untested. In order
      for incorporation of infection biomarker assessment to become the standard of care,
      validation of these markers in a multi-center prospective study is necessary. As the majority
      of these biomarkers have been chosen because of success in other patient populations, or ease
      of measurement, it is possible that the best biomarkers of infection have not yet been
      discovered in this patient population. Prospective identification and validation of novel
      biomarkers may also improve early identification of infections in burn patients. Early
      treatment of infections and sepsis directly correlated with improved survival and reduced
      costs of care.

    <description>Blood is to be collected at admission, prior to the 1st operating procedure, once daily for the following 7 consecutive days, at day 15, and at discharge (11 blood draws total). Blood will be taken from IV catheter or routine venipuncture if the catheter is not in place. The blood draw will occur prior to the induction of anesthesia or operating surgical procedure.</description>

          -  Greater than 20% Total Body Surface Area burn

          -  Patient arrival to the burn center within 7 days of burn injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related complex
             (ARC), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent

          -  Decision not to treat due to burn injury severity or futility as deemed by the
             clinical team at the time of admission (Note: This is a clinical determination of
             futility beyond which survival is rare. These are typically patients whose sum of
             Total Body Surface Area % burn and age (Baux score) exceeds 140 or 120 with severe
             inhalation injury.)
