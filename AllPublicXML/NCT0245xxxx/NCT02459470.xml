    <textblock>
      The aim pf this prospective study is to investigate the ability of stroke volume variation
      (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) to predict fluid responsiveness in patients
      undergoing kidney transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Optimal intraoperative fluid management guided by central venous pressure (CVP), a
      traditional intravascular volume status indicator has been established to improve
      transplanted graft function during renal transplantation. Recently, stroke volume variation
      (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV), dynamic preload indices derived from the arterial
      waveform are increasingly advocated as predictors of fluid responsiveness in anesthetized
      patients and critically ill patients. However, their usefulness in renal failure patients
      undergoing renal transplantation has not been investigated. Thus, the aims of this study is
      to investigate accuracy of SVV and PPV for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients
      undergoing kidney transplantation.
