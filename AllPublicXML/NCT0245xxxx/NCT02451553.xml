      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of afatinib dimaleate when given
      together with capecitabine in treating patients with solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or
      biliary cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment and has not responded to previous treatment. Afatinib dimaleate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving afatinib dimaleate together with capecitabine may be a better
      treatment for solid tumors, pancreatic cancer, or biliary cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D) of afatinib dimaleate (afatinib) in combination with capecitabine in patients with
      advanced solid tumors (phase I) and pancreatico-biliary cancers (phase Ib). (Phase I/Ib)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate biomarkers of response from tumor biopsies, including markers related to the
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      pathways via OncoPlex or other equivalent gene sequencing assay. (Phase I/Ib)

      II. Evaluate rates of response and stable disease, duration of response, time to progression,
      progression-free and overall survival. (Phase I/Ib)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of afatinib dimaleate followed by a phase
      Ib study.

      Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and capecitabine
      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
