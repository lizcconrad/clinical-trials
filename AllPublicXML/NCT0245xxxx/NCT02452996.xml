  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, the safety and tolerability of GNbAC1 as a treatment for MS patients
      will be evaluated in healthy male volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The monoclonal antibody, GNbAC1, targets the envelope protein (Env) of the human endogenous
      retrovirus (HERV), also called multiple sclerosis associated retrovirus (MSRV), which is
      considered as a critical factor in the development of multiple sclerosis.

      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GNbAC1 following
      single ascending doses (6, 18, and 36 mg/kg) administered via IV infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects as determined by past medical history, physical examination,

             allergic rhinitis that requires no treatment may be tolerated).

          -  Need of any prescription medication within 15 days prior to the administration of the
             study drug and/or non-prescription medication within 7 days prior to the

             during the study.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial during the previous 3 months, i.e. from completion
             of the previous trial to the planned first administration of the current trial.
