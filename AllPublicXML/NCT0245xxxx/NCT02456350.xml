      Autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with a
      safety switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma
      and leukemia. The patients will be monitored after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T
      cells for adverse events, persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and treatment
      efficacy.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell therapy for
      patients with B cell malignancies.

      Eligibility:

      Patients between 1 and 85 years of age, who have relapsed or refractory CD19-expressing
      B-cell malignancies (leukemia or lymphoma) that have not responded to standard treatments.

      Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria
      are eligible to participate.

      Patients must have adequate organ functions.

      Design:

        -  Peripheral blood from patients will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which will be transduced with a lentiviral or retroviral
           vector encoding anti-CD19 CAR containing a CD28 and a CD3 zeta as costimulatory domains
           as well as a safety switch.

        -  Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen to prepare their immune
           system to accept modified T cells.

        -  Patients will receive an infusion of their own modified T cells. They will remain in the
           hospital to be monitored for adverse events until they have recovered from the
           treatment.

        -  Patients will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the persistence of modified T
           cells and efficacy of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress has been made to date in the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies,
      including leukemia and lymphoma, many patients with relapsed or refractory diseases do not
      respond to the standard treatments. It has been shown that anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells
      may be an effective approach to treat the relapsed or refractory diseases. The procedure
      involves collecting PBMCs from the patients and modifying the T cells to attack the malignant
      B cells. In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, and a safety
      switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and
      leukemia. The patients will be pretreated with a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen
      before the infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and will be monitored for adverse events,
      persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and the treatment efficacy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Primary objectives

        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of anti-CD19 CAR
           transduced T cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies.

        -  Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if the treatment regimen can result in clinical regression of B-cell
           malignancies in the patients as described above.

        -  To determine the in vivo persistency of the anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells.
