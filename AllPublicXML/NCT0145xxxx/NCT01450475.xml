  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with cardiac and cerebral injury because of
      ischemia/reperfusion in approximately one third of cases. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC),
      have been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction (MI). As another ischemic
      conditioning, remote ischemic postconditioning, limits MI size in animal models. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the cardiac and cerebral protective effect of remote ischemic
      postconditioning in children undergoing cardiac surgery, as a single-center, randomized
      controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with Troponin release because of ischemia/reperfusion injury in
      approximately one third of cases. And I/R injury may also induce cerebral insult, even
      Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD).Transient sublethal episodes of ischemia before a
      prolonged ischemia/reperfusion injury, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been
      shown to reduce the extent of myocardial infarction (MI).And remote ischemic
      postconditioning(RIPoC), as another ischemic condition, limits MI size in animal models.

      However, there are limited outcome to demonstrate protection from RIPoC during cardiac
      surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cardiac and cerebral protective
      effect of remote ischemic postconditioning , as a single-center, randomized controlled trial.
