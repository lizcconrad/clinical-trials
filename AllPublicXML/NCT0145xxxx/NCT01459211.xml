      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of a combination of
      dexamethasone and lenalidomide (Revlimid®) (D+L) in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL
      who have failed or are unable to tolerate standard up-front therapy with regimens containing
      Fludarabine or in those with mutations in the p53 gene, CAMPATH-1H.

    <textblock>
      In this study we plan to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      dexamethasone, and lenalidomide (D+L) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, a subgroup
      with limited treatment options. Lenalidomide offers an alternative way of treating CLL. In a
      Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetics study (study 1398/180) in healthy male volunteers, it was
      demonstrated that lenalidomide administered at a dose of 100 mg twice a day for 6 days had an
      acceptable safety profile with grade 1-2 rash and pruritus being the primary adverse events
      associated with the administration of the compound. In myeloma and MDS, lenalidomide has been
      studied mostly at two doses: 25 mg/day and 10 mg/day. In CLL significant toxicity was
      observed with these two dose levels, including tumour lysis syndrome and tumour flare.47,48
      We therefore plan to start therapy with lenalidomide at a relatively low dose of 5mg/day,
      days 1-28, with cycle 1 and escalate to the maximum dose of 10mg/day with cycles 2-12. We
      have elected to administer lenalidomide continuously as opposed to pulsing over 14-21 days of
      each cycle to reduce the risk of tumour flare reaction (TFR), when this agent is reintroduced
      with each cycle. Finally, lenalidomide will be administered in combination with
      Dexamethasone, at a dose of 20mg/day for 4 days in each 28 day cycle as this allows
      convenient oral administration. We and others have demonstrated that Dexamethasone level is
      effective in CLL patients who are refractory or have relapsed following primary Fludarabine
      therapy. The combination of D+L will likely reduce toxicity, especially TFR, whilst improving
      overall efficacy without promoting the emergence of chemoresistant clones in which tumour
      suppressor genes have been inactivated.

    <description>Response will be assessed 4 weeks after completion or discontinuation of treatment. Response and disease status will be assessed at monthly follow up visits until 6 months post completion or discontinuation of treatment. After this patients will be assessed annually until death and the date of first relapse or progression will be recorded for every patient, therefore giving a duration of response in months.</description>

    <description>Patients will be assessed after completion or discontinuation of treatment monthly until 6 months, and then assessed annually. At these assessments the patients status will be assessed and any further treatment for the disease will be recorded and the date of this treatment. Therefore the time from end of chemotherapy to next treatment will be recorded for each patient, in months.</description>

    <description>Subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL will receive twelve 28-day cycles of treatment. Each cycle will consist of:
Oral Dexamethasone (20mg daily, days 1-4),
