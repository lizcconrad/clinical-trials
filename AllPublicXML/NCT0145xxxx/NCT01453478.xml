      This is a Phase I study to assess the combined effects of food and suppression of gastric
      acid secretion on the relative bioavailability of an immediate release (IR) tablet
      formulation and prototype bioenhanced formulations of GSK1325756, an oral interleukin 8
      receptor (IL8R also known as CXCR2) antagonist. The objectives are to understand if the
      co-administration of food enhances absorption and the inter-subject variability for the
      current GSK1325756 IR tablet under fed state proton pump inhibitor (PPI) conditions and
      secondly to assess whether two proposed bioenhanced formulations offer any improvement over
      the current GSK1325756 IR formulation under PPI conditions.

      This open-label, randomized, 5-period crossover study will be completed in a single cohort of
      subjects, with an interim analysis after completion of Treatment Period 4. During Treatment
      Periods 1 to 4, subjects will be randomized to receive GSK1325756 50 mg IR in the fed state,
      GSK1325756 50 mg IR in the fasted state, GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 1 in the fasted
      state, and GSK1325756 Bioenhanced Formulation 2 in the fasted state. Progression to Treatment
      Period 5 and the choice of bioenhanced formulation for dosing in this treatment period will
      be dependent on the findings of an interim analysis of the pharmacokinetic profile and
      relative bioavailability of each formulation following completion of Treatment Periods 1 to
      4. In Treatment Period 5, subjects will receive the selected GSK1325756 bioenhanced
      formulation in the fed state.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability, including
      the inter-subject variability, of the immediate release (IR) tablet used for the previous
      Phase I studies and 2 prototype bioenhanced tablet formulations of GSK1325756 in healthy
      elderly male and female subjects under fed and fasted states during suppression of gastric
      acid secretion (concomitant omeprazole, 20 mg, once daily (QD)). Secondary objectives include
      provision of information on the oral pharmacokinetic (PK) of GSK1325756 in the elderly under
      different dosing conditions during suppression of gastric acid secretion, and additional
      safety and tolerability information for oral administration of GSK1325756 in elderly
      subjects.

      The current study will provide an understanding of the PK of three formulations of GSK1325756
      during gastric acid suppression in a population of 65 to 80 year old healthy adult subjects.
      The effect of food on the PK of each GSK1325756 formulation will also be addressed in this
      population. The outcome of this study is likely to guide selection of the most appropriate
      formulation/dosing regimen for future studies.

      The completed clinical studies demonstrated that to minimize inter-subject variability of the
      exposure to GSK1325756, the current formulation needs to be administered with food,
      particularly in elderly subjects. This does not preclude development of the current
      formulation, but is not ideal, particularly if twice daily administration is needed in
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and for elderly subjects in which food
      intake can be variable. In addition, the inter-subject variability in exposure with the
      current formulation when given with omeprazole in the fasted state is not acceptable. This is
      likely due to the need for a low pH (acid level) (pH &lt; 2) gastric environment, particularly
      in the fasted state, to allow for sufficient solubilization of the GSK1325756 prior to
      transport to the small intestine where it is absorbed. Thus, this study is being conducted
      for the following reasons: (1) to determine if the current formulation results in acceptable
      exposure and inter-subject variability if given with food in subjects in which gastric acid
      secretion is suppressed with omeprazole and (2) to determine if a bio-enhanced formulation
      can provide an acceptable exposure profile and acceptable inter-subject variability in the
      fasted state in subjects in which gastric acid is suppressed. This information will be
      important in helping to determine the appropriate formulation and dosing regimen for
      progression to studies in COPD patients.

          -  Male or non-childbearing potential female who, at the time of signing the informed
             consent, are aged between 65 and 80 years (inclusive). Non-childbearing potential is
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] greater than 40
             milli-international units per milliliter MlU/mL) and estradiol less than 40 picograms
             per milliliter (pg/mL) [less than 147 picomoles per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory).

          -  Healthy, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures
             and objectives.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and
             bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (isolated
             bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin is less than 35 percent (%)).

          -  Resting blood pressure of less than or equal to 160/95 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg),
             irrespective of anti-hypertensive medication status for the subject.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 60 kilograms (kg) for men and greater than or
             equal to 45 kg for women; body mass index within the range 19 to 32 kiligrams per
             meter squared (kg/m2) (inclusive).

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use two of
             the following acceptable forms of contraception methods, one of which must be a
             barrier method, from screening until 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment:
             1) Established use of oral, injected or implanted methods of contraception. (The
             decision to allow use of hormonal contraceptives should be based on the
             investigational medicinal product's metabolism and potential for interactions,
             pharmacology and adverse event profile e.g., vomiting) 2) Placement of an intrauterine
             device or system 3) Barrier method such as a condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Barrier
             contraceptives must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide, which are not
             a barrier method and therefore should not be used alone 4) Male sterilization 5) True
             abstinence is acceptable when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. If a subject is not usually sexually active but becomes active, they should,
             with their partner, use two of the contraceptive methods listed above.

             dose of study treatment until completion of the post-study medical, unless in the
             opinion of the investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, the medication
             will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety; examples
