    <textblock>
      The MANOS device is a carpal tunnel blade used to perform carpal tunnel release (CTR). CTR is
      indicated for the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when conservative therapy fails. This
      study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CTR with the MANOS
      device.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Enrollment did not reach our intended sample size due to availability of CTR with MANOS outside
    of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is scheduled to undergo carpal tunnel release surgery.

          -  Patient has chronic Carpal Tunnel Syndrome with persistent symptoms despite
             non-operative treatment, or refusal of non-operative treatment, with one or more of
             the following: splinting, NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections.

          -  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome must be confirmed by positive results of Electromyography (EMG)
             and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) tests.

          -  Patient is a male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female.

          -  Patient is 18-75 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential, including those who have had a tubal
             ligation, but excluding those who have not experienced a menstrual period for at least
             two years, must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening.

          -  Patient must voluntarily provide written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a prior or current musculoskeletal or neurologic condition that limits
             strength, motion, or sensation in the affected hand.

          -  Patient has a medical condition that precludes the use of anesthetic required for
             surgery.

          -  Patient has an ipsilateral injury or other conditions affecting hand function.

          -  Patient has acute CTS resulting from an injury (e.g., fracture).

          -  Patient has had previous CTR surgery on the affected hand.

          -  Patient has psychiatric history, head injury or any other condition which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would prevent patient from complying with post-operative hand
             therapy or follow-up visits.
