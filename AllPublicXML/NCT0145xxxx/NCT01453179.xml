    <textblock>
      This clinical trial serves the purpose to compare the long-term effects of a treatment of
      actinic keratosis - your skin disorder - using Aldara® 5% cream (Imiquimod) or Solaraze® 3%
      gel (Diclofenac) on the face or the scalp. In particular, it should be found out whether the
      healing effect of these two medications on the skin lesions (i.e. the damaged skin parts) can
      be maintained for a prolonged period.

    <description>One course of treatment (COT) consisting of an overnight application of IMIQ (1 sachet for up to 50 cm2), applied 3 nights per week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for 4 weeks followed by a 4 weeks treatment pause. If necessary, this may be followed by a second COT.</description>

    <description>Solaraze® is applied locally to the skin 2 times daily and smoothed into the skin gently. The amount needed depends on the size of the lesion. Normally 0.5 grams (the size of a pea) of the gel is used on a 25 cm2 lesion site. The duration of therapy is 12 weeks.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible, a patient must comply with all of the following criteria:

          -  Immunocompetent patient.

          -  A study treatment area must be identifiable: Minimum of 5 and maximum of 10 typical
             visible AKs in one contiguous area of up to 50 cm2 on the face or scalp. The eyelids,
             the inside of the nostrils or ears, or the lip area inside the vermilion border must
             not be part of this area.

          -  A positive histological finding for AK grade I or II. This will be determined from the
             most suspicious lesion in the STA and there from the most pathological area biopsied
             during screening visit. This analysis will be done by the central histopathological
             laboratory.

          -  Willingness to comply with the obligations of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient is ineligible and must not enter the study if any of the following criteria is
        met:

        Safety concerns:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to imiquimod, diclofenac, acetyl salicylic acid, other non
             steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), hyaluronic acid, or relevant excipients.

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Women of child
             bearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control defined as
             those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. &lt;1% per year) when used consistently
             and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal
             IUDs, tubal ligation or vasectomised partner.

        Lack of suitability for the study:

          -  Presence of AK lesions in the STA with clinically excessive hyperkeratosis as seen in
             cutaneous horns.

          -  Any topical AK treatment including imiquimod or diclofenac, or any systemic AK
             treatment such as systemic retinoids, or any surgical AK treatment at the STA within
             the last 2 months prior to randomisation.

          -  Persisting AK lesion at screening visit following topical treatment with imiquimod or
             diclofenac in the STA.

          -  Presence of any histologically confirmed skin tumour in the STA: in situ SCC including
             Bowen's disease, invasive SCC, basal cell carcinoma, or other malignant tumours.

          -  Any dermatological disease or condition that may exacerbate by treatment with
             imiquimod or diclofenac (e.g. rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis).

          -  Any dermatological disease or condition in the STA that causes difficulty with
             examination (e.g. eczema).

          -  Systemic immunomodulatory treatment such as interferon, azathioprine, cyclosporine,
             retinoids, any oral or injectable corticosteroids, or inhaled or nasal corticosteroids
             with dosages of &gt;1200 µg/day beclomethasone or equivalent within 4 weeks before start
             of study treatment.

          -  History of any malignant tumour with high tumour burden or any systemic antitumour
             treatment (incl. radiotherapy).

          -  History of any malignant skin tumour having metastasised or in which metastasis within
             the study period is likely.

          -  History of severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,
             haematological, endocrine, metabolic, mental, neurological, or other disease within
             the last two years which might hinder regular treatment and supervision and might lead
             to premature withdrawal from the study.

          -  Mentally incapacitated patient.

          -  Present or history of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 3 years.

        Administrative reasons:

          -  Exposure to an investigational product within the last 3 months.

          -  Lack of ability or willingness to give informed consent.

          -  Age below 18 years.

          -  Lack of willingness to have personal study related data collected, archived or
             transmitted according to protocol.

          -  Anticipated non-availability for study visits/procedures.

          -  Vulnerable subjects (such as persons kept in detention).
