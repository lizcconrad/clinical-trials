      This is a phase 1, dose escalation study of Plerixafor in combination with granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor , Daunorubicin and Cytarabine in adults patients with relapsed acute
      myeloid leukemia .

      The Primary objective is to determine the maximal tolerated dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose
      of plerixafor when used in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor,
      Daunorubicin and Cytarabine during induction therapy Then determine the tolerability of
      plerixafor administered in combination with G-CSF and cytarabine during consolidation
      therapy.
