    <textblock>
      This is an open-label non-randomised, prospective, post market study to evaluate the
      performance of Inductigraft (osteoinductive synthetic bone graft) in patients receiving
      posterolateral lumbar spine fusion through assessment of successful fusion at 12 months post
      operation using x-rays and CT scans. Quality of life questionnaires also used to assess
      clinical outcome measures such as pain and quality of life. Patients followed up for 24
      months after surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disease (DDD) or lumbar spinal stenosis at one or two
             continuous spinal level(s), including subjects with spondylolisthesis (i.e.
             degenerative or isthmic)

          -  Has failed at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to clinical trial
             enrolment and is a candidate for spinal fusion surgery over one or two vertebral
             levels between, and including, L2 to S1 (i.e. second lumbar to first sacral)

          -  ≥ 18 years old and skeletally mature (epiphyses closed)

          -  Is, in the Investigator's opinion, psychosocially, mentally, and physically able to
             fully comply with this protocol, including the post-operative regimen, required follow
             up visits, the filling out of required forms, and have the ability to understand and
             give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has diagnosis of symptomatic DDD, spondylolisthesis, or lumbar spinal stenosis at more
             than two levels

          -  Has had prior fusion surgery at any lumbar level

          -  Has systemic infection or infection at the surgical site

          -  History of significant metabolic bone disease such as osteomalacia, autoimmune disease
             including rheumatoid arthritis, renal disease, hepatic disease, peripheral vascular
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, Paget's disease at the involved spinal level(s)
             or upper motor neuron disease (positive Babinski sign)

          -  Has a medical condition that would interfere with post-operative assessments and care
             (i.e. psychiatric disease, paraplegia, quadriplegia, etc.)

          -  Is in poor general health or any concurrent disease process that would place the
             subject in excessive risk to surgery (e.g. significant circulatory, pulmonary
             problems, or cardiac disease)

          -  Has a history (present or past) of substance abuse (recreational drugs, prescription
             drugs or alcohol) that in the Investigator's opinion may interfere with protocol
             assessments and/or with the subject's ability to complete the protocol required follow
             up

          -  Is known to be pregnant/breastfeeding at the time of enrollment, or plans to become
             pregnant during the course of the clinical trial

          -  Is participating in, or has completed within the last 30 days, another investigational
             clinical trial, which could confound results

          -  Has had three or more prior decompressive surgeries, or a prior posterior lumbar
             surgery resulting in significant muscle/ligament morbidity. This does NOT include
             facet saving techniques such as discectomy, laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures
             including nucleotomy, IDET procedures or annuloplasty procedures

          -  Has back or leg pain of unknown cause

          -  Morbid obesity defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40

          -  Non-discogenic or non-stenotic cause of symptoms (e.g. tumour or fracture at the
             involved level)

          -  Has a condition or requires post-operative medications that may interfere with
             bone/soft tissue healing (i.e. oral or parenteral glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives,
             methotrexate, etc.), or that effect the rate of bone metabolism unless they have
             undergone a 14 day wash out period prior to surgery

          -  Is undergoing treatment for osteoporosis (excluding osteopenia) such that in the
             Investigator's opinion, spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated

          -  Is involved in on-going litigation, concerning their medical condition.

          -  Has a known allergy to silicon.
