      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      isotopologs of Atazanavir both as single agents and as combinations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this study. Part A is a three-period, crossover design. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 sequences, in groups of 4 subjects each. All study drug
      doses, including the comparator, Reyataz, will be administered as single, open-labeled doses
      to subjects after a light meal. There will be a 7-day washout between individual subjects
      doses; that is, dosing will occur on the same day each week.

      Part B evaluations are based on the results of Part A. Part B will further consist of two
      subparts. In the first subpart, low single doses of 2 new isotopologs will be dosed to two
      groups of 4 subjects each, B1 and B2, respectively. Following assessment of safety and
      pharmacokinetics in the first subpart, the second subpart, which consists of three groups of
      8 subjects (B3, B4, B5) each will be dosed. Subjects enrolled in B3, B4, and B5 will
      participate in a 3-way partial crossover study design.

      The objectives will be to compare the PK properties, in healthy male subjects after a light
      meal, of single oral doses of single agent ATV isotopologs or as combinations of two ATV
      isotopologs with the PK properties in the same subjects, after a light meal, of a single dose
      of either 400 mg or 600 mg Reyataz. The safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected. Actual dosing and sampling
      times will be used for analysis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, as determined by the responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and
             laboratory tests assessed at the screening visit and prior to the first dose of study
             drug. A subject with a non-clinically significant abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range may be included only if the investigator considers that
             the finding will not compromise the subject's safety and will not interfere with the
             study procedures or data interpretation.

          -  Healthy adult males between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI within the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, at
             screening

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and the protocol

          -  Willing and able to be confined at the clinical research center for the study days

          -  Negative tests for selected drugs of abuse, cotinine, and alcohol at screening and Day
             -1

          -  Dietary habits that fall within the range of normal, as determined by the
             investigator. Examples of unusual diets are liquid diets, protein-only diets, high
             fat-diets, or low-carbohydrate diets.

          -  Willingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or
             lactating women; and if engaging in sexual intercourse with a female partner who could
             become pregnant, a willingness of male subjects to use a condom and spermicide, in
             addition to having the female partner use another form of contraception such as an
             intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable
             progesterone, subdermal implants, or a tubal ligation. This criterion must be followed
             from the time of first study drug administration until 30 days after the final
             administration of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clinically significant central nervous system (eg, seizures), cardiac,
             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal (GI) conditions; or history
             of such conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may place the subject at
             an unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial, may interfere with the
             interpretation of safety and/or tolerability data obtained in the trial, or may
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study
             drugs

          -  PR interval ≥ 220 msec or QRS duration ≥ 120 msec or QT interval &gt; 450 msec obtained
             at screening visit or prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase
             (GGT), serum creatinine, or bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening or
             prior to the first dose of study drug. These laboratory tests may be repeated once, if
             they are abnormal on first screening, and if there is a medical reason to believe the
             results may be inaccurate. If the repeat test is within the reference range, the
             subject may be included only if the investigator considers that the previous finding
             will not compromise the subject's safety and will not interfere with the
             interpretation of safety data.

          -  Positive blood screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody), hepatitis B
             virus surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at screening

          -  Urinalysis positive for protein or glucose (greater than trace findings of protein or
             glucose) at screening or prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  History of drug abuse within 6 months of screening

          -  History of any tobacco product use within 3 months prior to the study, to be verified
             by a urine cotinine screen of &lt; 200 ng/mL at screening and prior to the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Participation in a clinical trial and receipt of an investigational medication or a
             new chemical entity within 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any medication (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             current study drug

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription medications, including herbal and dietary
             supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study drug, or use of St. John's Wort within 14 days prior to the first dose
             of study drug. (The subject may take paracetamol (≤ 2 grams/day) or ibuprofen (≤ 1600
             mg/day) for up to 48 hours prior to the first dose of study drug. The investigator and
             study team may review medication use on a case-by-case basis to determine if its use
             would compromise subject safety or interfere with study procedures or data
             interpretation.)

          -  Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, star fruit, oranges, orange juice,
             Seville oranges, or red wine within 7 days prior to administration of study drug

             drug and while confined at the clinical site

          -  Donation of blood or blood products or blood collection in excess of 470 mL within 8
             weeks prior to dosing

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study drugs or components thereof, or a history
             of medication allergy or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates study participation

          -  Unwillingness to comply with protocol-specified lifestyle and/or dietary restrictions

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of screening

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (ie, active infection)
