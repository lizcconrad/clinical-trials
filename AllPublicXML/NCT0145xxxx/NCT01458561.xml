  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled investigation. Subjects in which
      bleeding from the exposed parenchymal surface is observed intraoperatively following the
      ligature of vessels visible with the unaided eye will be randomized to an adjunctive
      application of BioFoam or a standard topical hemostatic agent (Gelfoam with thrombin, in the
      form of Gelfoam Plus) to the entire exposed parenchymal surface. Following primary treatment
      of the exposed parenchymal surface as prescribed by the randomization scheme, treatment sites
      will be visually evaluated for the continued presence of bleeding. The overall objective of
      this investigation is to collect clinical data concerning the safety and effectiveness of
      BioFoam used as an adjunct to conservative measures of achieving hemostasis, such as manual
      pressure, cautery, and ligation, for intraoperative capillary, arteriolar, and venular
      bleeding (5 second stack of 5 gauze surface &quot;Bleeding Score&quot; = 1b or 2, score to be
      validated) on newly resected liver parenchyma in hemodynamically stable (American College of
      Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support Class I Hemorrhage) and non-coagulopathic patients in
      the open treatment of exposed liver parenchyma versus a standard topical hemostatic agent,
      Gelfoam Plus. It is not intended for traumatic liver injury. The investigation will be
      conducted at a maximum of three investigational sites.
