  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation has a special place in the medical field. It symbolizes a medicine
      whose limits always seem to be repelled. Because transplantation is unusual, it places people
      in front of outstanding issues which he has to cope with his personality and history. Factors
      involved in the psychology of patient presenting with graft are past and present psychic
      functioning, object relations, experience of transplantation itself and quality of social
      environment.

      Before or after graft defense mechanisms can be so intense that they can make the patient
      unable to overcome the graft. Yet as a pathological mechanism that denial was considered
      beneficial provided it is short.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate on psychopathological influence of psychological defense
      mechanisms used by liver transplant patients on their somatic psychological and social
      outcome.

      The objective is to measure the influence of variations of psychological defense mechanisms.

      The investigators want to measure the influence of personal history of patients, causal
      disease pre-existing, conditions of graft's realization, structure of patient's social
      environment (family or institutional); and wish to identify which of those elements can be
      protective or vulnerability factors with a view to allow adequate support (especially for
      patients who had multiple poor prognostic factors)

      The investigators will study pre-transplant psychological defense mechanisms of the subjects
      using the Bond Defense Style Questionnaire and structure of personality using the SCID II
      personality scale. They will evaluate post-transplant patient outcomes on clinical and social
      developments with DSQ 88 and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28) to six months, twelve
      months and five years after transplantation. Meanwhile, they will address each time you visit
      the data on consumption, misuse and alcohol dependence using the AUDIT questionnaire (Alcohol
      Use Disorders Identification Test).

      The hypothesis is that the defense mechanisms, their variations and personality of the
      patients are both vulnerability factors as protective factors in different phases of the
      graft. Identification should allow to optimize care and improve overall health. Results of
      this research could make it possible to determine the factors used in liaison psychiatry in
      the long term to ensure an adequate medical and psychiatric support to transplant patients.
