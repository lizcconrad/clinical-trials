  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A complex training on a dynamic leg-press with visual feed-back will improve coordinative
      capacity, power, sensorimotor and cognitive aspects more than a classic training on the same
      leg-press but without visual feed-back.

      The project evaluates two different resistance training programs on a leg press. One group
      will perform a standard resistance training with the aim of muscle hypertrophia, the other
      group will perform a complex resistance training combining rate of force development
      training, power training, speed endurance as well as sensorimotor aspects (i.e. following
      visual feedback to reproduce given forces or joint angles).

      Hypotheses: Participants in the complex training group will change the relation between
      counter movement jump and squat jump, i.e. they will more improve in the counter movement
      jump because of improved sensorimotor capacity.
