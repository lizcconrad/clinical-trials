  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative antibiotics for infection prophylaxis are routinely given to most surgical
      patients, and for orthopaedic surgery patients, the standard of care is treatment for 24
      hours following any elective procedure (1). The most concerning risk for insufficient
      antibiotic coverage in the post-operative period is the development of a complicated
      infection requiring irrigation and debridement or revision surgery. Moreover, recovery from
      surgery is usually delayed in patients that have postoperative wound infections leading to
      increased resource utilization and increased economic cost for the health care system. It is
      clear that prophylactic antibiotic therapy is necessary in the immediate post-operative
      period, but the length required continues to be debated.

      Orthopaedic patients undergoing elective spine surgeries often require the placement of a
      hemovac drain which applies gentle suction to remove excess fluid/blood and to promote
      healing. Wound drains, however, may also increase the risk of post-operative infection
      because they expose the &quot;clean&quot; interior aspect of the wound to the &quot;dirty&quot; exterior area
      around the wound. Given this additional focus of infection, it is unknown whether prolonged
      antibiotic therapy post-operatively is needed to decrease the rate of infection in this
      population (2,3). There is sparse literature evaluating the effectiveness of prolonged
      antibiotic therapy in decreasing complicated post-operative infection requiring irrigation
      and debridement in this population (1,4). To our knowledge, there are no recent studies
      comparing prophylactic antibiotics for 24 hours only post-operatively versus 24 hours after
      removal of the drain. In fact, a recent evidence-based review of the literature by the North
      American Spine Society highlighted the need for research in this area (5).

      The proposed study will compare two patient populations who will receive various lengths of
      post-operative antibiotics. One will receive only 24 hours worth, and the other will receive
      antibiotics for 72 hours after surgery and the rate of complicated infection compared between
      the two.

      The absence of a demonstrable difference suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis for only 24
      hours immediately post-operatively is sufficient for all elective spine patients undergoing
      posterior spine procedures requiring the placement of a hemovac drain.
