      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25mcg administered using the
      novel dry powder inhaler in children aged 5 to 11 years with persistent asthma. Fluticasone
      furoate (FF, GW685698) is a novel once daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and vilanterol (VI,
      GW642444) is an inhaled once daily long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA). FF/VI is a novel
      ICS/LABA combination with once-daily dosing being developed for the treatment of asthma in
      adults, adolescents, and children of 5 years and above.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, repeat dose, two period crossover study, with
      FF as the control. During each of two treatment periods subjects will receive either FF/VI
      100/25 micrograms (mcg) or FF 100 mcg daily on 14 consecutive mornings via the novel dry
      powder inhaler. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited into this study, with a target of
      20 completed subjects. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose , potassium and
      cortisol levels will be investigated.

             of &gt;19 and (Peak Expiratory Flow) PEF more than 75 percent predicted.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate an ability to accept and effectively use a demonstration
             inhaler from the demonstration kits provided.

          -  Subjects must weigh at least 20 kilograms.

          -  The subject and parent/guardian are able to understand and comply with protocol
             requirements, instructions, and protocol stated restrictions. The parent or guardian
             must have the ability to read, write, and record diary information collected
             throughout the study. The parent or guardian must have the ability to manage study
             drug administration and PEF assessments.

          -  At least one parent/guardian has signed and dated the written informed consent prior
             to admission to the study. This will be accompanied by informed assent from the
             subject for children aged 7 to 11 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of life-threatening asthma, an asthma exacerbation requiring
             systemic corticosteroids or Emergency Room attendance (within 3 months) or requiring

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled into one of two cohorts based upon age; the younger cohort was enrolled after a review of the safety/pharmacokinetic data of at least six participants from the older cohort. Each participant was assigned to treatment randomly; assignment was not to be influenced by whether participants were in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A Baseline assessment was carried out on Day 1 of the first treatment period. Participants were then randomized to one of the two possible treatments fluticasone furoate [FF] 100 µg/Vilanterol [VI] 25 µg.or FF 100 µg, followed by a cross over after a washout period of at least 7 days.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate at Day1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Heart rate (HR) was measured at Day 1 and Day 14 of the respective treatment period. hr=hour. Baseline is defined as the pre-dose measurement at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 14 value minus the Baseline value. Treatment, period, day (1 and 14), participant Baseline, period Baseline, and treatment*day interaction were fitted as fixed effects, and participant was fitted as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Serum Cortisol (SC) Weighted Mean (0–12 Hours) on Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>SC weighted mean was determined for each participant over the time period of 0–12 hours on Day 14 of the respective treatment period. SC weighted mean was derived by dividing the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC; defined as thearea under the concentration-time curve from time zero up to 24 hours) by the sample collection time interval. The sample collection time interval is defined as the difference between the time of the last cortisol sample and the time of the first cortisol sample. Samples were collected at the following time points: 0 (first blood draw/pre-dose); 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours (relative to the &quot;0&quot; time point). Weighted means were derived using the linear trapezoidal rule. Actual relative times were used for the calculation except where actual times were missing. If any actual times were missing, planned relative time were used for these observations. Treatment and period were fitted as fixed effects and participant was fitted as a random effect.</description>

        <description>During the inhalation profile assessment, participants inhaled through a mouthpiece from a device with a similar resistance to the dry powder inhaler used for this study. Average flow rate is defined as the average inspiratory flow rate (Liters [L]/min) across the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler. PIFR is defined as the Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (L/min) of the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler.The pressure drop during the inhalation was measured, and the inhalation profiles (pressure drop versus time profile) of the participants were obtained. The mean of the two inhalation profile measurements was used for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period), and the average flow rate and PIFR were determined.</description>

          <description>During the inhalation profile assessment, participants inhaled through a mouthpiece from a device with a similar resistance to the dry powder inhaler used for this study. Average flow rate is defined as the average inspiratory flow rate (Liters [L]/min) across the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler. PIFR is defined as the Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (L/min) of the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler.The pressure drop during the inhalation was measured, and the inhalation profiles (pressure drop versus time profile) of the participants were obtained. The mean of the two inhalation profile measurements was used for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period), and the average flow rate and PIFR were determined.</description>

        <description>The total emitted dose (TED) is defined as the mass (micrograms) of the nominal dose that passes beyond the throat. The recorded inhalation profiles of the participants and the mouth-throat (oropharyngeal) models of the sizes that approximated to pharyngometry measurements of the participants were used in conjunction with the electronic Lung (eLung) for in vitro assessment. The eLung is a breathing simulator that replicates the selected inhalation profile with an active inhaler placed at the lips end of the selected ororpharyngeal model. After the dose is emitted from the inhaler, the analysis and assay of throat deposition and material passing beyond the throat was used to derive the nominal, minimum, and maximum predicted total emitted dose.</description>

          <title>Total Emitted Dose (TED) on Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
          <description>The total emitted dose (TED) is defined as the mass (micrograms) of the nominal dose that passes beyond the throat. The recorded inhalation profiles of the participants and the mouth-throat (oropharyngeal) models of the sizes that approximated to pharyngometry measurements of the participants were used in conjunction with the electronic Lung (eLung) for in vitro assessment. The eLung is a breathing simulator that replicates the selected inhalation profile with an active inhaler placed at the lips end of the selected ororpharyngeal model. After the dose is emitted from the inhaler, the analysis and assay of throat deposition and material passing beyond the throat was used to derive the nominal, minimum, and maximum predicted total emitted dose.</description>
