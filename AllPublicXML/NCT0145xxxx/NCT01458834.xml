    <textblock>
      Several studies indicate that cigarette smokers show an attentional bias for
      cigarette-related cues, meaning that they more quickly detect and attend to and have more
      difficulty disengaging in cigarette-related information than neutral information. This bias
      is associated with craving and relapse following attempts to quit. This experiment will
      examine whether a computerized attentional training procedure will successfully reduce
      attentional bias towards smoking cues and reduce craving in regular cigarette smokers. The
      attentional training will be administered in a novel format in which participants complete
      5-minute long training sessions 3 times per day and can complete the trainings via home
      computer or handheld device such as the iPhone, Android phone, or iPod touch. A baseline
      assessment in the laboratory will measure attentional bias to smoking cues and craving
      following smoking cue exposure. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either the
      active training condition or a control condition. In both conditions, participants will be
      asked to complete brief training sessions 3 times daily for one week using their personal
      computer or handheld device. Following one week of training, participants will return to the
      lab for endpoint assessment of attentional bias and craving. The investigators hypothesize
      that compared to the control condition, the active training condition will significantly
      reduce attentional bias toward smoking related cues and cue-induced cigarette craving.

    <description>Participants will complete a computerized probe-discrimination task from their home computer or handheld electronic device 3 times per day for one week. Each training session will consist of 160 trials. In each trial, two pictures (smoking-related or neutral) will appear on the screen simultaneously and then disappear. An arrow will appear in the location of one of the pictures (&lt; or &gt;). Participants are asked to quickly identify the direction of the arrow by pressing a button. In the active training task, the arrow will replace the neutral pictures 80% of the time.</description>
