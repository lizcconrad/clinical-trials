      The objective of this study is to confirm and document that with the use of a FDA Class I
      exempt near infrared device, VeinViewerÂ® Vision that is hands-free and can be used for
      healthy adult volunteers with varying skin types to assist in the improved visualization, it
      is possible to film, analyze and document PIV localized complications and venous flow and
      refill.
