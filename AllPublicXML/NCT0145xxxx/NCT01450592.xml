      The study is designed as an interventional (as blood investigations will be done) dietary
      survey of diabetic &amp; non-diabetic population sample of India to understand &amp; compare dietary
      patterns among them.The study objective is to find out amount of carbohydrate content of
      daily diet of diabetic population study . This study does not intend to study the effect of
      any drugs. There will be 2 groups : Type 2 diabetics and non diabetic population. The study
      will begin after the study approval by ethics committee. The subject will involved after they
      sign the consent form. The study involves general examination of patients, collection of data
      like history of disease, interview by dietitian with the help of questionnaire, blood
      investigations (only in diabetic population only) and glycaemic control status of only
      diabetic population.The study is planned to be enroll 800 subjects (400 in each groups) from
      10 study centers spread across India. The study data will be analyzed with appropriate
      statistical methods.
