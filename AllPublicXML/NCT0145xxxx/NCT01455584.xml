      The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      HM781-36B continuously.

      Besides the main objective, there are 4 other objectives as follows:

        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of HM781-36B

        2. To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of HM781-36B

        3. To determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics after dosed HM781-36B
           continuously

        4. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B in patients with advanced solid
           malignancies
