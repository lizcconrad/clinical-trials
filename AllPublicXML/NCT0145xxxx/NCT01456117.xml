          3. The participant is a healthy adult male or female participant between the ages of 55
             and 83 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first dose of study
             medication dose.

          4. Female participants of childbearing potential will not be included in the study.
             Female participants must be post-menopausal (defined as &gt;2 years without menses).

          5. The participant is considered to have normal cognitive abilities, as assessed by
             standard cognitive tests administered at the Screening visit. All participants will
             undergo a brief neuropsychological assessment which includes the Montreal Cognitive
             Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Cognitive Function Screening
             Instrument to verify general cognitive status. Memory will be assessed with the
             Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Word List Memory
             Test and Trail Making Part B. Normal performance will be defined as scores within 1
             standard deviation (SD) of age and education normative mean.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant has received pioglitazone or any thiazolidinedione (TZD) in a previous
             clinical study or as a therapeutic agent within 1 year of Screening.

          2. The participant is an immediate family member, study site employee (defined as study
             personnel and employees directly supervised by study personnel), or in a dependant
             relationship with a study site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study
             (e.g., spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress.

          3. The participant has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic (e.g., migraines
             not well controlled, narcolepsy, previous head injury with loss of consciousness, or
             seizures), osteoporosis, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic,
             gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality which may impact the
             ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results.

          4. Participant has a known hypersensitivity or allergies to any component of the
             formulation of pioglitazone or related compounds.

          5. The participant has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a
             history of alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to the Screening visit or is unwilling to
             agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study. Participant is unwilling
             to agree to abstain from alcohol 24 hours prior to MRI or unwilling to abstain from
             drugs throughout the study.

          6. History or evidence of any other central nervous system disorder that could be
             interpreted as a cause of dementia.

          7. Current diagnosis of significant psychiatric disorders according to Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Forth Edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).
             Subjects with recent/past psychiatric disorders who are currently in
             remission/asymptomatic without the use of medication may be eligible as determined by
             the principal investigator and the medical monitor.

          8. Diabetes mellitus where the participant is being treated with insulin and/or
             peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ (PPARɣ) agonist.

          9. Participant has a history of cancer that required chemotherapy treatment within the
             past 2 years prior to Day 1, metastatic cancer in the past 5 years prior to Day 1, or
             radiation treatment to the brain in their lifetime. Subjects with basal cell or stage
             I squamous cell carcinoma of the skin will be eligible. Eligibility of subjects with a
             history of cancer will be determined by the principal investigator and medical
             monitor.10. History of macular edema, degeneration or any maculopathy.

        11. Participant with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6%. 12. Participant with congestive
        heart failure or significant edema (2+) of the extremities.

        be expected to influence the absorption of drugs (i.e., a history of malabsorption,
        esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, frequent [more than once per
        week] occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention [e.g., cholecystectomy]).

        16. Participant has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or
        hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) at Screening or a known history of human immunodeficiency
        virus infection (HIV).

        17. Participant has a Screening or Check-in (Day 1) abnormal (clinically significant) ECG.
        (Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically significant) ECG must be
        approved, and documented by signature by principal investigator. (If principal investigator
        is not a MD, ECG must be assessed by a qualified investigator).

        18. Participant has abnormal Screening or Day 1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically
        significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab abnormalities: Alanine
        Aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2x the upper limits of
        normal (ULN).

        19. Participant has a contraindication to having MRI, for example because of ferromagnetic
        foreign bodies (e.g., unremovable ferromagnetic dental work), medical devices such as
        aneurysm clips or cardiac pacemakers, or lead-based tattoos.

        20. Participant has hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic) at Screening.
