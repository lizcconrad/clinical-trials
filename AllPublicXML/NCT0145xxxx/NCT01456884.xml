  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this within-subjects randomized controlled trial is to determine whether two
      music therapy interventions are efficacious in reducing pain symptoms, in order to improve
      the quality of care for children in pediatric hospice. The investigators hypothesize that
      both music therapy interventions, live guitar and vocal intervention and vibroacoustic
      intervention, will reduce behavioural pain scores and that behavioural pain scores will
      correlate with physiological outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective pain management in pediatric palliative care is a quality of life issue for
      patients, families and professionals. Current research supports the use of music therapy to
      assist with pain management in pediatric medical settings. However, little research has been
      done to explore the use of music therapy for reducing pain in children with life-limiting
      neurological impairments or metabolic conditions.

      As the first known project to examine the effects of music therapy on pain symptoms with
      children who have life-limiting neurological impairments or metabolic disorders, this study
      will expand the evidence-base for practice with this population. It is imperative that an
      evidence base for music therapy in this area be established, so that the most effective
      interventions can be provided to these vulnerable children.
