  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive remediation (CR) is a new psychological treatment, which aims to improve cognitive
      function and coping skills. Several studies have recently demonstrated that CR improves
      cognitive and occupational function in patients with schizophrenia and with depression (e.g.
      Wykes et al 2007, Elgamal et al 2007). However, it is unclear whether CR improves cognitive
      and socio-occupational function in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) and, if so, what
      impact this might have on these people's abilities in terms of work, coping strategies,
      quality of life, and everyday safety.

      The aim of the present PhD study is to investigate if CR has beneficial effects on cognitive
      and socio-occupational function in patients with previous mania and depression who experience
      persistent cognitive difficulties. Such effects would suggest implementation of CR in future
      treatment of bipolar disorder in order to facilitate the patients' ability to cope with the
      responsibilities related to work and everyday life. The hypotheses of the present study are
      that CR (in comparison to standard treatment) will 1) improve verbal learning and recall; and
      2) improve sustained attention, executive function and psychosocial function.

    <description>All subjects will complete an MR brain scan, blood test, saliva test, and a neuropsychological battery of manual and computerised tests at baseline, at week 12 (end of active treatment) and week 26 (follow-up). Subjects randomly allocated to an active group will participate in a 12-week group-based cognitive remediation programme once a week for two hours. The waiting list group continues treatment as usual.</description>
