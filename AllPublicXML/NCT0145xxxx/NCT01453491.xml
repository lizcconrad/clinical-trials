  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to:

        -  1) Test the safety and tolerability of 2 different oral doses of SRT2104 in subjects
           with ulcerative colitis

        -  2) Determine the amount of SRT2104 measured from a single blood sample in addition to
           colon and/or rectal tissue samples (biopsies)

        -  3) Determine whether SRT2104 has any anti-inflammatory effect on the colon and/or rectum
           when taken orally for 8 weeks

        -  4) Determine whether SRT2104 causes any detectable changes to specific biomarkers. A
           biomarker is a biological marker (or substance such as a protein) that is used as an
           indicator of changes in a biological state that corresponds to the risk or progression
           of a disease.

    <description>SRT2104 drug substance is a new chemical entity which is supplied as a fine, yellowish/amber powder. The SRT2104 investigational product is prepared by packing 25mg or 250 mg of micronized SRT2104 powder with no additional additives into a size 00 opaque, hard gelatin capsule. All subjects will be provided with one dosing bottle per day that contains two 25 mg or 250 mg SRT2104 capsules for oral ingestion.</description>
