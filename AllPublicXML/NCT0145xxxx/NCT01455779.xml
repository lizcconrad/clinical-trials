      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the treatment efficacy of the Lyrette® System in
      women most likely to be treated in an office setting for the condition of stress urinary
      incontinence, secondary to urethral hypermobility.

    <description>The Verathon Transurethral RF System (Lyrette® System) is indicated for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence (SUI) due to hypermobility in women who have failed conservative treatment and who are not candidates for surgical therapy.
The treatment is a 9 minute non-surgical procedure completed using local anesthesia during a single office visit. Women are discharged home with no incisions, dressings, or catheters immediately following treatment.</description>
