    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed treatment safe

        2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with Multiple
           Sclerosis and clinical outcomes?

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) implantation performed intrathecally and intravenously.
      ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local
      anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and Females between Age 18 and 80 years.

          -  Duration of disease: &gt;5 years

          -  Failure to respond or intolerance to the currently available Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
             immunomodulatory treatments (ie interferons, Copaxone, immunosuppression): the lack of
             response to these treatments will be determined/defined by either an increase
             (deterioration) of at least one degree in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
             score during the last year or the appearance of at least two major relapses of MS
             during the same period of time (under treatment) or intolerance to these agents.

          -  Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer
             Society .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses.

          -  Exposure to any investigational drug or procedure within 1 month prior to study entry
             or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study.

          -  Active infectious disease. For patients who have tested positive, an expert will be
             consulted as to patient eligibility based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  Systolic blood pressure (supine) â‰¤90 mmHg;

          -  Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm;

          -  Active clinical infection.

          -  Cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the
             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  History of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer) in
             the last five years.

          -  Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent.
