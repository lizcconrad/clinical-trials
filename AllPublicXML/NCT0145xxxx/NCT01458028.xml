    <textblock>
      Single dose study of BAY85-3934 compared to placebo in young/elderly male and female healthy
      subjects. The main focus of the study is to determine if the pharmacokinetics (drug levels in
      blood) of BAY85-3934 is similar or not in the four subject groups. Qualifying subjects will
      be dosed with a single tablet of BAY85-3934 (or placebo) and blood will be drawn over 4 days.
      The safety and tolerability of BAY85-3934 compared to placebo will also be evaluated over the
      5 days of the study.
