      The investigators confirm the feasibility of 1-year administration of oral fluoropyrimidine
      S-1 as an adjuvant chemotherapy for the patient who received complete resection of non-small
      cell lung cancer. The investigators presume they can achieve high completion rate with low
      toxicity.

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy comprised eight courses (4-week administration, 2-week withdrawal) of S-1 (FT,
      gineracil, oteracil potassium; Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) at 80-120 mg/body/day
      according to body surface area (BSA): BSA &lt;1.25 m2, 80 mg/day; BSA &gt;1.25 m2 but &lt;1.5 m2, 100
      mg/day; and BSA &gt;1.5 m2, 120 mg/day. S-1 was administered orally, twice daily after meals,
      starting within 4 weeks after surgery.
