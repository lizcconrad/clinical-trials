    <textblock>
      Ureteroscopy (URS) is minimally invasive procedure for management of renal stones. URS is
      often involves concomitant of an indwelling ureteral stents. Placements of these stents
      include pain, bladder irritability, infection, migration, encrustation and stones.

      Pain is one of most significant problem of ureteral stents. There are no satisfactory
      measures to deal with this problem. A novel approach to manage the pain is to load a drug
      onto ureteral stent and deliver the drug into the urinary tract at controlled release rate.

      Lidocaine has been proven to be effective for management of the pain associated with
      interstitial cystitis. This agent has the potential for management of post-URS pain.

    <textblock>
      Patients treated with ureteroscopy (URS) for ureteral or renal calculi requiring a ureteral
      stent at time of URS will be randomized to receive intraureteral instillation of alkalinized
      lidocaine hydrochloride (study group) or normal saline (control group) immediately following
      the procedure to assess safety and effectiveness in alleviating pain and stent symptoms.
      Thousands of removable stents are placed in patients' ureters (tubes connecting kidney and
      bladder) each year in Canada. These plastic stents allow the kidney to drain when there is
      swelling after kidney stone surgery or if they are otherwise obstructed. Studies report that
      more than 80% of patients have painful symptoms from indwelling ureteral stents. This study
      will attempt to show that local anesthetic injected directly into the ureter before stent
      placement will reduce stent pain. Recent studies have shown infusing lidocaine with
      bicarbonate (a local anesthetic) into painful bladders is safe, and patients' symptoms
      improve dramatically. This result inspired the innovative idea that injecting a similar
      solution into the kidney and ureter (which have the same lining as the bladder) will numb the
      area sufficiently to decrease stent related pain.

      The study will randomly select half of the patients to receive an injection of non-irritating
      salt water (placebo), and half an injection of pH buffered lidocaine before the stent is
      placed. Both patients and physicians will be blinded to the assignment of treatment or
      placebo. The investigators will then compare pain scores post operatively.

      If successful, future researchers may use lidocaine in drug eluding stents to further
      ameliorate pain.
