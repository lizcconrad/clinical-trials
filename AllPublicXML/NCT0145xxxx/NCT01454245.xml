    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of
      a single dose of 3 capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335 in healthy adult male volunteers. The
      effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of one of the capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335
      will also be evaluated during the study.

      This is an open-label (the name of the study drug will be known to the healthy volunteers
      participating in this study as well as to all study staff), randomized (volunteers will be
      assigned by chance to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences of a single dose of 3 different
      capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels of drug)
      and relative bioavailability (i.e., the rate and extent of absorption of the drug in the
      body) of JNJ-39439335 (Part 1 of the study). The effect of food on the administration of
      JNJ-39439335 will then be evaluated on 1 capsule formulation of JNJ-39439335 (Part 2 of the
      study). The safety and tolerability of JNJ-39439335 will be monitored throughout Part 1 and 2
      of the study. In Part 1, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment
      sequences and will receive a total of 3 single doses of JNJ-39439335. Each dose (2 capsules)
      will be separated by 21 days. In Part 2, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 treatment sequences and will receive a total of 2 single doses of one formulation selected
      from Part 1; each dose will be separated by 21 days. Doses will be administered to healthy
      volunteers under fed and fasted conditions.
