      To evaluate the effect of partial posterior hyaloidectomy on preventing iatrogenic retinal
      breaks related to induction of a posterior vitreous detachment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The induction of a posterior vitreous detachment (IPVD) during vitrectomy have been suggested
      as one of the etiologies of iatrogenic retinal break related to vitrectomy.The iatrogenic
      retinal breaks related to IPVD usually develop near or anterior to the equatorial region.

      Thus, the investigators hypothesized that this complication could be prevented by restricting
      the extent of IPVD, and planned a modified procedure of vitrectomy in which the extent of
      IPVD and removal of vitreous cortex was restricted to about slightly beyond the margin of
      temporal major vascular arcade.

      The investigators have termed this procedure, partial posterior hyaloidectomy. Unlike RRD or
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy, lesions are localized within the major vascular arcade in
      macular disorders so that macular disorders could be an eligible indication for this
      procedure.

    <description>The core vitrectomy entails more extensive removal of vitreous gel, in contrast to the conventional core vitrectomy. IPVD was conducted by engaging the attached posterior cortical vitreous with a 23-gauge needle with angulated tip in the area adjacent to the optic disc followed by gently moving the tip to approximately 3 disc diameters away from the margin of the optic disc. After then, slightly elevating the tip in a posteroanterior direction with slowly proceeding it to the extent that we planned. With IPVD, the surgeon was able to visualize a floating Weiss ring in all of the cases. Active suction to initiate IPVD was not used in any of the cases. In the temporal direction, the extension of a PVD was restricted to approximately 2 disc diameters distance beyond the margin of temporal major vascular arcade</description>
