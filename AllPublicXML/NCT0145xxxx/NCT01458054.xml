    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I open label drug interaction study with two objectives. The first
      objective of this study (Cohort 1) is to determine if the pharmacokinetics of a single dose
      of GSK2336805 are affected by co-administration with repeat doses of omeprazole, a
      proton-pump inhibitor that is commonly used by chronic hepatitis C patients .

      The second objective of this study (Cohort 2) is to determine if the pharmacokinetics of a
      single dose of GSK2336805 are affected by co-administration with repeat doses of ritonavir, a
      HIV protease inhibitor drug that is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4.

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             Subjects with values outside the normal range should always be excluded from
             enrollment.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until the follow up visit.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kilograms for men and greater than or equal to
             45 kilograms for women. Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-32 inclusive will be

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  QTcB less than 450; or QTc less than 480 in subjects with Bundle Branch Block

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the

             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 milliliters within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  History or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or
             pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior
             to the first dose of study medication.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90 or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100 beats per minute (bpm) for female subjects or 45-100 beats per minute for male
             subjects.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination):Heart rate less than 45 and greater than 100 bpm for men and less than
             50 and greater than 100 bpm for women. PR interval less than 120 and greater than 220.
             QRS duration less than 70 and greater than 120. QTc interval greater than 450.
             Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (Does not include ST segment changes
             associated with repolarization). Any conduction abnormality (including but not
             specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, AV block [2nd degree or
             higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome). Sinus Pauses greater than 3 seconds.
             Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK
             medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the individual subject.
