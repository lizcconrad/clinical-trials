             digestive system, urogenital system, endocrine system, allergy / immune system, blood
             system, nervous / mental system, musculoskeletal system, skin diseases.

          2. History of any drug hypersensitivity.

          3. Female urine pregnancy test was positive.

             virus (HCV) antibodies.

          5. Acute disease state or infection associated with prescription drugs within 1 month
             before study day 1.

          6. Taking any drugs, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements within 7
             days before study day 1.

          7. History of alcohol abuse (consuming greater than 14 glasses of alcoholic beverages
             each week, 1 glass is approximately equivalent to: beer 284 mL, wine 125 mL, or
             distilled spirits [25 mL).

          8. History of drug abuse.

          9. Smoker or subjects quitting smoking less than 1 month before study day 1.

         10. Participating other trials within 1 month before study day 1.

         11. Donating blood (&gt; 400 mL) within 1 month before study day 1.

         12. During screening, alcohol breath test result &gt; 0.000.

         13. Systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg.

         14. Heart rate was lower than 45 beats per minute (bpm) and/or higher than 90 bpm during
             rest.

         15. The investigator thought the subjects might not be able to complete the study or
             comply with the requirements of the study (due to management reasons or other
             reasons).
