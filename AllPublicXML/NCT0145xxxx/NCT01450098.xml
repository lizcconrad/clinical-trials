      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety of a single dose of LY2484595 and to
      compare the amount of LY2484595 in the blood of healthy non-Asian subjects, Chinese subjects
      and first generation Japanese subjects after receiving a single oral dose of LY2484595 in a
      fasted state, after eating a low-fat meal and after eating a high-fat meal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are overtly healthy males or females, as determined by medical history and physical
             examination. For Cohort B, a first-generation Japanese subject is defined as one who
             is Japanese and was born in Japan and whose parents and all grandparents are Japanese
             and were born in Japan. A first-generation Chinese subject is defined as one who is
             Chinese and was born in China (mainland or Taiwan) and whose parents and all
             grandparents are Chinese and were born in China

          -  Female subjects are not of child-bearing potential due to surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) or menopause. Women with an
             intact uterus are deemed postmenopausal if they are at least age 45, have had
             cessation of menses for at least 1 year, and have not taken hormones or oral
             contraceptives (including estrogen or hormone replacement therapy) during the past 12
             months

          -  Are between the body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 and 29.0 kg/m^2, inclusive

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population
             or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not
             clinically significant by the investigator

          -  Acceptable blood pressure (BP) and heart rate at both supine and standing positions as
             determined by the investigator (systolic BP less than or equal to 140 mm Hg, and
             diastolic BP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). A single repeat BP measurement may be
             done at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow blood sampling

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures

          -  Have given written informed consent approved by Eli Lilly and Company (hereafter,

             participating in the study

          -  Have a history within the last 2 years or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, or neurologic disorders

          -  Have donated blood of more than 500 mL within the last month

          -  Have an average alcohol intake that exceeds 14 units per week, or are unwilling to
             stop alcohol consumption for 48 hours prior and during the inpatient confinement at
             the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) (1 unit = 12 oz or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of
             wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits)
