  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized crossover study, is to investigate the effect of school meals
      based on a sustainable New Nordic Diet on growth, learning abilities, well-being, sleep
      quality, physical activity and risk markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type II diabetes
      and osteoporosis in 8-11 year old Danish school children.

      The participating 3rd and 4th grades on 9 selected primary schools will be randomized to
      either start receiving New Nordic Diet school meals for 3 month(mo) or to eat their habitual
      school lunch for 3 mo and then crossover for additional 3 mo. All participants will be
      examined three times; at baseline, after 3 mo and after 6 mo.
