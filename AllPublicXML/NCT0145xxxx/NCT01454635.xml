    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to predict and visualize sertraline treatment response in major
      depressive disorder with clinical symptoms, demographic and stress state, personality, eight
      genetic polymorphisms at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While only about 50% of patients respond to first treatment in major depressive disorder,
      30-40% did not remit after continuous 1 year treatment. However, patients must remain on
      their prescribed medications for at least 4 weeks without knowing whether the particular
      antidepressant will be effective. Studies have suggested a number of predictors of treatment
      response, but varying degrees of success and nearly all with poor prognostic sensitivity and
      specificity. The investigators investigated clinical symptoms, demographic and stress state,
      personality and genetic polymorphisms in patients of major depressive disorder treated with
      sertraline and performed multivariate analysis to extract the predicting factors. Moreover,
      the investigators tried to visualize weight of variables and pathway one another.
