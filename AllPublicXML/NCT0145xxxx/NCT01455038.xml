      The purposes of this study were: (1) to compare heart rate variability between bipolar
      patients in subsyndromal depressive phase and healthy controls (2) to evaluate the relation
      between the severity of subsyndromal depressive symptoms and reduced heart rate variability.

        Thirty three (10 males, 23 females) patients in clinically remitted state diagnosed with
        bipolar disorder based on DSM-IV criteria were enrolled at one outpatient psychiatric
        clinic and 59 healthy controls (23 males, 36 females) from health promotion center in a
        university-affiliated general hospital. We defined an individual patient as being in
        subsyndromal depressive phase when the patient had a Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating
        scale (MADRS) score of 10 or less and Clinical Global Impression severity (CGI-S) of 3 or
        less for last one month. Healthy controls had no history of psychiatric disorder and had no
        psychiatric symptom when interviewed by a board-certified psychiatrist.
