  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if patients with the flu would receive oseltamivir
      treatment more quickly if it were prescribed by a pharmacist as compared to a physician, and
      to see if there is any difference in the effect of treatment on flu symptoms and overall
      health. Another reason for doing the study is to see how accurately pharmacists can diagnose
      the flu as compared to physicians. Viruses that are exposed to antiviral medications (like
      oseltamivir) sometimes develop a resistance to the medication. This means that the medication
      is no longer as effective in treating the symptoms caused by the virus. The development of
      viral resistance to oseltamivir will also be followed in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria Group 1

          1. Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age presenting at the pharmacy with a current
             prescription for oseltamivir (75 mg capsule BID for 5 days as per the Canadian label)
             for the treatment of their own current influenza symptoms

          2. Willingness to undergo 2 nasal swab procedures

          3. Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by a written and signed Informed
             Consent Form

        Inclusion Criteria Group 2

          1. Male and female subjects ≥ 18 years of age presenting at the pharmacy with indicative
             clinical symptoms/signs of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infection that
             started within a maximum of 2 days prior to the visit to the pharmacy (see Appendix A:

             FACTSS Influenza Diagnostic Tool)

          2. Suitable for oseltamivir treatment at a dose of 75 mg BID (see Appendix B: Algorithm
             for Determining Suitability of Pharmacist Prescribing of Oseltamivir)

          3. Willingness to undergo 2 nasal swab procedures

          4. Willingness to pay for (if not covered by insurance) and receive treatment with
             oseltamivir

          5. Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by a written and signed Informed
             Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria Group 1

          1. Subjects who have been prescribed any other formulation (i.e., oral suspension) or
             dose regimen of oseltamivir, or any other antiviral medication for the treatment of
             influenza

          2. Individuals presenting at the pharmacy with an oseltamivir prescription who themselves
             do not currently have a diagnosis of influenza (e.g., individuals filling a
             prescription for someone else who is currently infected with influenza; individuals
             filling a prescription that they or someone else will use for prevention of influenza
             infection or for treatment of a future influenza infection)

          3. Subjects who have received an oseltamivir prescription from a physician participating
             in the study

          4. Subjects for whom the oseltamivir prescription is not filled for any reason

          5. Subjects who, in the opinion of research personnel, will not comply with the study
             procedures

          6. Staff in the pharmacy or the primary care clinic who are involved in the study, and

          2. Subjects for whom the oseltamivir prescription is not filled for any reason

          3. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not suitable for the study for
             clinical or other reasons (e.g., the patient requires hospitalisation or will not be
             able to comply with study procedures)

          4. Staff in the pharmacy or the primary care clinic who are involved in the study, and
             their family members
