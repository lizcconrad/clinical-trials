  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with solid organ transplants have poorer outcomes than adults, and do not respond
      as well to post-rejection treatment. In addition to well-recognized declines in individual
      health-related quality of life, premature graft loss creates considerable health and economic
      burdens. High nonadherence rates among adolescents are believed to contribute majorly to
      rejection, premature allograft dysfunction and failure. Studies suggest that a
      telephone-based peer mentoring approach, with texting and e-communication, is a promising,
      practical means to promote medication adherence in adolescent solid organ transplant
      recipients. The study's main objectives are 1) to determine the efficacy of peer mentoring to
      improve medication adherence and health-related quality of life vs. usual care in adolescents
      and young adults with solid organ transplants, and 2) to determine the mechanisms through
      which peer mentoring impacts medication adherence and health-related quality of life.

      The investigators will conduct a single-center Phase II randomized clinical trial in which
      adolescents ages 14-23 and greater 3 months post solid organ transplant will receive either a
      peer mentor or usual care. The investigators will assess changes in quality of life from
      baseline to one year post-study entry. The investigators will also examine adherence changes
      over the same time frame using pharmacy refill data and a questionnaire. Peer mentors will
      provide social support and promote subject self-efficacy primarily via e-communication.
      Changes in social support and self-efficacy will be measured over a one-year period.
