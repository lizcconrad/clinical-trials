  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to assess whether compared to placebo, CP-690,550 is effective, safe, and
      tolerable maintenance therapy in subjects with Ulcerative Colitis (UC). The study proposes to
      assess whether compared to placebo, CP-690,550 maintenance therapy more effectively achieves
      mucosal healing and improves quality of life in subjects with UC.The study proposes to assess
      CP-690,550 pharmacokinetic exposure during maintenance therapy in subjects over the age of 18
      years with UC.

    <description>Remission in participants was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12 where higher score indicating higher disease severity.</description>

        <description>Remission in participants was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12 where higher score indicating higher disease severity.</description>

        <description>Sustained steroid-free remission was defined by being in remission and steroid-free at both Week 24 and Week 52. Steroid-free remission was defined by being in remission, in addition to no requirement of any treatment with steroid for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit. Remission was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity.

        <description>Remission in participants was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher subscores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Week 24 and 52</title>
        <description>Clinical response was defined by a decrease from induction study (A3921094 [NCT01465763] or A3921095 [NCT01458951]) baseline in Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point, or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity. Percentage of participants with clinical response at Week 24 and 52 have been reported in this outcome measure.</description>

          <description>Clinical response was defined by a decrease from induction study (A3921094 [NCT01465763] or A3921095 [NCT01458951]) baseline in Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point, or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity. Percentage of participants with clinical response at Week 24 and 52 have been reported in this outcome measure.</description>

It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity.

        <description>Symptomatic remission in participants was defined as a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, and 0 subscore for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity.</description>

        <description>Steroid-free remission was defined by being in remission, in addition to no requirement of any treatment with steroid for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit. Remission was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity. Percentage of participants in steroid-free remission were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants in Sustained Steroid-Free Remission, Among Participants Receiving Steroids at Baseline</title>
        <description>Sustained steroid-free remission was defined by being in remission and steroid-free at both Week 24 and Week 52. Steroid-free remission was defined by being in remission, in addition to no requirement of any treatment with steroid for at least 4 weeks prior to the visit. Remission was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12, where higher scores indicating higher disease severity. Percentage of participants with sustained steroid-free remission were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
