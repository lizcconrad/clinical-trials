      This project aims to enhance the emotional and physical well-being of veterans through the
      reduction of smoking by utilizing a web-based, computerized tailored intervention (CTI) with
      feedback messages delivered via cell phone. CTIs have shown increasing promise as useful
      behavior change programs for improved health behaviors. A variety of modalities are to
      deliver personalized CTI information and feedback; however, the ubiquity and sophistication
      of today's wireless mobile technologies represent new modes of delivery for empirically based
      smoking cessation and other behavioral health interventions. The CTI is based on the
      empirically-supported Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM). A web-based CTI
      modified for a veteran population will be used to pilot test the effectiveness of the CTI
      alone and CTI plus individualized text messaging enhancements. The pilot study is a
      randomized controlled trial to assess the cell phone's feasibility as an intervention
      modality for changing smoking behaviors. This will be the first study to adapt a smoking
      cessation Internet-based CTI to provide personalized feedback on a cell phone to reduce
      smoking behaviors in military veterans.

      Objective: This project examined the effectiveness of tailored text messages as an
      enhancement to a computerized tailored intervention (CTI) for smoking cessation with
      Veterans. It was theorized that the ubiquity and sophistication of today's wireless mobile
      technologies would represent new modes of delivery for empirically based smoking cessation
      and other behavioral health interventions. CTIs have shown increasing promise as useful
      behavior change programs for improved health behaviors; however, the ubiquity and
      sophistication of today's wireless mobile technologies represent new modes of delivery for
      evidence-based smoking cessation and other behavioral health interventions. The CTI was based
      on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and developed by Pro-Change Behavior
      Systems, Inc.

      Research Design: This randomized, prospective pilot employed a 2 (group) x 3 (timepoint)
      research design. Veteran smokers were recruited nationally from direct mailings, Facebook
      ads, community newsletters, posters, and flyers. In addition to the randomized control trial
      (RCT), a focus group (n=9) and individual usability tests (n=5) were conducted in order to
      assess the acceptability of the graphic user interface, questions, tailoring and program
      content to Veteran smokers. The pilot study tested the effectiveness of the CTI alone and CTI
      plus individualized text messaging enhancements in reducing smoking behavior in Veterans. In
      addition to smoking cessation, readiness to change other negative health behaviors � such as
      alcohol use, healthy eating, and exercise � was also assessed.

      Summary of Research Methodology and Procedures: Usability Testing: Five separate usability
      tests were conducted for the CTI smoking cessation program using a combination of the Think
      Aloud protocol and Wizard of Oz approach. Usability testing software was used to take notes
      and record participant interactions with the program. Participants provided qualitative and
      quantitative feedback on overall presentation and usability of the program. All interview
      data were coded, categorized, and summarized in a feedback report so that revisions to the
      system could be adapted. Pilot Study: At all three timepoints, participants completed a brief
      Health Risk Intervention (HRI), two additional smoking assessments, and the smoking cessation
      (SC) intervention. The HRI assessment determined baseline readiness to change for smoking and
      several other related health behaviors, and the smoking cessation intervention provided
      assessment and feedback about participants' confidence to quit smoking, decisional balance,
      and use of various change strategies. Following the baseline HRI and SC intervention, the CTI
      system randomized participants into either the treatment group (Tx), who also received the
      CTI only, or the treatment-plus group (Tx-plus), who received the CTI and tailored text
      messages. The study was conducted as entirely anonymous. All participants were given three
      months' access to the web-based CTI system. The Tx participants received only the online
      feedback narratives/report that all participants received upon completion of the online
      Smoking Cessation intervention. Tx-plus participants also received individualized text
      messages on their cell phones 2-5 times per week (the number of messages correlated with the
      participant's stage of change) that provide expert guidance, encouragement, and reminders
      that support their smoking cessation efforts.

      Findings: Four-hundred and forty-six Veterans were recruited at baseline. All participants
      were active smokers, distributed across the stages of change as 11.9% in Precontemplation
      (n=53; not intending to change in the next 6 months); 63% in Contemplation (n=281; intending
      to change in the next 6 months), and 25.1% in Preparation (n=112; intending to change in the
      next 30 days). Two-hundred and thirty-five individuals (52.7%) completed the one-month and
      three-month follow-ups: n=116 in the treatment group (CTI only; Tx) and n=119 in the
      treatment-plus group (CTI plus text messages; Tx-plus). Results indicated that the
      CTI-plus-text-messaging intervention outperformed the CTI-only intervention at an
      unprecedented quit rate. For those participants in the Tx group 32.8% had quit smoking at
      three-month follow-up; however, those in the Tx-plus group had quit rates of 43.2%. These
      findings are highly encouraging, and exceed those quit rates found for other CTI
      interventions for both groups by almost 15% (Krebs, Prochaska &amp; Rossi, 2010).

      Summary of Participant Experiences: While data are available only for those participants who
      completed the study, indications from the User Satisfaction Scale, as well as the open-ended
      questions, were that Veterans found the CTI and tailored text messages to be both appropriate
      and relevant. In addition, participants in the Tx-plus group also indicated that the text
      messages were helpful, timely and useful. There were no adverse events to report.

      Summary of Current Risk - Potential Benefit Assessment based on Study Results: This study was
      able to demonstrate that the TTM is an appropriate model to promote multiple behavior change
      in Veterans. Furthermore, the addition of tailored text messages increased the effect of the
      smoking cessation intervention (CTI) and improved quit rates in the Tx-plus group to levels
      that are unprecedented in the literature. Additionally, individuals who were at risk for
      other health behaviors progressed to A or M without intervention. For Veterans who are not
      ready for in-person psychotherapy, have practical issues attending therapy sessions, or fear
      stigma associated with seeking mental health care, this Veteran-tailored, motivational
      enhancement CTI may provide unique benefits. In addition, Veterans who smoke and have
      comorbid behavioral risk factors may find this CTI sufficient to resolve their problems. In
      this sense, the adapted CTI will make evidence-based mental health care more accessible to
      Veterans in need without adding concerns about stigma and costs.

      Impact/Significance: This is the Final Abstract for this research project. This study was the
      first to adapt a smoking cessation Internet-based CTI to provide personalized feedback on a
      cell phone to reduce smoking behaviors in military Veterans. The findings suggest that
      behavior change interventions can be successfully delivered to Veterans via the Internet, and
      that tailored text messaging can significantly enhance the intervention effects.
