  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diaphragmatic contraction is controlled by phrenic nerve which consists of anterior rami of
      3rd- 5th cervical nerve roots. Usually, It can't be evaluated from history taking and
      physical examination. Thus the diaphragmatic elevation on chest radiograph is assumed to
      identify the phrenic nerve dysfunction. Normally, the right diaphragm is higher than the left
      side about 1.5 ± 0.9 centimeters or 0.5 ± 0.3 time of vertebral height. Although there are
      several methods to determine the diaphragmatic elevation from previous studies, the accuracy,
      reliability, intra and inter-observer variation are problem.

      Neurotization is the effective procedure to restore upper extremity function in root avulsion
      type. Phrenic nerve is one of the common donor nerves which used for this procedure. But
      sometimes, concomitant injury of this nerve can occur. Therefore, the investigators
      established &quot;Diaphragmatic height index (DHI)&quot; from chest radiograph to use as the diagnostic
      test for phrenic nerve dysfunction.

        220 brachial plexus injured patients who underwent the neurotization and 80 non-brachial
        plexus injury patients who underwent the orthopaedic operation were retrospectively
        reviewed. With using nerve electrical stimulator (Aesculap Nerve Stimulator GN 24,
        Tuttlingen, Germany), in neurotization procedures, phrenic nerve dysfunction is defined by
        no any diaphragmatic contraction was observed intraoperatively. The enrolled patients were
        classified into three main groups: (A) BPI patients with phrenic nerve dysfunction group,
        (B) BPI patients with normal phrenic nerve function group and (C) non-BPI patients group.
        In group A and B, we further subgroubed into: (1) for the right and (2) for the left side.
