      To determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 4 doses (3, 6, 12, 24 mg) of
      Proellex in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids confirmed by ultrasound. Drug will be
      administered vaginally.

      This study is a phase II, 5 arm study with a 12 week active dosing period. The study will be
      conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, the first 6 women to be enrolled will be treated
      at the 12mg dose level, and in addition to the other required study assessments will be
      monitored with a 24-hour PK assessment on Day 14, and daily trough assessments for the first
      14 days. If, at Visit 3, the Cmax or AUC of any subject treated at 12mg exceeds the mean
      observed for the highest safe oral dose administered in the ZP-204 study, all subjects
      enrolled at the 12mg level will be discontinued, no further patients will be treated at this
      dose level, and the 6mg vaginal dose will be assessed in a similar fashion. In the second
      stage, the remaining subjects will be randomized to a dose of 3, 6, 12 or 24 mg.

      For all subjects there will be a 4-6 week placebo run-in period, to establish baseline
      parameters (bleeding and quality of life) followed by treatment at one of three single-blind
      Proellex doses (3, 6 or 12 mg daily, administered vaginally in capsule form.) The primary
      efficacy endpoint will be bleeding assessed using the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart
      (PBAC) after 12 or 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints will be changes in size of
      uterine fibroids assessed by MRI and improvement in quality of life assessed using the
      Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire (UFSQOL0. Safety
      endpoints include significant adverse events, changes in physical examination results, and/or
      clinical laboratory results significantly outside of normal range. For subjects enrolled in
      Stage 2, PK will be assessed after the first and last doses and trough levels every 2 weeks.
