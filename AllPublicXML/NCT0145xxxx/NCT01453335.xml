    <textblock>
      VeinViewerÂ® Vision will significantly increase the number of peripheral intravenous catheter
      access targets perceived by clinicians with experience in intravenous cannulation when
      compared to the number of access targets that these clinicians are able to visualize unaided
      or to palpate.
