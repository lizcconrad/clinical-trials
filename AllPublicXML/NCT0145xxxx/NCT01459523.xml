  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNB; also known as &quot;perineural&quot; catheters) provide
      target-specific pain control for a variety of surgeries. There has been increasing interest
      in the use of ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia, and many techniques using
      ultrasound alone for perineural catheter insertion have been described. Catheters may be
      placed at various points along the brachial plexus (for upper extremity procedures) or in
      proximity to the femoral and/or sciatic nerve (for lower extremity procedures). To date, the
      optimal ultrasound scanning technique, catheter insertion endpoint, catheter placement
      location per indication, for the majority of ultrasound-guided continuous peripheral nerve
      blocks remain unknown. This study will help provide important information related to optimal
      ultrasound scanning techniques and will help identify ways to improve the success rates,
      onset times, and analgesic effectiveness of these techniques for real patients undergoing
      surgical procedures.

      Primary Aim: To determine if there is an optimal scanning technique for ultrasound-guided
      perineural catheter insertion that will result in the most accurate tip placement in
      proximity to the target nerve or plexus.

      Secondary Aim: To determine if there is an optimal location for ultrasound-guided perineural
      catheter insertion along a target nerve or plexus that will result in maximum local
      anesthetic infusion benefits.
