  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intestinal ends must be rejoined after colonic resection. Conventional methods include
      sutured and stapled anastomoses, which is associated with 3-6% leakage after colonic surgery.
      The leakage of an anastomosis can cause serious consequences, such as abdominal infections
      and/or sepsis. Early detection of anastomotic leakage is the best way to avoid serious
      abdominal infections. The methods that are used today to detect leaks are unfortunately not
      very accurate. These methods include monitoring symptoms, temperature, and CRP-levels, and
      performing abdominal examinations and tomography scans. Because of the difficulties in
      objectively assessing these parameters, the anastomotic leaks are often diagnosed late. When
      reoperation is required, a permanent stoma may be made at the level of the sigmoid colon. The
      CARP system has been developed to achieve a safe anastomosis. The CARP is designed to
      providing an improved contact surface between the two intestinal ends and the ability to
      precisely investigate the anastomosis during and after surgery using the catheters of the
      CARP system. Standardized use of the CARP to anastomose the large intestine may provide
      significant advantages in the field of colorectal surgery.
