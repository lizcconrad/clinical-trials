  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs such as amisulpride, known as antipsychotic drugs, are used to treat troublesome and
      distressing symptoms in older people. Although these drugs can be beneficial, they are
      associated with side effects, particularly in patients with dementia and schizophrenia- like
      illness. There is an urgent clinical need to understand why this is the case, to guide
      treatment strategies.

      This study aims to utilise brain imaging techniques that measure the action of antipsychotic
      drugs in the brain to explore the causes of this susceptibility in older people with dementia
      and schizophrenia-like illness, and translate these findings into direct patient benefit.

      The aim of the study is to investigate and compare the relationship between the action of
      amisulpride at brain sites during the first 10 weeks of amisulpride treatment in two patient
      groups - Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia-like illness. Imaging data will be combined
      with data on drug dosage, levels of drug in the bloodstream and clinical response (symptom
      reduction and motor side effects) during dose titration.Dose-response modelling will be
      carried out in both groups to establish the minimum clinically effective dose of amisulpride,
      optimum dose range and impact of variability and covariates on exposure-response
      relationships
