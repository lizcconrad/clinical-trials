    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed treatment safe

        2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients after Stroke and
           clinical outcomes?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASCs) are a novel therapy for patients suffering from stroke.
      By injecting ASCs either into the internal carotid artery, these regions may become populated
      with the ASCs, thereby potentially restoring brain function. ASCs are a patient-derived
      (&quot;autologous&quot;) cell transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient into the
      internal carotid artery and intravenously. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a
      patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately
      delivered back to the patient.

    <description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of ASC implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be implanted into the Internal Carotid Artery and intravenously.</description>
