             acceptable contraception method for the duration of the study.

          -  Hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken protein, thiomersal, formaldehyde, gentamycin,
             ciprofloxacin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine;

          -  History of anaphylactic shock or neurological symptoms or signs following
             administration of any vaccine;

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome;

             disease, complicated diabetes mellitus, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or
             progressive renal disease, congestive heart failure;

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy within the past 36 months;

          -  Concomitant corticosteroid therapy, including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids;

          -  Receipt of immunostimulants;

          -  Receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin, blood products and/or plasma derivates within
             the past 3 months;

          -  Suspected or known HIV, HBV or HCV infection;

          -  Acute disease and/or axillary temperature ≥37oC within the past 3 days;

          -  Vaccine therapy within the past 4 weeks;

          -  Influenza vaccination (any kind) within the past 6 months;

          -  Experimental drug therapy within the past 4 weeks;

          -  Concomitant participation in another clinical study;

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the study;

          -  Past or current psychiatric disease of the subject that upon judgement of the
             investigator may have effect on the objective decision-making of the subject;

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse of the subject.
