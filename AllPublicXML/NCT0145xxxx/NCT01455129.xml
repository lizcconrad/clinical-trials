  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the commonest respiratory diseases.
      During the early stage of COPD, patients only have mild respiratory symptoms or signs which
      may lead to under-diagnosis of the disease. Patients may show poor response to treatment at
      later stages of the disease, associated with higher mortality and incidence of
      re-hospitalization and disability causing burden for both the families and the society.

      So far, there is no large-scale clinical trial on long-term intervention with tiotropium
      bromide (Spiriva) in patients with early stages of COPD (i.e. GOLD Stage I-II COPD or
      asymptomatic COPD). It would be of great significance for COPD prevention and treatment if
      the investigators could prove that tiotropium decreases the lung function decline and
      reverses disease progression in patients with early-stage COPD.

      The investigators objective is to evaluate the efficacy of long-term intervention with
      tiotropium in early stage (FEV1 ≥50% predicted) COPD (difference of trough FEV1, number of
      exacerbations, time to first exacerbation, quality of life, etc) and relevant
      pharmacoeconomic endpoints.
