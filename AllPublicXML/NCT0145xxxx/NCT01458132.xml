  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization has estimated that as many as 10% of the population worldwide
      may at some point experience at least one seizure. The percentage with active epilepsy is
      from 0.4% to 1%. From 40% to 65% of patients with HIV infection have been estimated to have
      some neurological involvement; the percentage reaches as high as 70% to 80% when post-mortem
      assessments are included. Estimates of the percentage of HIV-infected patients with seizure
      occurrence have varied widely, with one review finding a range from 2% to 20%. The highest
      percentage in this range was reported at a center that exclusively treated patients with
      neurological involvement, in India where HIV clade C subtype is predominant. Query of another
      neurology department's database determined that of the HIV-infected patients treated at the
      center, all of whom were referred for neurological symptoms, 6.1% experienced seizures.
      Underlying neurologic diseases in these patients included HIV-associated encephalopathy,
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and toxoplasmosis. In a Spanish population, 3% of
      HIV-infected patients over a one-year study period were found to have new-onset seizures,
      which were attributed to drug toxicity in 47%, intracranial lesions in 35%, and metabolic
      derangements in 12%.

      Drug-discontinuation studies, magnetic resonance imaging studies, and animal studies have
      produced recent evidence that some antiretroviral therapies may have neurotoxic effects,
      warranting further research. Individuals who are treated with highly active antiretroviral
      therapy are at risk for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), in which immune
      recovery triggers clinical deterioration as the newly invigorated immune system reacts to
      pathogens that either represent ongoing opportunistic infection or were previously
      successfully controlled. In a population initiating combination antiretroviral therapy
      between 1999 and 2007, 0.9% developed neurological manifestations of IRIS. Seizures may occur
      as part of a neurological IRIS syndrome, such as encephalitis and toxoplasmosis.

      Two randomized, Phase 2b dose-finding studies were conducted in HIV-1 infected adults to
      compare GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg given once daily as part of an antiretroviral treatment
      regimen. One of the studies (SGN113399) was in subjects with prior exposure to antiretroviral
      therapy where GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily were compared to determine the best
      dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving etravirine 200 mg twice daily
      was also included, and all arms included a twice-daily background therapy consisting of
      darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg plus raltegravir 400 mg. The other study (SGN113404) was in
      treatment-na√Øve subjects, comparing GSK2248761 100 mg and 200 mg once daily to determine the
      best dose in this population. A contemporary control arm receiving efavirenz 600 mg once
      daily was also included, and all arms were given background therapy selected by investigators
      from either once-daily abacavir/lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg or tenofovir/emtricitabine 300
      mg/200 mg. Of a planned total population in both studies of 300 subjects, 35 were enrolled
      before the studies were terminated because of the occurrence of seizures in five subjects.
      All of the subjects who experienced seizures were enrolled into SGN113399, four randomized to
      receive 200 mg GSK2248761 and one randomized to receive 100 mg GSK2248761. There were no
      seizures in the subjects receiving GSK2248761 in study SGN113404. At the time of study
      termination, subjects had been enrolled and received GSK2248761 at 19 sites in four
      countries: France, Romania, United States, and Germany. Although potential contributory
      conditions have been identified in some cases, definitive causative factors for the seizure
      occurrence have not been established.

      The purpose of this study is to follow subjects who previously received GSK2248761 while
      enrolled in the Phase 2b studies, which were halted due to unexpected seizures. The study
      will collect data on all subjects and will be used to monitor for additional seizures as well
      as collect additional clinical data on all subjects.

      The objective of the study is to collect and monitor data on all subjects who previously
      received GSK2248761 while enrolled in the Phase 2b studies SGN113399 or SGN113404 evaluating
      GSK2248761. There will be no formal hypotheses tested, and the data collected will be
      utilized to build individual subject narratives for each subject.

      All subjects who were previously randomized in the Phase 2b studies SGN113399 or SGN113404
      and received GSK2248761 will be targeted for enrollment in the study. Study SGN11339 had 20
      subjects randomized to receive GSK2248761 and was conducted at 12 sites in the United States
      and one site in Romania. Study SGN113404 was conducted at three sites in France and three
      sites in Germany, with 15 subjects randomized to receive GSK2248761. Therefore, the study
      population for the current study will consist of 35 subjects originating from sites located
      in the United States, Romania, France, and Germany.

      All subjects enrolled in this study previously received GSK2248761 in one of the Phase 2b
      clinical trials SGN113399 or SGN113404 of GSK2248761 for the treatment of HIV. This study
      will collect clinical and safety data on all subjects. Data from these subjects' medical
      charts will be collected from the point of termination of the Phase 2b clinical trials. Any
      subject who experienced any seizure during the Phase 2b clinical trial will be followed for
      two years. Subjects who experienced no seizure during the Phase 2b clinical trial will be
      followed for one year. In the event that a subject who did not previously have a seizure
      experiences a seizure during the study period, the subject will be moved to the &quot;seizure
      subject group&quot; that is being followed for two years. Data collection will occur on a
      quarterly basis for all subjects.

      No formal analyses will be performed. All data collected for each subject will be
      incorporated into a narrative of the subject's medical events during the follow-up period.
      The narrative will recreate the clinical course and evolution of disease history for the
      subjects and allow assessment for evidence of residual or new adverse events potentially
      related to their exposure to GSK2248761. Listings of AEs will be generated for each subject.
      Data on AEs collected quarterly will be combined with the subject's demographic and medical
      history details in the listing reports. The listings will be delivered to GSK every six
      months in coordination with the safety advisory committee meetings.

    <description>An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE was any experience that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant.</description>
