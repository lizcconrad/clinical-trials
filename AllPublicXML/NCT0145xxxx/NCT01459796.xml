    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the administration of first dose of study drug up to and including 35 days after the last dose of study drug). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the administration of first dose of study drug up to and including 35 days after the last dose of study drug). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event.
