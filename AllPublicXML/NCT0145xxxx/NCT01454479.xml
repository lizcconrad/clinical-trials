  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the 8th most common female cancer in Taiwan. Its incidence is
      increasing in the recent few years, around 1,200 new cases per year. The outcome of recurrent
      EC is disappointing, except focal recurrences that could be irradiated or removed.
      Chemotherapy is currently the most common salvage treatment for recurrent endometrial cancer.
      However, the response rate (RR) to 2nd-line treatment is approximately 0-27.3%, with short
      median time to progression, 2-3.9 months and low overall survival, 6.4-11 months.

      Due to progress of studies on the molecular and genetic basis of cancer and cellular
      signaling pathways, targeted therapy has been developed for various cancer treatments. A
      Gynecologic Oncology Group study found 44% of advanced endometrial cancer had HER&gt;=2+ and the
      ratio of HER2:chromosome 17 (CEP17) &gt;=2. Another study showed that HER&gt;=2+ was seen in 47% of
      carcinosarcoma. These evidences indicated HER2 gene amplification and HER2 overexpression
      occur in endometrial cancer and carcinosarcoma, especially in those of high grade and
      recurrence. Lapatinib (L), an oral inhibitor of both EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor)
      and HER2(human epidermal growth receptor), has been shown to be an effective treatment in
      HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analog of
      the natural product epothilone B, and recently has been approved by US Food and Drug
      Administration as a treatment option in metastatic breast cancer. It was also observed that
      lapatinib + ixabepilone killed more breast tumor cells than trastuzumab + paclitaxel in
      vitro. Two GOG(Gynecologic Oncology Group) studies had reported that weekly Ixabepilone as
      2nd-line chemotherapy provided a similar RR to 3-weekly regimen of 14.3% in platinum- and
      taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer with less severe toxicities. The combination of
      lapatinib and ixabepilone is expected to become an effective treatment for recurrent
      endometrial cancer and carcinosarcoma, but the ideal dose is yet to be surveyed.

      Patients receive weekly Ixabepilone 32 mg/m2 (D1) and a 4-level of oral Lapatinib 500-1250 mg
      once daily continuously. The recommended duration of treatment for each patient 21 days a
      cycle of total 6 cycles or until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity or patient's
      refusal occurred.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed carcinoma or carcinosarcoma of the endometrium with evidence
             of persistent disease or progression after initial surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, or both, not amenable for curative salvage therapy.

          2. ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH (ErbB2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals) of &gt; =
             2.0; ErbB2 overexpression is defined by immunostaining &gt;=2 for ErB2
