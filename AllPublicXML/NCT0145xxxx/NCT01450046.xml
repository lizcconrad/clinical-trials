  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Principal Investigator believes that Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will slow the progression of
      pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators must determine the safety and
      tolerability of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol in healthy participants before administering to
      cancer patients. The investigators will do this by giving participants a dose of up to1600 mg
      twice a day, not to exceed 3200 mg total for 14 consecutive days.

      Participants will be accrued in cohorts of three. The decision to dose escalate will be made
      by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC) based on safety after the last subject in the current
      cohort has completed the Study Treatment Period. The study will consist of the following
      procedures:

        -  Pre-Treatment Period: The screening period must occur within 7 days of dosing.

        -  Study Treatment Period (14 days): Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will be administered orally
           twice daily for 14 consecutive days

        -  Post-Treatment Period: Subject will return to the study site 7 days after the dose of
           Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol for an end-of-treatment assessment. On day 8 (± 2 days) after
           the last dose of study drug, the investigator will obtain follow-up information. Any
           serious adverse events (SAEs) present at 7 days after the last dose and possibly related
           to study drug will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or initiation of
           treatment that confounds the ability to assess the event.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol and to determine the maximum administered dose (MAD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol administered twice daily for 14 days. Safety analyses and summary tables will include data collected for all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.</description>

    <description>Each investigator will be provided with adequate supplies of Vitamin E δ -Tocotrienol, which will be supplied as 100-mg, 200-mg, and 400-mg capsules. Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will be administered orally once. The dose administered to each subject will be fixed and based on cohort assignment. Doses will be administered at the clinical site during each protocol-defined visit.</description>

    <description>Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will be administered orally as a single agent twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol is supplied as 100-mg, 200-mg, and 400-mg capsules. The first cohort will be dosed with δ-tocotrienol at 100 mg twice daily for 14 consecutive days. A minimum of 3 subjects is planned for each dosing cohort with Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol dose escalation dependent on safety and available PK data from prior cohorts. At the MTD or MAD, 18 subjects will be enrolled.</description>
