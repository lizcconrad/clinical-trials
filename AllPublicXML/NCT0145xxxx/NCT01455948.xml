    <textblock>
      The economic, patient related outcome, and effectiveness of balloon sinuplasty in the
      treatment of CRS patients with frontal and other sinus disease in the Canadian healthcare
      environment is not known at this time. This study will evaluate the impact of balloon
      sinuplasty and traditional FESS treatment on CRS patients.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health outcomes will be determined by the completion of the EQ-5D questionnaire in both treatment groups at various timepoint. The EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the two treatment groups in relieving symptomology of CRS.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness of the two treatment groups in relieving symptomology of CRS will be determined by the completion of the Sino-nasal Outcome Test - 20 (SNOT-20) questionnaire in both treatment groups at various timepoint. The SNOT-20 questionnaire is a validated instrument for the measurement of disease specific health status and quality of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.</description>
