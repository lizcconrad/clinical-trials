    <textblock>
      The objective of this Trial is to evaluate the performance of RPh201 as a treatment for the
      healing of partial thickness burns. It is further postulated that deep second degree lesions
      will benefit from the RPh201 treatment promoting granulation and epithelialization as well as
      wound closure.

      The objective of this Trial is to evaluate the performance of RPh201 in the treatment of
      partial thickness burns (second degree superficial and deep) of less than 5%TBSA.

      The additional follow up for a period of 20 weeks will be scheduled to extend the evaluation
      of wounds of Subjects that completed up to 3 weeks of treatment

      This is to include:

        -  Efficacy assessment of burn improvement following the use of RPh2O1 oil solution
           administered topically three times per week during an overall treatment period of up to
           3 weeks and at the follow-up visit at 20 weeks after end of treatment in Subjects with
           partial thickness burns (second degree superficial and deep) of less than 5%TBSA

        -  Safety evaluation of RPh201 formulated as an oil solution administered topically three
           times per week during an overall treatment period of up to 3 weeks in Subjects with
           partial thickness burns (second degree superficial and deep) of less than 5%TBSA.

             superficial and deep).

          4. Subjects will be eligible to participate in the Trial if their target lesion area of
             the edges is not more than 500-750 cm2 at baseline.

          5. The Subject is expected to be available for the 3 weeks Trial ambulatory treatment.

          6. The Subject is willing and able to adhere to the protocol regimen.

          7. The Subject is able to read, understand, and has signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Burn wounds of more than 48hours from burn event

          3. Presence of a systemic infection or significant local infection such as cellulites,
             purulent drainage, gangrene, or necrosis at the target wound site, as well as
             nonviable tissue, sinus tracts or tunnels that cannot be removed by debridement.

          4. Previous history of any illness or condition that may impair wound healing, immune

             known to impair wound healing, including but not limited to: corticosteroids,
             immuno-suppressive drugs, cytotoxic agents, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

          7. Presence or suspicion of any malignancy.

          8. Female Subjects who are pregnant or nursing, or of childbearing potential and are not
