        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mild, moderate, severe renally impaired or ESRD patients.

          -  Healthy male or female subjects to match renally impaired patients in BMI (±15%), age
             (± 7 years) and gender (in this order). Smoking status (yes or no) will also be used
             as a final criterion, if deemed feasible by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless using effective contraception during the study as defined in
             the protocol.

          -  Smokers, smoking 10 cigarettes or more per day from screening to study completion

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject
             in case of participation in the study

          -  Co-medication for healthy subjects

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
