    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to confirm that simultaneous use of L. reuteri ProGastria and
      omeprazole for 28 days can eradicate H. pylori in humans in the absence of antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori colonises an estimated 50% of the worldÂ´s population. Despite clear
      clinical guidelines on the treatment of this infection there is a drive to find alternative
      ways to control this infection in a wider perspective without the complications of induction
      of antibiotic resistance in the pathogen. A good alternative is to use probiotics.

      Lactic acid bacteria and in particular lactobacilli have been studied for their effects in
      humans infected with H. pylori with some success in reducing the infection load. Studies
      using supplementation with L. reuteri in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic H.
      pylori-infected subjects show a clear reduction of infection load after 4 weeks of use and
      this was concomitant with a reduction in symptoms associated with the infection. Further,
      dietary supplementation with L. reuteri during and after the period of H. pylori eradication
      therapy has also been shown to reduce the side effects of this therapy without affecting the
      degree of eradication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased number of H. pylori positive subjects treated with L. reuteri-ProGastria for 28 days who are negative for H. pylori after the treatment compared to placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Increase in the number of subjects with treatment success after 28 days of treatment with omeprazole + L. reuteri ProGastria compared to those given omeprazole + placebo will prove treatment success defined as the absence of H. pylori infection on Day 29. This is measured as a significant reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms (according to a validated GSRS score) and a negative stool antigen test for H. pylori infection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased number of subjects from the ProGastria group compared to the placebo group with a maintained absence of H.pylori infection up to 2 months after completed treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure will be proven when there is evidence of fewer patients in the L. reuteri ProGastria treatment success group with demonstrated presence of H. pylori infection, measured as UBT on Day 90 compared to the placebo treatment success group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with amelioration of gastrointestinal symptoms in H. pylori-infected subjects treated with ProGastria compared to placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is achieved by following reduced gastrointestinal symptom scores using GSRS validated scoring system at days 14, 28 and 90 in L. reuteri ProGastria treated subjects compared to placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confirmation that L. reuteri +omeprazole could improve eradication rates of H. pylori using triple therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be done by assesing the absence of H. pylori infection on Day 90 measured as a negative outcome in UBT in the L. reuteri ProGastria treatment failure group compared to the placebo treatment failure group</description>

L. reuteri ProGastria will be delivered at a dose of 1x108 CFU of 2 strains of L. reuteri giving a final dose of L. reuteri of 2x108 CFU. One chewable tablet is to be taken once per day giving a dose of L. reuteri of 2x108 CFU/day. This dose of L. reuteri has been shown to be effective in a series of conditions earlier, including inhibition of H. pylori in humans, and is considered the optimal dose. The study products will be taken daily for 28 consecutive days.</description>
