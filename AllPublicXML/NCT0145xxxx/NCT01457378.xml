      The aim of this study performed in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) subjects and healthy
      patients is to demonstrate the ability of composite score of frequency of gastrointestinal
      symptoms to discriminate healthy subjects and IBS patients. The properties of this
      questionnaire of composite score of gastrointestinal symptoms frequency will be compared to
      other validated questionnaires (severity of IBS symptoms and HRQoL).
