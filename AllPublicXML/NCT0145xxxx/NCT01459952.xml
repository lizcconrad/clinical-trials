    <textblock>
      The trial is an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase
      III study.

      After the patient has receiving information about the study and after given written informed
      consent, the patient will be screened.

      The patient's medical history and demographic information will be recorded. The patient will
      then be asked questions in accordance to the study questionnaires, and they will also be
      asked to complete questionnaires regarding quality of life - and finally they be instructed
      on how to complete the diary.

      All patients are randomized to receive standardized rose hip liquid or matching placebo. The
      subject is instructed to take the liquid form of rose hips in the morning and evening meal.
      The subject will also be advised to call the clinic if there is an acute attack of cold and /
      or flu because they must then increase the in-take of study treatment to 3 double dose for 5
      days and then return to normal dose.

      The subject will then be asked a series of questions under study questionnaires, and be
      instructed in how questionnaires (SF-12) and diary filled. This is to provide security to the
      validation output values Investigator or study nurse will take telephone contact with the
      subject once a month, subjects will be asked about how things are going and to remember to
      take the liquid and whether they have completed the diary.

      The last patient visit will take place after 6 months. Any side effects will be reported to
      and reviewed with HybenVital ApS in collaboration with medical experts.
