  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a condition of withdrawal symptoms after
      utero exposure to opioids. In an open label Phase 1 trial sublingual buprenorphine was
      associated with a ~30% reduction length of treatment compared to standard of care morphine.
      Due to the subjective nature of the scoring instrument, efficacy in a blinded trial is needed
      to unequivocally establish the superiority of buprenorphine over morphine. The primary
      objective of the trial is to compare length of treatment using sublingual buprenorphine or
      oral morphine solution in the pharmacologic treatment of the NAS.
