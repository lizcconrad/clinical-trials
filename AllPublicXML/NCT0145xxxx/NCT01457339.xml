    <textblock>
      This is a multiple ascending dose study; the purpose of this study is to examine the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (levels of drug in the blood) of SPD489 in Schizophrenic
      Patients who are currently maintained on a stable dose of an antipsychotic medication.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure at Day 5: 50 mg</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and pulse measurements were taken using an automated blood pressure monitoring device (ideally using the same device, the same arm and in the same position throughout the study). Measurements of vital signs were performed in triplicate (3 measurements) after the subject had been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. Each of the 3 triplicate readings were performed in succession, at least 1-2 minutes apart, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. It was expected that the triplicate measurements be obtained within a 5-6 minute period.</description>

    <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>

        <description>Blood pressure and pulse measurements were taken using an automated blood pressure monitoring device (ideally using the same device, the same arm and in the same position throughout the study). Measurements of vital signs were performed in triplicate (3 measurements) after the subject had been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. Each of the 3 triplicate readings were performed in succession, at least 1-2 minutes apart, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. It was expected that the triplicate measurements be obtained within a 5-6 minute period.</description>

        <description>The PANSS is a validated measure that evaluates the presence, absence, and severity of 30 symptoms of schizophrenia including both positive and negative symptoms and general psychopathology. Each of the 30-items are rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) with a total scoring range of 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate more impairment.</description>

Objective and subjective components are rated on a scale from 0 (normal/absence) to 3 (severe) and are summed yielding a total score of 0 to 9. Global impression is rated on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe) with a total score ranging from 0 to 5. Lower scores indicate reduced restlessness.</description>

          <description>BAS scale has objective, subjective, and global impression components of akathisia (motor restlessness that manifests itself with an inability to sit still or remain motionless). Objective and subjective components are rated on a scale from 0 (normal/absence) to 3 (severe) and are summed yielding a total score of 0 to 9. Global impression is rated on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe) with a total score ranging from 0 to 5. Lower scores indicate reduced restlessness.</description>

        <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Score at Day 5: Groton Maze Learning Test, 70 mg</title>
        <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Score at Day 5: Detection Task, 70 mg</title>
        <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Score at Day 5: Identification Task, 70 mg</title>
        <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery (CogState Battery) Score at Day 5: One Card Learning Task, 70 mg</title>
        <description>This battery is a series of 4 computerized cognition tests (Groton Maze Learning Test, Detection Task, Identification Task, and One Card Learning Task) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and reasoning, and problem solving. The entire battery takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. CogState scores are measured on a linear scale (no maximum score). The Groton Maze Learning Test measures total number of errors made in problem solving (lower score = better performance). The Detection Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). The Identification Task is measured by speed of performance (lower score = better performance). One Card Learning Task measures the accuracy of performance (higher score = better performance).</description>
