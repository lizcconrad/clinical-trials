  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the common diseases in the elderly. It is the third ranking cause of death
      and affects health care system in our country. The focal brain lesions encountered in
      patients with stroke can result in impairments in motor function, language, cognition,
      sensory processing, cognition and emotional disturbances. All of these conditions affect
      performance of functional activities. The abrupt change in the life situation of the stroke
      survivor impacts all phases of care. This may reduce a patient's quality of life.

      Many innovative therapy techniques have been developed to help the restoration of lost
      functions and to aid in prevention and treatment of depression. Music and art therapy has
      been used in rehabilitation settings to stimulate brain functions involved in movement,
      cognition, speech, emotions, and sensory perceptions. However many research studies on the
      use of music and art therapy in rehabilitation of acquired brain injury have suffered from
      small sample size, making it difficult to achieve statistically significant results. In
      addition, differences in factors such as study designs, methods of interventions, and
      intensity of treatment have led to varying results.

      Our study focuses on the use of creative therapy with a patient diagnosed with stroke.
      Creative therapy refers to a group of techniques include art therapy, writing, movement
      therapy, role play, and music therapy that are expressive and creative in nature. The aim of
      creative therapies is to help patients find a form of expression beyond words or traditional
      therapy, such as cognitive or psychotherapy. These therapies use arts modalities and creative
      processes during intentional intervention in therapeutic, rehabilitative, community, or
      educational settings to foster health, communication, and expression.
