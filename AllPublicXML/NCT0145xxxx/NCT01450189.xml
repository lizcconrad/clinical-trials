    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the feasibility for the potential public health benefit of
      behavioral and antiretroviral interventions during acute HIV infection.

      Central Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that delivering behavioral and
      antiretroviral interventions to acutely infected persons will reduce onward transmission.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is severe and continues to grow. In urban areas of
      Malawi, 19% of pregnant women seeking antenatal care and 15.6% of Malawians aged 15-49 years
      were infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention interventions that prevent onward transmission of
      HIV are urgently needed.

      Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) may be responsible for a substantial proportion of
      onward transmission of HIV infection. AHI is characterized by unfettered replication of HIV
      in a &quot;ramp up viremia&quot;. The high concentration of HIV in blood and genital secretions remains
      elevated for up to 10-12 weeks before it declines to the levels observed in established
      infection. These high levels of HIV shedding in the genital tract are likely to produce very
      efficient sexual transmission and the proportion of virions that are infectious may be
      substantially higher during acute compared to chronic infection. Consequently, the
      probability of transmission during unprotected intercourse for those with AHI is very high.
      Identifying persons with AHI and intervening to reduce onward transmission represents a
      tantalizing, but unproven, opportunity for HIV prevention.

      To have maximal impact, a prevention program targeting AHI must identify a substantial number
      of acutely infected persons and intervene quickly to minimize onward transmission. An
      effective immediate intervention would require behavioral modification to limit sexual
      partners and unprotected sex acts, and a biological intervention to reduce infectious viral
      burden in genital secretions. This is the first study to pilot a combined behavioral and
      biomedical intervention in individuals with AHI to reduce onward transmission of HIV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Primary Participants:

          -  HIV infection based on two positive HIV antibody rapid tests at the time of screening.

          -  HIV-negative based on one or more antibody rapid test and an HIV RNA PCR test.

          -  Serious illness, including tuberculosis or opportunistic infection, requiring systemic
             treatment and/or hospitalization.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence.

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the study investigator would compromise the
             safety of the study participant or study staff, or would prevent proper conduct of the
             study.

        Partner Participants:

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence.

          -  Current imprisonment or involuntary incarceration in a medical facility for
             psychiatric or physical illness.

        Exclusion for Receipt of Antiretroviral Drugs in the BIA Arm

        Note:A key component of this pilot study is to estimate the potential effect of ARVs during
        acute infection when applied on a large population scale.In effect, this pilot study should
        be viewed as a pilot for an effectiveness trial. Consequently, we will randomize all
        eligible participants to one of the three arms. If, however, persons should not receive
        ARVs for a variety of medically-related reasons, these persons will remain in the BIA arm,
        but will not receive ARVs. Women who are of reproductive potential but who refuse to use at
        least one form of contraception (see below), will remain in the BIA arm but will not
        receive ARVs. Similarly, persons randomized to the BI arm who do not attend all sessions
        will remain in the BI arm.

        Persons randomized to BIA with any of the following conditions will be excluded from
        receiving ARVs, but will remain in the BIA group for purposes of analysis.

          -  Laboratory values obtained at Day 0 prior to initiating ARVs at a subsequent visit

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt;300/mm3

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL

          -  Platelet count &lt;40,000/mm3

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase &gt; 5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;2.5 x ULN

          -  Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) &lt;60 mL/min

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity

          -  Positive serum or urine pregnancy test at Day 0.

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Refusal to use at least one method of contraception, if a woman is of reproductive
             potential.

        Acceptable forms of contraception include: condoms (male or female) with or without a
        spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or
        a hormonal-based contraceptive.

        Women not meeting the reproductive potential criteria above may receive the study drugs
        without using contraception.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drug(s) or
             their formulation.

          -  Requirement for any current medications that are prohibited with any study drugs.
