    <measure>Average Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) Pain Based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period (includes both Visits 5 and 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self assessment was performed daily in the evening before bedtime on a telephone via interactive voice recognition system (IVRS) (time window for completion between 6.00 pm to midnight). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study drug in each treatment period - period 1 and period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

      <recruitment_details>501 participants were screened, of whom 197 were withdrawn before randomization. 304 were randomized, of whom 3 discontinued before being treated. Participants were randomized at 47 centers in 3 countries: US (43), Czech Republic (3), and Italy (1). 4 centers received study drug but did not randomize participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed daily pain and sleep diary from Visit 1 (Screening) to Visit 9. Participants with a mean pain score ≥ 4 (moderate to severe pain) and those having completed ≥ 4 daily pain dairies over past 7 days and having a mean score of ≥ 4 at Visit 2 (Baseline) were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants were randomized to double-blind treatment with pregabalin for 6 weeks (150 - 300 mg/day) in period 1 followed by placebo in period 2. There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods. A 1-week taper was administered at the end of the second treatment period, followed by a final follow-up visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 30% Reduction in Mean DPN Pain Score From Baseline at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>Daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self assessment was performed daily in the evening before bedtime on a telephone via IVRS (time window for completion between 6.00 pm to midnight). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study drug in each treatment period - period 1 and period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

        <title>Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) Total Quality of Life (TQOL) Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. All symptoms (1 - 7) are scored as either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence of the symptom. With exception of questions 31 and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, “no problem” to “severe problem”). In question 31, “good”, the middle item, is scored as 0, “very good” as -1, “excellent” as -2, “fair” as 1, and “poor” as 2. In question 32, “about the same”, the middle item, is scored as 0, &quot;somewhat better&quot; as -1, &quot;much better&quot; as -2, &quot;somewhat worse&quot; as 1, and &quot;much worse&quot; as 2. TQOL score should be summed as follow: sum (Σ) (1 - 7, 8 - 35). The (sub)scales are calculated without weighting of any kind, and reported as the integer sum of listed questionnaire items (range: -4 - 136). The QOL-DN version that was administered in this study was modified with a 2-week recall period.</description>

          <title>Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) Total Quality of Life (TQOL) Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. All symptoms (1 - 7) are scored as either 1 or 0, indicating presence or absence of the symptom. With exception of questions 31 and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, “no problem” to “severe problem”). In question 31, “good”, the middle item, is scored as 0, “very good” as -1, “excellent” as -2, “fair” as 1, and “poor” as 2. In question 32, “about the same”, the middle item, is scored as 0, &quot;somewhat better&quot; as -1, &quot;much better&quot; as -2, &quot;somewhat worse&quot; as 1, and &quot;much worse&quot; as 2. TQOL score should be summed as follow: sum (Σ) (1 - 7, 8 - 35). The (sub)scales are calculated without weighting of any kind, and reported as the integer sum of listed questionnaire items (range: -4 - 136). The QOL-DN version that was administered in this study was modified with a 2-week recall period.</description>

        <title>Norfolk QOL-DN Small Fiber Domain Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>Norfolk QOL-DN is a 35-item participant-rated questionnaire used to assess impact of diabetic neuropathy on quality of life of participants with diabetic neuropathy. The items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0 - 4, &quot;no problem&quot; to &quot;severe problem&quot;). The small fiber domain score should be summed as follow: Σ (10, 16, 17, 18). Scales and subscales are calculated without weighting of any kind, and reported as integer sum of the listed questionnaire items (range: 0 - 16). The QOL-DN version that was administered in this study was modified with a 2-week recall period.</description>

This crossover study consisted of two double blind 6- week treatment periods where participants were randomized to pregabalin or placebo for the first period, and were then switched to the other treatment for the second period. There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods. A 1-week taper was administered at the end of the second treatment period, followed by a final follow-up visit.</description>

          <title>EQ-5D Dolan 1997 Index Summary Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>EQ-5D is a participant-completed 5-item questionnaire designed to assess health related quality of life in terms of a single index value or utility score. There are 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-point response scale [1 = no problems, 2 = some/moderate problems, 3 = extreme problems] and the scores are combined to form a single index utility value between 0 and 1 with higher scores indicating better health. The utility score is calculated using the Dolan 1997 algorithm and the revised version which was provided to the EuroQol Group by Dolan in 2001 – but later published in medical care in 2002.</description>

        <title>Average Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) Pain Based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
        <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self assessment was performed daily in the evening before bedtime on a telephone via interactive voice recognition system (IVRS) (time window for completion between 6.00 pm to midnight). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study drug in each treatment period - period 1 and period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

There was a 2-week single-blind washout (blinded to participant) between the treatment periods. A 1-week taper was administered at the end of the second treatment period, followed by a final follow-up visit.</description>

          <title>Average Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) Pain Based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Over the Last 7 Days of Each Treatment Period (Week 6 of Each Treatment Period)</title>
          <description>The daily pain diary consisted of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by having chosen the appropriate number between 0 and 10. Self assessment was performed daily in the evening before bedtime on a telephone via interactive voice recognition system (IVRS) (time window for completion between 6.00 pm to midnight). The endpoint mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings while taking study drug in each treatment period - period 1 and period 2, respectively. A rating of 1 - 3 was considered as mild pain; 4 - 6 as moderate pain; and 7 - 10 as severe pain.</description>

        <description>The PGIC is a participant-rated instrument that measures the participant`s assessment of change in his/her overall status on a scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Original scores (7 different scores) and categorized scores (4 different scores) were provided. Categorized scores were very much improved (consisting of very much improved and much improved); any improvement (consisting of very much improved, much improved, and minimally improved); no change (consisting of no change); and any worsening (consisting of minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse). Due to the crossover design, PGIC was analyzed at the end of period 1 (V5).</description>
