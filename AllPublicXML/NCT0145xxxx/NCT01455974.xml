  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfavorably high sodium intakes remain prevalent around the world. A negative sodium gradient
      in hemodialysis treatment results in absolute sodium removal via diffusive transport of
      sodium from the blood to the dialysate, and it may be a potentially useful tool to improve
      sodium loading due to excess dietary sodium intake.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a in small negative sodium gradient could
      improve blood pressure level, arterial stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy in
      hypertensive hemodialysis patients, who had been achieving and maintaining their dry weight
      assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that lowering dialysate sodium concentration could improve
      blood pressure (BP) control, and the lower BPs are considered to be a result of an
      improvement in volume status via increasing sodium removal. However, sodium, apart from
      volume, may have an independent effect on BP regulation. It is speculated that a reduction in
      exchangeable sodium, even without a change in body water content, may improve BP control.
      Unfortunately, as of yet, no clinical studies have actually provided the evidence in this
      field.

      In general population, dietary salt loading produces significant increase in aortic pulse
      wave velocity, which is reversed by lowering sodium intake. To the investigators knowledge,
      the effect of sodium on arterial stiffness has not been investigated in hemodialysis
      patients.

      A regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been achieved through strict dietary
      sodium restriction in hemodialysis patients. Lack of effect on LVH was observed in low sodium
      dialysis which may be due to the shorter time interval.
