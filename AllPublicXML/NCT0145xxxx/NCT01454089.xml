    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to ascertain whether there is evidence of longer
      survival relative to the control arm for three comparisons: 600 mg OGX-427 Arm to control
      Arm; 1000 mg OGX-427 Arm to control Arm; and pooled 600 mg and 1000 mg OGX-427 Arms to
      control Arm.

      Following 3 loading doses, participants receive chemotherapy and study drug on a 21-day cycle
      during the Treatment Period (Chemotherapy Period) until disease progression, completion of 6
      cycles, toxicity or voluntary participant withdrawal. Participants who do not have documented
      disease progression and have completed a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy continue to
      receive weekly Study Drug maintenance therapy during the Maintenance Period until disease
      progression or the participant fulfills one of the other reasons for withdrawal from protocol
      treatment, unless they have been discontinued from protocol treatment for unacceptable
      toxicity related to study drug. All participants have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit when
      they are withdrawn from all study treatment (chemotherapy and maintenance). All participants
      are followed until documented disease progression. Once disease progression is documented,
      participants enter a Survival Follow-up Period during which data are collected regarding
      further cancer therapy, secondary malignancy, and survival status.

    <description>Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease with no new lesions. Any pathological lymph node (target or non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm). All markers of disease must have normalized. Partial Response (PR): A decrease from baseline of ≥ 30% of the diameter(s) of all target measurable lesions with no unequivocal progression of non-measurable lesions and no new lesions.

A 20% increase in the sum of the diameter(s) of target measurable lesions over either the smallest sum observed or over baseline if no decrease during therapy has occurred. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 3. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions alone.</description>
