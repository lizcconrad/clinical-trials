    <textblock>
      The study consists of a pre-screening period to determine if the subject's tumor has PTEN
      deficiencies. Subjects then continue into the screening phase for Part 1, 2, or 3, as
      appropriate. In Part 1, subjects will then receive a single dose of 25 mg. After analysis of
      24 hour pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, subjects may receive continuous dosing or receive a
      single modified dose. In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled and dose escalation will occur in
      a 3+3 design. Subjects will receive a single dose on Day 1, and then begin continuous daily
      dosing after collection of a 72-hour PK sample. Additional subjects may be enrolled at lower
      dose levels for assessment of pharmacodynamic response. In Part 3, up to two tumor-specific
      expansion cohorts will be enrolled and receive the MTD or BED as defined in Part 2. A minimum
      of 12 and a maximum of 20 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each cohort. Interim
      monitoring for futility will be incorporated after response data from 12 subjects are
      available. In addition, up to 20 evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Part 3
      -Signal-finding Expansion Cohort at the MTD or BED as defined in Part 2. All subjects in all
      parts/cohorts will receive daily dosing until withdrawal or unacceptable toxicity. All
      subjects in all parts/cohorts will receive daily dosing until withdrawal or unacceptable
      toxicity.

          -  Subjects with brain metastases of non-CNS primary tumor are excluded if brain
             metastases are symptomatic and treated (surgery, radiation therapy) but not clinically

             enhanced MRI or CT), OR asymptomatic and untreated but &gt;1 cm in the longest dimension
             NOTE: Subjects with small (less than or equal to 1 cm in the longest dimension),
             asymptomatic brain metastases who do not need immediate local therapy may be enrolled.

        NOTE: Subjects receiving a stable (i.e., unchanged) dose of corticosteroids for &gt;30 days or
        subjects who have not received corticosteroids within 14 days prior to the first dose of

             greater than or equal to 470 msec NOTE: If first screening QTcF is greater than or
             equal to 470 msec, ECG should be repeated two additional times at least five minutes
             apart and the average of the three readings should be used to determine eligibility.
             Clinically significant ECG abnormalities including second degree (Type II) or third
             degree AV block, history of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including
             unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, stenting, or bypass grafting within the past
             six months prior to enrollment, Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the NYHA
             functional classification system, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the
             institutional LLN, NOTE: If a LLN does not exist at an institution, then use LVEF

             cardiac metastases
