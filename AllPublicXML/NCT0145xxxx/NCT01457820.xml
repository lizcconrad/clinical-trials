    <textblock>
      Allopurinol is a drug commonly used to treat gout. However recent studies have shown it has
      the potential to help improve oxygen supply to heart muscle. In this study the Investigators
      aim to find out if allopurinol slows down the onset of angina symptoms, as seen by a doctor
      on a tracing of the heart (ECG- electrocardiogram), for patients who have been diagnosed with
      heart disease, when exercising on a treadmill. The Investigators are also are trying to
      figure out the best dose of allopurinol to use and to see how quickly it begins working. To
      do this the investigators will recruit patients with angina, exercise them on a treadmill
      after giving different doses of allopurinol and see if there is an improvement in their time
      to bring on angina symptoms and signs. Patients recruited to this trial will receive three
      different treatment regimes over a six week period. Each treatment regime will last for one
      week with a one week rest period between each regime. This will involve up to eleven visits
      to Ninewells Medical School, Dundee for testing.
