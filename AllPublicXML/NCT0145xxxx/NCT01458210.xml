    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how the body processes oral contraceptive (OC), using
      Ortho-Cyclen, as a commonly prescribed combination oral contraceptive in healthy female
      participants, and the effect of dulaglutide on how Ortho-Cyclen is processed by the body.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

Participants received the first 28-day course (Lead-in) followed by 2 subsequent 28-day courses (Periods 1 and 2, respectively). Following the Lead-in period, the Period 1 sample was taken during the first 28-day course and the Period 2 sample was taken during the second 28-day course.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             medical history and physical examination

               -  As it is possible that dulaglutide may cause the oral contraceptive (OC) tablet
                  to be less effective than usual, participants will be required to use 2
                  additional highly effective methods of contraception from the screening
                  appointment until 2 months after the poststudy follow-up appointment. Additional
                  methods of contraception may include the following: a non-hormonal intrauterine
                  device with spermicide; male or female condom with spermicide; contraceptive
                  sponge with spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide;
                  sterile sexual partner; or abstinence (participants reporting abstinence who
                  become sexually active while on the study must agree to use other additional
                  methods of contraception). The pregnancy test result must be negative at
                  screening and at each check-in

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of between 18.5 and 30.0 kilogram-meter squared (kg/m^2),
             at screening

          -  Have no clinically significant findings, as determined by the investigator, upon
             bimanual pelvic and breast examinations, at screening (provision of previous
             gynecological examination documentation may be accepted)

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within the normal reference range for the
             population or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged
             to be not clinically significant by the investigator

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures and restrictions

             from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product, or are concurrently
             enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or
             medically compatible with this study

          -  Have known allergies to Ortho-Cyclen, dulaglutide, or to related compounds or to any

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study

          -  Have an abnormal blood pressure (BP) (after at least 5 minutes sitting) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the
