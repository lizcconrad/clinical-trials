  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents receive anticipatory guidance
      about how to discipline their children as part of the well child visit. However, physicians
      provide counseling only 25-40% of the time. In regard to the type of discipline, the AAP
      recommends that primary care providers encourage parent to use non-physical forms of
      discipline and discourage parents from using physical punishment. Educational resources are
      needed to help physicians routinely provide these important anticipatory guidance messages.
      In this study, consecutive parents were exposed to routine anticipatory guidance messages
      before the well child visit with the physician. After the clinic visit, parents were invited
      to participate in a research study to assess their attitudes about physical punishment and
      other discipline strategies. The key research question of this study is: Can a brief
      multimedia program (i.e. Play Nicely program) affect parents' attitudes about the use of
      physical punishment? The time frame of the study was June through August of 2010. Data was
      collected immediately after the clinic visit and 2-4 weeks post clinic visit.

      Note: Because of a poor follow up rate with the 2-4 week phone call, this effort to collect
      follow up data was unsuccessful.

    <description>After the clinic visit, parents were invited to participate in a 2 minute survey which included the ATS scale, a 10 item scale that is associated with parents' actual use of physical punishment. Data was obtained from the parent immediately after the clinic visit while the parent was in the clinic. We attempted a follow up phone call 2-4 weeks post clinic visit. However, due to a poor follow up rate, this data will not be reported nor will it be compared to the data that was collected immediately post clinic visit.</description>
