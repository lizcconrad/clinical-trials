  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It can be difficult to obtain the perspective of patients who have had bowel surgery. This
      study is being done because the investigators are trying to find out whether patient-reported
      outcomes, (results reported to investigators by the patient), on a regular basis, will help
      the investigators provide better patient care and symptom management.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible and if it is useful to
      their medical care for patients who have had bowel surgery to complete surveys about their
      symptoms on a regular basis. In this study the surveys are completed from home, by web or by
      telephone, every month for 6 months. The results of this study will guide the design of large
      research studies on cancer-related bowel function.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a bowel function questionnaire for patients with
      colorectal cancer. The questionnaire will be used in future clinical trials to assess bowel
      function.

    <description>we define feasibility as being the completion of 4/6 surveys. A complete survey is defined as having responses to 17/24 items (70%) on the survey. The administration mode will be deemed feasible if &gt;=70% of patients complete 4/6 surveys.</description>

    <description>IVRS: An interactive voice response system (IVRS) is an automated telephone platform. The IVRS system will allow the participant to complete the survey when they receive the call and/or to call the system within the survey window to complete the survey. In each group, administration of a survey including the BFI, PRO-CTCAE sexual function items, and QOL LASA and in each group, the survey will be conducted once a month over a six-month period. The intervention will be an email alert to study personnel (EASP). Patients randomized to EASP will receive a phone call if their bowel function by the clinical office nurse if the study personnel determine that the patient's BFI, as reported on the monthly survey, is less than 53 (lowest quartile scores). Interventions that may occur include dietary and/or medication advice at the discretion of the office staff.</description>
