    <description>Comparisons between dabigatran trough plasma levels as predicted by simulations to those observed in the study are performed to validate the dosing algorithm for Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) .
Despite the primary endpoint only being assessed in patients who received dabigatran etexilate, Warfarin was included as a comparator treatment in this study in order to facilitate informal comparisons of outcome events, and to look for efficacy signals in this previously unexplored population.</description>
