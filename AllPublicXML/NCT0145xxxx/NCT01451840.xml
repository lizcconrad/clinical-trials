  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effects of alkalinized lidocaine in the endotracheal
      tube cuff to a bolus dose of remifentanil given prior to the emergence of anesthesia:

        -  on the incidence of perioperative coughing

        -  on the time needed for the emergence of a desflurane-based anesthesia

        -  on the incidence of sore throat after extubation.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of alkalinized lidocaine in the endotracheal
      tube cuff will reduce the incidence of perioperative coughing after a desflurane-based
      anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence is an important period of general anesthesia during which several problems can
      occur. Coughing, hypertension, tachycardia and agitation have been observed during emergence
      of general anesthesia.

      Desflurane is a newer volatile agent allowing early recovery from anesthesia. This agent has
      led to earlier discharge and more rapid resumption of normal activities after surgery.
      However, an incidence of coughing around 70% has been reported after a desflurane-based
      anesthesia. Different techniques and drugs have been studied to reduce coughing during
      emergence.

      Among others, the role of lidocaine given intravenously, topically, or intracuff has been
      studied. The use of intracuff alkalinized lidocaine has been proven effective to reduce the
      incidence of coughing during emergence of anesthesia.

      Furthermore, there is some evidence supporting the administration of intravenous opioids
      prior to emergence of general anesthesia to reduce perioperative coughing, agitation and
      hemodynamic stimulation. However, depending on the type of opioids given, this may delay the
      emergence from anesthesia. The effect of a remifentanil infusion given in combination with
      isoflurane as the volatile agent has been shown to reduce the incidence of perioperative
      coughing without delaying the emergence of anesthesia. Bolus doses of remifentanil have also
      been proven effective to reduce the hemodynamic response to extubation.

      The effect of these two modalities (alkalinized lidocaine and remifentanil) have never been
      compared. This study will assess their efficacy to prevent perioperative coughing after a
      desflurane-based anesthesia.
