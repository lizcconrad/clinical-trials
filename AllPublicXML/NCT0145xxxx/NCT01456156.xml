  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is difficult when the tumor is adjacent to the big vessels of the liver and some
      patients can not receive radical resection. Such patients have high risk of recurrence. Tumor
      resection and postoperative radiation is an option for such patients to achieve radical
      treatment and radiation may reduce local recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with risk factors of recurrence receive postoperative radiotherapy using intensive
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT).
      The clinical target volume includes tumor bed. The dose will be 50-60Gy/25-30f. Overall
      survival, local-recurrence free survival, disease free survival and toxicity need be
      observed.
