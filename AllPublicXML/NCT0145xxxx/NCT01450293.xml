  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants in malaria-endemic regions of Africa are an important target for vaccination against
      malaria in view of the enormous disease burden of malaria in this population. The purpose of
      this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVA ME-TRAP and AdCH63 ME-TRAP
      candidate vaccines in healthy children in a malaria endemic region. The regimen proposed here
      has protected non-immune volunteers in Oxford against sporozoite challenge, and so may be
      protective against naturally acquired infection in the Gambia. Administration of AdCh63
      ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP to infants in this study will occur at intervals of at least two
      weeks from the administration of routine infant immunisations, given according to the Gambian
      EPI.
