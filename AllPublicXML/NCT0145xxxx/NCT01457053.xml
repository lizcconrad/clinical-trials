  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of
      ultrafiltration treatment with standard intravenous (in your vein) diuretic therapy
      (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) on your heart function and blood flow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care to treat congestive heart failure is with a class of medication called
      diuretics, which remove the extra fluid from the body through urination. Another way to
      remove extra fluid in patients with heart failure is called ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration
      may result in more rapid removal of excess fluid and more rapid improvement in your symptoms
      compared to standard diuretic treatment. Currently, it is unknown what effects these
      therapies (diuretics or ultrafiltration) have on the small blood vessels in your heart. These
      small blood vessels are important to supply blood and oxygen to your failing heart. Thus, the
      purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of ultrafiltration
      treatment with standard intravenous (in your vein) diuretic therapy on your heart function
      and blood flow.

Subjects will be randomized with a computer generated random number function to either ultrafiltration or diuretic therapy within 24 hours of hospitalization for the management of fluid overload.
Patients randomized to diuretic therapy will be treated with intravenous loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide).

          <title>Ultrafiltration</title>
          <description>Patients with acute decompensated heart failure will be randomized to either ultrafiltration or diuretics. The myocardial blood flow of patients treated with ultrafiltration will be actively compared to diuretic therapy.
Ultrafiltration: Subjects will be randomized with a computer generated random number function to either ultrafiltration or diuretic therapy within 24 hours of hospitalization or outpatient heart failure clinic for the management of fluid overload. If randomized to the ultrafiltration arm, on admission to the hospital patients will be initiated on ultrafiltration therapy for 2-5 days.
Patients randomized to UF will be treated using the Aquadex System 100 ultrafiltration device (CHF Solutions, Minneapolis, MN). The selection of ultrafiltration rate (fluid removal rate)will be determined by the treating physicians based upon clinical assessment of volume status and perceived safety.</description>

          <title>Diuretic Therapy</title>
          <description>Patients with acute decompensated heart failure will be randomized to either ultrafiltration or diuretic therapy. The myocardial blood flow of patients treated with ultrafiltration will be actively compared to diuretic therapy.
Loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide): Patients with ADHF and hypervolemia will be enrolled in a prospective, randomized fashion.
Subjects will be randomized with a computer generated random number function to either ultrafiltration or diuretic therapy within 24 hours of hospitalization for the management of fluid overload.
Patients randomized to diuretic therapy will be treated with intravenous loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide). The selection of diuretic, dose and frequency of diuretic administration will be determined by the treating physicians based upon clinical assessment of volume status, response to medication, and perceived safety.</description>
