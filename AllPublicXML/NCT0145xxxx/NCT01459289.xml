  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of HPV testing in cervical screening has raised concerns about the effect of a
      positive HPV result on women's psychological well being. This is a nested psychosocial study
      of the COCY trial (IRB No. UW 09-377; PI: Prof Hextan Ngan), with the aim to evaluate the
      psychosocial impact of HPV positivity on Hong Kong Chinese women and the modulating effects
      of educational intervention on such impact. Potential participants are identified among those
      who have joint the COCY trial. Participants will be randomized into two groups, namely the
      control group or intervention group. The control group participants will receive their smear
      results and an HPV leaflet by post. The intervention group will receive the leaflet and a
      counseling session on HPV. Self-administered questionnaires will be used to assess
      participants' psychological condition at the receipt of the smear results and at two months
      afterward. It is hypothesized that the level of emotional distress measured at smear result
      notification will be greater than that at two months afterward for all participants.
      Furthermore, participants in the intervention group will have lower psychological distress
      than those in the control group at two months after the receipt of their smear results.
