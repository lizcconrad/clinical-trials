  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if door-to-door is more effective than community
      gathering in providing voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) in communities in rural
      Lesotho. The voluntary HIV counseling and testing will be proposed as an integrated part of a
      package of proposed services. The package consists of: Blood-pressure measurement,
      blood-glucose measurement, Body-mass-index (adults), weight for height (children), catch-up
      vaccinations, deworming (children) Vitamin A (children &amp; young women), family planning for
      eligible women, Tuberculosis screening and HIV counseling and testing.

      12 health centers (clusters) in rural Lesotho are matched according to their routine
      performance in VCT and enrollment into chronic HIV/AIDS care (average numbers tested positive
      and enrolled into HIV/AIDS care per month per facility). After matching, 6 health centers are
      randomly assigned to perform door-to-door VCT, whereas the others perform the traditional
      community gathering approach (called &quot;pitso&quot; in Sesotho). Within the catchment area of each
      health center five campaigns in five different, randomly selected villages, are held (one day
      VCT campaign per village). Within each cluster another five villages are randomly selected
      who do not get a particular campaign and serve as a control for each cluster. In each matched
      cluster-pair, both health centers conduct the five campaigns during the same week (one
      conducting it as door-to-door, the other one conducting it through &quot;pitsos&quot; (community
      gathering)).

      Both approaches receive the same resources in terms of finances, time spending doing the
      VCT-campaign and human resources.
