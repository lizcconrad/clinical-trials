    <textblock>
      Anesthesia for cesarean section has been a great challenge for the anesthesiologist, for
      mother and fetus are closely related. So the challenge is to anesthetize the mother without
      interfering with the physiology of the fetus. The spinal block, although safe, are not free
      of complications if not treated properly, may be responsible for increased fetal morbidity.
      Among the major side effects, there is hypotension, with potentially serious consequences for
      the maternal-fetal dyad. Hypotension in pregnant women at low risk may not lead to major
      damage, but a pregnant woman with low reserves, as is the case of pregnant women with
      pre-eclampsia, any drop in blood pressure of the mother can bring harm to the welfare of
      mother and fetus. Based on the above, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of
      maternal and perinatal treatment of hypotension with ephedrine or metaraminol in pregnant
      women with severe preeclampsia undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. There
      will be a randomized, double-blind, which will be included pregnant women with severe
      preeclampsia with indication of cesarean section, gestational age above 34 weeks gestation
      and only.Will be Excluded women with hemorrhagic syndromes of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome,
      eclampsia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, fetal distress and absolute
      contraindications to spinal anesthesia.

      All patients are fully informed of the research objectives and will only be included in the
      study if they agree to participate and sign the Instrument of Consent. The project was
      designed following the recommendations of Resolution 196/96 of the National Health and the
      Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects (2000). In addition, the
      project was submitted to the Ethics Committee in Research of the Institute of Integrative
      Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira, is approved. The study will be conducted from June 2011
      to July 2012. The study variables are: consumption of metaraminol and ephedrine before and
      after birth, the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, incidence of maternal hypotension, the
      occurrence of reactive hypertension, occurrence of bradycardia, pH of umbilical cord, Apgar
      score 5 minutes, need for face mask ventilation and ICU admission.

      Ephedrine, a long time was considered the safest drug for both mother and fetus during the
      treatment of hypotension in Caesarean section. However, recent evidence shows that contrary
      to what was thought, ephedrine appears to increase fetal metabolism, decreasing the pH and
      excess base.

      Recently, phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of hypotension during cesarean
      delivery with better results in relation to acid-base parameters in umbilical cord blood.
      However, few data are available on the use of phenylephrine in high-risk pregnancy, the
      majority of studies in healthy pregnant women for elective caesarean section.

      Although little scientific evidence regarding the use of metaraminol for treatment of
      hypotension in Caesarean section, recent study demonstrated superiority of this drug compared
      to ephedrine, checking a lower incidence of neonatal acidosis and better control of blood
      pressure. The researchers also found differences in blood gases from the umbilical cord
      between the ephedrine and metaraminol groups larger than those already found in previous
      studies comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine.

      The pathophysiological changes in patients with pre-eclampsia can lead to intrauterine growth
      restriction with chronic fetal distress, due to the limited uteroplacental flow, which, in
      certain situations, may be reduced by 50% to 70%. Added to this, spinal anesthesia may cause
      sudden hypotension and fetal acidosis more often, even in elective operations, compared to
      epidural or general anesthesia, and that these changes may not have clinical significance in
      healthy fetuses at term, but may be critical in situations where arterial insufficiency
      uteroplacental and fetal distress already to present. It is believed, therefore, important
      that treat or prevent hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia under spinal
      anesthesia.

      Prevention of hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia does not require large amounts
      of intravenous fluids, but careful prophylaxis of postural hypotensive syndrome. Despite the
      care, if hypotension occurs, aggressive treatment is mandatory in these patients and fast in
      order to avoid worsening fetal distress and neonatal depression. Such patients are more
      sensitive to vasopressors, therefore, small doses should be administered.

      However, the biggest challenge of the anesthesiologist is to determine the ideal vasopressor
      in pregnant women at high risk, able to adequately restore blood pressure levels without
      determining deterioration of fetal status.

      30 Reynolds and Seed in 2005 showed that ephedrine, administered in large doses, has
      contributed to the adverse effects of spinal anesthesia (greater degree of fetal metabolic
      acidosis), supporting the idea that ephedrine is not the vasopressor of choice for treatment
      of maternal hypotension during cesarean section.

      As a result, this study is to fill this knowledge gap, taking on great importance to evaluate
      maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia to receive
      ephedrine or metaraminol for treatment of maternal hypotension during caesarean section under
      spinal anesthesia. Considering the importance of creating a protocol, since the metaraminol,
      unlike phenylephrine, is widely available at our facility.
