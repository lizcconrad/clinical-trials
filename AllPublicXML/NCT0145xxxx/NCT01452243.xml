      The first objective is to determine the efficacy of calcium and vitamin D supplementation at
      doses of 1200 mg and 800 IU, respectively, to reduce the incidence of falls and fractures in
      non-institutionalized elderly people.

      The second objective is to measure and compare treatment groups (calcium and vitamin D vs
      placebo) as regards muscle strength and musculoskeletal function, bone mineral density,
      calcidiol level and treatment safety.

      Background:

      There are many studies that associate vitamin D serum levels in older persons with muscle
      strength, physical performance and risk of fractures and falls. However, current evidence is
      insufficient to make a general recommendation for administrating calcium and vitamin D to
      older persons. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of calcium and
      vitamin D supplementation in improving musculoskeletal function and decreasing the number of
      falls in person aged over 65 years.

      Design:

      Phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      already marketed drugs in a new indication. It will be performed at Primary Care doctor
      visits at several Healthcare Centers in different Spanish Health Areas. A total of 704
      non-institutionalized subjects aged 65 years or older will be studied (sample size calculated
      for a statistical power of 80%, alpha error 0.05, annual incidence of falls 30% and expected
      reduction of 30% to 20% and expected loss to follow up of 20%). The test drug containing 800
      IU of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium will be administered daily. The control group will
      receive a placebo. The subjects will be followed up over two years. The primary variable will
      be the incidence of spontaneous falls. The secondary variables will include: consequences of
      the falls (fractures, need for hospitalization), change in calcidiol plasma levels and other
      analytical determinations (transaminases, PTH, calcium/phosphorous, albumin, creatinine,
      etc.), change in bone mass by densitometry, change in muscle strength in the dominant hand
      and change in musculoskeletal strength, risk factors for falls, treatment compliance, adverse
      effects and socio-demographic data.

    <description>By the timed up and go test (the elderly person gets up from a chair with arms, walks three meters, turns round, walks back and sits down again). Taking more than 20 seconds indicates a high risk for falls.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is considered as any untoward medical occurrence in any patient included in the study which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>
