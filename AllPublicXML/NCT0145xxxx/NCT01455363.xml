  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test the hypothesis and to proof thank to laser speckle contrast
      imaging that post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) can be induced through a tumor, in this
      case, through a basal cell carcinoma, which will be used as a model of study of tumor
      vasculature.

      This new concept of tumor perfusion artificial increase could be used in the future for
      malignant tumors treatment, in order to increase tumor mean oxygen partial pressure (thus
      decreasing tumor hypoxia, hallmark of malignant tumors) during cancerology therapies, like
      radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, and increase their efficacy.

      This clinical trial will use skin flap model for trunk and facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
      with respect the classical excision margin of BCC surgery (3-4mm): after local anesthesia, a
      little random pattern skin flap will be raised around the BCC, then the cutaneous pedicle
      will be clamped with surgical clamp for 3 minutes and clamp released.

      In case of limb BCC, limb tourniquet will be used, and occluded during 3 minutes upstream to
      the BCC location.

      During all steps of experimentation, laser speckle imaging will be used to measure
      continuously the peri-tumoral and tumoral perfusion, start from tumor excision, up to10
      minutes after tumor pedicle clamp or tourniquet release.
