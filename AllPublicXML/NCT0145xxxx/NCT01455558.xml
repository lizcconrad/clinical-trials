        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 19 and 55 and within 20% of

          -  Female subjects showing positive results on a serum pregnancy test before the study,
             and those who were of childbearing potential agreed to use one of the following
             medically accepted methods of contraception during the entire period of the study:
             abstinence, documented tubal ligation at least 1 year before enrollment in the study,
             documented placement of an intrauterine device with a proven failure rate of &lt;1% per

             urinalysis) or ECG tests;

          -  Use of prescription drugs in the 14 days immediately prior to starting the study that
             had the potential to interact with the study medication;

          -  Use of any substance that could induce CYP3A4 synthesis (eg, St. John's wort, other
