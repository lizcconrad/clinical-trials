  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to characterize the safety and toxicity of DKN-01 by determining
      a maximum-tolerated dose and associated dose limiting toxicity. To evaluate the
      pharmacodynamic response in patients with cancer. To characterize the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of DKN-01 in cancer patients who are intolerant to standard/approved therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of this trial consists of 4 treatment arms of DKN-01. It is a dose escalation study in
      patients with multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors. Patients must be refractory or
      intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). At each dose level, 3 subjects will be
      treated. If none of the 3 subjects develop a dose limiting toxicity after a minimum of 4
      weeks of treatment, subsequent dose escalation will proceed according to the same schedule.
      Part B consists of dose confirmation in patients with NSCLC. Patients must be refractory or
      intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). Approximately 15 patients may be enrolled
      in Part B.

    <description>DKN-01: DKN-01 was administered intravenously (IV) once a week over a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours for dose levels of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. At the 600 mg dose level, DKN-01 was administered by IV on days 1 and 15 of each cycle.
PART A - Dose Escalation: Study group of 3 participants were treated with a 28 day cycle of DKN-01 at an assigned dose level until disease progression. Dose escalation occurred sequentially over the doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg until the criteria for reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were met or the highest planned dose study group was completed. Cycle 1 defined the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period that governs dose escalation. The dose escalation method was guided by the incidence of DLTs during the first cycle.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Eight sites in the United States participated in the study and 7 of them enrolled patients. The Date of First Enrollment was 16 Jan 2012, and the Date of Last Completed was 06 Dec 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Part A enrolled patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors. A dose escalation procedure was followed. Part B enrolled patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Following screening (up to 28 days prior to first treatment) if entry criterion was met, patients were eligible for enrollment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>75 Milligram (mg) DKN-01 Part A (QW)</title>
          <description>DKN-01: DKN-01 was administered intravenously (IV) once a week over a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours for dose levels of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. At the 600 mg dose level, DKN-01 was administered by IV on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. PART A - Dose Escalation: Study group of 3 participants were treated with a 28 day cycle of DKN-01 at an assigned dose level until disease progression. Dose escalation occurred sequentially over the doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg until the criteria for reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were met or the highest planned dose study group was completed. Cycle 1 defined the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period that governs dose escalation. The dose escalation method was guided by the incidence of DLTs during the first cycle.</description>

At the 600 mg dose level, DKN-01 was administered by IV on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. PART A - Dose Escalation: Study group of 3 participants were treated with a 28 day cycle of DKN-01 at an assigned dose level until disease progression. Dose escalation occurred sequentially over the doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg until the criteria for reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were met or the highest planned dose study group was completed. Cycle 1 defined the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period that governs dose escalation. The dose escalation method was guided by the incidence of DLTs during the first cycle.</description>

      <desc>Safety analyses were based on the full analysis set (FAS), which was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment during Part A or Part B of the study. Assessments up to 30 days after the date of last dose of study medication (for serious adverse events and unresolved study drug-related AEs) were included.</desc>

          <title>75 Milligram (mg) DKN-01 Part A</title>
          <description>DKN-01: DKN-01 was administered intravenously (IV) once a week over a minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 2 hours for dose levels of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. At the 600 mg dose level, DKN-01 was administered by IV on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. PART A - Dose Escalation: Study group of 3 participants were treated with a 28 day cycle of DKN-01 at an assigned dose level until disease progression. Dose escalation occurred sequentially over the doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg until the criteria for reaching the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were met or the highest planned dose study group was completed. Cycle 1 defined the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period that governs dose escalation. The dose escalation method was guided by the incidence of DLTs during the first cycle.</description>
