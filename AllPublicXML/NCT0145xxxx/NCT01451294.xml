  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the recommended treatment for symptomatic high degree
      stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). ICA obstruction is often associated with an
      impaired cerebral autoregulation, implicating that cerebral perfusion pressure becomes
      dependent on systemic blood pressure. Therefore, to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure in
      this type of patients intraoperative hypotension needs to be avoided. Different short-acting
      agents such as phenylephrine, (a drug with vasoconstrictive properties), or ephedrine (a drug
      with vasoconstrictive properties combined with an increase in heart rate) can be used to
      correct intra-operative hypotension. In healthy subjects these agents affect the cerebral
      perfusion differently despite an identical effect on the systemic blood pressure. Cerebral
      perfusion decreases after phenylephrine administration while it is preserved after the use of
      ephedrine. The optimal agent for correcting hypotension in CEA patients, and thus in a
      situation of an impaired cerebral autoregulation, is unknown.

      Therefore, the investigators propose to perform a prospective study observing the effect of
      phenylephrine and ephedrine on cerebral perfusion to make a recommendation regarding the use
      of either phenylephrine or ephedrine during CEA.
