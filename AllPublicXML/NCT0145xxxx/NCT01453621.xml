  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blunt head trauma (BHT) accounts for &gt;450,000 emergency department (ED) visits for children
      annually in the US. Fortunately, &gt;95% of head trauma in children is minor in nature. Although
      most children have minor head trauma, clinicians obtain cranial CTs in 35-50% of these
      children, which carries a radiation risk of malignancy. Recently, the investigators conducted
      a study of 44,000 children in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN)
      in which the investigators developed and validated clinical prediction rules that identify
      which children with minor BHT are at very low risk of having clinically-important traumatic
      brain injuries (TBI) and, therefore, do not require a CT scan. In this proposal, the
      investigators aim to assess whether implementing the PECARN TBI prediction rules (one for
      preverbal, one for verbal children) via computerized clinical decision support (CDS)
      decreases the number of (unnecessary) cranial CT scans obtained by ED physicians for children
      with minor BHT at very low risk of clinically-important TBIs. After a two-site pilot phase to
      test and refine the CDS, the investigators will conduct a seven-center prospective trial. The
      investigators will measure cranial CT use prior to and after the intervention implementation
      of CDS and clinician education. The investigators will study the use of CT by practitioners
      for children &lt;18 years for 12 months pre- and post-intervention.

        Clinicians:

        Our target study population includes clinicians with training in pediatrics (particularly
        pediatric emergency medicine)or general emergency medicine. As clinical practice is likely
        to vary among physicians with different training and in different settings, we will include
        two types of sites for this trial:

          1. Pediatric emergency departments with &gt;80% of children cared for by pediatric emergency
             medicine physicians or general pediatricians.

          2. General emergency departments with &gt;80% of children cared for by general emergency
             medicine physicians.

        Patients:

        Inclusion:

          -  children younger than 18 years who

          -  sustained minor blunt blunt head trauma defined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of
             14 or 15 on initial ED evaluation

        Exclusion:

        Patients who have any of the following:

          -  blunt head trauma &gt; 24 hours prior

          -  penetrating trauma

          -  brain tumors

          -  coagulopathy

          -  ventriculoperitoneal shunts

          -  preexisting neurological disorders complicating assessment

          -  neuroimaging obtained at an outside hospital before transfer to a study site
