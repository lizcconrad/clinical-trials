      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving pemetrexed disodium and
      sorafenib tosylate together in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Pemetrexed
      disodium and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib tosylate may also stop the growth of solid tumors
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving pemetrexed disodium together with sorafenib
      tosylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine doses for the combination of pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) with sorafenib
      (sorafenib tosylate) appropriate for Phase II study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of the combination of pemetrexed and
      sorafenib.

      II. To observe antitumor effects of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium and sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 2 weeks and sorafenib
      tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
