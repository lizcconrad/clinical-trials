  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative sore throat, cough, and hoarseness of voice are common, uncomfortable,
      distressing sequelae after tracheal intubation. It was postulated that these effects are
      because of irritation and inflammation of the airway. Bimanual laryngoscopy is known to
      improve visual field during intubation. This procedure might reduce laryngeal trauma during
      intubation and therefore reduce the incidence or degree of post-operative sore throat. This
      is the first prospective, double-blinded, controlled study, which is focused on the effects
      of bimanual laryngoscopy on first 24-houred post-operative sore throat (POST).
