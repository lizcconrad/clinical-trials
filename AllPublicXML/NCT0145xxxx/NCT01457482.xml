  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Earlier research has shown that pregnant women with a pronounced fear of childbirth have a
      significantly increased risk for birth complications and subsequent psychological trauma. In
      Sweden and also internationally, women in fear of childbirth are treated in many differing
      ways. Evidence for best care for these women is lacking. The Art Therapy method is a
      creative, psycho-therapeutic form of treatment which has been used for several decades within
      psychiatry. It has recently been seen that the Art Therapy method has positive effects during
      treatment for crisis reactions.

      Recruitment has recently been initiated for a randomized controlled study of Art Therapy for
      the treatment of fear of childbirth.

      The hypothesis for the study is as follows:

      H1 = treatment with Art Therapy and therapeutic conversations will result in a decrease in
      fear of childbirth when compared to treatment by therapeutic conversations only.

      The instrument which is to be used for measurement of childbirth fear is the Wijma Delivery
      Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ). This is a well validated instrument which was developed in
      Sweden. A power calculation has shown a need for 62 x 2 participants; a total of 124 women.
