  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study conforms to a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over
      design.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effect of three probiotics (Lactobacillus
      plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104448, and Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104450) on
      intestinal epithelial permeability and the immune system, in at least 8 healthy subject.

      The effect of the three different probiotics and a placebo will be assessed on every subject
      in random sequence.

      Prior to the start of a 7-days supplementation period (one of the three probiotic supplements
      or placebo), blood samples will be obtained and small intestinal permeability will be
      assessed by measuring the urinary extraction ratios of ingested water-soluble, non-degradable
      test probes, with and without indomethacin challenge (to compromise the gut). After each
      supplementation period the gut will be stressed again by the indomethacin protocol, followed
      by measurement of small intestinal permeability, whereupon blood samples will be taken and
      duodenal tissue samples will be obtained by standard gastroduodenoscopy. Each supplementation
      period will start 1 month after finishing the pervious test episode, in randomized sequence.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum
      WCFS1, Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104448, and Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104450 on intestinal
      epithelial permeability. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects on immune modulation,
      gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, small intestine epithelial gene
      regulation and tight junction proteins modulation, infiltration of immune cells in intestinal
      mucosa and immune markers in blood plasma.

      The investigators hypothesize that Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus plantarum
      CIP104448, and Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104450 will, each separately, significantly affect
      the innate immune system and intestinal permeability in humans.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sugar recovery in urine, as indicator of intestinal permeability, after seven days probiotics supplementation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Permeability will be assessed at baseline (3 days before supplementation), at baseline after indomethacin administration (1 day before supplementation) and after the 7-days probiotics supplementation period (again after indomethacin administration).</time_frame>
    <description>The barrier function test is based on a comparison of intestinal permeation of a larger molecule with that of a smaller molecule. The subject will ingest a sugar drink containing sucrose, lactulose, L-rhamnose, sucralose and erythritol after an overnight fast. All sugar probes are accepted and validated parameters of integrity of the intestinal barrier, and proved an accurate estimation of mucosal damage.
Urine samples will be obtained to measure sugar recovery. The sugar molecules will be determined by fluorescent detection high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences of measurements in duodenal biopsy specimens between the separate arms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Duodenal biopsy specimens will be obtained at the end of each probiotics supplementation period (one day after the seven day supplementation).</time_frame>

    <description>Al study subjects will in randomized sequence participate in this arm (7-days supplementation period of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1).
Each arm represents a 7-days supplementation period (with probiotics or placebo). The 7-days supplementation period will be followed by a month washout time after which the next supplementation period with another probiotic (or placebo) will start. The sequence is randomized and double blind. The different measurements will be performed at baseline and after each supplementation period.</description>

    <description>Bacterial supplements (Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104448, and Lactobacillus plantarum CIP104450) will be prepared in the food-grade pilot plant of NIZO food research. Exactly 1x10^11 life bacteria are consumed by each participant.
Consumption of this amount of life bacteria is in line with earlier human studies and routinely reached by the consumption of dairy. As a placebo, the same drink will be used without addition of bacterial cells.</description>
