      The drug diphenylcyclopropenone, or DPCP, modifies the immune system and has been shown to be
      effective in treating certain kinds of cancer. This study hopes to improve our understanding

    <textblock>
      The immune system is the primary line of defense against infections and other things
      perceived as foreign to the body. Unfortunately, this immune system often fails to eliminate
      tumors or other cancerous growths. The drug diphenylcyclopropenone, or DPCP, modifies the
      immune system and has been shown to be effective in treating certain kinds of cancer. This
      study hopes to improve our understanding of how this drug helps create an effective immune
      response. In order to reach this goal, normal volunteers will be given the DPCP drug in the
      form of a gel or a placebo gel (gel without the active chemical) on a few small areas of
      skin. Then, biopsies will be taken of the skin at the sites where the active drug was placed.
      Also, small biopsies will be taken from opposite areas of skin which received placebo gel to
      serve as controls. The biopsied skin samples will then be studied by methods such as
      immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis which will help define the immune reaction
      caused by DPCP. The rationale for the study is to better understand how the immune system can
      be activated to produce cells that may fight infections or cancers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant female between 18 and 60 years of age

          -  Able to give verbal and written informed consent

          -  For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or in men whose partners may become
             pregnant, willingness to use an acceptable method of contraception to prevent
             pregnancy for the duration of the study (while receiving study medication and for one
             month following the last dose of study medication). Acceptable forms of contraception
             are listed in the protocol.

          -  Must have a negative urine pregnancy test (for WOCBP)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects taking any of the following systemic or topical therapies within 4 weeks of
             enrollment: corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or any other medications that may
             affect the outcome of the study

          -  Known sensitivity to bandage or adhesive tape.

          -  Subjects who have active localized or systemic medical conditions that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would preclude or make unsafe their participation in the study

          -  Subjects with any underlying concomitant diagnosis that may influence immune reactions
             (e.g. eczema, psoriasis, lupus)

          -  Subjects who are nursing mothers, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant at anytime
             during the course of the study or within 30 days of study completion

          -  Subjects who are unable to comply with study procedures, communicate effectively,
             cooperate with the investigator, or are unable to understand the study

          -  Subjects who have been treated with another investigational device or drug within 30
             days of enrollment

          -  HIV positive as determined by self-reported history and/or a HIV POCT at screening

          -  History, physical, social or lab findings suggestive of any medical or psychological
             condition that would, in the opinion of the PI, make the candidate ineligible for the
             study
