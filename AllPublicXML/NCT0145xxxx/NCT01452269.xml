  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Deaf Weight Wise study is to test a 16 week, evidence-based, comprehensive
      program to change obesity-related health behaviors in Deaf people who use American Sign
      Language (ASL) as their primary language.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms - immediate intervention or delayed
      intervention. In addition to the intervention activities, participants will also take part in
      five study visits over the course of two years. At these study visits, the investigators will
      administer several surveys as well as conduct biometric assessments.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that the immediate intervention group will increase
      their levels of physical activity and reduce their caloric intake and body weight immediately
      following the intervention, compared to the delayed intervention group.

    <description>We measured the mean change in weight for the immediate and delayed groups, from baseline to 6 months (post-intervention for the immediate group; no intervention yet for the delayed group). We used intention to treat analyses, with any missing values carried forward from baseline to the 6-month data point.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dietary Risk Assessment (DRA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We measured the mean change in DRA score for the immediate and delayed groups, from baseline to 6 months (post-intervention for the immediate group; no intervention yet for the delayed group). We used intention to treat analyses, with any missing values carried forward from baseline to the 6-month data point. DRA scores range from 0-96; lower scores are better (improved dietary quality).</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Activity Assessment (PAA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We measured the mean change in the moderate PAA scoare for the immediate and delayed groups, from baseline to 6 months (post-intervention for the immediate group; no intervention yet for the delayed group). We used intention to treat analyses, with any missing values carried forward from baseline to the 6-month data point. PAA moderate activity scores range from 0-27; higher scores are better (more physical activity).</description>

    <description>Groups will consist of approximately 13 subjects who meet for 2 hours a week for 16 weeks. Group sessions will be offered at a variety of times and days of the week. A trained, deaf, ASL-fluent counselor will lead the sessions.
Subjects will be asked to complete a food and physical activity diary. Each intervention session will include a weigh-in, group sharing/problem solving, discussion of a weight management topic, and goal setting/action planning for the next week. Periodically, each subject will receive a Personal Feedback Report. Subjects will be able to earn points for complying with various aspects of the program. Points can be redeemed for small prizes (i.e. water bottles).
The maintenance phase consists of two meetings at the beginning of the 6-month maintenance period and three months later. This will consist of a weigh-in, review of self-monitored diet and physical activity, problem solving and goal setting/action planning for their long-term program.</description>

            <description>This arm received the Group intervention immediately following baseline data collection. Groups consisted of 4-12 subjects who meet for 2 hours a week for 16 weeks. Group sessions were offered at a variety of times. A trained, deaf, ASL-fluent counselor led the sessions.
Subjects completed a food and physical activity diary. Each intervention session included a weigh-in, group sharing/problem solving, discussion of a weight management topic, and goal setting/action planning for the next week. Subjects received a Personal Feedback Report periodically. Subjects earned points for complying with various aspects of the program. Points were redeemed for small prizes (i.e. water bottles).
The maintenance phase consisted of two meetings at the beginning of the 6-month maintenance period and three months later, and consisted of a weigh-in, review of self-monitored diet and physical activity, problem solving and goal setting/action planning for their long-term program.</description>

          <title>Immediate Intervention Group</title>
          <description>This arm received the Group intervention immediately following baseline data collection. Groups consisted of 4-12 subjects who meet for 2 hours a week for 16 weeks. Group sessions were offered at a variety of times. A trained, deaf, ASL-fluent counselor led the sessions.
Subjects completed a food and physical activity diary. Each intervention session included a weigh-in, group sharing/problem solving, discussion of a weight management topic, and goal setting/action planning for the next week. Subjects received a Personal Feedback Report periodically. Subjects earned points for complying with various aspects of the program. Points were redeemed for small prizes (i.e. water bottles).
The maintenance phase consisted of two meetings at the beginning of the 6-month maintenance period and three months later, and consisted of a weigh-in, review of self-monitored diet and physical activity, problem solving and goal setting/action planning for their long-term program.</description>
