      KI1001(Circadin®, Prolonged release tablet which contains melatonin) has showed its efficacy
      to improve sleep quality in over 55 years old primary insomnia patients. This is a bridging
      study to investigate the efficacy and safety of KI1001(Circadin®) in Korean patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies throughout the world have shown that insomnia is a common complaint that occurs in
      10-50% of the population depending on age, sex and country. Among the wide variety of
      available treatments of sleep disturbances, the most commonly prescribed hypnotics are the
      benzodiazepines (BZD) and non-BZD hypnotics.

      However, these hypnotics were often associated with rebound, dependency, tolerance, higher
      risk of falls mainly in the elderly population, anterograde memory disturbances and increased
      risk for motor accidents the next day.

      In response to the unmet clinical need for a safe and efficacious alternative treatment for
      primary insomnia, that in addition to treating quantitative sleep problems, would improve
      sleep quality and daytime functioning, a clinical development program on melatonin for the
      treatment of primary insomnia was initiated.

      This study is conducted using a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group
      design, after a single-blind placebo period. Primary insomnia patients aged over 55 will be
      screened for entry into the study.

      After placebo run-in period, Patients will enter a 3 weeks double-blind treatment period.

      Primary parameter is quality of sleep, secondary parameters are including getting to sleep,
      awakening from sleep, behavior following wakefulness, quality of day and night, sleep latency
      and quality of life.
