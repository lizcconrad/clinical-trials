  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reflects the responsiveness of the autonomic system to an
      external stimuli. The aim of this system is to maintain homeostasis.The variability implies
      on the interaction between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems to maintain the
      ongoing changes of the autonomic system. Following Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), there can be
      a damage to the Central Nervous System (CNS) function. The damages described in the
      literature are cognitive, motor and behavioural function, while there is less relation to the
      autonomic system. The autonomic system can influence the ability of patient with ABI to
      participate in the rehabilitation program. The aim of this work is to investigate the
      activity of the autonomic system activity as manifested by HRV among patients with ABI in
      different conditions: resting, during activity and while listening to different auditory
      stimuli.
