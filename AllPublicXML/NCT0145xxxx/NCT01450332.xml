    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of implanting the Tavor ACL
      prosthesis in patients with a ruptured ACL by improvement of healing kinetics as well as
      major adverse treatment events (AEs). it is designed to test the hypothesis that there is a
      difference in healing kinetics of ACL deficient knees treated by ACL reconstruction using
      autografts and those in which such procedure was performed with the Tavor prosthesis.
