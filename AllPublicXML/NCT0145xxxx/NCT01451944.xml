  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our program is to evaluate the effect of home health nurse intervention and
      education on hospital admissions, ER utilization and asthma control of Passport asthma
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that case management and in home education by nurses
      will decrease hospitalizations and ER asthma visits and improves disease control in our
      population.

      Our clinic population consists of primarily inner-city, low income, medicaid recipients. This
      population suffers from severe asthma much more than the typical pediatric population. Asthma
      remains the most frequent cause of hospital admission for our patient population. Home health
      nurse asthma education and home visits have been reported to reduce asthma triggers in the
      home and improve asthma control. The unique partnership between the pediatrician and the home
      health nurse will give us a better understanding of the health needs for this population,
      will improve quality of care and deliver more cost effective care.

      Asthma patients age 3-17 enrolled in our clinic who have been seen in the ER, hospital or
      clinic for an asthma exacerbation will be invited to participate. Once enrolled they will
      have a home health nurse visit their home and provide medical assessment, asthma education
      and determine if the patients has all needed medications available. They enrolled patient
      will receive another home visit at 1, 4, and 12 months after enrollment. The medical record
      will be reviewed and ER visits and hospitalizations recorded.
