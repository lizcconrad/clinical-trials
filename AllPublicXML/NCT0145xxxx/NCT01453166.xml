      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brazilian cardioprotective
      diet plan to reduce cardiovascular risk factors of new cardiovascular events.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in both sexes in Brazil and
      worldwide. Modifying risk factors such as diet and lifestyle can prevent most cases of
      cardiovascular disease. This pilot trial is based on specific and traditional brazilian food.
      The objective is to reduce risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure,dyslipidemia and
      diabetes in patients with cardiovascular disease history.
