      Patients with adrenal insufficiency also exhibit an adrenomedullary dysfunction. Furthermore,
      patients who suffer from both, adrenal insufficiency and type I diabetes more frequently
      report hypoglycemia, particularly after strenuous activities. The study investigates the
      counter regulatory hormonal response to physical stress and the impact on cognitive function
      in subjects with and without Addison's disease, type I diabetes and healthy subjects.

      As patients with adrenal insufficiency also exhibit an adrenomedullary dysfunction and
      patients who suffer from both, adrenal insufficiency and type I diabetes more frequently
      report hypoglycemia, particularly after strenuous activities this study investigates the
      counter-regulatory hormonal response to physical stress and the impact on cognitive function
      in subjects with and without Addison's disease, type I diabetes and healthy subjects.
      Patients will perform ergometer training with an individualized intensity and fulfill
      cognitive function testing (stroop test and fatigue inventories) before and after strenuous
      activity.

    <time_frame>testing is performed at first visit (baseline, duration 5 min) and second visit (at least 48 hours after visit1). The second test is performed 5 min after strenous activity of 23 min duration, test duration again 5 min)</time_frame>
    <description>study participants are tested with three standardized tests: stroop-task, symptom rating scale and a short term memory test. First testing is performed at visit 1 at rest, the second test at visit 2 after strenuous activity at a bicycle ergometer.</description>
