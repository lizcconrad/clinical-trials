    <measure>Mean Area-under-the-Curve (AUC) Analysis of Change From Baseline in Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>from surgery baseline (pre-incision) through surgery end (time of cortical clean-up/wound closure)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pupil diameter over time from surgical baseline (immediately prior to surgical incision) to the end of the surgical procedure (wound closure) was summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment arm and time-point (every minute).
The primary analysis of the change in pupil diameter was based on the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) pupil diameter change from baseline. First, the AUC of the pupil diameter from surgical baseline to wound closure was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Second, the mean AUC was obtained by dividing the AUC by the total time of surgery. Third, the mean AUC of change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline pupil diameter from the mean AUC.</description>

    <measure>Mean Area-under-the-Curve Analysis of Ocular Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score Within 12 Hours Postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis of the ocular pain VAS (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) was based on the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC). The AUC of the ocular pain VAS during 12 hours postoperatively was calculated by the trapezoidal rule in which the hour 11 was used to represent the time-point 10-12 hours. The mean AUC was defined as the AUC divided by the number of hours with ocular pain VAS results during the first 12 hours postoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BVCA) Log Score on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) summarized by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity log score. For subjects without a score due to inability to read the ETDRS chart, the log score was imputed as 1.6 for the purpose of treatment comparisons. Subjects without a score because the manifest refraction was not completed were excluded from the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Ocular Inflammation in Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) Grade on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>The mean SOIS summarized by treatment arm and time point on Day 1 postoperatively. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject's anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

        <title>Mean Area-under-the-Curve (AUC) Analysis of Change From Baseline in Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</title>
        <description>Change in pupil diameter over time from surgical baseline (immediately prior to surgical incision) to the end of the surgical procedure (wound closure) was summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment arm and time-point (every minute).
The primary analysis of the change in pupil diameter was based on the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) pupil diameter change from baseline. First, the AUC of the pupil diameter from surgical baseline to wound closure was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Second, the mean AUC was obtained by dividing the AUC by the total time of surgery. Third, the mean AUC of change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline pupil diameter from the mean AUC.</description>

        <description>The primary analysis of the ocular pain VAS (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) was based on the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC).

        <title>Ocular Inflammation in Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) Grade on Day 1</title>
        <description>The mean SOIS summarized by treatment arm and time point on Day 1 postoperatively. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>
