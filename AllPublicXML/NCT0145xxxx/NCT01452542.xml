    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the within-subject pharmacokinetic
      (PK) variability and relative bioavailability of single oral 150-mg doses of eliglustat
      administered as the Phase 3 formulation (3x50-mg capsules) and the common blend proposed
      commercial formulation (1x150-mg capsule) in healthy adult subjects, which will be used to
      plan and support the design of a subsequent bioequivalence study.

      This will be a single-site, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-sequence,
      four-period replicated crossover study in healthy adult subjects. The study will comprise a
      screening period, four treatment periods with a 7-day washout between dosing in each period,
      and a safety follow-up visit.

          -  The subject has been a non-smoker for at least 6 months prior to the time of providing
             informed consent, and is willing and able to abstain from smoking (and use of other
             forms of nicotine) until completion of the safety follow-up visit.

          -  The subject has not used drugs of abuse for at least 6 months prior to Day -1 and is

             follow-up visit.

          -  The subject is willing and able to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the
             first dose of study drug until completion of the safety follow-up visit.

          -  The subject is willing and able to abstain from grapefruit or star fruit products for

             (or an indeterminate metabolizer where one allele is known to correspond to
             ultra-rapid metabolism) based on results of CYP2D6 genotyping performed at screening.
             (Note: Prior CYP2D6 genotyping results may be used for the purpose of determining
             study eligibility if a copy of the laboratory report is available and the genotyping
             results can be interpreted with the same classification system used by the study

             constipation, diverticulitis, or irritable bowel syndrome).

          -  The subject has had a GI surgical procedure that might affect drug transit time,
             (e.g., cholecystectomy, GI bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy, or small
             bowel resection).

          -  The subject has any of the following: Clinically significant coronary artery disease

          -  The subject has any other clinically significant organic disease, including
             cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, GI, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, metabolic, or
             psychiatric disease, or other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or

             the first dose of study drug.

          -  The subject has a screening laboratory test result above the upper limit of normal for
             any of the following liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin.

          -  The subject tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis
             C antibody, or hepatitis B surface antigen at screening.
