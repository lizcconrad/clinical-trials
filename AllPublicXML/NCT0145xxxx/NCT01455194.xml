    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ was developed to measure the adequacy of asthma control in clinical research and in clinical practice. It includes 5 questions about symptoms, 1 question about beta 2 -agonist use and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). Participants recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond to each question using a 7-point scale. The items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items and ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled). Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.</description>

    <description>The time course of the incidence of a 0.5 points improvement of ACQ score was evaluated. Mean ACQ values over time by treatment group for on-treatment site measurements was assessed. The time course of asthma control (ACQ) was done on a weekly base using home-based and site-based ACQ measurements. The ACQ was developed to measure the adequacy of asthma control in clinical research and in clinical practice.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AEs included both serious AEs and non-serious AEs. Baseline of double-blind treatment period was defined as the average of the measurements of the last 2 weeks at site prior to first intake of double-blind study medication.</description>

Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.</description>

Percent reversibility is calculated as the difference between highest FEV1 after salbutamol and highest FEV 1 before salbutamol divided by highest FEV 1 before salbutamol.

        <title>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>The ACQ was developed to measure the adequacy of asthma control in clinical research and in clinical practice. It includes 5 questions about symptoms, 1 question about beta 2 -agonist use and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). Participants recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond to each question using a 7-point scale. The items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items and ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled). Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Well-controlled Asthma and ACQ Improvement at the End of the Study</title>
        <description>Well-controlled asthma at the end of the study was defined as a participant with an ACQ score of 0.75 or lower. ACQ improvement was defined as a decrease in ACQ score of at least 0.5. The ACQ was developed to measure the adequacy of asthma control in clinical research and in clinical practice. It includes 5 questions about symptoms, 1 question about beta 2 -agonist use and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). Participants recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond to each question using a 7-point scale. The items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items and ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled). Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Time to First Well-Controlled Asthma Measurement by ACQ Cut-Off Point</title>
        <description>Well-controlled asthma was defined as an ACQ score of equal to or lower than the ACQ cut-off point.The ACQ was developed to measure the adequacy of asthma control in clinical research and in clinical practice. It includes 5 questions about symptoms, 1 question about beta 2 -agonist use and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). Participants recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond to each question using a 7-point scale. The items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items and ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled). Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma.</description>

        <description>The analyses was intended to identify participant’s subsets that would benefit from dose escalation. This analysis tested the potential factors, including age, sex, pretrial inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose category, history of exacerbations, baseline ACQ score, baseline BMI category and smoking status. ACQ includes 5 questions about symptoms, 1 about beta 2 -agonist use and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). Participants recall their experiences during the previous 7 days and respond to each question using a 7-point scale. The items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items and ranges between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled).Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;=1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. As predefined in the protocol, participants with missing data for any category were not included.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AEs included both serious AEs and non-serious AEs. Baseline of double-blind treatment period was defined as the average of the measurements of the last 2 weeks at site prior to first intake of double-blind study medication.</description>
