    <textblock>
      Background: New research criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently
      been developed to enable an early diagnosis of AD pathophysiology by relying on emerging
      biomarkers. To enable efficient allocation of health care resources, evidence is needed to
      support decision makers on the adoption of emerging biomarkers in clinical practice. The
      research goals are to 1) assess the diagnostic test accuracy (of current clinical diagnostic
      work-up and emerging biomarkers in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), 2) perform a cost-consequence analysis and 3)
      assess long-term cost-effectiveness by an economic model.

      Methods/design: In a cohort design 304 consecutive patients suspected of having a primary
      neurodegenerative disease are approached in four academic memory clinics and followed for two
      years. Clinical data and data on quality of life data, costs and emerging biomarkers are
      gathered.

      Diagnostic test accuracy is determined by relating the clinical practice and new research
      criteria diagnoses to the reference diagnosis. The clinical practice diagnosis at baseline is
      reflected by a consensus procedure among experts using clinical information only (no
      biomarkers). The diagnosis based on the new research criteria is reflected by decision rules
      that combine clinical and biomarker information. The reference diagnosis is determined by a
      consensus procedure among experts based on clinical information on the course of symptoms
      over a two-year time period.

      A decision analytic model is build combining available evidence from different resources
      among which (accuracy) results from the study, literature and expert opinion to assess
      long-term cost-effectiveness of the emerging biomarkers.

      Discussion: Several other multi-centre trials study the relative value of new biomarkers for
      early evaluation of AD and related disorders. The uniqueness of this study is the assessment
      of resource utilization and quality of life to enable an economic evaluation. The study
      results are generalizable to a population of patients who are referred to a memory clinic due
      to their memory problems.
