    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to know if the R230C and C230C variants of the ATP-binding
      cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene are associated with a smaller glucose lowering effect
      compared to the wild type allele (R230R) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Specific objectives:

        1. In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles
           (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from
           the treatment with glibenclamide on following continuous variables:

             -  Fasting glucose

             -  Percentage reduction

             -  Hemoglobin A1c,

             -  Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol

             -  Weight

        2. In patients with type 2 diabetes stratified by the existence of the risk alleles
           (R230C/C230C) or the wild variant (R230R) of ABC-A1, compare the changes resulting from
           the treatment with glibenclamide on following binomial variables:

             -  Number of cases that reach fasting plasma glucose lower than 110 mg/dl

             -  Number of cases that reach an HbA1c less than 7%

    <description>Patients in which the fasting glucose persisted above the treatment goal (fasting glucose &lt;126 mg/dl) after a 4 week diet period will receive glyburide. The dose of the medication will be adjusted based on the results of fasting glucose values. At each visit patients will return the leftover tablets; counts of the tablets will be the method for measuring the adherence to treatment. The medical study participants who decided to doses of glibenclamide will not know the allele of ABCA1 gene under study.</description>

    <description>Patients in which the fasting glucose persisted above the treatment goal ( fasting plasma glucose above 126 mg/dl) will receive glyburide. The dose of the medication will be adjusted based on the result of blood glucose using the following table:
Fasting glucose 126 to 140 mg/dl: 2.5 mg/day (half tablet in the morning) 141 to 180 mg/dl: 5 mg/day (a tablet in the morning) 181 220 mg/dl: 7.5 mg/day (a tablet in the morning and half tablet per night) 221 to 250 mg/dl: 10 mg/day (a tablet in the morning) and a tablet in the evening.</description>
