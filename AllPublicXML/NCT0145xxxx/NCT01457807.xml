  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD3241 following multiple administration of 2 new,
      different extended release formulations of tablets of AZD3241 (300 mg), in relation to the
      100 mg extended release tablet used in a previous study and potential food interaction. The
      safety and tolerability of AZD 3241 will also be investigated as a secondary objective. In
      addition to these a number of exploratory objectives will be investigated with blood
      sampling.
