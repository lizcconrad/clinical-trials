    <textblock>
      This trial will try to perform pharmaceutical care on ambulatory elderly diabetes patients.
      To provide appropriate diabetes education administration, identify and resolve drug-related
      problems, assess the appropriateness of their medications, establish the mechanism of
      medication consultations. Each patient will be assessed by the MMSE(Mini-Mental State
      Examination) and GDS(Geriatric Depression Scale). The effectiveness of pharmacist's
      intervention will be assessed by lab data and some questionnaires.
