    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of JNJ-38518168 on the pharmacokinetics
      (how the body handles a drug) of methotrexate in participants with rheumatoid arthritis.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (physician and participant will know the name of the assigned drug),
      multi-center, non-randomized, drug/drug interaction study of JNJ-38518168 in participants
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a stable oral methotrexate (MTX) dose (7.5-25 mg). The
      treatment phase will last 16 days. Participants will be housed in the clinic for dosing and
      study procedures from Day -1 to Day 2 and again from Day 14 to Day 16. Participants
      completing treatment will have a follow-up visit between Days 22 and 25. Participants who
      discontinue the study prematurely will complete the Day 22 to 25 follow-up procedures at the
      time of discontinuation or as soon as possible thereafter. The duration of participation in
      the study for an individual participant will be up to 7 weeks (including screening).
      Participant safety will be monitored. Day 1: A single oral dose of the participant's weekly
      methotrexate dose. Days 2-15: Weekly MTX co-administered with two 50-mg capsules of
      JNJ-38518168, administered daily.
