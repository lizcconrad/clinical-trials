  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of upper respiratory tract
      illnesses as well as more severe lower respiratory illnesses, including bronchiolitis and
      pneumonia. RSV affects almost all children within the first 2 years of life. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immune response to the RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 vaccine among adults,
      RSV-seropositive children, and RSV-seronegative infants and children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response of the RSV MEDI ΔM2-2
      vaccine in the four groups of participants. The study vaccine will be evaluated in adults, in
      RSV-seropositive children, and in a dose-ranging study in two groups of RSV-seronegative
      infants and children.
