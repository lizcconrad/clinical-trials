  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to compare the efficacy and patient tolerability of a preparation
      consisting of 2L Golytely (PEG + electrolytes) plus 15mg of bisacodyl vs the standard
      preparation of 4L Golytely. The investigators hypothesize that 2L Golytely with 15mg
      bisacodyl will show similar bowel cleansing efficacy while offering better tolerability.

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their bowel prep experience (based on ease of use) on a Likert scale. The number of participants in each level will subsequently be quantified (n, %) and compared between the two groups.</description>
