        Inclusion

          1. Be considered in general good health based upon medical and surgical history, vital

          2. Be ≥18 years of age.

          3. Female subjects are eligible if not pregnant, not lactating or not planning to become

             the study.

          4. Male subjects biologically capable of having children must agree to the use of a
             reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study.

          5. Have a clinical diagnosis of one of the following:

               -  OA of the knee or hip for at least one year based on the American College of
                  Rheumatology (ACR) criteria

               -  Moderate to severe CLBP (i.e. pain that occurs in an area with boundaries between
                  the lowest rib and the crease of the buttocks) that 1) must have been present for
                  at least several hours a day for a minimum of 3 months, 2) is not due to a known
                  malignancy, and 3) must be classified as non-neuropathic, neuropathic, or
                  symptomatic for more than 6 months after LBP surgery based on the Quebec Task
                  Force Classification of Spinal Disorders.

          6. Have an average in-clinic pain score of ≥3 on the 11-point (0-10) numerical rating
             scale (NRS) as an average for the last 24 hours at screening visit.

          7. Have a pain intensity score of ≥4 on NRS as an average for the last 24 hours at
             baseline visit.

          8. Must, in the investigator's opinion, qualify for opioid therapy for their CLBP or OA.

          9. Voluntarily provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion

          1. Have any clinically significant condition or unstable inter-current illness that would
             preclude study participation or interfere with the assessment of pain and other
             symptoms of CLBP or OA or would increase the risk of opioid related AEs.

          2. Have an uncontrolled or poorly controlled major psychiatric condition, or have
             clinically significant anxiety or depression.

          3. Have an active malignancy or history of malignancy within 2 years.

          9. Had surgical implants of either the knee or hip selected as the primary OA joint.

         10. Had gastric reduction surgery.

         11. Have been taking opioids in equivalents to more than 20 mg OC or more than 40 mg MS
