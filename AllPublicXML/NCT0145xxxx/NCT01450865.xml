  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slow axonal Kv7 potassium channels are found along unmyelinated axons and at the nodes of
      Ranvier of myelinated axons in peripheral nerve. As such the pharmacological activation of
      Kv7 channels offers a potential means of reducing the excitability of peripheral axons. To
      determine whether this is the case for human peripheral myelinated axons, the effect of the
      Kv7 channel agonist flupirtine on the electrical excitability of A fibres was examined in
      both isolated segments of human sural nerve in vitro and in motor axons of the median nerve
      supplying abductor pollicus brevis in vivo. Axonal excitability was assessed in 21 human
      sural nerve fascicles in vitro and in 20 volunteers in vivo using threshold tracking in QTRAC
      (Â© Institute of Neurology, London, UK). Strength-duration time constant, rheobase current,
      relative refractory period (RRP), post spike superexcitability at 5 and 7 ms and threshold
      electrotonus over the 90 100 ms period were used as indices of electrical excitability. In
      addition, suppression of ectopic discharge in a model of upper limb ischaemia.

    <description>The primary outcome parameter of axonal excitability was the relative refractory period (RRP) as assessed with threshold tracking techniques. Strength-duration time constant, rheobase current, refractoriness determined at 2 and 2.5 ms, superexcitability at 7 ms and threshold electrotonus over the 90 100 ms period were used as secondary outcome measures.</description>
