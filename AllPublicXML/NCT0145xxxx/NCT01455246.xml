    <textblock>
      Nosocomial spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is frequently caused by multi drug
      resistant bacteria. Standard treatment of SBP could be ineffective. The aim of the study is
      to compare daptomycin + meropenem vs ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial SBP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a well known complication in patients with liver
      cirrhosis and ascites. Nosocomial SBP is defined as SBP that occurs after 48 hours of
      hospitalization. It has been shown that patients with nosocomial SBP have a worse prognosis
      than patients with community-acquired SBP. It has also been shown that nosocomial SBP is
      frequently caused by multi drug resistant bacteria such as extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase
      (ESBL) producing enterobacteria or meticillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus. Currently
      the empirical treatment of SBP is the use of third generation cephalosporins or
      amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. In patients affected by nosocomial SBP these treatment could be
      ineffective. Up to now an empirical approach with a broader spectrum strategy (such as an
      association between meropenem and daptomycin) has never been compared to standard therapy in
      the treatment of nosocomial SBP. Thus, the aim of the study is to compare daptomycin +
      meropenem vs ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial SBP in patients with cirrhosis.

    <description>Daptomycin will be administered at the dose of 6 mg/kg every 24 hours and 6 mg/kg every 48 hours for an estimated creatinine clearance (CKD-EPI) of &gt; 30 ml/min and &lt; 30 ml/min respectively. Meropenem will be administered at the dose of 1 g t.i.d., 1 g b.i.d., 0.5 g every 24 hours for an estimated creatinine clearance of &gt;50 ml/min, 10-50 ml/min, and &lt; 10 ml/min respectively. The treatment will go on for 7 days. In the patients without response to treatment after 48 hours will be added a rescue therapy with fluconazole. In patients in which cultures shown a bacterial species resistant to therapy, daptomycin and meropenem will be discontinued and replaced by a therapy based on antibiotic susceptibility of isolated species.</description>
