  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      gliomas that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus
      (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient.
      This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient
      s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-EGFRvIII incorporated in the
      retrovirus.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see
      if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-EGFRvIII cells) are a safe and effective
      treatment for advanced gliomas.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-70 with malignant glioma expressing the EGFRvIII molecule.

      Design:

      Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo
      a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed

      Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo
      leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-EGFRvIII cells. {Leukapheresis is
      a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}

      Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the
      conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-EGFRvIII cells, and aldesleukin. They will stay in the
      hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans every month for the first year, and then every 1-2 months as long as
      their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.

      BACKGROUND:

      - Patients with recurrent gliomas have very limited treatment options. EGFR variant III

      (EGFRvIII) is the most common mutant variant of EGFR and is present in 24-67% of patients
      with glioblastoma.

        -  EGFRvIII expression promotes oncogenesis and is associated with poor prognosis.

        -  EGFRvIII is not expressed in normal tissue and is an attractive target for
           immunotherapy.

        -  We have constructed a retroviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
           that recognizes the EGFRvIII tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic
           transfer of this CAR with high efficiency without the need to perform any selection.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-EGFRvIII CAR engineered peripheral
           blood lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, and
           aldesleukin

        -  Determine the six month progression free survival of patients receiving anti-EGFRvIII
           CAR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes and aldesleukin following a nonmyeloablative
           but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Histologically proven glioblastoma or gliosarcoma expressing EGFRvIII as determined by
           IHC or RT-PCR

        -  Failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy

        -  Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60%

        -  Cardiac, pulmonary and laboratory parameters within acceptable limits

      DESIGN:

        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II design.

        -  Patients will receive a non-myeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex
           vivo tumor reactive, CAR gene-transduced PBMC, plus IV aldesleukin.

        -  Once the MTD has been determined, the study will proceed to the phase II portion.

        -  In the phase 2 portion of the trial, patients will be accrued to two groups:

             -  Patients with recurrent malignant glioma requiring steroid use at the start of
                treatment

             -  Patients with recurrent malignant glioma not requiring steroids at the start of
                treatment

        -  A total of 107 patients may be enrolled over a period of 7 years.

          2. Patients must have progression of disease after radiotherapy (including patients that
             undergo surgery for recurrent disease and are rendered NED). This includes recurrent
             GBM after receiving all standard first-line treatment, including surgery (if feasible
             due to neurosurgical and neuro-anatomical considerations) and adjuvant radiotherapy
             +/- chemotherapy.

          3. Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for
             at least five days prior to registration.

          4. Patients must be &gt; 18 years old and less than or equal to age 70

          5. Patients must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

          6. Must be willing to sign a durable power of attorney.

          7. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60

         10. Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody
                  unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patients
                  must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         11. Hematology

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. A prior history of gliadel implantation in the past six months..

          2. Women who are currently pregnant or breast feeding because of the potentially
             dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          3. Active systemic infections, (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment) coagulation
             disorders or any other major medical illnesses

          4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune

             attacks and other central nervous system bleeding in the preceding 6 months that were
             not related to glioma surgery. History of prior intratumoral bleeding is not an
             exclusion criteria; patients who with history of prior intratumoral bleeding, however,
             need to undergo a non-contrast head CT to exclude acute bleeding.
