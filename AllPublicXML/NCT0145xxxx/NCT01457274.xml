  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients undergoing elective colonoscopy under sedation will be randomised to
      BIS-guided sedation targeting either &quot;light&quot; (bispectral index [BIS] 70-80) or &quot;deep&quot;
      (BIS&lt;60) sedation. Sedation will be achieved with a standardised regimen of target-controlled
      infusion of propofol and fentanyl bolus. The primary end point will be the incidence of
      procedure recall in each group - this will be assessed at the conclusion of the procedure.
      The procedural conditions, cardio-respiratory complications and recovery including cognitive
      function will be assessed during and immediately after the procedure. The incidence of
      dreaming and patient satisfaction with anaesthesia care will be recorded immediately after
      the procedure. The study will be complete when the patient leaves the hospital on the day of
      the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controversy exists about the need for deep sedation or light sedation during elective
      colonoscopy. Deep sedation ensures amnesia for the procedure and may ensure better operating
      conditions, but may result in cardiorespiratory side effects and prolonged recovery.
      Differences exist between countries regarding the prevailing depth of sedation with deeper
      sedation in general being administered in Australia than the United States. This study aims
      to explore that controversy.

    <description>Time from starting sedation until opening eyes in the post anaesthesia care unit, and time until readiness for hospital discharge will be recorded.
Cognitive function at hospital discharge, compared to pre-procedure function, will be assessed by the CogState(TM) test battery.</description>

    <description>Proceduralist and anaesthetist satisfaction with the sedation will be recorded at the end of the procedure.
Patient satisfaction with their anaesthesia care will be assessed at the time they are ready for hospital discharge.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day. Day of procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Upon rousing in the post anaesthesia care unit patients will be asked the modified Brice questionnaire (&quot;What is the last thing you remember before you went to sleep?&quot;, &quot;What is the first thing you remember when you woke up?&quot;, &quot;Did you remember anything in between?&quot;, and &quot;Did you have any dreams?&quot;).
Dreaming will be assessed by the response to quesion 4.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the depth of sedation targeted in this study.
Patients enrolled in this study will be sedated with the same medications (fentanyl bolus and propofol target controlled infusion), and at the same starting doses, in each study arm. However, the depth of sedation targeted will differ between the arms, and this depth will be guided by the BIS monitor.
It is expected that those patients randomised to &quot;deep&quot; sedation will require a higher dose of sedative medication to achieve their target BIS value (&lt;60) than those in the &quot;light&quot; sedation group (BIS 70-80).</description>
