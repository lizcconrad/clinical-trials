  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence supports detrimental effects of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) on
      vascular function (VF). Though, the effect of AGE-modified proteins alone on vascular
      function remained unknown. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate the effects of
      heat-treated, glycated beta-lactoglobulins (BLG) on vascular function in subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to compare it to non-glycated, heat-treated BLG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, controlled, randomized, cross-over manner, 19 subjects with T2DM will
      receive on 2 different days beverages containing either glycated, heat-treated BLG or
      non-glycated, heat-treated BLG.

      Macrovascular (brachial ultrasound of flow mediated dilatation -FMD) and microvascular
      function (laser-doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia at the hand) at baseline (T0), as
      well as 90 (T90) and 180 (T180) minutes after each beverage will be measured.
