    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed treatment safe

        2. Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with diffuse brain
           lesions and clinical outcomes.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will
      be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction using local anesthesia and
      syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells. The cells will be delivered via catheter into the
      internal carotid artery and intravenously.
