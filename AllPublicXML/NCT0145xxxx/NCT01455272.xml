    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is one of the best, and sometimes the only,
      option for the treatment of leukemia, particularly for patients with advanced-stage leukemia.
      However, relapse rate was still very high for advanced-stage leukemia.

      It was found in our previous study that infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF)-primed peripheral blood progenitor cells (GPBPC) instead of non-primed lymphocytes
      exhibited a comparative or stronger graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and comparative or
      less incidence of GVHD, rarely being complicated with pancytopenia. When GPBPC infusion was
      combined with the use of short-term immunosuppressant for GVHD prophylaxis, the incidence of
      fatal GVHD complicated with GPBPCI was further reduced. Our primary data showed the GPBPCI
      combined with the use of short-term immunosuppressant was feasible in patients with advanced
      leukemia to prevent relapse after HLA-mismatched HSCT.

      The study hypothesis:

      Prevention of relapse using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-primed peripheral blood
      progenitor cells following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with
      advanced-stage acute leukemia can

        -  reduce relapse rate

        -  improve survival

      A G-CSF-primed PBPCI was planned within day 60 post-transplantation before hematologic
      relapse was diagnosed in patients for which no GVHD occurred or free of GVHD after 2 weeks
      off immunosuppression for patients receiving GPBPCI after day 90 post HSCT. Before
      administration of GPBPCI, serious infection had to be cleared and no serious organ failure
      could be present. The GPBPCI regimen was comprised of G-CSF-primed PBSCs instead of harvested
      non-primed donor lymphocytes and short-term immunosuppressive agents for prevention of GVHD
      after GPBPCI. Chimerism status was examined before and after prophylactic treatment with
      GPBPCI.
