    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the role of the addition of CP870, 893 to the neoadjuvant
      and adjuvant setting for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Patients will receive
      standard surgery followed by chemoradiation for their disease, but one dose of gem/cp 870,893
      will be pre-op and 3 doses post-op.

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label single-arm,phase 1, trial. Ten patients with newly diagnosed resectable
      pancreatic carcinoma will receive gemcitabine and CP-870,893 two weeks prior to surgical
      resection and subsequently during standard-of-care adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (at which
      time CP-870,893 will be given on day 3 of each of three 28-day cycles of gemcitabine).
      Previously established doses of each agent will be used and each given by IV infusion.
