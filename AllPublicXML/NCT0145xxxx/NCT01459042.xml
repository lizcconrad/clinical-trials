    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that primary aldosteronism (PA) is a much more common cause of
      hypertension than had been demonstrated historically. In patients with resistant
      hypertension, the prevalence of PA from different clinics worldwide is about 10-20%. As has
      been no such data in China, the investigators are conducting a PA study in different province
      of China to evaluate the prevalence of PA in patients with resistant hypertension.
