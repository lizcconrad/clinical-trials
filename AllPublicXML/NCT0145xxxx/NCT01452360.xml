      This project expects the integrated database of terminally renal ill patients combines
      clinical and files of Health Insurance and renal medical society database. It will provide
      valuable actual evidence data to quality monitoring of dialysis treatment and related
      academic research. Besides, using the cohort study of chronic renal disease --「epidemiologic
      research of chronic renal disease」, we can trace the patient continually and analysis
      different risk factors of chronic renal disease in Taiwan. Taken together, the results of
      this project --1.1「Integrate the current database of renal disease and establishment of
      national monitor system」and 1.2「Epidemiologic study in chronic renal disease」-- will provide
      the basic rules of prevention and treatment, basic research and clinic application in chronic
      renal disease.

      The main source of patient in this study sub-plan 1.2 will collect the patient from medical
      center in Taiwan. We assume collect 7 groups in study period -- First：【CKD stage I】.
      Second：【CKD stage II】. Third：【CKD stage III】. Forth：【CKD stage IV】. Fifth：【CKD stage V】.
      Sixth：【CKD high-risk group】. Seventh：【health control group】to study case report；Total collect
      11500 people. At the same time, we collect the sample of blood and urine and personal health
      survey to provide the basic data base for each patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Collection of CKD patient group： The patients who will select into this plan are
             chosen from the hospital (This hospital is defined as the renal disease improving
             institute) in Taiwan. New case in this hospital will be collected into the CKD patient
             group. In order to separate those patients into five stages of CKD, we are going to
             calculate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by using the formula of GFR. Stage I --
             Renal function is normally and protein was detectable slightly in urine
             (GFR：≧90ml/min/1.73M2). Stage II -- Slight renal function failure was observed
             (GFR：60~89ml/min/1.73M2). Stage III -- Moderate renal function failure
             (GFR：30~59ml/min/1.73M2). Stage IV -- Severe renal function failure
             (GFR：15~29ml/min/1.73M2). Stage V -- End stage renal disease (GFR：＜15ml/min/1.73M2).
             The age is from fourteen to eighty-five and whatever they are male or female will be
             taken into this project.

          2. Collection of CKD high-risk group： The CKD patient's relative will be considerately
             incorporated into the CKD high-risk group. If CKD patient being confirmed, their
             relative who had chronic disease including DM, hypertension and CVD will be chosen
             into CKD high-risk group. The age is from fourteen to eighty-five and whatever they
             are male or female. This plan will select five thousand people into CKD high-risk
             group.

          3. Collection of healthy control group： According to the characteristic of CKD patient
             group, we will select the health control group carefully (paired selection of CKD
             patient group, 1:1). The rules of paired selection : 1. Sex 2.Age ± 5 years 3.Location
             -- CKD patient and health people are get from the same hospital. Health people who had
             no any chronic disease and required a physical checkup which get from the hospital
             (This hospital should be qualified to the renal disease improving institute) will be
             chosen into this project. Fifteen hundred people will be taken in this plan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  This plan divide into three groups：1. CKD patient group -- CKD patient group have no
             exclusion criteria. 2. CKD high-risk group -- CKD high-risk group exclude the patient
             who had renal disease. 3. Heath control group -- Heath control group exclude the
             patient who had any chronic disease. Test of liver residual function will exclude the
             patient who had allergic reactions to galactose. It will exclude the person including
             galactosemia patient, DM patient, pregnant woman, children and disabled people.
