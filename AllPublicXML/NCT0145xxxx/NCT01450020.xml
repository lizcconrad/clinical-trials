      This randomized clinical trial studies peer navigator education in improving survivorship
      care in African American breast cancer survivors. An educational intervention involving peer
      groups may help to improve the well-being and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer
      survivors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of peer navigation (PN) to improve understanding of survivorship
      care planning (SCP) at 6 months.

      II. To promote adherence to the SCP schedule of follow-up examinations at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PN on change from baseline in medical efficacy, preparedness for
      life as new survivor, and physical and health related QOL at 6 months.

      OUTLINE: PNs are trained on medical issues and resources, and SCP. Participants are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive 4 PN sessions tailored to their needs followed by a 6 month
      booster session and American Cancer Society (ACS) materials.

      ARM II: Participants receive ACS materials.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.

    <measure>Ability of peer navigation to improve understanding of SCP</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chi-square and t-tests will be used to compare the baseline characteristics of subjects randomized to PN intervention vs control. For subjects in the intervention arm, the number of navigation sessions received will be reported, and correlated factors will be explored. The number of subjects navigated per PN will also be reported. Nonevaluable and evaluable subjects (defined at 6 and 12 months) will be compared. Site of care will be handled as a cluster level variable in generalized linear mixed (GLM) regression models.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the SCP schedule of follow-up examinations</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a newly created, 50-point scale that gives equal weight to completion of the recommended: physical exams, imaging, pelvic exam, annual oncology visit, and breast self-exams.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of PN on change in medical efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory analyses will analyze the effect of PN intervention actually received, using the number of PN sessions completed and the quality of the subject's PN as measured by PN's post-training level of acuity and utility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparedness for life as new survivor (PLANS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PLANS consists of two subscales that measure patients' knowledge and self efficacy with regards to their Access and Quality of Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) and adherence with regard to following these tasks. The knowledge subscale (Cronbach's alpha 0.90) and adherence subscale (Cronbach's alpha 0.70) have good reliability.</description>
