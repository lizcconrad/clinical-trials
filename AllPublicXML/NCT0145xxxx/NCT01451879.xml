  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: the effectiveness of treatment of Pompe Disease with rhGAA enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT) is limited at least in part because patients develop antibodies against the
      provided rhGAA enzyme. Treatment with immunomodulatory drugs may dampen or eliminate the
      anti-rhGAA immune response in patients receiving ERT, thereby allowing for greater ERT
      efficacy. Studying the immune response to rhGAA may provide valuable insight into the role of
      the immune system in the effectiveness of ERT for Pompe Disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effect(s) of medications that alter
      the immune system on anti-rhGAA immune response in Pompe patients receiving rhGAA enzyme
      replacement therapy (ERT). The investigators would also like to determine whether treating
      Pompe Disease with medications that affect the immune system has any effects on the overall
      health or disease progression of Pompe.

      Subjects will be patients between the ages of 0 months and 65 years who have been diagnosed
      with Pompe Disease, confirmed by mutational analysis and/or GAA enzyme activity assay.

      Subjects will be eligible regardless of whether they have begun enzyme replacement therapy
      prior to enrollment. All Subjects will receive enzyme replacement therapy as standard of care
      during the course of the Study, although they may not have begun ERT treatment at the time of
      enrollment. In addition to ERT, subjects may receive an immunomodulatory regimen as part of
      their standard of care; this may include rituximab, sirolimus, methotrexate, IVIg or other
      immunomodulatory agents such as pharmacological chaperone N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ),
      alone or in combination, at the discretion of their caregiver(s).
