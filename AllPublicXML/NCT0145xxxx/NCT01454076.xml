  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, sequential, 5-arm, phase 1 study of oral IXAZOMIB
      designed to assess drug-drug interaction with ketoconazole (Arm 1), the relative
      bioavailability of 2 capsule formulations of IXAZOMIB (Arm 2), food effect (Arm 3), drug-drug
      interaction with rifampin (Arm 4), and drug-drug interaction with clarithromycin (Arm 5) in
      participants with advanced nonhematologic malignancies or lymphoma.

    <description>Best overall response for a participant is best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1: Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter [mm]). No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD). An increase of &gt;=20% from the nadir (or baseline, if it represents the point at which the sum of target disease was lowest) represents PD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Best overall response for a participant is best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1: Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter [mm]). No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD). An increase of &gt;=20% from the nadir (or baseline, if it represents the point at which the sum of target disease was lowest) represents PD.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response</title>
          <description>Best overall response for a participant is best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1: Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter [mm]). No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD). An increase of &gt;=20% from the nadir (or baseline, if it represents the point at which the sum of target disease was lowest) represents PD.</description>
          <population>The response-evaluable population included participants who had measurable disease at baseline, received at least 1 dose of any study drug, and had at least 1 postbaseline response assessment.</population>
