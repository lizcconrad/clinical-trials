  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe drug concentrations in blood plasma, rectal fluid,
      rectal tissue, and seminal fluid in HIV negative men following single and multiple doses of
      an investigational HIV medication known as GSK1349572 (dolutegravir).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine first dose and steady-state concentrations of
      GSK1349572 in seminal fluid, rectal mucosal fluid, and rectal tissue compared to blood plasma
      (BP) in HIV-1 negative males. GSK1349572 is an investigational next generation integrase
      inhibitor currently in Phase III trials. Understanding the concentrations of GSK1349572 in
      multiple male biological compartments will inform its role in preventing HIV infection by
      making an HIV-infected person less likely to transmit the virus, and protecting uninfected
      persons from acquiring the virus.

    <description>Subjects will take a GSK1349572 (dolutegravir) 50mg tablet by mouth once daily for 8 days. GSK1349572 concentrations will be measured in blood plasma, seminal fluid, rectal fluid, and rectal tissue over 24 hours after a single dose and over two 24 hour periods once steady state is reached. Blood plasma will be collected pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours after dosing.
