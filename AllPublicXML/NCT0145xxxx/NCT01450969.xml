      The PREFER Trial has three main objectives. The primary objective of the trial is to show how
      much radiation attenuation is provided by XPF in absolute and relative terms. The secondary
      objective of the study is to measure and compare the amount of radiation that interventional
      radiologists are exposed to per case in an interventional suite setting using FDA approved
      XPF thyroid collars or standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collars. The third objective is
      to assess the operator comfort wearing the XPF protection devices. In order to achieve these
      objectives, measurements will be performed in 60 consecutive endovascular procedures
      requiring C-arm fluoroscopy performed at BCVI. Participants will be asked to wear an XPF cap
      (weighing approximately 100 grams) in every study procedure. Furthermore, a prospective
      randomization will be performed, assigning participants to wear their own standard 0.5 mm Pb
      equivalent thyroid collar or to wear the FDA approved XPF thyroid collar. Radiation exposure
      will be monitored with 4 radiation detectors (TLDs, 2 attached to the cap, 2 attached to the
      collar) which the participant is required to wear. After each procedure the participant will
      be asked to rate the comfort of wearing the devices on a scale from 1 to 100.

    <measure>Radiation attenuation in percentage (%) and in absolute terms (μSv/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>The attenuation is assessed directly after each procedure (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The null hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is inferior to the standard 0.5mm Pb lead equivalent thyroid collar with regard to radiation attenuation/transmission. The alternative hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is non-inferior to the standard thyroid collar. If there is truly no difference between standard and XPF thyroid collars, then 60 patients are required to be 95% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -0.7% transmission rate and -0.013 μSv/min.</description>
