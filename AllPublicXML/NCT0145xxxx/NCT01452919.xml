  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not people with schizophrenia who take
      LY2140023 become physically dependent on it, and experience a series of symptoms such as
      craving to have the drug when they stop using it.

      This trial consists of two phases: An open-label phase consisting of up to 4 weeks and a
      double-blind phase consisting of up to 3 weeks.
