      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a capsular tension ring (CTR) in
      preventing anterior capsule shrinkage after cataract surgery in exfoliation syndrome (XFS)
      with no zonular weakness. The eyes with XFS undergo phacoemulsification and aspiration (PEA)
      with an intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. All operations are performed by a single
      surgeon. No eyes with either ectopia lentis or phacodonesis are included. There are three
      groups; CTR is not used in group A, CTR is simply implanted in group B, and CTR is implanted
      and closed by tying both eyelets in group C. The areas of continuous curvilinear
      capsulorhexis (CCC) are calculated, and both the time-course change and the comparison among
      the 3 groups are tested.

    <description>The vertical diameters (A mm) and horizontal diameters (B mm) of the postoperative capsulorhexis opening were measured using the scale of a Haag-Strait slit lamp. The area of the rhexis is equal to πAB/4 mm2. The measurements are taken on day one (baseline), and thereafter at each weeks postoperatively. The statistical analyses are used for time-course changes in each group, and for the area among the three groups on the same postoperative period. For this study, the percent change is calculated based on the ratio of the area at each measurement in comparison to the initial value.</description>
