  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 15-gene lung signature was created to identify predictive and prognostic biomarkers for
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. The 15-gene signature was validated using a
      microarray platform with fresh frozen tumor tissue to place NSCLC patients into high risk and
      low risk cohorts with significantly different survivals.

      Using fresh frozen tissue can be challenging, so this study attempts simplify the process by
      migrating the 15-gene signature from fresh frozen to two alternative tissue formats: Formalin
      Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) and RNAlater.

      The gene expressions of the different tissue formats will be compared to see if the fresh
      frozen tissue results are similar to the alternative tissue formats.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with early stage NSCLC will be consented prior to surgery so that any excess tissue
      collected during surgery can be collected in one of the three tissue formats (Fresh Frozen,
      FFPE, RNAlater) and sent to the Sponsor for testing.
