  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the beneficial metabolic effects of endurance exercise training are not due to
      adaptations to weeks, months, or even years of training, but rather much is due to the
      response to the most recent exercise session(s). Therefore, the investigators contend that
      lifestyle interventions for obese individuals should be tailored to optimize the metabolic
      effects of the most recent exercise session(s). But the &quot;dose&quot; of exercise necessary to evoke
      these beneficial responses is not known, and the mechanisms responsible for these
      improvements are poorly understood. The findings from these studies will: 1) establish the
      minimum &quot;dose&quot; of a single exercise session necessary to improve insulin sensitivity the next
      day in obese adults, 2) characterize the underlying metabolic factors responsible for the
      improvement in insulin sensitivity, and 3) assess the cumulative metabolic adaptations that
      occur over days, weeks, and months of a low-intensity/low-volume lifestyle exercise program.
      Findings from these studies will provide valuable information for the development of
      lifestyle programs aimed at maximizing the key metabolic health benefits of each exercise
      session in obese patients.
