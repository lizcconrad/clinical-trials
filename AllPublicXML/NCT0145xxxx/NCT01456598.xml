  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  It was confirmed that the laparoscopic surgery decreases the postoperative pain and
           reduces the recovery periods in the various surgical fields such as cholecystectomy and
           colectomy etc. Also, there are clinical evidences that the laparoscopic surgery is
           applicable to malignant tumor according to the development of surgical techniques and
           medical instruments.

        -  In case of early stage of gastric cancer, as the diverse clinical evidences, the
           gastrectomy has been commonly applied, however, the opening surgery is still applied for
           advanced gastric cancer due to lack of clinical evidence.

        -  In Korea, approximately 38% of patients who undergo surgery for gastric cancer are
           diagnosed by T2-T3 (AJCC 6th edition) (www.i-kgca.or.kr, National gastric cancer
           registration business in 2009). There are various clinical evidences to apply
           laparoscopic surgery to the patients, however, most of them are retrospective or cohort
           study results.

        -  For the clinical application of surgical treatment regarding locally advanced gastric
           cancer using laparoscopic surgical technique, it requires the confirmation of definite
           execution for laparoscopic gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection and the safety of
           surgery and oncological usefulness should be verified.

        -  In order for this, it is only possible to confirm through the comparison of short-term
           surgical results (complications, mortalities, operative time and duration of
           hospitalization etc) and long-term results (survival rates and recurrence rates etc)
           between laparoscopic surgery and opening surgery based on the multicenter large-sized
           randomized prospective study with current standard treatment.

           chemotherapy based on 5-FU.

      Evaluation of efficacy and safety

        -  3-year Relapse free survival rate and overall survival rate of the patients who undergo
           laparoscopic and open subtotal gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection.

           index such as recovery of postoperative intestinal hypermotility, meals and duration of
           hospitalization, EORTC-C30 and STO22 questionnaire between the patients who underwent
           laparoscopic and open subtotal gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection.
