      This is:

        -  A prospective, randomized, open, phase II, multi-centre, interventional study. Patients
           who are in at least PR and have received lenalidomide as 2nd line treatment for MM will
           be recruited.

        -  The patients will be randomized into two groups. Group R will receive lenalidomide 25
           mg/day p.o. continuously for 21 days and group Rb will receive a similar dose of
           lenalidomide with the addition of 40 mg of dexamethasone p.o. on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of
           every 28 day treatment cycle. Study includes a maximum of 24 cycles including two
           consolidating cycles per patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria - all subjects must:

          1. Be at least 18 years of age

          2. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of MM and have either refractory or relapsed
             and refractory after first line treatment disease defined as:

               -  Primary refractory

               -  Refractory

               -  Relapsed and Refractory

          3. Subjects must have undergone prior treatment with one treatment line of anti-myeloma
             therapy. Induction therapy followed by ASCT and consolidation/maintenance will be
             considered as one line.Have a confirmed diagnosis of MM

          4. Have received lenalidomide after one prior treatment for MM and have reached at least
             a partial response (PR), according to IMWG criteria, including two consolidating
             cycles. Subjects have experienced a response at least PR after starting treatment with
             lenalidomide and cortisone cycles.

          5. Have personally signed and dated a legally effective written informed consent form
             prior to admission to the study.

          6. Must be willing and able to understand and comply with the study requirements.

               -  Platelet count &lt; 75,000/ µL

               -  Creatinine Clearance &lt; 45 mL/min according to Cockcroft-Gault formula

               -  Serum SGOT/AST or SGPT/ALT &gt; 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

          2. ECOG performance status &lt;4.

          3. Individuals who have had a stem-cell transplant as a 2nd line treatment for MM

          4. Individuals who have taken any experimental drugs or participated in a clinical trial
             within 30 days prior to screening.

          5. Individuals with significant psychiatric illness or a clinically significant
