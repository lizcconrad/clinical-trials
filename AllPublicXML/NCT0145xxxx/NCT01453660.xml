  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is one of the most common chemotherapy drugs used to treat many different cancers,
      including germ cell tumors (GCT). Cisplatin is very effective in treating GCT, but there are
      side effects. One of the possible long-term side effects of cisplatin is thought to be heart
      disease. The way that cisplatin causes heart disease is not well understood. One possibility
      is that cisplatin may damage the inside layer of blood vessels called the endothelium. The
      purpose of this study is to measure changes in the endothelium that happen when patients with
      GCT get cisplatin chemotherapy and to compare these changes with a group of patients not
      receiving chemotherapy.

    <description>Time 1: A baseline assessment will be performed in the fasting state including Endo-PAT2000, vital signs, waist circumference, fasting blood draw, &amp; urine sample. This will be considered Day 1 of the study for this group of patients. Time 2 (2-5 hours from Time 1): Two to five hours after Time 1, patients will undergo assessment of blood pressure &amp; heart rate, including orthostatics &amp; Endo-PAT2000 testing. Time 5 -- End of Study visit (14-34 weeks from Time 1): At a time point 14 to 34 weeks later than Time 1 patients will undergo study testing in the fasting state. This includes Endo-PAT2000 testing, vital signs including orthostatics, waist circumference, fasting blood draw, &amp; urine sample. The Surgery-Only Group will not have any assessment at Time 3 (Day 2) or Time 4 (Day 5) due to logistical concerns.

        The Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy Group will be recruited from the Genitourinary (GU)
        oncology clinics. The GU Oncology section has a large clinical service which ensures
        adequate recruitment.

        The Surgery-Only Group will consist of patients with a diagnosis of GCT who have recently
        had surgical management of their disease and are not planned to receive radiation or
        chemotherapy. Potentially eligible patients will be recruited from the GU Oncology and
        Urology clinics since they are seen by both services.
