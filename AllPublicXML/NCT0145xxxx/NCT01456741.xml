  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endobronchial lung cancer tend to manifest in three different patterns. It can present as a
      bulky, exophytic mass lesion, submucosal infiltration or extrinsic compression from
      peribronchial disease. Bronchoscopy with differents techniques as forceps biopsy, bronchial
      brushing and bronchial washing is recognized as the gold standard to diagnose central airways
      lung neoplasms. Some authors suggested that the addition of endobronchial needle aspiration
      (EBNA) to these conventional diagnostic methods may increase the sensitivity of bronchoscopy
      in submucosal and peribronchial disease but few prospective trials have been performed and
      this procedure is still underutilized in many centers. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) showed
      to improve yield of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal nodes and
      pulmonary peripheral lesions, reducing the number of inadequate specimens and costs. However,
      its utility during endobronchial needle aspiration has not been substantiated.

      This prospective study has two primary objectives: to compare the sensitivity of ROSE-EBNA
      with that of the conventional technique and to investigate the diagnostic yield of
      endobronchial needle aspiration and its contribution to CDM in the evaluation of patients
      with endobronchial lesions.
