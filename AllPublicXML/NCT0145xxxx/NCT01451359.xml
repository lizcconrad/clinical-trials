  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because an endobronchial valve is a one-way inspiratory airway blocker, it is hypothesized
      that it could be also used for controlling persistent air leaks while maintaining the
      drainage of secretions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in October 2008 the
      Spiration valve system designed to control air leaks in the lung that persist after lung
      surgery. This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Spiration endobronchial valves in a prospective series of consecutive patients with a
      prolonged persistent air leak after anatomic surgical resection for cancer.

    <textblock>
      Persistent Air Leak (PAL) is independently associated with prolonged hospital length of stay,
      decreased patient satisfaction, increased morbidity or postoperative complications, and adds
      significantly to the cost. The management of air leaks is primarily preventive and therefore
      starts in the operating room with surgical techniques that can minimize the occurrence of
      post-operative air leaks, such as the creation of pleural tents or use of suture line glues
      or sealants. Notwithstanding some patients will after a lung resection have PAL. Any minimal
      invasive method that helps to increase our ability to treat (reduce and/or stop) the air leak
      in these latest cases carries an enormous clinical as well as cost-saving potential.
      Bronchoscopic occlusion of a segmental or subsegmental bronchus using endobronchial valves is
      such a less invasive method which has shown in case reports to interrupt an air leak.
