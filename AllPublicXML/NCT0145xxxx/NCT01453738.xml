    <textblock>
      This trial is planed to study if allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells would be safe and
      beneficial in osteoarthritis of knee joint. This is a double blind study. Different doses of
      stem cells will be used in this study.

    <description>Safety evaluation will include assessment of physical examination, periodic monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature), clinical laboratory investigations (including haematology, serum chemistry, LFT, urine-analysis) and 12-lead ECG recording.
Tolerability: Adverse events monitored using information volunteered by the patients and as observed by the PI will be summarized descriptively by total number of AE(s) and compared between the study arms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females in the age 40 - 70 years (both inclusive)

          2. Radiographic evidence of grade 2 to 3 osteoarthritis based on the Kellgren and
             Lawrence radiographic criteria.

          3. History of primary idiopathic osteoarthritis of the knee characterized by pain which
             requires intake of analgesics.

          4. Self-reported difficulty in at least one of the following activities attributed to
             knee pain: lifting and carrying groceries, walking 400 metres, getting in and out of a
             chair, or going up and down stairs.

          5. Patients who have been on stable medication which may be NSAIDs / Opioid or opiate
             analgesics, for the past three months.

          6. Female patients of childbearing age must be willing to use accepted methods of
             contraception during the course of the study

          7. Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior or ongoing medical conditions (e.g., concomitant illness, psychiatric condition,
             alcoholism, drug abuse), medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or
             laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the
             safety of the subject, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow-up
             would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.

          2. History of surgery, or major trauma to the study joint

          3. Arthroscopy on the study joint in the previous 12 months

             qualifying with osteoarthritis of the knee, a large, bulging effusion of the study
             knee joint with the loss of normal contour of the joint at the screening visit or at
             the baseline examination

          5. Patients who had received intraarticular steroids or hyaluronan within the last three
             months.

          6. Infections in or around the knee.

          7. Patients awaiting a replacement knee or hip joint

             devices

         11. Patients with other known rheumatic or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid
             arthritis

         12. Other pathologic lesions on x-rays of knee

         13. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test, Anti human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test, or RPR

         14. History of Bleeding disorders

         15. Known hypersensitivity to Hyaluronan products or animal sera

         16. For women of child-bearing potential: positive pregnancy test or lactating [Females
             who are planning pregnancy within next one year should be excluded]
