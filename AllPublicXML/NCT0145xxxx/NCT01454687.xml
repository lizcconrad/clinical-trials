    <textblock>
      The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is used to describe a group of genetic skin diseases
      associated with skin weakness, blisters, and chronic wounds. &quot;Revertant mosaicism&quot; means that
      there are two genetically different populations of cells due to spontaneous mutations. Some
      EB patients have normal, non-fragile skin patches which may be areas of revertant mosaicism.
      In the revertant areas, the proteins function normally, like non-EB skin. In this study, we
      plan to culture cells from the revertant areas and graft them on to the wounded areas.
