  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well appreciated that an extreme sedentary lifestyle from paralysis, contributes to
      many secondary medical problems such as diabetes and insulin resistance, obesity,
      constipation, poor blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular disease, reduced quality of
      life, and more. The ReWalk-I exoskeleton walking device permits investigation of the
      potential benefits of frequent upright posture and walking on many of the secondary
      consequences of spinal cord injury. The researchers are investigating the ability of persons
      with paraplegia to learn to stand and walk with the ReWalk-I and the effects of being upright
      and walking on several of these secondary medical consequences of spinal cord injury.

      Potential participants will be pre-screened with the inclusion criteria for eligibility. The
      informed consent process will begin for those participants who have been determined to meet
      the inclusion criteria. After the potential participant's signed consent has been provided,
      further evaluations for eligibility will be performed (e.g., there are several medical and
      physical exclusion criteria). Those potential participants who meet both the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into the ReWalk-I study. Baseline evaluations
      and personalized measurements for fitting to the ReWalk-I will be performed over one week,
      before the training sessions begin. The ReWalk sessions will consist of a Learning Phase (12
      sessions in 4 weeks) and a Training Phase (18 sessions in 6 weeks). These times may vary by
      each participant's ReWalk learning curve. Training will begin with sit-to-stand,
      stand-to-sit, and standing balance activities. Progression to walking will occur as skills
      advance. Each session will be an average 50 minutes, with 3 sessions per week. The skills to
      be learned include 1) sit-to-stand, 2) stand-to-sit, 3) 2-arm standing balance, 4) 1-arm
      standing balance, 5) walking, and 6) stair climbing. The study evaluations will be repeated
      after the Learning Phase, after the Training Phase and 1-month post training follow-up.
