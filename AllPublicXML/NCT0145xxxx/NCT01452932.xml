      Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of muscle training, the degree of dyspnea and
      aerobic capacity in patients over 50 with COPD, in a health care institution provider in
      Antioquia.

      Question: What is the effectiveness of muscle training, in the degree of dyspnea and aerobic
      capacity in COPD patients over 50 years, in a health service institution provider in the
      department of Antioquia?

      Hypothesis: Muscle training causes changes in the degree of dyspnea and aerobic capacity,
      other than the breathing exercises and relaxation

      Design: Randomized clinical trial with allocation and blinding of the autcomes assesor.

      Participants: COPD patients stage II and II, male and female, over 50 years old, who are
      attending to a community health service provider in the department of Antioquia.

      Intervention: A physiotherapeutic intervention using PNF technique was applied to the
      experimental physiotherapy group versus Yoga sessions applied to the other group. Twelve
      weeks protocol performing three sessions per week.

      Outcome measures: Dyspnea degree and aerobic capacity was measured using the MMRC scale and
      the six minute walking test respectively at the begining and the end of the study.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by GOLD (The Global Initiative for
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) as a disease process characterized by progressive airflow
      limitation associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to particles or
      harmful gases and is not fully reversible. This restriction generates an expiratory flow of
      air entrapment resulting hyperinflation, coupled with the effects that systemic, structural
      changes occur in skeletal muscles which leads to greater fatigue causing dyspnea.
      Consequently, patients with COPD require participation of accessory muscles of respiration,
      which should have a dual function during activities involving the upper limbs, to supply the
      ventilatory requirements and movements of the shoulder girdle, which increases dyspnea
      carrying the patient to stop their activities, leading to physical deconditioning and
      progressively decreasing aerobic capacity. This demonstrates the need to improve the
      resistance of the upper limb muscles in these patients, thus contributing to a reduction in
      the degree of dyspnea and improved their aerobic capacity. The investigators propose a study
      aimed at determining the effectiveness of muscle training in the degree of dyspnea and
      aerobic capacity in COPD.

    <description>The physiotherapeutic intervention was based on the Kabat (PNF) technique. Thirty-three sessions were planed. Each session lasted between thirty and fifty minutes.
The experimental group was guided by a physiotherapist or a physiotherapy student and each session took place in a hospital auditorium provided with oxygen cylinders, chairs and water.
Each session consisted of a warm up and stretch period, a period of resistance training of the upper limbs with their rest periods in which diaphragmatic breathing exercises and finally a cooling period.
The instructions and instruments given to each participant such as weights and elastic bands were the same for all of them.</description>

The group was led by a Yoga Instructor and each sessions took place in a hospital auditorium provided by oxygen cylinders, chairs and water.
No instruments were needed for this intervention.</description>
