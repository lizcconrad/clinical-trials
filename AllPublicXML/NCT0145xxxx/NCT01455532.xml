      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of iniparib as a single agent
           and in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors
           that are refractory to standard therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the antitumor effect of iniparib (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
           Tumors [RECIST]) Version 1.1 in patients with measurable disease.

        -  To characterize iniparib (and its metabolites, if possible) pharmacokinetics.

      Based on data generated by Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess
      eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1
      cycle (3 weeks or 4 weeks depending on regimen) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment
      visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug. However, treatment
      may continue until precluded by toxicity, progression, or death.
