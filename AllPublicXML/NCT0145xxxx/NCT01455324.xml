  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to work with prosthetists to fit the novel conformable socket
      material developed by Infoscitex, to subjects, and determine if it is a viable alternative to
      current prosthetic socket liners. During this task, the research team will travel to the
      prosthetists locations to have them fit the subject with the conformable woven socket and a
      check socket, and provide subjective feedback with regard to comfort and fit for the amputee,
      its ease of use, and breathability. The subject will also wear the woven socket for gait
      analysis and provide his/her feedback as well.

    <textblock>
      Modern prosthetics have improved significantly with regards to control and functionality, but
      the fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket is a primary concern for many
      amputees. A poor fit can lead to skin irritation, tissue breakdown, and pain. The volume of
      the residual limb of an amputee changes throughout the course of a day and throughout the
      year. Volume fluctuation within the socket can lead to issues for the amputee, including
      decreased comfort, increased shear forces, increased pressure on bony prominences, as well as
      a poor gait pattern. An uncomfortable or non-performing socket/residual limb interface
      decreases user compliance with the prosthetic and therefore decreases the activity level of
      amputees who want to remain active in their civilian and military lives. The investigators
      are developing a multilayered socket that takes advantage of a novel braided material for
      strength and passive conformability with thin layers dedicated to wearer comfort. This new
      socket provides ultimate fit for improvement in the performance of the prosthesis. The socket
      adapts itself to the changing physical shape of the residual limb as the prosthesis is worn.
      The adaptation is a natural result of the material properties, so is done passively and in
      real time. The materials are lightweight, breathable, and ultrasound transparent, allowing
      the prosthetic to function in a variety of environments.

      This study will be undertaken to have prosthetists fit subject lower limb amputees with the
      woven inner socket, with a check socket for evaluation in a gait lab setting. At the
      completion, the subject and prosthetists will be asked to complete a questionnaire and give
      their opinions regarding the material of the woven inner socket.
