    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how subjects with intact skin tolerate a water jet (psi 10-12) and how
      well the water stream is contained by a new containment device.

      Pulse lavage irrigation is an effective method of cleaning both acute and chronic wounds. The
      major drawback to pulse irrigation is that it is extremely messy and can easily contaminate
      the patient's surroundings, putting other patients and the person operating the device at
      risk. In order to obtain the benefits of pulse lavage, we have created a device that will
      contain the water spray from the lavage and protect both the patient and their surroundings.
      This study evaluates how well the device contains the spray from pulse lavage and how well
      subjects with intact skin tolerate pulse lavage when awake.

    <description>After each lavage treatment, leak will be assessed by the presence of moisture outside of the lavage chamber. The time period of evaluation will take place immediately after the lavage. The subject will not be followed after their visit is complete.</description>
