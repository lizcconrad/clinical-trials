  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      IgPro20 in subjects with primary immunodeficiency (PID) as a follow-up to the pivotal study
      ZLB06_002CR (NCT01199705).

    <measure>Median of the Individual Subject's Rate of Adverse Events (AEs) Per Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The rate was calculated by counting all newly developed or worsened AEs within a subject and dividing by the total number of IgPro20 infusions administered to this subject. Subsequently, the median of these individual AE rates per infusion was calculated. AE rates were classified (i) by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and (ii) by causal relationship to study medication (not related or unlikely related; at least possibly related [i.e., possibly related, probably related, or related]).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Rate of AEs Per Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The rate was calculated by counting all newly developed or worsened AEs during the treatment period in all subjects and dividing the total number of AEs by the total number of IgPro20 infusions administered. In addition, individual AEs were classified (i) by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and (ii) by causal relationship to study medication (not related or unlikely related; at least possibly related [i.e., possibly related, probably related, or related]). The AE rates per infusion by severity and causal relationship to study medication were calculated by dividing the number of AEs in each category by the total number of IgPro20 infusions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Infusions With Subject-assessed Tolerability of at Least 'Good'</measure>
    <time_frame>24 to 72 hours after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects assessed their overall perception of local tolerability at the infusion site throughout the study in the subject diary within a time window of 24 h to 72 h after the end of the latest infusion by assessing it as &quot;very good&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, or &quot;poor&quot;. The reported percentage represents the percentage of subjects with local tolerability assessments of &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot; at any given study infusion.</description>

    <measure>IgG Trough Level</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Rate of Clinically Documented Serious Bacterial Infections (SBIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SBIs are defined as bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia and septicemia, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial meningitis, or visceral abscess. The annualized rate was based on the total number of SBIs and the total number of subject study days for all subjects in the FAS and PPS and adjusted to 365 days.</description>

          <description>The rate was calculated by counting all newly developed or worsened AEs within a subject and dividing by the total number of IgPro20 infusions administered to this subject. Subsequently, the median of these individual AE rates per infusion was calculated. AE rates were classified (i) by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and (ii) by causal relationship to study medication (not related or unlikely related; at least possibly related [i.e., possibly related, probably related, or related]).</description>

          <population>The FAS comprised all subjects receiving at least 1 IgPro20 infusion. The PPS comprised all subjects with the disease under study who a) received uniformly repeated IgPro20 infusions at weekly intervals and b) who had at least 1 documented total serum IgG trough level.</population>
