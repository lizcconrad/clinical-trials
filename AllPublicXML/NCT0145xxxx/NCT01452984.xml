      Mohs surgery excises non-melanoma skin cancer tumors of the head and neck while preserving
      maximum healthy tissue, an advantageous characteristic when dealing with the cosmetic and
      functional cervifacial region. Yet, treatment can result in changes to function and
      appearance with effects on quality of life. This project uses Grounded Theory to explore the
      Mohs surgery experience of NMSC patients who have head and neck lesions through interview and
      observation of the surgical appointment.

      Mohs surgery offers significant benefits in excising NMSC tumors of the head and neck by
      precisely removing cancerous tissue while preserving the maximum amount of healthy tissue, a
      characteristic of particular advantage when dealing with NMSC in the highly cosmetic and
      functional cericofacial region. Despite this, few studies have explored the patient
      perspective on their experience with Mohs surgery. Futhermore, treatment for NMSC can result
      in scarring, disfigurement, and changes to function and appearance. Ramifications on identity
      and self, embodiment and aesthetics, interaction and relationships appear likely and
      consequences on function and quality of life might then follow. Using Grounded Theory, this
      project aims to explore the question &quot;what is the experience of Mohs surgery for non-melanoma
      skin cancer patients who have lesions of the head and neck?&quot; Potential patient participants
      are those diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer, who have undergone Mohs surgery or are
      scheduled to undergo Mohs surgery on skin located in any area above the shoulders, and are
      referred to the project by their surgeons. They will represent a range of disease, from those
      who have had a single Mohs surgery to those with recurrent NMSC and repeated Mohs. Patients
      will also read and speak English and be at least 18 years of age. Transcribed interviews and
      field notes will be analyzed using constant comparative technique to develop descriptive and
      theoretical understandings of how experience Mohs surgery for non-melanoma skin cancer of the
      head and nexk.

    <description>Each retrospective interview will be conducted by the Principal Investigator and/or Project Manager to collect denmographic information and experiential narratives from the patient, using open-ended questions and structured probes based on individual responses. Retrospective interviews will be recorded and scheduled at the patients' convenience either in the clinic, at the home, or at a place that is convenient to them.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Prospective Observations</arm_group_label>
    <description>Prospective Observations of clinic visits will be combined with informal interview to document conversations with their treating physicians about concerns emerging from appearance, function, and other factors that may impinge on clinical decision making and experience including quality of life. The Project Manager will be present for the clinical visit during which the Mohs surgery takes place and record field observations as well as informal interview notes in a notebook.</description>
