      Obesity is a chronic disease now considered a major public health concern in the global
      context, as it causes or exacerbates many diseases limitations in providing quality of life
      and higher treatment costs. The increase in the number of patients undergoing bariatric
      surgery and the excess skin and subcutaneous tissue adjacent to slimming collaborate in the
      search for growth by plastic surgery. Currently several techniques of thighplasty has been
      submitted but no studies were found that evaluated the characteristic clinical and emotional
      resulting from this procedure. This study has as a goal to evaluate the body image and
      quality of life in women submitted to thighplasty.
