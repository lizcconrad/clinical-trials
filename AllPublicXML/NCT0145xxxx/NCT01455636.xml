  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low birth weight (LBW) infants are particularly vulnerable to frequent infections and
      consequent morbidity resulting in sub-optimal breastfeeding, limited ingestion of
      complementary foods and ultimately micronutrient deficiencies that result in post-natal
      linear growth faltering. The objective of this study is to facilitate improved feeding
      practices through the early reduction of infections using the innovative tools of water-based
      hand sanitizer (beginning at birth) and an improved micronutrient powder (I-MNP) (beginning
      at 6 months of age). A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial will be carried
      out in Bangladesh using a 2x2 factorial design. LBW infants (n=480) will be recruited at
      birth and allocated to either HS or No HS from 0 to 6 months. From 6 to 12 months, half of
      the children in each group will be randomized to receive I-MNP. All groups will receive
      nutrition and hygiene education from birth to 12 months. Recumbent length is the primary
      outcome; morbidity, dietary intake and hemoglobin will be assessed as secondary outcomes. By
      working with BRAC, the largest implementation agency in Bangladesh, there is the opportunity
      to translate the results directly and quickly into child health programs in Bangladesh.

      General Objective To explore the relative effect of hand sanitizer and home fortification
      with an improved MNP (plus nutrition education) to prevent infections, improve feeding and
      ultimately to improve growth among LBW infants in Bangladesh.

      Specific Objectives Although the applicants clearly understand that the primary purpose of
      the Alive and Thrive RFP is to improve infant feeding, we believe that by preventing
      infections, feeding will improve and growth will accelerate. Thus our primary objective is to
      determine the relative effect of intervention packages to improve feeding and thus prevent or
      reverse linear growth faltering and reduce rates of stunting among LBW infants (Ha:
      Combination of all three interventions will improve feeding and prevent or reverse linear
      growth faltering and reduce rates of stunting)

      Secondary objectives (i) Investigate the effect of intervention packages on rates of diarrhea
      and acute respiratory tract infection (ARI).

      (Ha: Combination of all three interventions will reduce on rates of diarrhea and acute
      respiratory tract infection) (ii) Explore the effect of the intervention packages on energy
      and nutrient intakes of infants and their feeding behaviors.

      (Ha: Combination of all three interventions will increase energy and nutrient intakes of
      infants and improve the feeding behaviors) (iii) Determine the impact of the improved MNP on
      iron status (hemoglobin level in blood) in a subgroup.

      (Ha: The group receiving the improved MNP will have increased hemoglobin level in blood and
      reduced rates of anemia)

The composition is specially designed to enhance appetite and growth with 17 essential micronutrients; including calcium and magnesium, as well as an increased amount of zinc (10 mg).
