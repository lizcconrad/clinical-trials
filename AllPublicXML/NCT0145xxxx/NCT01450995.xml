    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 6 month cross over study in 50 migraine patients fulfilling
      International Headache Society Classification criteria for migraine headache with and without
      aura having 2-6 migraines per month and not over 14 days a month of headaches in the previous
      3 months. Baseline Headache Impact Test -6 (HIT-6) will be obtained and 25 patients will
      administer Treximet as needed for 3 months and then 2 Aleve and 100mg Imitrex taken
      concomitantly as needed for 3 months. The other 25 patients will administer 2 Aleve and 100mg
      Imitrex taken concomitantly as needed for 3 months and then Treximet as needed for 3 months.
      In addition to Revised Patient Perception of Migraine Questionnaire (PPMQ-R)data, a detailed
      diary will be recorded regarding number of tablets taken per attack, compliance, rescue
      treatment, when patients treated their migraine attack (mild, moderate, or severe), onset of
      pain reduction (pain relief and pain free, and 24 hour pain relief and sustained pain free
      response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A migraine headache is characterized by pain felt on one and sometimes both side(s) of the
      head. Other symptoms associated with a migraine headache may include nausea, vomiting, and
      sensitivity to light and sound. A migraine can last a few hours or up to one or two days.

      Triptan medications are currently thought to be safe and effective for acute migraine
      treatment. Treximet(tm) is a triptan tablet containing a combination of sumatriptan 85mg
      (Imitrex) and naproxen sodium 500 mg.

      This combination has two methods of action for relieving a migraine headache. It targets the
      nerves and blood vessels involved in a migraine, and relieves inflammation that may cause
      migraine pain. Treximet(tm), is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of taking Treximet(tm) as
      a combination pill to taking two Aleve(r) tablets and 100mg of Imitrex(r) as separate tablets
      taken at the same time.
