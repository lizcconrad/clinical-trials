  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators first aim is to determine the effect of low intensity exercise (without
      weight loss) on insulin sensitivity, muscle lipid metabolism, and factors regulating these
      processes in skeletal muscle after 1 day, 2 wks, 12 wks of training, and again after 3 days
      without exercise in obese adults. the investigators second aim is to determine the effect of
      combining low intensity exercise training with 10% weight loss on insulin sensitivity, muscle
      lipid metabolism, and factors regulating these processes in skeletal muscle.

      Although a single 40 minute session of exercise at a low exercise intensity will not improve
      insulin sensitivity, the investigators anticipate adaptations after two weeks of exercise
      training (6 session/wk; 12 session total) will improve insulin sensitivity and be accompanied
      by a reduction in fatty acid intermediates and a reduction in markers for pro-inflammatory
      activation in muscle. the investigators anticipate changes in insulin sensitivity, fatty acid
      partitioning, and pro-inflammatory markers the day after the last session of a 12 wk training
      program (without weight-loss) will be similar to that measured after 2 weeks of training. the
      investigators anticipate insulin sensitivity, accumulation of fatty acid intermediates, and
      pro-inflammatory activation will be markedly improved after 10% weight loss when measured the
      day after exercise. the investigators would expect the improvements in Insulin sensitivity,
      accumulation of fatty acid intermediates, and markers of inflammatory stress will be
      significantly attenuated when measured 3 days after the most recent exercise session, but
      beneficial effects of 10% weight loss on these metabolic endpoints will persist when compared
      with before weight loss.

    <description>During the first 12 weeks of the study, subjects will adhere to an exercise training program while maintaining their original body weight. The exercise training program will entail the following: 40min/session, ~50% of their maximal aerobic capacity (approximately 100-110 beats per min), 5-6 days/week
After the first 12 weeks in the study, subjects will continue with the same exercise program, but then they will be placed on a reduced calorie diet until they lose exactly 10% of their original body weight</description>
