  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of G protein-coupled receptor GPR119 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1)release from the intestinal L-cells. Previously, administration of 2-oleyl-glycerol
      (2-OG) to humans significantly increased plasma GLP-1. In the present study we want to test
      the effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that we will expect to find a
      significant increased plasma GLP-1 following a meal containing of 2-OG when compared to meals
      containing of olive oil or carbohydrates alone.

      Activation of G protein-coupled receptor GPR119 stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1)release from the intestinal L-cells. Previously, administration of 2-oleyl-glycerol
      (2-OG) to humans significantly increased plasma GLP-1. In the present study we want to test

      significant increased plasma GLP-1 following a meal containing of 2-OG when compared to meals
      containing of olive oil or carbohydrates alone. The aim of the study is to elucidate the
      effect of 2-OG, 'diet oil' on GLP-1 secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes and to explain
      the mechanism behind the known stimulation of GLP-1 release by dietary fat.
