    <textblock>
      Septic shock is in critically ill patients is a condition associated with a high rate of
      organ failure and hereto attributable mortality ~45-55% Hypothesis: Mild Induced Hypothermia
      reduces the mortality of critically ill patients with septic shock by reducing organ
      metabolism, counteracting on microcirculatory thrombosis, genetically downregulating tissue
      apoptosis and by reducing bacterial growth rate and toxin production.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is an acute life-threatening condition, with great organ damage for every hour.
      The patients have a high risk of dying and therefore rapid treatment is of crucial importance
      for survival of the patients.

      Septic shock is mainly due to a collapse in the blood circulation (the capillary system) due
      to blockage by blood cells - a process initiated by substances from the cells of the immune
      system via activation of coagulation. The normal function of the smallest blood vessels is to
      transport oxygen, nutrients and drugs to organs and tissues, and lead waste products away.
      While the offer of oxygen and nutrients to the organs decreases, the consumption of oxygen
      and nutrients increases due to fever and immune reactions.

      When the capillary system collapses, the organs and tissues suffer, and various forms of cell
      death in the organs begins including &quot;programmed cell death&quot; (&quot;apoptosis&quot;). This leads to
      organ damage, for example brain damage or kidney damage and ultimately to multiple organ
      dysfunction which is the direct cause of the patient dies.

      Mild induced hypothermia (cooling to 32 0C-34 0C) affects at least 5 core areas in the
      pathophysiology of septic shock: 1) inhibition of inflammation 2) inhibition of apoptosis
      (&quot;programmed cell death&quot;), 3) antithrombotic, 4) decreases the metabolism and 5) inhibits
      bacterial growth and production of toxins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged &gt; 50 years of age.

          2. Severe sepsis /septic shock = SIRS + suspected infection+hypotension Mean Arterial
             Blood Pressure (MAP) &lt;70 mmHg,

          3. Admitted to the participating intensive care units (ICU)

          4. Indication for intubation

          5. Possibility of inclusion within 6 hours after septic shock/severe sepsis is diagnosed
             in the ICU. Patients admitted with septic shock/severe sepsis should be included
             within 6 hours after admission. If a patient is not included within this period, that
             patient cannot be included within the same hospitalization.

          6. The patient must have an expected stay in the ICU of more than 24 hours. Anticipated
             death within 24 hours after admission to the ICU does not exclude participation;
             however no decision of reduction of treatment level must have been taken. During this
             time period, probability that the patient is discharged to a floor department must not
             be likely (&lt;10% probability).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients are pregnant or breast feeding

          2. The findings of the initial screening, shows that the patient has a bleeding disorder
             and/or the patient has an uncontrollable bleeding and /or surgery within the last 24
             hours

          3. Persons who are detained under the Act on the use of coercion in psychiatry
