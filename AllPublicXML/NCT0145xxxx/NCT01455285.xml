      Hypothesis: What is the best modulation of pulse frequency in transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation in dysmenorrhea? Purpose: To determine the effect of hypoalgesia frequency
      modulation pulse by transcutaneous electrical nerve (TENS) in dysmenorrhea. Methods: A
      controlled clinical study and prospective developed at the School of Physiotherapy Clinic /
      UFPI. Forty students were randomized into four distinct groups of the modulation frequency
      TENS: group 1 - 100 Hz, 100μs, group 2 - 4 Hz, 100μs, group 3 - placebo (apparatus off),
      group 4 - placebo induced (2 Hz, 40μs). All were initially evaluated by a questionnaire
      developed for the study, the visual analogue scale (VAS) (before, after 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
      minutes) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (before and after 20 minutes). The total duration
      of TENS application was 20 minutes and all protocols were performed in a single session. The
      analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) followed by the Tukey procedure was applied to identify
      differences between experimental groups for each variable analyzed. The level of significance
      was p&lt; 0,05.
