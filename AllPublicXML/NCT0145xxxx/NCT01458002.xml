    <textblock>
      This study targets two major risk factors for cancer; is designed to treat the behaviors on a
      population basis, using proactive recruitment strategies; intervenes on multiple behaviors
      simultaneously, thereby producing greater impacts for cancer prevention; utilizes one of the
      most promising approaches to low cost population based interventions for health-related
      behavior change, namely the internet; and develops and tests a promising new approach to
      increasing the utilization and effectiveness of internet-based interventions, relational
      agents. The primary aims are: (1) To develop and assess the effectiveness of a tailored
      internet intervention on a national sample; (2) To develop and assess the effectiveness of
      the internet intervention enhanced by a relational agent; and (3) To determine if the
      intervention with the relational agent can outperform the regular tailored internet
      intervention.

      The overarching goal of this research project is to revise and enhance a multimedia
      computer-based multiple risk factor intervention for cancer prevention, using the internet to
      reach a general population. Two innovative, individualized, easily disseminated, low-cost,
      and interactive interventions, both for multiple behaviors (sun protection and exercise
      adoption), will be developed and evaluated in comparison to a control condition. The first
      intervention involves adapting our effective multimedia expert system interventions to the
      internet environment. The second intervention builds on the first with the additional
      inclusion of a Relational Agent, a recently developed computer-based approach to establishing
      a personal relationship typically missing on internet sites. Both systems will employ the
      same theoretical model of behavior change, the Transtheoretical Model, as the deep knowledge,
      and all systems will employ empirically based decision rules. The design is a 3 Group
      (Control, Internet, Internet plus Relational Agent) x 3 Occasions (0, 12, 24 â€¢ Months) with
      intervention occurring during the first 12 months. A representative national sample of 1639
      individuals at risk for both behaviors will be recruited. The primary aims are: (1) To
      develop and assess the effectiveness of a tailored internet intervention on a national
      sample; (2) To develop and assess the effectiveness of the internet intervention enhanced by
      a relational agent; and (3) To determine if the intervention with the relational agent can
      outperform the regular tailored internet intervention. The secondary aims are: (1) To
      determine if the two interventions are differentially effective with each behavior and with
      different subgroups, and (2) To determine if the relational agent intervention is utilized
      more often for increasing exercise than for sun protection. This study targets two major risk
      factors for cancer; is designed to treat the behaviors on a population basis, using proactive
      recruitment strategies; intervenes on multiple behaviors simultaneously, thereby producing
      greater impacts for cancer prevention; utilizes one of the most promising approaches to low
      cost population based interventions for health-related behavior change, namely the internet;
      and develops and tests a promising new approach to increasing the utilization and
      effectiveness of internet-based interventions, relational agents.

    <description>Regular Exercise is defined as any planned physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, aerobics, jogging, bicycling, swimming, rowing, basketball, etc.) performed to increase physical fitness. Such activity should be performed 5 times or more per week for 30 minutes per session, consistent with CDC guidelines.</description>

    <time_frame>Percentage of baseline at-risk participants who reach the Sun Protection criteria at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Consistently protecting themselves from the sun every time they were out in the sun for 15+ minutes is defined as 1) using sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more, wearing protective clothing (for example, a hat with a wide brim, shirts, and pants), and avoiding or limiting exposure to the sun during the mid-day hours (10 am - 4 pm).</description>
