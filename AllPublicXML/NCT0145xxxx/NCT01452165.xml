      The main purposes of this study are:

        -  to describe the prevalence and degree of reduced left ventricular function and
           hypertrophy in patients with peripheral arterial disease in comparison to controls from
           the general population,

        -  to evaluate factors of importance to left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy in
           patients with peripheral arterial disease, and

        -  to assess the impact of cardiac function and left ventricular hypertrophy on long-term
           prognosis in patients with peripheral artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular dysfunction is often a consequence of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is
      prevalent among patients with peripheral artery disease. However, there is limited data
      regarding left ventricular morphology and function in those patients. In the cross-sectional
      part of this study we will describe the prevalence of reduced cardiac function and left
      ventricular hypertrophy in a cohort of patients with peripheral artery disease. The patient
      outcomes will be compared to control subjects randomly selected from the general population
      in a case-control design. Further, clinical and genetic determinants of cardiac dysfunction
      in the patient cohort will be identified. In the longitudinal part of the study, the impact
      of cardiac function and morphology on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity will be
      evaluated in the cohort.
