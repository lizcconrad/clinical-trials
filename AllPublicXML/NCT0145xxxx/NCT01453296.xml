    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of dosing with 25 μg GW642444, an orally inhaled
      long-acting agonist of the β2-adrenoceptor, in asthmatic subjects aged 5 to 11. GW642444 is
      currently under development as the long-acting beta-agonist component of a combination
      product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and a longacting beta-agonist.

      Subjects will receive a single dose via a novel dry powder inhaler, then 7 days once-daily
      repeat dosing following a washout period. The study will be a randomized two-way crossover,
      with a placebo control. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the
      aim that 20 will complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose and
      potassium levels will be investigated.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled into one of two cohorts based upon age; the younger cohort was enrolled after a review of the safety/pharmacokinetic data of at least six participants from the older cohort. Each participant was assigned to treatment randomly; assignment was not to be influenced by whether participants were in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A Baseline assessment was carried out on Day 1 of the first treatment period. Participants were then randomized to one of the two possible treatment sequences (Vilanterol [VI] 25 micrograms [µg] followed by matching Placebo; matching placebo followed by VI 25 µg) in a 1:1 ratio in an AB or BA sequence.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Heart Rate at Day 1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Heart rate (HR) was measured at Day 1 and Day 14 of the respective treatment period. hr=hour. Weighted means were derived using the linear trapezoidal rule. Actual relative times were used for the calculation except where actual times were missing. If any actual times were missing, planned relative times were used for these observations. For 0-8 hr parameters, treatment, period, participant Baseline, and period Baseline were fitted as fixed effects, and participant was fitted as a random effect. For 0-2 hr parameters, treatment, period, day (1 and 14), participant Baseline, period Baseline, and treatment*day interaction were fitted as fixed effects, and participant was fitted as a random effect. Subject 2308 received VI 25 µg in both treatment periods, and contributed twice to the summary of VI 25 µg (n=28).</description>

        <title>Distance of Assessment on Day 1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>During the pharyngometry assessment, participants inhaled through a wavetube, which had a mouthpiece with the same dimensions as the mouthpiece on the dry powder inhaler used for this study. This technique was used to measure the size of the throat and mouth (oropharynx) in the form of pharyngograms. Distance of assessment is defined as the distance (length measured in centimeters [cm]) estimated to be from the lips to the larynx. Pharyngometry data were recorded for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period) using the mean of four measurements (pharyngograms), and the average oropharyngeal cross-sectional area was calculated.</description>

        <description>During the inhalation profile assessment, participants inhaled through a mouthpiece from a device with a similar resistance to the dry powder inhaler used for this study. Average flow rate is defined as the average inspiratory flow rate (Liters [L]/min) across the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler. PIFR is defined as the Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (L/min) of the inhalation profile when inhaling across the resistance of the inhaler.The pressure drop during the inhalation was measured, and the inhalation profiles (pressure drop versus time profile) of the participants were obtained. The mean of the two inhalation profile measurements was used for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period), and the average flow rate and PIFR were determined. Subject 2308 received VI 25 µg in both treatment periods, and contributed twice to the summary of VI 25 µg.</description>

        <title>Inhaled Volume on Day 1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>During the inhalation profile assessment, participants inhaled through a mouthpiece from a device with a similar resistance to the dry powder inhaler used for this study. Inhaled volume is defined as the volume of air (Liters) inhaled during the inhalation across the resistance of the inhaler.
The pressure drop during the inhalation was measured, and the inhalation profiles (pressure drop versus time profile) of the participants were obtained. The mean of the two inhalation profile measurements was used for each day (Days 1 and 14 of the respective treatment period), and the inhalaled volume was determined. Subject 2308 received VI 25 µg in both treatment periods, and contributed twice to the summary of VI 25 µg.</description>

        <title>Total Emitted Dose (TED) on Day 1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The total emitted dose (TED) is defined as the mass (micrograms) of the nominal dose that passes beyond the throat. The recorded inhalation profiles of the participants and the mouth-throat (oropharyngeal) models of the sizes that approximated to pharyngometry measurements of the participants were used in conjunction with the electronic Lung (eLung) for in vitro assessment. The eLung is a breathing simulator that replicates the selected inhalation profile with an active inhaler placed at the lips end of the selected ororpharyngeal model. After the dose is emitted from the inhaler, the analysis and assay of throat deposition and material passing beyond the throat was used to derive the nominal, minimum, and maximum predicted total emitted dose.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean QTcF at Day 1 and Day 14 of the Respective Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The electrocardiographic (ECG) parameter QT duration corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) was measured at Day 1 and Day 14 of the respective treatment period. hr=hour. Actual relative times were used for the calculation except where actual times were missing. If any actual times were missing, planned relative times were used for these observations. For 0-8 hr parameters, treatment, period, participant Baseline, and period Baseline were fitted as fixed effects, and participant was fitted as a random effect. For 0-2 hr parameters, treatment, period, day (1 and 14), participant Baseline, period Baseline, and treatment*day interaction were fitted as fixed effects, and participant was fitted as a random effect. Subject 2308 received VI 25 µg in both treatment periods, and contributed twice to the summary of VI 25 µg (n=28).</description>
