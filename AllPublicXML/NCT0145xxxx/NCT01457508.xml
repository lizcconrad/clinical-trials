      This study will assess the immunogenicity and safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals'
      (formerly SB Biologicals') DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa™) vaccine compared with separate
      administration of DTPa-HBV-IPV (Infanrix penta™) and Hib (Hiberix™) vaccine administered at
      3, 5 and 11 (or 12) months of age.

             examination before entering into the study.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parents or guardians of the subject after
             they have been advised of the risks and benefits of the study in a language which they
             clearly understood, and before performance of any study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply at the

             vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Administration of chronic immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             three months before vaccination.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study within 30 days before each dose

          -  Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio and/or
             Hib disease.

          -  History of /or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio and/or
             Hib disease or infection.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine, including allergic reactions to neomycin and polymyxin B.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  History of seizures or of any neurological disease at study entry.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth, or planned
             administration during the study period.

          -  Acute disease at time of enrolment
