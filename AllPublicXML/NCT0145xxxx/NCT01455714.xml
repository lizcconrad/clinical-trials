      Finding early predictors of myocardial in patients with hypertension

        1. Scientific objective The study objective is to clarify the grounds of heart exertional
           dyspnoea stenocardial pain in patients with well-controlled stage I or II hypertension
           according to ESH (European Society of Hypertension), without changes in epicardial
           coronary arteries in coronary angiography and normal resting echocardiography result,
           and to assess of potential early markers of heart hypertrophy and failure in patients
           with hypertension.

           Characteristics of the final result The study is to allow for identification of patients
           with hypertension, in whom an early introduction of pharmacological treatment of heart
           failure should be considered. Evaluation in the detection of asymptomatic myocardial
           dysfunction will include potential heart failure markers such as: cardiotrophin 1,
           cystatin C, serum syndecan-4, collagen III N-terminal propetide [PIIINP], MMP-2, MMP-7,
           MMP-8, MMP-9 and NT-proBNP, modern echocardiography methods and magnetic resonance
           imaging in order to increase the effectiveness of prevention, diagnosis and treatment
           optimalization.

        2. Project significance Prognosis in heart failure is very serious. It is similar or worse
           than in advanced cancer. These data indicate an extreme importance of the optimal early
           causal treatment of hypertension and symptomatic treatment of heart failure early stage
           in order to prevent the development advanced form of the disease, which has bad
           prognosis. In clinical practice, patients with well-controlled hypertension often report
           exercise limitation, exertional dyspnea and/or stenocardial pain which is not reflected
           in a standard resting echocardiography (normal result), without coronary artery disease
           data in electrocardiographic stress test and without change in epicardial coronary
           vessels in coronary angiography. The study is designed to establish the panel of
           diagnostic tests in patients with hypertension and exertional dyspnoea only, which will
           allow for early detection of abnormalities (before symptoms occur) and the start of the
           optimal treatment for these patients. Unfortunately, still too small percentage of
           patients receives full pharmacotherapy, hence the authors of the latest guidelines of
           procedure in heart failure and hypertension put great emphasis on this aspect. Optimal
           management may prevent the progression of these patients in stage C heart failure, and
           thus bring tangible benefits not only the patients themselves but also, by reducing the
           number of costly hospitalizations, significantly reduce health care costs. The number of
           hospitalizations for heart failure in Poland is estimated at 100 000 per year, and
           hospitalization costs exceed 70% of the total costs associated with the treatment of
           heart failure. The issue of exertional dyspnoea and overt heart failure in patients with
           hypertension and normal results of resting echocardiography is a new problem, both in
           Poland and in the world.

      So far, there are no treatment recommendations for this group of patients. Material and study
      plan 120 persons (age 40-60 years old) will be included in the study, patients with stage I
      or II primary hypertension according to the European Society of Hypertension: Group A- 40
      patients without symptoms of heart failure Group B- 40 patients with exertional dyspnoea
      Group C - 40 patients with overt heart failure

      In group B (patients with exertional dyspnea/stenocardia) we will include only patients who
      have undergone contrast coronary angiography without any identified changes in the epicardial
      coronary arteries, which will facilitate answering the presented purpose of research.
      Patients in groups A and B with normal resting echocardiography and treated with a maximum of
      2 antihypertensive drugs (an ACE inhibitor or a sartan as therapy base), according to the
      following regimen:

      ACEI/ARB + diuretic ACEI/ARB + calcium channel antagonist Group C - treatment in accordance
      with the standards for heart failure. Each patient will be informed about the objectives of
      the study and give written consent to participate.

      After signing informed consent patients will have performed the following tests:

        -  Interview and documentation analysis,

        -  Physical examination,

        -  Electrocardiogram,

        -  24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),

        -  24-hour EKG recording,

        -  Echocardiography at rest and during submaxinal exercise on a bicycle ergometer,

        -  Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD),

        -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging,

        -  Standard labolatory parameters,

        -  Levels of markers: cystatin C, cardiotrophin-1, metaloproteinases: MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-8,
           MMP-9, Procollagen III N-Terminal Propeptide (PIIINP), Syndecan 4 (SDC4) and NT-proBNP
           Each patient will be informed about the objectives of the study and give written consent
           to participate.

      The concept and plan of study

        1. The attempt to clarify the grounds of heart exertional dyspnoea stenocardial pain in
           patients with well-controlled stage I or II hypertension according to ESH (European
           Society of Hypertension), without changes in epicardial coronary arteries in coronary
           angiography and normal resting echocardiography.

        2. MRI evaluation of coronary microcirculation and endothelial function assessed by
           flow-dependent vasodilation in hypertensive patients with and without heart failure
           symptoms.

        3. Comparison of modern echocardiographic methods and magnetic resonance imaging in the
           diagnosis of hypertensive patients with and without overt heart failure.

        4. Cystatin C as a new marker of organ damage in patients with hypertension and comparison
           of cystatin C with GFR assessed by MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance on as
           renal function assessment indicators in patients with hypertension.

        5. Evaluation of new markers - cardiotrophin 1 and cystatin C, serum syndecan-4, collagen
           III N-terminal propetide [PIIINP], MMP-2, MMP-7,MMP-8, MMP-9 and NT-proBNP in the early
           diagnosis of heart failure.

        6. Potential markers of heart failure, modern echocardiography methods and magnetic
           resonance imaging in the detection of asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction in order to
           increase the effectiveness of prevention and treatment.

        7. Searching for the relationship between the type of hypertension (dipper or non-dipper)
           and the development of heart failure symptoms, and whether there are differences between
           the echocardiographic images of these patients?

        8. Selection of patients with hypertension, in whom an early introduction of
           pharmacological treatment of heart failure should be considered.

        9. The study will also help answer the following questions: (a) Which parameters best
           assess the overall cardiovascular risk? and (b) When the treatment of heart failure in
           patients with hypertension should start.

      The measurable effect of this research besides cognitive is to the possibility of reducing
      the proportion of patients who come to overt heart failure connected with hypertension
      through the optimization of preventive, diagnostic methods and to determine the optimum
      treatment in these patients.
