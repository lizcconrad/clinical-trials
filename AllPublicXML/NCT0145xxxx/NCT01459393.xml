    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare in a prospective and randomized way actinic keratosis treatment
      with 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy versus cryotherapy, from the standpoint of
      therapeutic efficacy, pain, and cosmetic results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratosis is a skin lesion induced by chronic sun exposure with a significant
      prevalence and malignant potential for squamous cell carcinoma, which makes essential its
      treatment. Today there are several possible therapies, where cryotherapy is usually applied
      in our practice. Photodynamic therapy (PDT)is another method also widespread for keratosis
      which involves the administration of a topical precursor drug which produces endogenous
      photosensitising substances activated by specific light, selectively destroying the diseased
      tissue. This study aims to evaluate the use the drug formulation for photodynamic therapy
      5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) associated with dimethyl sulfoxide, comparing its efficacy with
      conventional cryotherapy, and also pain and cosmetic results. This project enrolled 137
      outpatients from the Department of Cutaneous Oncology of Barretos Cancer Hospital - Pio XII
      Foundation, with symmetrical and comparable keratosis in their upper limbs. With the same
      patient as controls, side arm and therapy to be used were randomized: cryotherapy or
      photodynamic therapy. For cryotherapy was utilized bottles of liquid nitrogen (Cry-ac,
      500ml); and for photodynamic therapy was utilized incoherent red light lamp with a total
      dosis of 37J/cm² . There was one or two sessions of each therapy , at 0 and 3 months; and
      three assessments for evaluation were done at 0, 3 and 6 months of onset. The evaluations on
      efficacy were in terms of area regression, and classified as complete response or no
      response. Pain was assessed by visual analogue scale, and numerical scale. Cosmesis was
      evaluated with the presence or not, objectively, of hyper, hypopigmentation or scar
      retraction. Finally, patient's preference regarding utilized therapeutics was noted by the
      researcher.

    <description>Pain was evaluated with a Visual Analogic Scale (blind) and a graduated scale. It was evaluated at the time 0 and 15 minutes after each intervention (Cryotherapy or PDT): at the first intervention (0 months), and at the second intervention if the residual lesion that indicates a second session (3 months).
And at the third interwiew (6 months) there was no intervention, but the patients who was submitted to 2 interventions were requested about what intervention was more painfull (the first or the second one).</description>

Cosmesis was evaluated subjetively also by the researcher as one of the possibilities: aesthetic outcome awfull, bad, regular, good, excellent.
And there was and objective evaluation of cosmesis by the researcher, the presece or absence of one or more of these criteria: hypochromia, hyperpigmentation,hyperemia, scar.</description>

After a 4 hours interval under light protection with plastic film and aluminum foil, the light protection and the emulsion is removed. Then the lesion is lightened with a red (630 nm) incoherent LED lamp AKTILITE CL 128 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway) with a total light dose of 37J/cm2.After that dressings are done and kept for 24H, and removed at patient home.</description>
