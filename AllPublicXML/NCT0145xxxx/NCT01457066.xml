  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to culturally adapt and tailor an existing, theory-based
      intervention, using state-of-the-art methods designed to maximize cultural sensitivity,
      feasibility and acceptability to HIV+ Latino MSM, and to test it in a small randomized
      controlled trial (n=60 intervention; n=60 control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While early receipt of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy are critical for effective HIV
      treatment, engagement with and retention in HIV care are essential first steps. Retention in
      HIV care is particularly important for traditionally disadvantaged groups, such as Latino
      MSMs, who are over-represented in the HIV epidemic. HIV+ Latino MSM therefore urgently need
      interventions to improve their retention in HIV care, which may be affected by a number of
      culture-specific factors. The goal of this proposal is to culturally adapt and tailor an
      existing, theory-based intervention, using state-of-the-art methods designed to maximize
      cultural sensitivity, feasibility and acceptability to HIV+ Latino MSM, and to test it in a
      small randomized controlled trial (n=60 intervention; n=60 control). The study will be
      conducted among insufficiently retained HIV+ Latino MSM at AltaMed, the largest provider of
      HIV medical services for Latinos in Los Angeles. The proposed intervention is designed to
      retain participants in HIV care by addressing barriers to and facilitators of HIV care
      salient to Latinos, using group-based as well as one-on-one, peer-based learning approaches.
