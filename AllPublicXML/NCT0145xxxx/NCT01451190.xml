          -  Agree to abstain from use of any hair growth affecting oral or topical medication
             including over the counter and herbal medications, minoxidil, finasteride or

          -  Subjects who have used minoxidil or any oral or topical medication including over the
             counter and herbal medications for the treatment of hair loss within 6 months of study
             screening, or finasteride or dutasteride within 12 months of study screening.

          -  A history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year of study enrollment.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days or six half lives of

          -  Prior surgery in the donor or study areas.

          -  Insufficient hair or scarring in the donor area that might impact cell growth.

          -  Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,
