  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to analyze the resolution rate of benign biliary strictures due
      to chronic pancreatitis after temporary insertion of unflared-ends and flared-ends fully
      covered self-expandable metal stents.

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic treatment of benign biliary strictures include the placement of plastic stents or
      Self-Expandable Metal Stents. Long term results of placement of a single plastic stent are
      disappointing. Better results have been obtained by endoscopic insertion of multiple plastic
      stents.

      Biliary Self-Expandable Metal Stents used for malignant strictures are uncovered or partially
      covered with a plastic coating. More recently, fully covered SEMS have been developed and are
      now available on the market and due to their removability are proposed also for benign
      indications.

      Uncovered and partially covered biliary Self-Expandable Metal Stents for chronic
      pancreatitis-related benign biliary strictures on long-term may clog due to tissue ingrowth
      through the uncovered meshes.

      Removable fully covered Self-Expandable Metal Stents seem to be an attractive option for
      CP-related BBS, but scarce data are available in the literature.

      The investigators conducted a feasibility, prospective, tertiary single-centre trial to
      investigate the durable resolution of chronic pancreatitis-related benign biliary strictures
      after temporary insertion of FC SEMS with unflared-ends and flared-ends.
