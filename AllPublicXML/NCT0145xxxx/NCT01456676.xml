  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of administering the combination of
      nilotinib and LDE225 to patients with chronic or accelerated phase of chronic myeloid
      leukemia and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose
      level (RP2D) of LDE225 in combination with nilotinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML in chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase
             (AP)with resistance to at least one prior BCR-ABL targeting TKI

          2. Documented chronic phase CML

          3. Adequate end organ function

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             and must be using highly effective methods of contraception. Male patients with female
             partners of child-bearing potential must use condoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Impaired cardiac function

          2. Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent disease that in the opinion of the investigator
             could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol

          3. History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of study entry or past medical history of
             chronic pancreatitis

          4. Patients actively receiving therapy with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers, and
             the treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication
             prior to entering the study

          5. Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any medications that have the
             potential to prolong the QT interval and the treatment cannot be either safely
             discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to starting study drug.

          6. Previously documented BCR-ABL Y253H, E255K/V, T315I or F359C/V mutation
