      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      intravesical cis-urocanic acid in patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle invasive
      bladder cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, dose-escalating, Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of intravesical cis-urocanic acid (cis-UCA) in patients with primary or
      recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      The primary objectives is to evaluate safety and tolerability of cis-UCA after a single
      intravesical instillation with escalating doses and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of cis-UCA after a single intravesical instillation
      with escalating doses.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetics of cis-UCA after a single
      intravesical instillation with escalating doses, to obtain preliminary information on
      possible anti-tumor effects of cis-UCA by cystoscopy and histological evaluation after a
      single intravesical instillation with escalating doses, and to evaluate the effects of
      cis-UCA on different surrogate biochemical markers on tumor growth and differentiation after
      a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses.

      The key eligibility criteria are the following: Patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle
      invasive bladder cancer; eligible for intravesical treatment; age 18-80 years; WHO
      performance status 0-2; acceptable liver, renal and hematological function within 30 days
      prior to inclusion.

      At minimum 3 patients and at maximum 24 patients is planned to be included in the study. The
      fixed dose-escalation levels will be used.

      Up to three dose cohorts are planned to be included:

        -  Cohort I: 2% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 3, max 12 patients

        -  Cohort II: 4% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients

        -  Cohort III: 6% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients

             drug intravesical instillation for one hour

          4. Severe irritative voiding symptoms, such as urgency, frequency and nocturia that could
             compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Urologist/Investigator
