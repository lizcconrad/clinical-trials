  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that 5-10% of Hepatitis B Virus vaccine recipients produce none
      or to few antibodies after a standard immunization with 3 vaccines. These individuals are
      defined as non-responders. The investigators wish to investigate if mounting another kind of
      immune response, called the cellular immune (CMI) response, protects these non-responders.

      Aim/Hypothesis

      Primary aims:

        1. To estimate the CMI response in serologic non-responders after receiving a standard
           course of HBV immunization

           Secondary aims:

        2. To establish the prevalence of serological non-responders after a standard course of HBV
           vaccination.

        3. To assess the safety of the vaccine.

        4. Evaluate predictors of serologic non-response in young, healthy individuals receiving a
           standard course of HBV immunization

        5. To compare the immunological profile before and after a standard HBV vaccination regimen
           on non-responders and responders

        6. Establish a rapid test for measuring CMI after being HBV vaccinated.

      A total of 400 healthy volunteers receive a standard course of immunization with a combined
      hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix®) at 0, 1, and 6 months. Blood is drawn at 0 and 8 months
      from all participants. The blood will be analysed to see if there is antibodies or/and if
      there is mounted a cellular immune response by measuring on parameters called cytokines.
