  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study rationale: Sensory/behavioural elements of smoking play a role in smoking behaviour and
      may have a potential to assist smoking cessation. Among current treatments for smokers, only
      the nicotine inhalator is attempting to address such factors. The inhalator's efficacy does
      not exceed that of the other NRT products, but it mimics the relevant sensory input to only a
      limited extent, and its nicotine delivery is dependent on intensive puffing. Recently a new
      product, the Electronic Cigarette (E-C) has become available, which provides a more realistic
      behaviour and sensory replacement for smoking and can provide good nicotine levels with less
      effort.

      Primary objective: To compare E-C and nicotine inhalator in their effects on tobacco
      withdrawal symptoms over 24hr abstinence.

      Hypotheses: E-C will be more effective than the inhalator in reducing withdrawal symptoms and
      craving and elicit more favorable user ratings. It will also provide higher nicotine levels.

      Study design: In a cross-over study, participants will be randomized to the sequence of
      conditions and provide baseline measures and samples for salivary cotinine analysis. They
      will be asked to abstain from smoking their usual cigarettes and use the allocated product
      over 24 hours. They will return to the study centre the following day, and complete measures
      of craving and withdrawal, ratings of subjective and sensory effects of the products, product
      satisfaction, and adverse effects. They will also provide saliva samples for cotinine
      analysis. Abstinence from smoking will be verified with CO readings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable interest in E-Cs at the moment and the study would provide information
      on whether the E-C surpasses the tried and tested nicotine inhalator. If so, it would open a
      possibility of its utilization in smoking cessation, and provide encouragement for further
      examination of the role of sensorimotor replacements in the treatment of tobacco dependence.

    <description>Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS; West &amp; Hajek, 2004): Measure of severity of urges to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms. MPSS is a rating scale sensitive to tobacco, and to both pharmacological (West, Hajek et al. 1990) and behavioral (McRobbie and Hajek 2007) treatment effects. Effective treatments typically generate a difference in ratings over 24-hours of abstinence of at least 0.7 compared to control procedures.</description>

    <description>We analysed 15 brands of the most popular E-Cs in the UK, EU and US for nicotine levels in the mist. Vapours were generated from cartridges of various nicotine content using a standard single-port linear smoking machine with a puff volume of 70 ml, 1 puff every 7 sec., and a puff duration of 1.8 sec (based on averaged puffing conditions from 10 E-C users found during preliminary studies). Nicotine was absorbed in two sequential washing bottles with methanol and internal standards and analysed with gas chromatography. One brand was selected for this study as it consistently delivers about 1mg of nicotine with 20 puffs.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The inhalator consists of a nicotine cartridge which is placed into a plastic mouthpiece. One cartridge contains 10mg of nicotine of which 4mg of nicotine can be extracted. Nicotine is delivered mainly through the oral cavity, throat, and upper respiratory tract with a minor fraction reaching the lungs. A single cartridge can be used for one 20-minute period of continuous puffing or periodic use of up to 400 puffs per cartridge.</description>
