    <textblock>
      The purpose of this US FDA post-marketing commitment study is to evaluate the safety of
      MenACWY-CRM among 50.000 vaccinated adolescents within a large US Healthcare Maintenance
      Organization who received MenACWY-CRM vaccination as part of their routine clinical care. The
      pre-specified 26 events of interest are events commonly evaluated in vaccine safety studies
      and include certain neurological, immunological, vascular, musculoskeletal and hematologic
      disorders. All events are collected retrospectively.
