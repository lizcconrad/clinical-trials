      The study objective of this open label, multicenter study is to provide access to NKTR-102
      treatment to subjects previously enrolled in a NKTR-102 study who are without signs of
      disease progression since receiving NKTR-102.

      In addition the study will evaluate the safety of continued exposure to NKTR-102, observe
      disease status and survival status in subjects receiving NKTR-102, and evaluate the efficacy
      of NKTR-102 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
