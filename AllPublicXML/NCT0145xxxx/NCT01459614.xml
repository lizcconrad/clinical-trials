      Primary Objectives

      To assess the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine, taxotere, and xeloda (GTX) with
      cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the progression-free
      survival (PFS) rate at 6 month.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess safety and characterize toxicities of the combination of GTX with cisplatin in
           subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        -  To estimate 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 month disease control rate (DCR), PFS, and overall
           survival (OS).

      Study Design

      This study is a single arm phase II study to assess the efficacy of GTX with cisplatin in
      subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Approximately 38 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled, 28 in the initial cohort and 10 in the expansion cohort

      The study will have a safety run-in phase consisting of 6 subjects. To ensure that the
      combination is safe, the first six subjects will be treated at DL1 and observed for limiting
      toxicity for the first 2 cycles before continuation with further accrual. After the safety
      run-in, the study will be continuously monitored for adverse events.

      The primary endpoint will be the PFS rate at 6 month, which is defined as the proportion of
      subjects alive, free of disease progression at 6 months. The treatment regimen would be
      considered of insufficient activity for further study in this population if PFS rate at 6
      months is 50% or less, and the minimum required level of efficacy that would warrant further
      study with the proposed regimen is a 75% PFS rate at 6 months. The study design includes
      interim monitoring for futility using a predictive probability approach. We will stop the
      study early if given the information at the interim analysis, it is unlikely that the PFS
      rate at 6 months will be greater than 50% if the study continues to the end.
