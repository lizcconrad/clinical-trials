  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This international, prospective, observational, open-label, pharmaco-epidemiologic study
      observes cancer patients at risk for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (FN) who are
      receiving filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006) for primary or secondary FN prophylaxis to better
      describe the patient population at risk for FN and treated prophylactically in physician's
      best clinical judgement with filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006), to describe prophylaxis patterns
      involving filgrastim biosimilar (EP2006), and to evaluate hematology levels and variability
      in hematological outcomes, impact on chemotherapy delivery, radiotherapy, surgery, and
      mortality. Additionally the study aims to identify patient cohorts who are vulnerable to poor
      response to FN prophylaxis and experience break-through episodes of FN, understand the
      differences between prophylaxis responders and non-responders, and describe the degree to
      which prophylaxis of FN is in congruence with guideline recommendations.

Chemotherapy regimens were classified for FN risk (&lt;10% risk, 10-20% risk or &gt;20% risk) according to the published rates in the EORTC Guidelines under consideration of agent(s) and schedules.

A two-group solution converged and the groups differentiated on key baseline variables. However, the group sizes were too unevenly distributed for further analysis with the &quot;high risk group&quot; comprised of only 3.0% of the evaluable sample.

ECOG score is a severity scale from 0 to 5 (highest) to grade toxicity and is defined as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life-threatening, 5=lethal. ECOG is described in more detail by Oken et al, Am J Clin Oncol (CCT) 5:649-655, 1982.

          <description>Objective 7: To identify different latent clusters of end-stage cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and being treated with EP2006 for the treatment or primary or secondary prophylaxis of FN using statistical data-mining techniques to profile patients based on medical history, concomitant comorbid conditions, and current clinical status.</description>
          <population>A two-group solution converged and the groups differentiated on key baseline variables. However, the group sizes were too unevenly distributed for further analysis with the &quot;high risk group&quot; comprised of only 3.0% of the evaluable sample.
Only patients with data in each group are analyzed for hemoglobin at study start.</population>

Patient risk score (PRS) shows the individual patient risk for FN.The PRS is a sum of eight weighted individual patient risk factors for FN and results in a possible score of 0 to 11 (highest risk for FN). The risk factors were assigned weights based on the level of risk specified by guidelines and SC consensus (age &gt; 65 years: 3.0; advanced disease: 1.5; history of FN: 3.0; No antibiotic prophylaxis: 0.5; poor performance/nutritional status: 1.5; female gender: 0.5; Hb&lt;12g/dL: 0.5; Renal, CV or liver disease: 0.5).

        <description>Objective 3: To determine the extent to which the primary and secondary prophylaxis of FN in cancer patients is in congruence with the EORTC best practice guidelines and dosing recommendations, and whether this is associated with better outcomes.
The GCS is computed at the patient level as an overall grade of how congruent actual GCSF treatment is to recommended treatment. The GCS is computed as follows and scores range from 0 to 3: GCS = Σ(CRS + mean GIS over all cycles + GPS), with higher scores indicating higher congruence.
CRS: Chemotherapy Risk Score (0 or 1 with 1 best); FN: febrile neutropenia; GCSF: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GIS=GCSF Initiation Score (0 to 1 with 1 best); GPS=GCSF persistence score (0 to 1 with 1 best);</description>

        <description>Objective 6: To examine the multilevel determinants (patient, center) of hematological outcomes of primary and secondary prophylaxis with EP2006 to better understand the variability in outcomes achieved.
Hierarchical modeling was used to test the relationship of patient- and physician/center-level variables and treatment response in terms of ANC. This analysis was conducted at the cycle level using a 1-cycle lag between treatment patterns and outcomes, that is study drug treatment patterns in one cycle predicted the ANC value at the beginning of the next cycle. Log-transformed ANC values were used.
Table presents predictors for ANC: GCSF decision, study drug dose, tumor type, patient gender, ECOG, Hb
Since log-transformed Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) values were used, Exp(beta) can be interpreted in terms of % change in ANC for each unit change in predictor or for each category relative to the referent (for categorical variables); Hb=Hemoglobin</description>

        <description>Objective 7: To identify different latent clusters of end-stage cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and being treated with EP2006 for the treatment or primary or secondary prophylaxis of FN using statistical data-mining techniques to profile patients based on medical history, concomitant comorbid conditions, and current clinical status.
ECOG score is a severity scale from 0 to 5 (highest) to grade toxicity and is defined as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life-threatening, 5=lethal. ECOG is described in more detail by Oken et al, Am J Clin Oncol (CCT) 5:649-655, 1982.

Table presents patient level predictors for cancer-related mortality: female gender, poor performance (ECOG &gt;=2) during study.
ECOG score is a severity scale from 0 to 5 (highest) to grade toxicity and is defined as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life-threatening, 5=lethal. ECOG is described in more detail by Oken et al, Am J Clin Oncol (CCT) 5:649-655, 1982.</description>
