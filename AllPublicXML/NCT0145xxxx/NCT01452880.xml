    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy and side effects induced by
      administration of two different infusion rates of remifentanil, 0,05 mcg/ Kg/ min versus
      0,1mcg/ Kg/ min, in order to determine which one is the most appropriate analgesic treatment
      to face extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.

      Remifentanil is an ultra-short-acting oppioid, which is quickly metabolized by unspecific
      blood and tissue esterases . This feature vouches for a predictable pharmacokinetics and
      makes this drug suitable for administration in continuous intravenous infusion in order to
      achieve patient conscious sedation during non-invasive surgical procedures. Remifentanil
      could be particularly useful in day surgery setting, thanks also to its faster elimination
      than other oppioids. This property ensure a swift recovery from conscious sedation, reducing
      the period of time during which patient remains in recovery room and decreasing also the
      incidence of side effects, like PONV and respiratory depression. Conscious sedation with
      remifentanil can provide patient comfort and cooperation during surgical procedure, since the
      verbal contact with the patient is kept up. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a
      non-invasive procedure, contemplated as the first-line treatment for renal and upper ureteral
      stones, if stone diameter is ranged from 5 to 20 mm . It can grind calculi into fine
      particles, that are expelled through micturition. Although many studies have been published
      in regard to continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil, a small number of them focuses
      on which is the most appropriate infusion rate for ESWL procedure.
