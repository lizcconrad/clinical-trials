  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine fusion is one of the most common procedures performed in spinal surgery. Several
      surgical techniques can achieve a solid union, but the intertransverse posterolateral fusion
      (PLF) is the most widely used. However, complications can develop when the bone graft
      material used is insufficient to achieve the desired fusion. With its unique properties,
      nanOss Bioactive can be mixed with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and other graft materials to
      obtain new bone growth during the healing process.

      It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive will result in fusion at 12 months, with
      CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of translational motion, and less than
      5 degrees of angular motion. In addition, patients are expected to see an improvement in
      Oswestry Disability Index scores, VAS pain scores, and SF36 scores, while decreasing the use
      of pain medication, returning to work, and finding satisfaction in the results of their
      surgery.

      The post marketing clinical trial is designed to assess lumbar fusion using interbody cages
      with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions using nanOss
      Bioactive bone void filler in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) characterized by
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

      Patients for this study will be recruited from up to 10 clinical sites. It is estimated that
      100 patients will be enrolled in the study. At least 10 investigators will participate in the
      study. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to sign the
      informed consent. Preoperatively, the patient will provide his /her medical history and
      complete self assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation.

      Patients who meet the criteria for entrance into the study will undergo lumbar fusion using
      interbody cages with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions
      using nanOss Bioactive in combination with local autograft and bone marrow aspirate (BMA).
      Anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures are not allowed.

      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected. The patients will
      be evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. At each postoperative visit,
      the investigator will clinically evaluate the patient and the patient will complete self
      assessment documents, Oswestry Disability Index, Quality of Life questionnaires and a surgery
      satisfaction survey, e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, or very
      unsatisfied with the surgery. Fusion status will be evaluated radiographically at each visit
      using plain films. CT scans at 12 months will be evaluated by an independent radiologist.
      Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.

             for osteoporosis must obtain a DEXA scan of the spine and hip to determine if the
             patient has severe osteoporosis. The definition of a patient at risk used by the
             National Osteoporosis Foundation includes the following: i. Premature menopause (&lt; 45
             years) ii. Prolonged amenorrhea (&gt; one year) iii. Maternal history of hip fracture iv.
             Primary hyperparathyroidism or hyperthyroidism v. Chronic renal failure vi. Previous
             fragility fractures, particularly of the hip, spine or wrist vii. Patients who have
             ever taken corticosteroids in doses &gt;7.5 mg/day for one year or more. Patients will be
             excluded if their bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine or hip is more than 1.0
             standard deviation (SD) below the mean of normal adults in the presence of one or more
             fragility fractures indicating severe osteoporosis. If severe osteoporosis is
             diagnosed, the patient must be excluded from the investigational study. If the patient
             has osteoporosis or osteopenia, they may be included in the study if he or she meets
             the rest of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
