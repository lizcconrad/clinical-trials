      This study aims to study and implement active referral of heroin users from a syringe
      exchange programme to evidence-based treatment for heroin addiction. Patients are randomized
      to either a strength-based case management intervention or a control group, while both groups
      receive referral to medical investigation for inclusion in substitution treatment for heroin
      addiction. The hypothesis is that syringe exchange can be used for referral to effective
      treatment, and that a strength-based intervention can increase the number of patients who are
      successfully referred and enter treatment.

    <textblock>
      Patients attending the syringe exchange programme of Malmö, Sweden, and who are using heroin
      as their primary drug of abuse and who live in the catchment area of Malmö Addiction Centre,
      will be addressed, and patients willing to participate will undergo a baseline interview and
      will be referred to medical examination for decision to start substitution treatment to treat
      heroin dependence. Half of patients will be randomized to a strength-based case management
      intervention, hypothesized to facilitate treatment entry, and half of patients will be
      randomized to a control condition involving only referral.

      The study will measure the number of patients who successfully accept referral and initiate
      substitution treatment for heroin dependence, comparing patients in intervention arm to
      patients in the control condition (RCT design). Also, as a secondary outcome measure,
      retention and treatment outcome (substance use and clinical characteristics) will be compared
      between the two groups. In addition, this study will enable a number of sub-analyses aiming
      to increase knowledge about heroin addicts' detailed substance use pattern and clinical
      characteristics. Patients will be followed with respect to retention, substance use and
      clinical picture for three years.
