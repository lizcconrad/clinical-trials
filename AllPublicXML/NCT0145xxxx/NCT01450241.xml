  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether short-course antibiotic therapy is safe and
      effective for the treatment of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Febrile neutropenia remains a major cause of morbidity in solid cancer patients. There is an
      unresolved question regarding the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment for patients
      with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin. Current guidelines recommend at least seven days
      of antibiotic treatment. Several studies have demonstrated the safety of early antibiotic
      discontinuation in patients with febrile neutropenia. We plan an open label randomized
      controlled trial to compare early antibiotic discontinuation to the accepted prolonged
      antibiotic treatment protocol
