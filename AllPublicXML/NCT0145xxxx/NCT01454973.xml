  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-year clinical study to improve tools for measuring the function of insulin-producing
      beta cells in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A three-year observational study to standardize the meal tolerance and maximum stimulational
      tests for measuring beta cell function in the clinical setting. It also aims to improve
      methods for the early prediction of the long-term response to an intervention and for
      identification of patients at risk for rapid beta cell function deterioration, thereby
      enabling future clinical studies that examine diabetes progression.

          2. Overweight and obese, generally healthy men and women. Healthy is defined as no
             clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG
             and clinical laboratory tests.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential are allowed (but must agree to use non-hormonal
             contraception and not plan to become pregnant for the duration of the study. Must
             agree to maintain the same contraceptive measures throughout the study. Acceptable
             contraceptive methods for female subjects of childbearing potential include one of the
             following:

               -  Abstinence.

               -  One (1) of the following methods:

                    -  Tubal ligation

                    -  Copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD)

                    -  Condom AND spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

                    -  Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 6 months.

          4. It is required that all male subjects use an acceptable method of contraception (as
             outlined below), starting from the first dose of study medication and continuing for
             at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug:

               -  Abstinence

               -  A condom AND one of the following:

               -  Vasectomy for more than 6 months. Female partner who meets one of the following
                  conditions: has had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy; or
                  is post menopausal

          5. BMI 27-40; stable weight (less than 3% change in past 3 months) Age Range: 30-65

          6. No history of diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance (and impaired fasting
             glucose)

          7. Other conditions may be allowed, if medically stable and controlled within acceptable
             limits, including: hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis

          8. Smokers allowed, but must be able to participate on inpatient stay and not smoke

          9. Normal oral glucose tolerance test response (see exclusion criteria)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic or clinical findings at Screening.

          2. Any condition possibly affecting absorption (eg, gastrectomy, malabsorption syndromes,
             abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, cholecystectomy or hysterectomy).

          3. Use of unacceptable medications (see Appendix A)

          4. A positive urine drug screen.

          5. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer

             If QTc exceeds 450/470 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average
             of the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Supine blood pressure &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), on a single
             measurement. If elevated, confirm by a single repeat, following at least 10 minutes of
             rest.

          9. Screening fasting serum glucose &gt;=100 mg/dL or HbA1c &gt;6.5%, confirmed by a single

         10. Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (see below for definition of abnormal).

         11. Screening serum alanine transaminase (ALT) or serum aspartate transaminase (AST)
             greater than 2X the upper limit of the laboratory reference range.

             if deemed necessary.

         13. Pregnant or nursing females; inability to use effective contraception.

         14. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

             excluded, depending on study type and details.

         16. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, if utilized by
             the site for blood draws.

         17. Unwilling or unable to comply with directions and procedures described in this
             protocol.

         18. Subject is the Investigator or a sub-Investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff, or a relative of study personnel directly involved
             with the conduct of the study.

         19. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
