    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PE among consecutive
      ICU patients receiving MV who required thoracic computed tomography (CT) with contrast agent
      injection, regardless of whether PE was suspected clinically. The secondary objectives were
      to assess the association between PE and DVT, to identify risk factors for VTE, and to
      determine the outcome of VTE.

      Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) produces nonspecific or minimal symptoms in mechanically
      ventilated (MV) patients, leading to underdiagnosis. We estimated the prevalence of PE and
      associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among MV patients.

      Methods: Consecutive MV patients who required thoracic computed tomography (CT) in a single
      ICU. Compression ultrasound of the four limbs was performed within 48 hours of inclusion.
      Curative anticoagulation therapy was given immediately after PE diagnosis.
