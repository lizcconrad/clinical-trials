    <textblock>
      It is necessary for outcome measures to accurately reflect the state of health of a person in
      order for clinical trials to show benefit. The most commonly used outcome measure for Charcot
      Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) is the CMT Neuropathy Score, which uses cutoffs of points
      designated as mild (0-10 points), moderate (11-20) or severe (21-36). These terms are
      arbitrary. This study is looking to base mild, moderate, and severe on what both people
      affected with CMT and those who provide for people with CMT consider appropriate.
