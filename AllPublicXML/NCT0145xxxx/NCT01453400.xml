          -  Evidence of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic diseases, or

          -  Current or past history of a bleeding disorder

          -  Self reported alcoholism or drug abuse within two years prior to screening or routine
             consumption of three or more alcohol containing beverages per day

          -  Habituation to analgesic drugs or tranquilizers (i.e., routine use of five or more
             times per week for greater than three weeks)

          -  Acute illness, local infection, or disease (other than URTI with pharyngeal infection)
             that can interfere with the conduct of the study

          -  Current use of blood thinning (anticoagulant), low dose aspirin, or steroid drug
