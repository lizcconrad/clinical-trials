      RATIONALE: Studying biomarkers of tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes the occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in samples from patients with rhabdoid tumor
      of the kidney and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if there are molecular differences between rhabdoid tumor of the kidney
           (RTK) and the atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT).

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile and microRNA
      profile.
