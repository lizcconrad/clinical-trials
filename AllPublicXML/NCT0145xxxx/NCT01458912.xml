      The aim of this study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at medium
      doses twice daily and high doses once daily (evening dosing) and placebo over an 12-week
      treatment period in asthmatic patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately controlled on low
      dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy as demonstrated by a decrease in Forced Expiratory
      Volume in one second (FEV1) (not less than 10 %, and equal to or less than 25%) and an Asthma
      Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-6 score of not less than 1.5 at time of randomisation.

             before the age of 40 years.

          -  All patients must be on a maintenance treatment with either medium-dose ICS plus
             Long-acting beta agonist (LABA) or high-dose ICS without LABA, stable for at least six
             weeks prior to Visit 1 (see also Section 3.3.1 and Appendix 10.3).

          -  All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of not less than 60 to 90% of
             predicted normal and an ACQ-6 mean score of less than 1.5 at the pre-screening Visit
             1.

          -  All patients must have an improvement in FEV1 not less than 12 % above baseline and an
             absolute change of at least 200 mL within 15-30 min after administration of 400 mcg
             salbutamol/albuterol Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI). When the
             reversibility is not achieved at Visit 1, there will be the option to repeat
             reversibility test at any visit during the run-in period.

          -  Variation of absolute pre-bronchodilator FEV1 values at Visit 2 as compared to Visit 1
             must be within plus/minus 20 %.

          -  Patients must be never-smokers or ex-smokers with a smoking history of less than10
             pack-years and smoking cessation at least one year prior to screening .

          -  Patients must be able to use Respimat® inhaler and MDI correctly

          -  Patients must be able to perform all trial-related procedures including technically
             acceptable pulmonary function tests and electronic PEF measurements, and must be able
             to maintain records during the study period as required in the protocol.

        To enter treatment period following additional criteria have to be met (at randomisation
        visit):

          -  All patients must have an improvement in FEV1 not less than 12 % above baseline and an
             absolute change of at least 200 mL within 15-30 min after administration of 400 mcg
             salbutamol/albuterol HFA MDI. When the reversibility is not achieved at Visit 1, there
             will be the option to repeat reversibility test at any visit during the run-in period.

          -  During the run-in period (at the same clinic visit) all patients must be both
             symptomatic (ACQ-6 mean score equal to or greater than 1.5) and have shown a decrease
             in morning pre-bronchodilator FEV1 not less than 10% and less than or equal to 25%
             from pre-screening baseline FEV1 at Visit 2.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with significant pulmonary disease other than asthma or other significant
             medical conditions (as determined by medical history, examination and clinical
             investigations at screening) that may, in the opinion of the investigator, result in
             any of the following: (i) put the patient at risk because of participation in this
             trial or (ii) influence the results of the trial or (iii) cause concern regarding the
             patient's ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Patients with a clinically relevant, abnormal screening haematology and/or blood
             chemistry finding, if the abnormality indicates a significant disease as defined in
