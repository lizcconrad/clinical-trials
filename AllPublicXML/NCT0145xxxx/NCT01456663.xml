          -  Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 (all subjects)

          -  Male and female Caucasian subjects

          -  Group 1, 2 and 3 (subjects with hepatic impairment)

          -  Subjects must satisfy the criteria for hepatic impairment as evidenced by a Child-Pugh
             score of A, B or C at screening

          -  Group 4 (healthy subjects)

          -  Each healthy subject must match in age (±8 years), gender, weight (±15%) to an
             individual subject with hepatic impairment in group 1, 2 or 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 (all subjects)

          -  Use of any tobacco products from 1 week prior to cotinine screening assessments until
             study completion.

          -  Group 1, 2 and 3 (subjects with hepatic impairment)

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 3 months prior to screening

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological or
             psychiatric diseases within 1 month prior to study drug administration except for
             hepatic impairment or any other disease associated with this underlying condition.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition other than hepatic impairment which might
             significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs,
             or which may jeopardize the safety of the study subject in case of participation in
             the study.

          -  History or presence of encephalopathy within 6 months prior screening (except for
             subjects in Groups 2 and 3).

          -  Documented presence of a porto-systemic shunt.

          -  Documented presence of esophagus varices (stage III or IV).

          -  Group 4 (healthy subjects)

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological or
             psychiatric diseases.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the safety of
             the study subject in case of participation in the study. History of drug or alcohol
             abuse within 12 months prior to screening, or evidence of such abuse as indicated by
             the laboratory assays conducted during screening and baseline.

          -  History or presence of hepatitis B or C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at screening.
