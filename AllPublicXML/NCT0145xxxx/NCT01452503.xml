      Evaluation of preference for three female condoms (FC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study was to identify the female condom most preferred by study
      participants. This provided USAID with data to make informed decisions regarding female
      condom purchases. The study was conducted in three parts. The objective of Part 1 was to
      familiarize each participant with the three FC types, to minimize learning curve effect in
      subsequent phases of study, and to gather information on participant demographics, FC
      acceptability, device function, safety, preference for each of the condom types, and use of
      male condoms during the same time period. The objective of Part 2 was to determine actual,
      &quot;unstated&quot; and &quot;unbiased&quot; preference for a particular type of FC. The objective of Part 3 was
      to identify reasons for preference of a particular FC type and to document details
      surrounding product use/non-use.

    <description>The objective of Part 1 is to familiarize each participant with the use characteristics of the three female condom types in order to minimize learning curve effect in subsequent phases of study. In Part 2, a 'simulated market' will be created in order to determine an unbiased, free choice preference for a particular FC type. Part 3 will detail the reasons for participants' selection/preference of specific FC types.</description>
