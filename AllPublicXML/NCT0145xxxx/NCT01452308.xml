  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of simtuzumab (GS-6624) in patients with
      fibrosis of the liver.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled into two sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of
      10 participants who will receive simtuzumab every other week for a total of 3 infusions.
      Participants in Cohort 2 (10 subjects) will also receive simtuzumab every other week for a
      total of 3 infusions; the dose will depend on the safety and tolerability of simtuzumab seen
      in Cohort 1.

      Participants from both cohorts who have completed the main study will be allowed to continue
      on simtuzumab treatment for an additional extension period, and will receive up to 13
      additional infusions of simtuzumab at a fixed dose of 700 mg for an additional 24 weeks.
