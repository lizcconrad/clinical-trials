  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) during sleep in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
      have been shown to be associated with elevations in Blood Pressure (BP). Rotigotine has been
      shown to effectively reduce the incidence of PLMs in patients with RLS. The current study
      aims to demonstrate that treatment with Rotigotine could help reduce the number of nocturnal
      BP elevations associated with PLMs in patients with RLS.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Elevations of Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) During the Night That Are Associated With Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) at the End of the 4-week Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the 4-week Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>Polysomnography (PSG) recordings, including the assessment of continuous Blood Pressure and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), were obtained on 2 consecutive nights prior to Baseline Visit and prior to End of Maintenance Period (Visit 7) for up to 8 hours per night. Readings from the first night of the PSG were only used for analysis if the PSG from the second night was determined to be not valid for evaluation. Influence of Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) on sleep is reflected in the Periodic Limb Movement-Related Arousal Index (PLMAI). Arousal is defined as sudden change in the EEG activity and the index illustrates to what degree the PLMs contribute to arousal from sleep. Sleep stages and time spent in each sleep stage were determined from Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <description>The PLMI is defined as Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs)/ total time in bed in hours. PLMs are measured by Polysomnography (PSG).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS) at the End of the 4-week Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the 4-week Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS is a subject-based scale that consists of 10 items to evaluate the severity of major RLS symptoms and the impact of the disease on subjects' daytime functioning. Each of the 10 items is measured on a scale that ranges from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). A sum score between 0 (no RLS symptoms present at all) and 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms) across all 10 items was calculated. A negative value in IRLS Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

    <description>The RLS-QoL is a disease-specific instrument for the evaluation of Quality of life. It consists of 12 items and the overall sum score is calculated from all 12 items and measured on a scale that ranges from 0 (lowest Quality of life) to 60 (highest level of Quality of life). A negative value in RLS-QoL Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Elevations of Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) During the Night That Are Associated With Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) at the End of the 4-week Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Polysomnography (PSG) recordings, including the assessment of continuous Blood Pressure and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), were obtained on 2 consecutive nights prior to Baseline Visit and prior to End of Maintenance Period (Visit 7) for up to 8 hours per night. Readings from the first night of the PSG were only used for analysis if the PSG from the second night was determined to be not valid for evaluation. Influence of Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) on sleep is reflected in the Periodic Limb Movement-Related Arousal Index (PLMAI). Arousal is defined as sudden change in the EEG activity and the index illustrates to what degree the PLMs contribute to arousal from sleep. Sleep stages and time spent in each sleep stage were determined from Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Number of Elevations of Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) During the Night at the End of the 4-week Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Polysomnography (PSG) recordings, including the assessment of continuous Blood Pressure and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), were obtained on 2 consecutive nights prior to Baseline Visit and prior to End of Maintenance Period (Visit 7) for up to 8 hours per night. Readings from the first night of the PSG were only used for analysis if the PSG from the second night was determined to be not valid for evaluation. Influence of Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs) on sleep is reflected in the Periodic Limb Movement-Related Arousal Index (PLMAI). Arousal is defined as sudden change in the EEG activity and the index illustrates to what degree the PLMs contribute to arousal from sleep. Sleep stages and time spent in each sleep stage were determined from Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>

Item 1 measures subject's satisfaction with sleep on a 11-point scale that ranges between 0 (completely satisfied) to 10 (completely dissatisfied). The ratings are given by the subjects. A negative value in RLS-6 Item 6 Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</description>
