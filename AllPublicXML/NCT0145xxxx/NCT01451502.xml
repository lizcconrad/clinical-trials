  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the next 5‐10 years or possibly longer, a high proportion of the Cord Blood Banks (CBB)
      inventory worldwide will be composed of unlicensed umbilical cord blood (UCB) units. While
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐licensed units will be prioritized, it will always be
      possible that an unlicensed unit will have known attributes, making it a better source of
      cells for the given indication. Because of the wide variety of current and potential
      indications as a source of cells for hematopoietic reconstitution or other form of cellular
      therapy, it is critical that the investigators have access to unlicensed UCB units.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive intravenous hydration, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride
      (or appropriate alternative regimen) approximately 30 minutes prior to UCB infusion with
      doses adjusted for subject age and weight unless otherwise specified in the specific
      treatment protocol. Additional treatments will vary with the specific use of the UCB cells as
      specified in institutional review board (IRB)‐approved disease‐specific protocols at the
      University of Minnesota.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for an unlicensed umbilical cord blood (UCB) unit, the subject must meet
        each of the eligibility criteria listed below:

          -  Subjects with any diagnosis for which there is an institutional review board (IRB)
             approved treatment protocol that requires UCB as a source of hematopoietic stem cells
             for lympho‐hematopoietic reconstitution after myeloablative or non myeloablative
             conditioning.

          -  Subject (or parent/guardian) must provide written informed consent for the use of
             unlicensed UCB units with co‐enrollment onto a University of Minnesota IRB‐approved
             clinical trial that details the disease specific treatment plan that prescribes the
             use of UCB as source of cells

          -  Subject has an unlicensed UCB unit that meets required cell dose and HLA matching
             criteria (as defined in the primary treatment protocol) that is considered negative
             for tested blood‐borne pathogens and also lack an 'equivalent', licensed UCB unit from
             a University of Minnesota approved Cord Blood Bank

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are specified in the treatment protocol according to indication.
