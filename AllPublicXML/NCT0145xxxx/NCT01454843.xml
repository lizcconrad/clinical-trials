      The purpose of the study is to compare the results of LASIK surgery when using Alcon
      Allegretto wavefront-guided excimer laser system compared to AMO Visx Custom wavefront-guided
      excimer laser system in patients with nearsightedness with and without astigmatism.

      The patients will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the
      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. if there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the patient from the study, then we will inform the patient and make an appropriate
      referral. If the patient is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive
      examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. The patient
      will undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with a wavefront-guided
      excimer laser and which eye is treated with wavefront-optimized will be randomized so there
      is a 50% chance for either eye to receive one treatment. The patients will be seen on the day
      of surgery, post op day one, post op day 4-7, one month, three months, six months and one
      year. The patient will receive topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the
      procedure. LASIK treated eyes will receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after
      treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment
      of patients undergoing lasik surgery.

      The research procedures are the least risky that can be performed consistent with sound
      research design.

    <description>Efficacy measures uncorrected visual acuity following the LASIK surgery. We will record how many eyes see 20/40, 20/30, 20/25, 20/20, 20/16, 20/12.5 and 20/10 after the surgery without glasses or contact lenses. We are measuring how well patients see after the surgery without glasses or contact lenses.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Will will assess safety by measuring change in best spectacle corrected visual acuity. We will record the number of eyes that gain, lose or have no change in the best spectacle corrected visual acuity after the surgery. This is measured using snellen visual acuity charts. The ideal outcome would be that there were no loss of any lines of best spectacle corrected visual acuity and a high percentage of gains of lines of best spectacle corrected visual acuity.</description>
