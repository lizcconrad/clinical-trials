      Patients who are newly diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma will undergo disease staging at
      diagnosis and initial treatment response assessment. At each time point (initial staging and
      treatment response assessment) in addition to standard imaging investigations (PET CT, Chest
      CT, anatomical MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and abdominal USS), patients will undergo an
      extended MRI scan.

      The trial will be a single centre cohort study in patients newly diagnosed with Hodgkin's
      lymphoma undergoing disease staging at diagnosis and initial treatment response assessment.
      At each time point (initial staging and treatment response assessment) in addition to
      standard imaging investigations (PET CT, Chest CT, anatomical MRI of the abdomen and pelvis
      and abdominal USS), patients will undergo advanced anatomical and functional MRI sequences.
