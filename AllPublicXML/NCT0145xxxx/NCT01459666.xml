  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test if the use of DysportTM (abobotulinumtoxinA) improves wound healing and
      scarring after Mohs surgery. Research in the laboratory as well as previous studies in humans
      have shown improved wound healing and scarring with the use of a similar medication called
      Botox.

      Dysport may improve wound healing and scarring by relaxing facial muscles and therefore
      minimizes the muscle tension and possibly the inflammation around the wound.

      Primary Objective:

      -To evaluate the efficacy of using aboBTX-A to improve wound healing prior to Mohs
      micrographic surgery and reconstruction for skin cancer as measured by the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) at 6 weeks post surgery.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate efficacy of using aboBTX-A to improve wound healing prior to Mohs
           micrographic surgery and reconstruction for skin cancer as measured by the Patient and
           Observer Assessment Scale (POSAS) at week 1, 6, and 24.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of using aboBTX-A to improve wound healing prior to Mohs
           micrographic surgery and reconstruction for skin cancer as measured by the Visual
           Analogue Scale (VAS) at week 1 and 24 post surgery.

        -  To evaluate patient satisfaction

        -  To evaluate safety (adverse events)

      This is a 6 month, prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled
      study. A total of 40 male or female healthy volunteers, 20 in each arm, will be enrolled. Up
      to 10 more patients can be enrolled to account for patient drop-out. Subjects will all
      undergo Mohs micrographic surgical removal of a skin cancer lesion on the forehead followed
      by reconstruction. Subjects will be randomized to receive either aboBTX-A injection or
      placebo injection in the frontalis, procerus, and corrugator muscles prior to reconstruction.
      Photographs, POSAS, and clinical assessments will be taken immediately after initial wound
      closure, at 1 week follow-up, at 6 weeks follow-up, and at 6 months follow-up. Adverse events
      will also be reviewed at each study visit. After the completion of the study, the photographs
      will be assessed (blinded as to the patient identifiers) using a 10 cm visual analog scale
      (VAS). The first few photographs will be evaluated by the surgeons together to calibrate the
      VAS and ensure inter-reliability.

    <measure>Patient and Observer Assessment Scale (POSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 1, 6, and 24 post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) consists of two numeric scales. One scale is completed by the patients, the other by the clinician. This scale is different than previous scales because it takes the patient's input into consideration. It has good internal consistency and interobserver reliability. The assessment will take place at Day 0, Week 1, Week 6, and Month 6.</description>

    <description>Each patient will be able to receive up to 120 units of Dysport/placebo at the initial visit to treat the entire forehead area (the frontalis, procerus, and corrugator muscles) to insure cosmetic symmetry. Injections will be placed a minimum of 1.5cm above the orbital rim at the mid papillary line to minimize the risk of lid ptosis. The actual amount to be injected will be at the discretion of the Mohs surgeon based on his or her opinion of what amount is needed for sufficient wound paralysis and cosmetic symmetry.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment:

          -  Ability to understand the risks, benefits, and alternative to participation and give
             informed consent

          -  Have biopsy proven skin cancer on the medial forehead that is amenable to Mohs
             surgery. Medial forehead is defined as the area superiorly from the hairline,
             inferiorly at the eyebrow, and laterally to the tip of the lateral brow (see diagram).

          -  Undergoing elective reconstruction of biopsy proven skin cancer that is amenable to
             Mohs surgery with defect size measuring 1.0 cm or greater

          -  If female, not currently pregnant, no potential for pregnancy, or if of child-bearing
             age, must agree to use adequate contraception (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control; abstinence) for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A negative
             urine pregnancy test is required at study entry for female subjects of childbearing
             potential: a woman is considered to be of child bearing potential unless she has had a
             tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy, or is postmenopausal
             (without a menstrual period for at least one year)

          -  Agrees to not use disallowed concomitant medications (retinoids)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a patient from study enrollment.

          -  Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, or women of child bearing age who are
             unwilling to use adequate contraception (described above) during the study period

          -  Current or past history of a neuromuscular disease (such as myasthenia gravis,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome)

          -  Currently taking aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular
             transmission (e.g., curare-like agents)

          -  History of radiation therapy or chemotherapy

          -  History of keloid or other hypertrophic scar formation

          -  Current or past history of scleroderma

          -  Has used botulinum toxin in the forehead area within one year.

          -  Has significant resting eyebrow ptosis

          -  Has used any topical retinoids to the forehead area within the past 4 weeks

          -  Undergo any scar revision procedure for the duration of the study including
             intralesional kenalog, laser treatment, and/or scar revision surgeries

          -  Any hypersensitivity to any component of abobotulinumtoxinA (i.e. cow milk protein) or
             any previous hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin A or related product.

          -  Non-English speaking: These patients are excluded since translation of the informed
             consent into other languages is time-consuming and expensive as it requires a bona
             fide translator for the particular language of interest and this type of person may be
             difficult to locate.

          -  House staff and students, medical students on a clerkship, and employees related to
             study personnel or who work for any study personnel, and members of the study team are
             not eligible to participate in this study as a subject.

          -  The investigator feels that for any reason the subject is not eligible to participate
             in the study
