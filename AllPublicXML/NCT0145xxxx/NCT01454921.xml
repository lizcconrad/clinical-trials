  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop/adapt a culturally appropriate secondary prevention intervention for
      young, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive women through intervention groups,
      evaluate its acceptability and feasibility, make appropriate modifications, and manualize the
      intervention in preparation for a full-scale randomized trial.

      Once the intervention is developed/adapted, the sites will pilot the interventions twice to
      enable modifications. The intervention aims to address the following concerns: 1) reducing
      the risk of young women infected with HIV transmitting the virus to their sexual partners,
      and 2) preventing young women infected with HIV from re-infection with a new viral strain or
      co-infection with another sexually transmitted disease (STD). Data will be collected to
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed intervention using both
      quantitative and qualitative methods at each iteration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female at birth and currently female;

          -  Receives services at one of the selected ATN sites or their community partners

          -  HIV-infected as documented by medical record review or verbal verification with
             referring professional

          -  Between the ages of 16-24 years (inclusive) at the time of informed consent/assent

          -  Ability to understand both written and spoken English

          -  Gives informed consent/assent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of active, serious psychiatric symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, thought
             disorder) that would impair a participant's ability to meet the study requirements

          -  Visibly distraught (e.g., suicidal, homicidal, exhibiting violent behavior)

          -  Intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or other substances at the time of study
             enrollment*.

               -  Intoxication at the time of visit will exclude participation at that time.
                  Participants cannot be visibly under the influence of substances at the time of
                  enrollment or consent. If a participant returns to enroll while sober, enrollment
                  can occur. Similarly, if a participant arrives to an intervention group visibly
                  intoxicated, then she will be asked to leave. However, prior intoxication does
                  not eliminate future participation. Thus, those who are dismissed from a session
                  due to intoxication can return to a subsequent session as long as they are sober.
