      Purpose: During lactation, several physiological modifications occur including cellular
      differentiation and proliferation, as well as elevation in inflammation. The role of the
      Mediterranean (MED) diet rich in walnuts has been shown to favorably modify fatty acid
      profiles and to reduce inflammation. The study goal is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
      effects of the MED diet rich in walnuts during lactation, a time of increased inflammatory
      response.

      Procedures: A randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial among lactating women
      comparing the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet with walnuts to the USDA's MyPyramid Diet
      for Moms was commenced to determine the effects of the diet on fatty acid profiles and
      biomarkers of inflammation in breast milk and material serum/plasma. Secondary outcomes of
      interest include effects of maternal diet assignment on maternal body weight and body
      composition as well as infants' growth and health during the study trial period.

      Population: The study population includes healthy women between the ages of 18-40 years who
      are within 6 months post-partum and plan to breastfeed a minimum of 3 times per day for 6
      months following study entry. There have been a total of 138 participants enrolled in the
      study. All 138 participants are women; 34 identified themselves as Hispanic, and 104 said
      they were not Hispanic.
