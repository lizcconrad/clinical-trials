  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Millions of people each year sustain injuries, have tumors surgically removed, or
      are born with defects that require complex reconstructive surgeries to repair. In the case of
      hand, forearm, or arm amputation, prostheses only provide less than optimal motor function
      and no sensory feedback. However, hand and arm transplantation is a means to restore the
      appearance, anatomy, and function of a native hand. Although over 70 hand transplants have
      been performed to date and good functional results have been achieved, widespread clinical
      use has been limited due to adverse effects of life-long and high-dose immunosuppression
      needed to prevent graft rejection. Risks include infection, cancer, and metabolic problems,
      all of which can greatly affect recipients' quality of life, make the procedure riskier, and
      jeopardize the potential benefits of hand transplantation.

      Study Design: This non-randomized, Phase II clinical trial will document the use of a new
      immunomodulatory protocol (aka - Pittsburgh Protocol, Starzl Protocol) for establishing hand
      transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive treatment for upper extremity
      amputations by minimizing maintenance immunosuppression therapy in unilateral and bilateral
      hand/forearm transplant patients. This protocol combines lymphocyte depletion with donor bone
      marrow cell infusion and has enabled graft survival using low doses of a single
      immunosuppressive drug followed by weaning of treatment. Initially designed for
      living-related solid organ donation, this regimen has been adapted for use with grafts
      donated by deceased donors. The investigators propose to perform 30 human hand transplants
      employing this novel protocol.

      Specific Aims: 1) To establish hand transplantation as a safe and effective reconstructive
      strategy for the treatment of upper extremity amputations; 2) To reduce the risk of rejection
      and enable allograft survival while minimizing the requirement for long-term high dose
      multi-drug immunosuppression.

      Significance of Research: Hand transplantation could help upper extremity amputees recover
      functionality, self-esteem, and the capability to reintegrate into family and social life as
      &quot;whole&quot; individuals. The protocol offers the potential for minimizing the morbidity of
      maintenance immunosuppression, thereby beneficially shifting the risk/benefit ratio of this
      life-enhancing procedure and enabling widespread clinical application of hand
      transplantation.

    <description>This protocol uses a novel bone marrow cell-based therapy for composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) rather than conventional triple-drug immunosuppression to facilitate long-term graft survival of deceased donor human upper extremities under low-dose maintenance immunosuppression. Initial T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab is followed by upper extremity transplantation and tacrolimus maintenance therapy. Donor bone marrow cells are infused on Day 10 (±4 days) post-transplantation to elicit a host alloimmune response triggering exhaustion and deletion of the respective host (anti-donor) lymphocyte clones. Subsequently, tacrolimus therapy is given for at least 6 months before spaced weaning is considered in stable recipients.</description>
