  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic gynaecological pain is a major medical problem that affects 20-30% of women at
      different moments of their life. This largely neglected issue has a significant impact on the
      sexual and conjugal life of women suffering from it as well as on their psychological health.
      Furthermore, this kind of pain is not well understood, often misdiagnosed or even totally
      ignored. Also, treatment is limited and not extensively studied. This study aims at better
      understanding and treating gynaecological pain. The focus of the study will be provoked
      vestibulodynia, pain at the entry of the vagina. The efficacy of specialized pelvic floor
      physiotherapy will be compared to a topical cream (lidocaine) applied to the vulva. The
      treatment efficacy will be assessed in 234 women (aged from 18-45 years old) suffering from
      provoked vestibulodynia recruited in 4 hospitals (CHUS, Jewish General Hospital,
      Royal-Victoria Hospital, CHUM St-Luc).

      This is a randomised controlled trial comparing the impact of multimodal physiotherapy
      treatments to topical lidocaine in women suffering from provoked vestibulodyina. The first
      treatment consists of 10 sixty minutes weekly physiotherapy treatments including relaxation
      techniques, stretching and pelvic floor muscle control exercises. The second treatment is a
      night time application of lidocaine to the vulva for 10 weeks. Physiotherapists will then
      evaluate women's pain and sexual function right after the treatment and 6 months later.
