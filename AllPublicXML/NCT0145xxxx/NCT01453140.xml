  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are proposing to treat patients with steroid-refractory
      Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) in a manner designed to promote CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. The
      profound immune suppression which follows the most common salvage treatment for GVHD have
      unfortunately lead to very poor outcomes because of high infection rates. A more targeted
      approach based on the promotion and stabilization of Tregs is hoped to allow GVHD control
      without the profound immunosuppression usually seen. High-dose cyclophosphamide and sirolimus
      have been successfully used for the prevention of GVHD and have shown to enhance the Tregs
      subpopulation. The addition of low dose IL-2 and a demethylating agent such as azacitidine
      will also be studied in an attempt to promote and stabilize the FoxP3 expression of Tregs.

One day after the administration of cyclophosphamide, patients will receive sirolimus 6 mg PO x 1 and on the following day will start sirolimus at a dose of 2 mg PO daily.</description>
