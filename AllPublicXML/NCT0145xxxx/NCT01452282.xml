      Introduction: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery are at increased risk of cardiovascular
      complications. The development of methods that can accurately predict the occurrence of these
      events is of critical importance and large studies have been published with this purpose.
      Based on these studies, several algorithms have been proposed to predict of cardiovascular
      events postoperatively. However, quantification of this risk is often difficult to measure,
      especially in those patients with subclinical disease, not always detected in routine
      evaluation. The ankle brachial index (ABI) has proved a valuable tool in the quantification
      of cardiovascular risk, and perhaps the most promising when compared with other methods. It
      is easy, cheap, fast and feasible in office care, with a great acceptance between patients
      and small intra and inter observer variability. Despite strong evidence of the utility of ABI
      as a tool in assessing cardiovascular risk, there are no data about the use of ABI in other
      patients referred for non vascular surgery, which constitutes the majority of operations
      performed worldwide.

      Objectives: To evaluate the use of ABI as a predictor of cardiovascular events in patients
      undergoing non-cardiac and non-vascular surgery and its applicability as a tool in the
      reclassification of patient risk groups established by guidelines for perioperative
      evaluation.

      Methods: 300 moderate to high risk patients referred for non-vascular and non-cardiac will be
      included. Data about risk factors, signs and symptoms, physical examination and treatment
      used will be collected before surgery. The ABI will be measured and the patient will be
      monitored for 30 days to the detection of cardiovascular events: death from any
      cardiovascular causes, unstable angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, isolated elevation of
      troponin, decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, stop nonfatal heart failure,
      pulmonary edema, stroke and lower limb ischemia. Postoperative electrocardiogram, total
      creatine kinase, MB fraction and troponin I will be measured daily until 3º day and whenever
      clinically indicated.
