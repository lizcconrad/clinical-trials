    <description>The percent of subjects whose estimated blood glucose values are different than meter BG values. A calculation was performed to determine the percent of subjects whose estimated BG values are &gt; +/-20% different than meter BG values when samples have BG &gt;=75mg/dL or &gt; +/- 15mg/dL different than meter BG values when samples have BG &lt;75mg/dL, as measured by fingerstick CONTOUR速.</description>
