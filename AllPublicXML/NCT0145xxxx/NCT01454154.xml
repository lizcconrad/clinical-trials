  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional study of IV
      RP-1127 (Glyburide for Injection) begun within 10 hours of complicated mild, moderate or
      severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess whether patients with severe,
      moderate, or complicated mild TBI administered RP-1127 will show a decrease in MRI-defined
      edema and/or hemorrhage, compared to patients administered placebo.

      The primary safety objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of RP-1127 compared to
      placebo in patients with severe, moderate, or complicated mild TBI.

             similar antiplatelet agents in the previous 72 hours (Note that patients later found
             to have taken these medications will not be automatically excluded from the study.)

         17. Use of sulfonylurea drugs within the prior 30 days

         18. Treatment with another investigational drug within the prior 30 days

         20. Known diagnosis of G6PD enzyme deficiency

         21. PaO2 &lt; 60 mm Hg on admission (for patients in whom blood gases are drawn per standard
             of care)

         22. Non-English speaking legally authorized representative and subjects (University of
             Maryland only)
