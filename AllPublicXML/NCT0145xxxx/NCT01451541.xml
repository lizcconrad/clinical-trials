    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Average Daily Subject-reported AM and PM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS) Averaged Weekly Over the First 6 Weeks of the Double-blind Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-6</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS is the sum of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestions. Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent 1 = mild 2 = moderate 3 = severe Therefore, rTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Reflective TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 12-hour time interval. Difference was calculated as the six week treatment average - baseline. Greater reductions in the change from baseline score indicate greater improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) Overall Score at the End of the First 6 Weeks of Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 -6</time_frame>
    <description>PRQLQ was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, and social) that are most troublesome to children with rhinoconjunctivitis. The PRQLQ has 23 questions in 5 domains (nose symptoms, eye symptoms, practical problems, activity limitation, and other symptoms). Children recalled how they were during the previous week and responded to each question on a 7-point scale (0 = not bothered to 6 = extremely bothered or 0 = none of the time to 6 = all of the time) for a total possible score of 138. The overall PRQLQ score is the mean of all 23 responses.</description>

             examination and medical history.

          -  Has a history of PAR to a relevant perennial allergen (house dust mites, cockroaches,
             molds, and animal dander) for a minimum of 1 year immediately preceding the study
             screening visit. The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required
             treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past and require treatment
             throughout the entire study period.

          -  Has a demonstrated sensitivity to at least 1 allergen known to induce PAR (house dust
             mites, cockroaches, molds, and animal dander) based on a documented result with a
             standard skin-prick test either within 12 months prior to screening visit or performed
             at the screening visit. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3 mm
             larger than the negative control wheal for the skin-prick test. The subject's positive
             allergen test must be consistent with the medical history of PAR, and the allergen
             must be present in the subject's environment throughout the study.

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Average Daily Subject-reported AM and PM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS) Averaged Weekly Over the First 6 Weeks of the Double-blind Treatment.</title>
        <description>TNSS is the sum of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestions. Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent 1 = mild 2 = moderate 3 = severe Therefore, rTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Reflective TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 12-hour time interval. Difference was calculated as the six week treatment average - baseline. Greater reductions in the change from baseline score indicate greater improvement.</description>

Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent 1 = mild 2 = moderate 3 = severe Therefore, rTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Reflective TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 12-hour time interval. Difference was calculated as the six week treatment average - baseline. Greater reductions in the change from baseline score indicate greater improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) Overall Score at the End of the First 6 Weeks of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>PRQLQ was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, and social) that are most troublesome to children with rhinoconjunctivitis. The PRQLQ has 23 questions in 5 domains (nose symptoms, eye symptoms, practical problems, activity limitation, and other symptoms). Children recalled how they were during the previous week and responded to each question on a 7-point scale (0 = not bothered to 6 = extremely bothered or 0 = none of the time to 6 = all of the time) for a total possible score of 138. The overall PRQLQ score is the mean of all 23 responses.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Average Subject-reported AM iTNSS Averaged Over the First 6 Weeks of Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>TNSS is the sum of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestions. Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent 1 = mild 2 = moderate 3 = severe Therefore, iTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Instantaneous TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 10 minute time interval. Difference was calculated as the six week treatment average - baseline. Greater reductions in the change from baseline score indicate greater improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily PRQLQ Overall Score at the End of the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PRQLQ was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, and social) that are most troublesome to children with rhinoconjunctivitis. The PRQLQ has 23 questions in 5 domains (nose symptoms, eye symptoms, practical problems, activity limitation, and other symptoms). Children recalled how they were during the previous week and responded to each question on a 7-point scale (0 = not bothered to 6 = extremely bothered or 0 = none of the time to 6 = all of the time) for a total possible score of 138. The overall PRQLQ score is the mean of all 23 responses.</description>
