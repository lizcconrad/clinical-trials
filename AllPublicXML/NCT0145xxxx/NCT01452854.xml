  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how a chemotherapy treatment (Temozolomide, also
      called Temodar) affects the process of ovarian aging which is measured by a decline in
      ovarian follicle count, in patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG). It is important to know if
      different patient factors and Temozolomide influence the rate of ovarian aging in women with
      LGG who have good long-term survival rates. This will allow better counseling about the
      effects of this particular chemotherapy agent on fertility in women.

      Understanding how Temozolomide influences ovarian aging would be important information for
      physicians to predict the possibility of infertility (the inability to become pregnant)
      following recovery from Temozolomide treatment. Physicians would like to provide better
      individualized recommendations for cancer patients regarding timing of planned treatment and
      future pregnancy.

      We will do this by comparing data from the women being treated for Low Grade Glioma with
      Temozolomide to a similar group of women who have been unaffected by cancer or cancer
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Premenopausal women ages 18-44 newly diagnosed with LGG

          -  Patients fulfill the inclusion criteria for UCSF Protocol Number: CC #99102 &quot; A Phase
             II Study of Temozolomide (TEMODAR) in the Treatment of Adult Patients with
             Supratentorial Low Grade Glioma&quot;

          -  Patients with histologically proven supratentorial low grade glioma.

          -  Patients may or may not have had a surgical resection.

          -  Patients must be expected to live the length of study

          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent according to institutional
             guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or
             radiation to pelvic region.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient was diagnosed at least 2 years
             earlier and has been disease-free for at least 6 months following the completion of
             curative intent therapy with the following exceptions: Patients with treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
             regardless of the disease-free duration, are eligible for this study if definitive
             treatment for the condition has been completed.

          -  Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would
             compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation,
             follow up, or interpretation of study results.

          -  Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled
             (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without
             improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including
             &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs, substance abuse or had a recent history
             (within the last year) of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study or is not in the best interest of the
             patient.
