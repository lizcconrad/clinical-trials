      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of ethinylestradiol 30µg-drospirenone
      combined with metformin and weight loss by means of dietary intervention on the indices of
      endothelial dysfunction (i.e. flow-mediated dilation and serum endothelin-1), serum
      hsCRP,lipids,insulin resistance and body composition in young women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) frequently cluster several cardiovascular risk
      markers and early subclinical atherosclerosis. Because combined oral contraceptives (COCs),
      the most common treatment of this disease, might adversely influence insulin resistance,
      glucose tolerance, lipid profile or aggravate chronic inflammation the possibility of
      worsening the already unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile of PCOS subjects is of concern.
      On the contrary, the insulin sensitizer metformin has been shown to ameliorate insulin
      resistance, reduce hyperandrogenism and triglyceride levels and also to improve endothelial
      structure and function in PCOS. Drospirenone (DRP) is a progestin with antiandrogenic and
      antimineralocorticoid activity. However, the studies assessing the effect of the COC
      containing 30 µg EE+3mg DRP (DRP/EE30µg) on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis are few and
      inconclusive. Therefore,the purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of the oral
      contraceptive DRP/EE30µg combined with metformin and weight loss by means of dietary
      intervention on the indices of endothelial dysfunction, i.e. flow-mediated dilation and serum
      endothelin-1, serum hsCRP,lipids, and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS.
