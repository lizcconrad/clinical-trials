  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is an investigator-initiated, randomized-controlled trial of the effectiveness
      of written and verbal parent-specific depression education and motivational advice in
      increasing participants self-disclosed intention to seek follow-up care for possible
      depression symptoms. The control condition is written and verbal general depression education
      and advice. Hypothesis: the office-based experimental intervention of written and verbal
      parent-specific depression and emotional health education and motivational advice increases
      intention to seek follow-up services for emotional health or depression, when compared to
      written and verbal general depression education and advice.

      Maternal depression is a common problem, debilitating for mothers and affecting parenting
      practices with negative effects on the behavior, development, and physical health of
      children. The value of identifying and treating maternal depression for child development and
      well-being is well documented. Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers to the recognition
      and treatment of maternal depression. This is particularly problematic in younger women, as
      they are less often seen for health care. The overall objective of this project is to test
      whether the uptake of follow-up recommendations for potential depression by mothers
      identified by screening in clinical settings is improved by parent-specific targetting of
      depression education and motivational advice.
