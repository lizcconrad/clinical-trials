      The Acute Carotid Sinus Endovascular Stimulation II (ACES II) Study is a multicenter,
      prospective, non-randomized study that is being conducted to evaluate the feasibility of
      endovascular stimulation of carotid sinus nerves via an electrophysiology (EP) catheter
      advanced into the internal jugular vein (IJV). The current study investigates the hypothesis
      that intraoperative electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus from the IJV will result in
      an acute and dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure and heart rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study objectives are being assessed during the intraoperative baroreceptor stimulation.
      No subsequent testing will be performed. The follow-up visit is only intended to assess for
      adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years old

          -  Subject is hypertensive (defined as at least one in-office Systolic BP measurement
             ≥140 mm Hg or Diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg within three months prior to enrollment

          -  Subject is undergoing a cardiac catheterization involving right heart catheterization
             and/or EP procedures.

          -  Subject (or subject's legally authorized representative) is able and wiling to give
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an ejection fraction (EF) less than 35% (by most recent echocardiography
             in the past 6 months) and there has been no change in clinical status relative to EF

          -  Subject is a woman who is pregnant, nursing, or of child bearing potential and is not
             on a reliable form of birth control

          -  Subject is enrolled or is planning to participate in a concurrent drug and/or device
             study during the course of this clinical trial. Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is
             only allowed with documented pre-approval from the Medtronic study manager,
             documenting that there is not a concern that co-enrollment could confound the results
             of this trial.

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to participate with study procedures
