    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Mean percent change from Baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. Analyses were performed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate. Percentage change from Baseline=(measure at Month 6 - measure at Baseline) divided by the measure at Baseline * 100.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <description>Mean percent change from Baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. Analyses were performed using the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate. Percentage change from Baseline=(measure at Month 6 – measure at Baseline) divided by the measure at Baseline * 100.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.
