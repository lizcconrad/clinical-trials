  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the rosiglitazone/glimepiride fixed-dose
      combination tablet will safely and effectively control glycemia as first-line oral therapy in
      drug naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes. This 24-week study will compare the effects of
      treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride to treatment with glimepiride alone. The primary
      objective is to demonstrate superiority of rosiglitazone/glimepiride to glimepiride in
      lowering Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The antihyperglycemic effect of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of oral antidiabetic agents
      is due to their ability to increase insulin sensitivity at the cellular level, which in turn
      improves the ability of endogenous insulin to regulate glucose utilization by the tissues.
      Compounds of the sulfonylurea (SU) class act to stimulate insulin production by the pancreas,
      overcoming insulin resistance by increasing circulating insulin levels. The mechanisms of two
      kind OADs may be viewed as complementary, offering the opportunity for improved efficacy and
      durability of effect through coadministration of a TZD and a sulfonylurea.

      Successful management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires aggressive glycemic control
      starting at the earliest stages of the disease. Rosiglitazone/glimepiride combination
      therapy, with complementary mechanisms of action, has the potential to provide significant
      benefits over monotherapy as first line therapy. Treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride at
      this early stage of diabetes is expected to provide better glycemic control and allow a
      greater proportion of patients to achieve target glycemic goals than oral monotherapy.

      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, study to compare the effects of
      treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride combination or glimepiride in drug naïve T2 DM
      patients.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for HbA1c assessment. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The American Diabetes Association has recommended an HbA1c value below 53 millimoles per mole (mmol/mol) (7.0%) for most participants. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Proinsulin and Insulin at Week 24/Early Withdrawal (EW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24/EW</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples of participants who had fasted for 12-14 hours were collected for fasting proinsulin (precursor of insulin) and insulin assessment. Preproinsulin is sequentially processed via proinsulin, through intermediate proteolytic cleavage products, to insulin and C-peptide before release from the beta cell granule by exocytosis. Elevated levels of proinsulin are considered indicative of beta cell dysfunction. Insulin is a hormone that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24/ EW minus the value at Baseline (Week 0).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 24</title>
        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for HbA1c assessment. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The American Diabetes Association has recommended an HbA1c value below 53 millimoles per mole (mmol/mol) (7.0%) for most participants. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 24</title>
        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for FPG assessment. The FPG test, also known as the fasting blood sugar test, measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. Change from Baseline in FBG was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <description>Blood samples of participants who had fasted for 12-14 hours were collected for fasting proinsulin (precursor of insulin) and insulin assessment. Preproinsulin is sequentially processed via proinsulin, through intermediate proteolytic cleavage products, to insulin and C-peptide before release from the beta cell granule by exocytosis. Elevated levels of proinsulin are considered indicative of beta cell dysfunction. Insulin is a hormone that regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24/ EW minus the value at Baseline (Week 0).</description>

        <description>Blood samples of participants who had fasted for 12-14 hours were collected for fasting glucose (FG) and insulin (FI) assessment. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance (a condition in which natural hormone insulin becomes less effective in lowering blood sugars) and beta-cell (specialized cells in the pancreas producing insulin) function.

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) at Week 24/EW</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is used as a measure of health outcome and includes single-item measures (coded on a 3-point scale [1, no problems; 2, some problems; 3, severe problems]) of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The instrument includes a global rating of current health using a visual analog scale (VAS): 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). Health states may be converted to a single summary index by applying a formula that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension. The index scale is -0.111 to 1. A lower index indicates worse health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adjusted Diabetes Quality of Life (A-DQOL) Scores at Week 24/EW</title>
        <description>In diabetic participants, QOL, anxiety, and depression were measured by the A-DQOL scale . There are 46 core items (10 additional items for adolescents) and 4 major dimensions: treatment satisfaction, treatment impact, worry about long-term complications, and worry about social/vocational issues. Participants respond to all items on a 5-point Likert scale: 1, no impact, no worries, or always satisfied; 5, always affected, always worried, or never satisfied. The total score is a sum of the individual scores of all 46 items (range of 46 to 230); a lower score indicates a better QOL.</description>

        <description>Blood samples of participants were collected for MCV assessment. Change from Baseline in MCV was calculated as the value at Week 24/EW minus the value at Baseline. MCV is the average size of the red blood cells expressed in femtoliters. MCV is calculated by dividing the hematocrit (as percent) by the RBC count in millions per microliter of blood, then multiplying by 10. MCV is one of the three main RBC indices that are helpful in determining the cause of anemia.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Data at Week 24/EW</title>
        <description>PR, QT, QTc, RR, QRS, and QRS axis data were measured by ECG. The PR interval (int.) starts at the beginning of the atrial contraction and ends at the beginning of the ventricular contraction. QT (QT int.) and QTc (corrected QT int.) indicate how fast the ventricles are repolarized, becoming ready for a new cycle. The RR int. represents the duration of the ventricular cardiac cycle and is an indicator of ventricular rate. QRS (QRS duration) indicates how fast the ventricles depolarize. The QRS axis is an indicator of the electrical heart axis, which is an average of all heart depolarization.</description>
