  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal nutritional management consists in reproducing miming uteri growth kinetic. Since
      the seventies, NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) strategy consists in a high proteidic
      input (apport) supposed to allow optimal neurodevelopment. However, nutritional practices and
      strategies have significantly evolved during these last years, influenced by Baker
      nutritional imprinting concept (2002). Actually, neonatal high proteidic exposition could
      perturb metabolism and hormonal systems of newborns conducting to a reinforcement of obesity
      and cardio-vascular pathology prevalence in this target population at adulthood. In this
      context many studies emerged since 2000 and try to assess the trade-off between
      neurodevelopment and growth under nutrition conditions. EPIPOD try to focus the link between
      heterogenous proteic input dispensed in our NICU (described by tercil methods on population)
      and fat mass phenotype variations at discharge (described by tercil methods); and its
      consequences on neurodevelopmental growth. Understanding how particular nutritional
      exposition could determine &quot;fatty&quot; phenotype and impact neurodevelopment is clearly our main
      goal.

    <description>EPIPOD consists in a Non-Interventional Research according to French regulations. Actually, Peapod examination at discharge takes part of current clinical practice and patient management in Nantes Neonatal Intensive Care Unit since 2008.
After checking inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and obtaining oral informed consent from newborn legal authority or parents, PEAPOD assessment was leaded in the last week of hospitalization. Consisting in 2 repeated measurement, body composition estimation was completed by clinical and demographic data as neonatal nutrition (Parenteral nutrition pattern at Day 5, 10 and 21, and ASQ/BLR Neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years old).</description>
