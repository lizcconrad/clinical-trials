  <brief_title>The Effect of Testosterone Replacement on the High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Subgroups</brief_title>
  <official_title>Phase 4 Study That Compares the High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL) Cholesterol Subgroups of the Patients With Congenital Hypogonadotrophic Hypogonadism With That of the Healthy Control Subjects, and Investigates the Effect of Testosterone Treatment on HDL Subgroups.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to answer the following questions:

        1. Is there any difference between the compositions of the HDL cholesterol subpopulations
           of patients with hypogonadism and the healthy controls.

        2. What is the effect of testosterone replacement therapy on the distributions of HDL
           subgroups.

        3. Is there any difference between the effects of the two different testosteron replacement
           regiments

      This study has two designs:

        1. The case control design to search for the difference between the HDL subgroups and the
           other metabolic parameters between the healthy subjects and the patients with
           hypogonadism

        2. The follow-up study to search for the effects of two different testosterone replacement
           regiments.

    <description>The HDL subfractions were measured by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation technique. Two different reagents were prepared in different PEG concentrations and pH values. The supernatant of the solution precipitated with reagent A contained total HDL cholesterol while the supernatant of the solution precipitated with reagent B, contained only the HDL3 subclass. The cholesterol was then quantified by enzymatic with CHOD-PAP reagent (Olympus Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). HDL2 cholesterol was measured by calculating the difference between total HDL and the HDL3 subclass.</description>
