    <description>The daily pain rating scale (DPRS) consists of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.

    <description>The DPRS consists of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Participants described their pain during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number between 0 and 10.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) Score at Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>SF-MPQ was assessed according to the participant's answer to the SF-MPQ questionnaire. The score for each composite scale (sensory, affective, and total) was derived by summing the reported intensity value for each item within a particular scale where None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The sensory score was the sum of the scores of the first 11 pain descriptors (throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting) and could range from 0-33. The affective score was the sum of the scores of the last 4 pain descriptors (tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) and could range from 0-12. The total score was the sum of the scores of all 15 pain descriptors and could range from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicated greater pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assessed key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. With the exception of sleep adequacy, optimal sleep, and quantity, higher scores reflected greater impairment in the MOS-Sleep subscales.

        <description>The daily pain rating scale (DPRS) consists of an 11-point numeric scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) Score at Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8</title>
        <description>SF-MPQ was assessed according to the participant’s answer to the SF-MPQ questionnaire. The score for each composite scale (sensory, affective, and total) was derived by summing the reported intensity value for each item within a particular scale where None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The sensory score was the sum of the scores of the first 11 pain descriptors (throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting) and could range from 0-33. The affective score was the sum of the scores of the last 4 pain descriptors (tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) and could range from 0-12. The total score was the sum of the scores of all 15 pain descriptors and could range from 0 to 45. Higher scores indicated greater pain.</description>

        <title>Baseline Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-Sleep Scale Scores</title>
        <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assessed key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. With the exception of sleep adequacy, optimal sleep, and quantity, higher scores reflected greater impairment in the MOS-Sleep subscales. The MOS-Sleep Scale was used to evaluate sleep during the previous week.</description>

        <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assessed key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. The awaken short of breath subscale also ranged from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating less difficulty in breathing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MOS-Sleep Scale, Somnolence Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The MOS-Sleep Scale was a participant-rated questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assessed key constructs of sleep. Instrument scoring yielded 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9-item overall sleep problems index. The total score ranged from 0 to 100. The somnolence subscale score also ranged from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating less somnolence.</description>

        <description>The HADS was a self-administered questionnaire that consisted of 2 subscales, 1 measuring anxiety (HADS-A Scale) and the other measuring depression (HADS-D Scale). Each subscale comprised of 7 items; participants assessed how each item applied to them on a scale of 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Subscores from HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression) were not to be combined. The interpretation of each HADS subscales was as follows: 0-7 normal, 8-10 mild, 11-14 moderate and 15-21 severe.</description>

          <description>The HADS was a self-administered questionnaire that consisted of 2 subscales, 1 measuring anxiety (HADS-A Scale) and the other measuring depression (HADS-D Scale). Each subscale comprised of 7 items; participants assessed how each item applied to them on a scale of 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Subscores from HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression) were not to be combined. The interpretation of each HADS subscales was as follows: 0-7 normal, 8-10 mild, 11-14 moderate and 15-21 severe.</description>
