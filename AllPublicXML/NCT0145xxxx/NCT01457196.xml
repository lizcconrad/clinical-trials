    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this specimen correlative study is two-fold: to provide a mechanism
      for the association of known molecular alterations with clinical outcomes, and to provide
      rapid genetic profiling of alterations with known clinical utility using tumor and germline
      specimens to support treatment decisions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or prospective cancer patients; current cancer patients must have
             histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer

          2. Tumor tissue available and suitable for molecular analyses from at least one of the
             following sources:

               -  Tissue previously stored in UNC's Tissue Procurement Facility (TPF)

               -  Tissue previous stored at an institution other than UNC-CH, provided
                  investigators can determine that the tumors were sampled and stored under
                  appropriate conditions for inclusion in the study

               -  Patient undergoing tissue collection as per clinical standard of care and willing
                  to allow specimens from surplus tissue to be diverted for research purposes

               -  Patient undergoing tissue collection as per clinical standard of care and willing
                  to have additional specimens taken for research

               -  Patient willing to undergo biopsy for purpose of research only

          3. The following inclusion criteria apply only to patients undergoing biopsy for research
             purposes only under this protocol:

               -  â‰¥18 years of age

               -  Treatment options offer no expectation of cure, e.g., advanced solid tumor
                  patients with metastatic disease. NOTE: This restriction applies to biopsy of
                  vital organs only, e.g., lung, liver, etc.

               -  Appropriate candidate for research biopsy based on institutional standards for
                  target biopsy site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition that would make participation in the protocol unreasonably hazardous for
             the patient in the opinion of the treating physician

          2. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition or co-morbid condition
             that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.

          3. The following exclusion criteria apply only to enrolled patients undergoing biopsy for
             research purposes only:

          4. History of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction to local anesthetics (i.e.
             lidocaine, xylocaine) or any medications used for conscious sedation (if applicable).

          5. Requires general anesthesia for collection of biopsy

          6. Pregnant or lactating women

          7. Active cardiac disease

          8. Patients receiving bevacizumab less than 6 weeks prior to enrollment into this study
             should not undergo research core biopsies because of the concern for potential
             increased bleeding risk and delayed healing. (NOTE: Patients receiving bevacizumab who
             are undergoing a research biopsy of accessible organs (e.g. breast, lymph node, skin
             etc.) must be two weeks from the last dose of the angiogenesis inhibitor).
