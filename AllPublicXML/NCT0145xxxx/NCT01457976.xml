      The study concerns a survey of attitudes of the public on issues around personal
      responsibility for health and the use of financial incentives to promote health in the U.S.
      and Germany. All data are gathered anonymously through online platforms. Two separate
      professional panel providers are used for access to members of the public. All participants
      are people who have voluntarily joined a survey panel in the past through an informed consent
      process and currently serve as panel members.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survey respondents are presented with scenarios that seek to elicit views and attitudes on the concepts of personal responsibility, and the acceptability of financial incentives. The analysis will present these views and attitudes in aggregate form.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes are measured using 5 point Likert scales, indicating the extent of agreement or disagreement with particular scenarios or questions. Other forms of multiple choice options are also used, in which respondents express their preferences by selecting one option over others. At the end of the surveys, an open text box is provided for general comments.</description>
