    <textblock>
      There is no formal research hypothesis to be statistically tested in this protocol.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) when
           combined with three platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens (Cisplatin/Gemcitabine;
           Cisplatin/Pemetrexed; and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) in subjects with NSCLC.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as maintenance therapy
           in combination with Bevacizumab/Avastin that will be given after at least 4 cycles of
           platinum doublet chemotherapy.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with
           Erlotinib among epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous
           NSCLC subjects and as monotherapy in subjects with NSCLC.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with
           Ipilimumab in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as switch maintenance
           therapy in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC.

        -  The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as monotherapy among
           subjects with untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases and no evidence of cerebral
           edema.
