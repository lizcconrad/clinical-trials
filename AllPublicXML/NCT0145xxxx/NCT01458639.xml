      Phase 3 within-subject trial of Technegas V/Q SPECT and Tc-99m macro-aggregated albumin (MAA)
      imaging compared to Xenon-133 V/Q planar and Tc-99m macroaggregate of albumin (MAA) imaging

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 within-subject trial of Technegas Ventilation SPECT and Tc-99m MAA
      perfusion imaging compared to xenon (Xe-133) Ventilation Planar and Tc-99m MAA perfusion
      imaging for the diagnosis of PE. Diagnosis of PE provided by review of the subjects'
      documented clinical information after 30 days of follow-up. Primary assessments of efficacy
      will be based on an independent blind reads of the Technegas V/Q SPECT images by three
      different readers and the independent blind reads of Xe 133 V/Q planar images by three
      different readers.

             radiopharmaceutical not otherwise specified within 72 hours of this imaging study.

          2. Has previously undergone an imaging study with a Tc-99m agent, within 48 hours of this

          6. Is hemodynamically unstable.

          7. Has received therapeutic dose of low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin within
             24 hours prior to dosing or Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) within 4 hours prior to
