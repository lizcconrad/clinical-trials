    <textblock>
      A multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of BPS 314d-MR in subjects with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension currently receiving treatment with an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA)
      and/or a Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor (PDE-5 inhibitor).

      Approximately 100 centers will be participating in the study. Approximately 630 eligible
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two groups, BPS-314d-MR (active) or placebo study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BPS-314d-MR in subjects with
      PAH who are treated with background therapy such as ERA and/or a PDE-5 inhibitor.

      Subjects who consent to the study will be assessed at the Screening and Baseline visits to
      determine eligibility for the study. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at the Baseline
      visit will be enrolled into the study and treated by either active or placebo study drug. The
      subject, the clinical site staff and the Sponsor will be blinded to the treatment assignment.
      Treatment assignment will be random.

      Following the Baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinical site at Week 6, Week 12,
      Week 20 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects will undergo all scheduled efficacy and
      safety assessments, as defined by the protocol. Between scheduled clinical site visits, the
      clinical site staff will be required to contact the subject by a telephone call to assess
      tolerability to study drug and change subject's dosage as appropriate. Telephone calls should
      occur at least once weekly for the first 20 study weeks when dose changes will occur most
      frequently and subjects are becoming familiar with the study procedures. Telephone calls will
      occur at least once monthly thereafter. Subjects will be provided with an electronic diary to
      record doses taken and help in tracking of health issues for conversations with the clinical
      site staff.

      Subjects will continue their participation in the study until the Sponsor formally closes the
      study. At that time the subject will return to the clinical site for an End of Treatment
      visit to complete all scheduled tests. Subjects who are participating in the study at its
      conclusion may be offered the opportunity to enroll in a long-term extension study. Subjects
      who do not continue into an extension study are required to discontinue from study drug.

      Subjects will be urged to remain in the study for long-term follow-up even if study drug is
      discontinued.

      In the event that a subject withdraws consent for participation in the study or the
      Investigator terminates the subject from the study the subject will return to the clinical
      site for an End of Treatment visit to complete all scheduled tests. After study drug has been
      permanently discontinued, and if the subject is terminated from the study, the subject will
      return to the clinical site after 30-37 days for a final Safety Follow-up visit and to return
      any remaining study drug.

      The optional Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be offered to all study subjects at
      clinical sites. Subjects within those sites will decide if they wish to participate in the
      optional PK evaluation. For those subjects electing to participate, two blood samples will be
      collected at three clinical site visits (Weeks 6, 12 and 20).

      The optional hemodynamic sub-study will be offered to all study subjects at clinical sites.
      All subjects at the selected research centers will be offered the opportunity to volunteer in
      the sub-study. Hemodynamic measurements will be assessed by Right Heart Catheterization
      (RHC). For those subjects who consent to the RHC, the RHC procedure will be performed at the
      Baseline visit and during Week 20.

             capillary hemangiomatosis, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

          2. As the diagnosis of PAH may be challenging in subjects with multiple co-morbid
             conditions, if the subject has the presence of two or more of the following co-morbid
             conditions:

               -  Diabetes

               -  Body Mass Index [BMI] &gt; 35

               -  Past history of pulmonary embolism

               -  Chronic atrial fibrillation

               -  FEV1 of &lt; 70% of predicted

               -  Systemic hypertension requiring treatment. AND

               -  the Sponsor does not concur, in writing, with the appropriateness of the subject
                  to enter the study.

          3. Has a history of interstitial lung disease, unless subject has collagen vascular
             disease and has had pulmonary function testing conducted within 6 months of the
             Baseline visit demonstrating a total lung capacity ≥70% of predicted.

          4. Has a history of obstructive lung disease, unless subject has had pulmonary function
             testing conducted within 6 months of the Baseline visit demonstrating a forced

          6. Has received prostanoid therapy at any time.

          7. Modified dose, initiated or discontinued any PAH medication within 30 days prior to
             the Baseline visit including, but not limited to, an ERA, PDE-5 inhibitor, oral
             vasodilators, diuretics, digoxin, oxygen or calcium channel blocker (with the
             exception of anticoagulants).

          8. Has an ongoing hemorrhagic condition (e.g., upper digestive tract hemorrhage,
             hemoptysis, etc.), or has a pre existing condition that, in the Investigator's
             judgment, may increase the risk for developing hemorrhage during the study (e.g.,
             hemophilia). Transient hemorrhage (e.g., epistaxis, normal menstrual bleeding,
             gingival bleeding, hemorrhoidal bleeding, etc.) will not preclude enrollment

             40% as assessed by either multigated angiogram, angiography or echocardiography, or
             left ventricular shortening fraction &lt;22% as assessed by echocardiography. Note that
             subjects in whom abnormal left ventricular function is attributed entirely to impaired
             left ventricular filling due to the effects of right ventricular overload (i.e., right
             ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation) will not be excluded.

         15. Has creatinine clearance &lt;30 (using the Crockroft-Gault formula) or requires
             hemodialysis.

         16. Has Childs-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis.
