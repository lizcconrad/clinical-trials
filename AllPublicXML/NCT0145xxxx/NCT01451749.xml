  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III study is to further evaluate the effects of shenwu capsule, a
      traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on cognition, function and memory in patients with
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's
      disease, in a 6-month supervised protocol of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. The
      results of this study may provide support for a relatively simple and inexpensive treatment
      strategy with herbal therapy that specifically targets individuals with the mild cognitive
      impairment that directly influence risk of developing dementia for older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a group of individuals who have some cognitive
      impairment but of insufficient severity to constitute dementia1,which is a transitional stage
      between normal aging and dementia. Amnestic MCI is the most common subtype of MCI, which
      shows the least reversion to normal, and is defined as a significant impairment in memory but
      with no impairment in activities of daily living. In an interventional study of patients
      meeting Petersen criteria for amnestic MCI, 16% progressed to dementia per year, 99% of whom
      received an AD diagnosis. Hence, MCI, in particular amnestic MCI is generally recognized in
      many cases to represent prodromal AD and becomes a new target for prevention and treatment of
      AD.

      The specific aims for the study is to evaluate change in Efficacy and safety of shenwu
      capsule in treating amnestic MCI. Using a randomized controlled parallel group design, 324
      older adults diagnosed with amnestic MCI participate in a 6-month supervised protocol of
      either shenwu capsule or donepezil. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at
      baseline, and months 3 and 6. Before the 6-month intervention, medial temporal atrophy (MTA)
      or hippocampal volume atrophy on the CT or MRI scan are assessed for all subjects. The
      results of this study may provide support for a safer and inexpensive treatment strategy that
      specifically targets individuals with the mild cognitive impairment that directly influence
      risk of developing dementia for older adults.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Scores: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive. Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) , at baseline (day 1 clinic visit) and at 12-week intervals thereafter until week 24. The ADAS-cog was designed specifically to evaluate the severity of cognitive dysfunctions characteristic of AD patients and includes 11 items. Among these items, memory, orientation, language function, practical ability, and attention are evaluated. The score on the ADAS-cog range from 0 to 70 point, with 0 point indicating no impairment and 70 points indicating severe impairment of cognition. In the Shenwu capsule group, the ADAS-cog score is ranges 3-38.3 points, and 3.3-30.7 points in the Donepezil group. The Change in cognitive scores was calculated as24 week minus the baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Memory Scores: The Delayed Story Recall (DSR) Test From the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>memory function was evaluated with the DSR subtest,at baseline (day 1 clinic visit), at the mid-study (week 12), and at the endpoint of treatment (week 24). The DSR is a tool which was designed to assess immediate registration of verbal information and retention over time. It contains six sub-tests: two verbal memory tests (one of which is a story recall), two visual memory tests and two information-processing tests. The story recall test includes immediate story recall (ISR) and delayed story recall (DSR). The DSR total score ranges from 0-56 points. Lowers score means higher impairment of memory.The Change in cognitive scores was calculated as 24 week minus the baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Scores: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to weeks 24</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability was evaluated with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) IADL, at baseline (day 1 clinic visit), at the mid-study (week 12), and at the endpoint of treatment (week 24). The IADL contains eight items, which are the ability to use a telephone, shop, prepare food, run laundry, use modes of transportation, take responsibility for one's own medications, complete housekeeping, and handle finances,each items ranges from 1 to 4 points, 1 points means no problem, and 4 points means greater impairment in instumental acvtiveity of daily living.The total is sub of the eight items, and the total range of the IADL is 8-32 points, higher scores indicate greater impairments. The changes was calculted by weeks 24 minus baseline.</description>

          <description>The Mini-mental State Examination(MMSE) is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. It is used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The scores of the MMSE ranges from 0 to 30, and a lower score indicate higher impairment. The MMSE score ranges from 24-30 points in both group.</description>

        <description>Cognition was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) , at baseline (day 1 clinic visit) and at 12-week intervals thereafter until week 24. The ADAS-cog was designed specifically to evaluate the severity of cognitive dysfunctions characteristic of AD patients and includes 11 items. Among these items, memory, orientation, language function, practical ability, and attention are evaluated. The score on the ADAS-cog range from 0 to 70 point, with 0 point indicating no impairment and 70 points indicating severe impairment of cognition. In the Shenwu capsule group, the ADAS-cog score is ranges 3-38.3 points, and 3.3-30.7 points in the Donepezil group. The Change in cognitive scores was calculated as24 week minus the baseline.</description>

        <description>memory function was evaluated with the DSR subtest,at baseline (day 1 clinic visit), at the mid-study (week 12), and at the endpoint of treatment (week 24). The DSR is a tool which was designed to assess immediate registration of verbal information and retention over time. It contains six sub-tests: two verbal memory tests (one of which is a story recall), two visual memory tests and two information-processing tests. The story recall test includes immediate story recall (ISR) and delayed story recall (DSR). The DSR total score ranges from 0-56 points. Lowers score means higher impairment of memory.The Change in cognitive scores was calculated as 24 week minus the baseline.</description>

          <title>Change in Memory Scores: The Delayed Story Recall (DSR) Test From the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB)</title>
          <description>memory function was evaluated with the DSR subtest,at baseline (day 1 clinic visit), at the mid-study (week 12), and at the endpoint of treatment (week 24). The DSR is a tool which was designed to assess immediate registration of verbal information and retention over time. It contains six sub-tests: two verbal memory tests (one of which is a story recall), two visual memory tests and two information-processing tests. The story recall test includes immediate story recall (ISR) and delayed story recall (DSR). The DSR total score ranges from 0-56 points. Lowers score means higher impairment of memory.The Change in cognitive scores was calculated as 24 week minus the baseline.</description>
