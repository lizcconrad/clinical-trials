  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots in lung arteries (pulmonary embolism) are usually detected using a radiological
      test called computed tomography (CT scan). As technology advances, the CT scans are able to
      detect smaller and smaller blood clots. Over time, the frequency of blood clots in the
      pulmonary arteries has increased significantly (CT scan are now detecting very small blood
      clots that the investigators could not see before). As a result, more and more people are on
      blood thinners to treat these small blood clots but their true clinical significance is
      unknown.

      The management of blood thinners is costly and also utilizes scarce healthcare resources.
      These blood thinners need to be monitored with frequent blood work. Furthermore, every year,
      approximately 3 percent of patients on blood thinners will have a major bleeding event
      requiring medical attention.

      The investigators don't think that treating these small blood clots in the pulmonary arteries
      detected on CT scan is worth the risk of bleeding from the blood thinners.

      The main goal of this study is to find out if it is safe to not treat very small blood clots
      in the pulmonary arteries.

      The investigators plan to follow 300 patients with small blood clots in their lungs for 90
      days. These patients will not be treated with blood thinners but will be followed closely
      with other non-invasive tests to avoid progression or recurrence of blood clots.

               -  Isolated SSPE is defined as CTPA demonstrating an intraluminal filling defect in
                  a subsegmental artery with no filling defects visualized at more proximal
                  pulmonary artery levels.

          1. Proximal lower extremity (popliteal vein or above) or upper extremity (subclavian vein
             or above) DVT.

          2. Need for long term oral anticoagulant therapy for reasons other than VTE.

             unusual site thrombosis (e.g. splanchnic or cerebral vein thrombosis).
