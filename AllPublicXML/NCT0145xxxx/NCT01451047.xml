    <description>A piece of occipital scalp is taken from the subject. The epidermal and dermal cells from this tissue are expanded in culture. The cells are then harvested and, for certain types of product, combined. These cells are then injected into the balding area of the scalp of the original subject.</description>

             vertex circle.

          -  Have no clinically significant disease or abnormal laboratory results taken at the
             screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity to DMEM/F-12 or any component of the study material.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to clindamycin hydrochloride, amphotericin B or streptomycin
             sulfate.

          -  Subjects who have used minoxidil, or any oral or topical medication including over the
             counter and herbal medications for the treatment of hair loss within 6 months of study
             screening, or finasteride or dutasteride within 12 months of study screening.

          -  A history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year of study enrollment.

          -  Clinically significant medical or psychiatric illness currently or within 30 days of
             study screening as determined by the investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters.

          -  A positive result at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1 or 2),
             Hepatitis B or C, HTLV I/II.

          -  Dermatologic condition in donation and/or study areas.

          -  Prior surgery in the treatment area.

          -  Insufficient hair or scarring in the donor area that might impact cell growth.

          -  Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system function; or any condition that
             would place the subject at increased risk.
