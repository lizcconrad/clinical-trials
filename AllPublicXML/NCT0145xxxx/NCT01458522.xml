    <textblock>
      This a phase 2 study comparing the efficacy of intravenous (IV) lacosamide (LCM) with IV
      fosphenytoin (fPHT) in controlling frequent nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs), the Adverse Events
      profile of LCM compared with fPHT when used to treat frequent NCSs, and length of stay in an
      intensive care unit for subjects treated with LCM versus subjects treated with fPHT. The
      trial will include a preacute-treatment period, an acute-treatment period, a
      postacute-treatment period, and a long-term follow-up period.

    <description>fPHT treatment arm, a bolus of 20 mg PE/kg will be administered at a rate of no greater than 75 mg PE/minute. If a further bolus is required, 5 mg PE/kg will be administered. The daily maintenance dose for fPHT will be 5 mg PE/kg divided into 2 doses.</description>

    <description>LCM treatment arm, a bolus of 400 mg will be administered over 30 minutes. If a further bolus is required, 200 mg will be administered. Regardless of whether the subject received a rebolus, he or she will begin receiving a maintenance dose 12 hours after the initial dose. The daily maintenance dose will be the same as the total bolus (400 mg or 600 mg) divided into 2 doses.</description>

    <description>If after initial treatment with fPHT any of the following occurs, the subject will have reached the end of the first treatment arm and will &quot;cross over&quot; and begin receiving the other drug, ie, the one not originally administered:
The subject subsequently has another seizure within 24 hours following the 2-hour post-rebolus observation-only period.
The subject does not receive a rebolus but has a seizure within 24 hours following the 2 hour post-bolus observation-only period.
The subject experiences an AE that precludes further use of the first study drug.
If crossover occurs, the subject will &quot;start over&quot; with the second drug, going through the same observation-only period, rebolusing (if necessary), and study assessments with the second drug, beginning with the Baseline assessments.</description>

             lasting longer than 10 minutes).

          4. Episodes of SE, defined as at least 30 minutes of ESz activity in 1 hour, in the last
             6 hours.

             without clear ESzs (for definitions of periodic discharges, rhythmic delta activity,
             and ESzs, see the Manual of Operations).

          8. Electroencephalographic seizures consistent with typical absence seizures.
