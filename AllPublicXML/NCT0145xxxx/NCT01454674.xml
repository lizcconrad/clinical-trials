  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a three dose level, cross-over vegetable feeding study using
      expertise from nutritional sciences and plant sciences to:

        1. Implement a randomized vegetable feeding trial among overweight post- menopausal women

        2. Produce, in a controlled environmental setting, vegetable crops which provide a selected
           variety and quantity of carotenoid and nutrient exposure

        3. Assess changes and hopefully demonstrate a significant reduction in oxidant stress and
           inflammation in this population at risk for developing chronic disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women were randomly assigned a vegetable feeding dose order of consuming 2,5 &amp; 10
      servings/day of vegetables for 3 week periods, with feeding periods separated by 4 week
      washout periods, during which time a limited number of low biological value fruits and
      vegetables were eaten.

      This research will provide important and relevant information to fill several gaps in our
      current knowledge including a more thorough description of the oxidant stress and
      inflammatory status of overweight, postmenopausal women, assessment of the relevant daily
      &quot;dose&quot; of vegetables necessary to modulate biomarkers of oxidant stress and inflammation in
      overweight postmenopausal women and evaluation of the association between plasma nutrient and
      carotenoid levels in relation to changes in oxidant stress and inflammation in this
      population. Our long-term goal is to reduce chronic disease risk among &quot;at-risk&quot;
      post-menopausal females.
