    <textblock>
      Several factors characterize repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a
      strategic aid in the treatment of postpartum depression.

      However, up to current days there have been no studies evaluating the effects of rTMS on
      neurocognitive and social performance of women suffering from the disorder.

      The present study evaluates the impacts of rTMS in clinical, cognitive and social
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive technique that can influence specific
      areas of the brain and has very few side effects.

      The treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation requires attendance to hospital daily
      sessions for 4 consecutive weeks. Each session lasts up to 30 minutes.

      Side effects include scalp discomfort and mild headache. No anesthesia is required.

      Stimulation aims the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region previously studied to treat
      depression symptoms with positive results.

      The present technique has never been employed in previous studies, but risks are
      insignificant.
