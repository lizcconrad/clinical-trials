      Title:

      The effect of dance-therapy on the functional capacity, body image and quality of life of
      patients with advanced obesity

      Project duration:

      33 months (August 2010 to June 2013)

      Clinical context:

      Obesity has reached epidemic proportions. The gait and balance problems in obese people and
      the associated decreased functional capacity and risk of falling highlight the need to
      evaluate the benefits of specific treatments on these problems. Attention should be paid not
      only to metabolic management but also to the physical rehabilitation required in cases of
      advanced obesity.

      Objectives:

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dance-therapy on functional capacity
      (walking ability, postural control and physical activity level), body image and quality of
      life of patients with advanced obesity.
