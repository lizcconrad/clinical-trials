      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy and tolerability of a multiagent
      chemotherapy treatment regimen without radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma
      in the brain.

      The objective of the study is

        1. To investigate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose methotrexate-based induction
           polychemotherapy regimen combined with Rituximab and intraspinal DepoCyte followed by
           temozolomide maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed primary central nervous system
           lymphoma

        2. To assess the long term outcome concerning neurotoxicity
