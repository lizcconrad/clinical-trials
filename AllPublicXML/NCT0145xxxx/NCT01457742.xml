  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of non-thermal Pulsed Radio
      Frequency (PRF) treatment with the Ivivi SofPulse for amelioration of knee pain in patients
      with mild to moderate Osteoarthritis and to determine the duration of clinical benefit
      following discontinuation of treatment.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial will investigate
      the effectiveness of PRF using the Ivivi SofPulse on knee pain severity in adults with mild
      to moderate knee OA. Potential subjects will complete questions related to medical history,
      inclusion / exclusion criteria, and OA symptom severity. Knee radiographs will be evaluated
      by the Principal Investigator (PI) or co-investigator for determination of knee OA severity
      based on the Kellgren/Lawrence criteria. Eligible subjects will enter a 1-week run-in period.
      After successful completion of the run-in period, subjects will be randomized to PRF
      treatment twice a day (Active) or sham treatment twice a day (Sham). All subjects will be
      followed for 4 weeks for purposes of the primary endpoint evaluation. Thereafter, the
      subjects initially allocated to Active will be equally allocated to Active or Sham and will
      be followed through 26 or 8 weeks, respectively. The subjects originally assigned to Sham
      will maintain this treatment regimen through 26 weeks.

    <description>Comparison of changes in &quot;current&quot; knee pain severity at 4 wks over baseline. Between-group difference of at least 25 percentage points considered clinically significant. &quot;Current&quot; knee pain severity assessed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, 0 (no pain) and 10 (pain as bad as it can be). The knee that meets radiographic criteria for mild or moderate knee OA and has the highest knee pain severity based on the average daily severity score during the 1-wk run-in period will be selected for the primary endpoint analysis.</description>
