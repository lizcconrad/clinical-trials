  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of topical steroids in the treatment of alopecia areata in children is common
      practice. However, no particular potency of steroid is accepted as the standard treatment due
      to the paucity of high quality evidence in the dermatology literature to substantiate their
      use. Two randomized controlled trials exist assessing topical steroid efficacy in this
      disorder, both have methodological limitations. The question remains as to which topical
      steroid is safe and efficacious for use. We performed a double blinded controlled trial to
      assess the usefulness of a class 1 topical steroid (clobestasol proprionate 0.05%) compared
      with a class 7 topical steroid (hydrocortisone 1%) in children with alopecia areata.
