  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurologically-impaired individuals may have significant neurologic morbidity related to
      epilepsy and seizure disorders. Finding safe, noninvasive methods of decreasing seizures, and
      potentially reversing the epileptogenic process, is of paramount importance in improving the
      lives of those with epilepsy.

    <description>Main Outcome Measure: The effect of exposure to the auditory stimulus on seizure frequency. Changes in seizure rates from baseline to treatment years were determined and statistically compared within the treatment and control groups, as well as between the groups to assess efficacy of treatment.</description>
