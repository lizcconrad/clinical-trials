      Background: There is a hypothesis in literature that the mechanical action of deep transverse
      friction massage (DTF) produces vasodilatation and increases blood flow. But as yet, no
      experimental study has confirmed the effect of DTF on blood flow in the Achilles tendon.
      Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether one session of DTF can
      influence the Achilles tendon blood flow.

      Design: a randomized pre- posttest trial was set up. Patients: Sixty-two healthy participants
      volunteered. Each person underwent the following four steps of the procedure: 1. Measuring
      the tendon blood flow (PRE), 2.fifteen minutes of DTF on the Achilles tendon, 3. Measuring of
      the tendon blood flow (POST), 4.follow - up measurement after 20 minutes of rest (POST20).

      Intervention: one leg of each person was randomly assigned to deep transverse friction
      session, the other leg was used as a control leg. Friction was applied continuously for a
      total of 15 minutes. Measurements: the microcirculation was determined at 2 and 8 tissue
      depths at the distal and the proximal midportion of the Achilles tendon. For each level, the
      capillary blood flow, the tissue oxygen saturation, and the postcapillary venous filling
      pressure was registered.

    <description>For the application of the deep transverse friction massage, the participants were positioned supine with the ankle in 90 Â° of dorsiflexion, in order to bring some tension on the tendon. The treating clinician stabilized the subject's foot with one hand while applying the DTF with the other hand. The deep friction massage is a pinching technique with thumb and index finger, reinforced by the middle finger.</description>
