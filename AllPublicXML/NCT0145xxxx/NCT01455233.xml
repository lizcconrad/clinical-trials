  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Besivance is equal to Vigamox in safety and
      tolerance when used prophylactically in subjects undergoing routine cataract surgery.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assigned to receive either Besivance or Vigamox (1:1) to be administered as
      1 drop in the study eye 4 times daily starting 3 days prior to cataract surgery and
      continuing for 7 days post-operatively.

      Sixty subjects (30 from Ophthalmology Consultants and 30 from Ophthalmology Associates) of
      any race and either sex, requiring cataract extraction with planned implantation of a
      posterior chamber intraocular lens.
