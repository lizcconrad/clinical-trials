  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by seizures. Beside seizures people
      suffering from epilepsy experience several challenges related to education, work and everyday
      life such as learning-, problem-solving-, memory-, concentration-, attention difficulties and
      fatigue.

      It is generally approved that physical activity (PA) has a positive effect on physical as
      well as mental factors. However, people with epilepsy are found to be less active and PA is
      rarely offered or recommended as supplement to anti-epileptic medical treatment. Few studies
      have investigated the effect of PA in subjects with epilepsy and additional studies of high
      methodical quality are needed to enable evidence-based information and counselling.

      This study is carried through as a randomized controlled trial which investigates the effect
      of participation in a 10-week cardio exercise program in people with Juvenile Myoclonic
      Epilepsy aged 15-50.

      The study hypothesis is that participation in a 10-week cardio exercise program will induce a
      positive change in cognitive function (concentration and attention) and possibly in
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition it is expected that the intensity and
      duration of the 10-week cardio exercise program is sufficient to cause changes in
      physiological parameters related to a reduced risk of lifestyle diseases.
