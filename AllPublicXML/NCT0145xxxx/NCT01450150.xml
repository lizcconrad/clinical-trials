  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive method to activate or
      de-activate neurons in superficial regions of the brain through the induction of weak
      electric currents in the brain tissue delivered by two scalp electrodes. Initial studies have
      shown tDCS to be effective for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), although there are
      negative trials in the specialized literature. One reason for these discrepant results might
      be that the duration of tDCS treatment in clinical trials to date (up to 2 weeks) is still
      insufficient to produce consistent clinical improvements. Thus, we intend to assess, in a
      sample of outpatients with MDD, whether a 3-week adjunctive course of active tDCS over the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is associated with a significant clinical improvement
      when compared to sham tDCS. The investigators hypothesize that subjects receiving active tDCS
      will present with significantly higher response and remission rates at weeks 3.
