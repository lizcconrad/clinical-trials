    <textblock>
      The Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery are conducting this research study to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of intravascular angioplasty for the treatment of venous
      narrowing in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

    <description>- Percent (%) of patients with Severe Adverse Events (SAE) measured at 24 hours (Immediate) and 1 month (Short term) post-surgical safety outcome in MS patients diagnosed with CCSVI that underwent therapeutic angioplasty. . The 95% confidence interval of the SAE rates for immediate and short terms will be obtained by the exact method, respectively. For Phase II study, the immediate and short term SAE rates will be analyzed, respectively, using the Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yearfollowing</time_frame>
    <description>- Restoration of venous outflow (more than 75% of normal outflow) as measured by the combined ECD/TCD and MRV at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yearfollowing the angioplasty as compared to baseline as well as compared to a parallel control group of MS patients that will undergo only selective venography without balloon angioplasty (sham-angioplasty). These comparisons will be accomplished by the hierarchical linear model which takes into account the correlation within subjects. Based on the residuals, we will check the normality assumptions by the normal quantile plot and skewness.</description>
