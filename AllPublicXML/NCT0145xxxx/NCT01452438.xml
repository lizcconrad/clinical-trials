      The purpose of this study is to summarize the occurrence of incident serious medically
      attended events and events of interest up to 1 year following MenACWY-CRM vaccination
      administered as part of routine clinical care. This US FDA post-marketing commitment study is
      an open-label, descriptive, epidemiological safety surveillance study of MenACWY-CRM vaccine
      in subjects 2 to 10 years of age within a large US Healthcare Maintenance Organization. The
      26 events of interest are events commonly evaluated in vaccine safety studies and include
      certain neurological, immunological, vascular, musculoskeletal and hematologic disorders. All
