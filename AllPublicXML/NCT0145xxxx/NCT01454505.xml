      The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AL-53817 (Stage A)
      and evaluate the safety and efficacy of AL-53817 for the treatment of allergic rhinitis
      (Stage B).

    <textblock>
      Stage A was a 1-day, single ascending dose study utilizing 7 separate cohorts of unique
      subjects (healthy normal volunteers). Each cohort was administered a different dose of
      AL-53817 Nasal Spray Solution in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      In Stage B, 2 different cohorts of unique, ragweed-sensitive subjects were administered the
      MTD for up to 5 days twice a day to determine the safety and efficacy of AL-53817 Nasal Spray
      Solution for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Subjects were required to meet minimum
      allergic rhinitis scores at two qualifying EEC visits to participate in the study. Subjects
      were continually housed in clinic during the 5-day treatment period.

    <description>Stage B: Nasal congestion was assessed by the subject before entering the EEC and at 14 timepoints over a 6-hour period after entering the EEC. Nasal congestion was scored on a scale from 0-3, where 0=none and 3=severe. Baseline EEC was conducted up to 21 days prior to the 5-day treatment period.</description>

    <description>Stage B: Nasal symptoms were assessed by the subject before entering the EEC and at 14 timepoints over a 6-hour period after entering the EEC. TNSS score (0-12) was a sum of scores for nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy nose, and runny nose scores, each individually assessed on a 0 to 3 scale, where 0=none and 3=severe. Baseline EEC was conducted up to 21 days prior to the 5-day treatment period.</description>

        <description>Stage B: Nasal symptoms were assessed by the subject before entering the EEC and at 14 timepoints over a 6-hour period after entering the EEC. TNSS score (0-12) was a sum of scores for nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy nose, and runny nose scores, each individually assessed on a 0 to 3 scale, where 0=none and 3=severe. Baseline EEC was conducted up to 21 days prior to the 5-day treatment period.</description>
