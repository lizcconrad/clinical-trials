      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus
      affects how tinnitus is perceived and if its use aids in the recovery of cognitive functions
      that may be affected by tinnitus. The investigators hope to better understand areas of the
      brain involved with or changed because of tinnitus. The investigators also hope to see if the
      Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus impacts changes in those areas of the brain the investigators
      believe may be affected by tinnitus.

      The objective of this pilot research project is to advance knowledge about the role of
      attention, control, and other cortical networks in the development and maintenance of
      bothersome tinnitus.

      The investigators have three specific aims. First, determine whether the Brain Fitness
      Program-Tinnitus affects the tinnitus percept and aids the recovery of cognitive functions
      apparently &quot;highjacked&quot; by the tinnitus. Brain Fitness Program-Tinnitus was developed to
      improve cognitive function by engaging the brain's neuroplasticity; the program is novel,
      non-invasive, and inexpensive. Second, establish specific default mode, attention system, and
      cognitive control network deficits in patients with bothersome tinnitus through the use of
      advanced neuroimaging techniques. Third, assess whether exposure to the Brain Fitness
      Program-Tinnitus impacts changes in the default mode, attention system, and cognitive control
      network deficits.

      The investigators will employ a randomized clinical trial design among a cohort of
      active-duty firefighters who experience bothersome tinnitus. A planned enrollment of 40
      firefighters with tinnitus in the clinical trial will have sufficient statistical power to
      detect a 17-point change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores. In addition, a previously
      developed fcMRI protocol will be used to study brain activity in regions associated with
      voluntary, involuntary, and executive control of attention in 60 firefighters (40
      firefighters enrolled in the clinical trial and 20 firefighters without tinnitus).
