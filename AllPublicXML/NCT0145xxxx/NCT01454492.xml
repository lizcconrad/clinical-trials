    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is a complex chronic inflammatory disease, it always presents with nasal
      obstruction, nasal itching, sneezing and runny nose. Whether in adults or children, rhinitis
      is a complex disease. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in Taiwan is about 24-29%. Taiwan
      is a developing country. It is a hot and humid country. In developing countries,
      industrialization, air pollution makes the constantly increasing number of patients with
      rhinitis. Penghu in 1994 for children aged 7 to 14 by the study found that among 7599 people,
      1766 people have allergic rhinitis, about 23.2%. Allergic rhinitis is a complex chronic
      disease. So, it become a diagnostic challenge, its prevalence always underestimated. The
      prevalence of rhinitis has increased in recent years. The phenomenon of underestimate is
      caused by variety of personal and environmental factors. Allergic rhinitis had increased
      direct and indirect social and economic burden.

      Geographic tongue is a benign tongue performance. Geographic tongue has been reported their
      relevance to allergy. Geographic tongue is a chronic tongue situation. The causes of
      geographic tongue still remains unknown. Allergic rhinitis is a diagnostic challenge to
      clinicians. The investigators hope that geographic tongue could play a role in the diagnostic
      of allergic rhinitis. The prevalence of geographic tongue in the United States is about 1.8%,
      white Americans and Mexicans have a higher incidence rate. This study will investigate the
      relevance between allergic rhinitis and geographic tongue. The investigators will analyze the
      relevant gender, age, severity of inspection reports. The research results wound provide an
      important reference to the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
