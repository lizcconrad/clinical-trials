  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I study, to assess the safety of a novel malaria vaccine, AdCh63
      CS, simian adenovirus encoding Plasmodium falciparum liver stage antigen, Circumsporozoite
      protein. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults. They will be primed with various
      doses of AdCh63 CS administered intramuscularly. Some of the volunteers will receive a
      booster vaccination with MVA CS administered via intramuscular route. Safety data will be
      collected for each vaccination regimen. Secondary aim of this study will be to assess the
      immune responses generated by vaccination.

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding or intention to become pregnant during the study

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of

          -  Suspected or known injecting drug abuse in the 5 years preceding enrolment.

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis C virus (antibodies to HCV).

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal finding on biochemistry or haematology blood
             tests, urinalysis or clinical examination.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
