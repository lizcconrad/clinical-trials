  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disease among the Caucasian population with
      considerable morbidity and reduced life expectancy.

      Excessive oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells and persisting infections are
      considered the main mechanism of damage of respiratory epithelium in CF.Glutathione (GSH)
      represents the first-line defence of the lung against oxidative stress-induced cell injury;
      however, a depletion of its levels has been observed in the airways of patients affected by
      CF. In vitro studies have showed that CFTR protein plays a pivotal role in transmembrane
      glutathione transport. Therapeutic approaches with inhaled GSH could improve the reduced lung
      antioxidant capacity in order to counterbalance the oxidant stress linked to the chronic
      airway inflammation and bacterial infection.

      Primary objective of the study is to investigate whether a 12 months treatment with inhaled
      GSH can improve airway obstruction in CF patients. Secondary objectives include the effects
      of GSH therapy on exercise capacity, body mass index (BMI), respiratory symptoms, quality of
      life, frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, hospital admissions, and antibiotic
      administration. Moreover the study will evaluate the effect of GSH therapy on markers of
      oxidative stress in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and in serum, and on inflammatory markers
      on brushed nasal epithelial cells.

      150 eligible patients will be enrolled on the basis of inclusion criteria. Patients will be
      divided in two groups: 1) Group 1 age between 6 and 18 years; 2) Group 2 older than 18 years.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment or placebo arm.Patients randomized in the
      GSH arm will receive a dosage of 10 mg/kg bid over a 12 months period.

      Clinical visits will take place at the beginning (visit 0, enrolment visit) and after one
      month (visit 1), three months (visit 2), six months (visit 3) nine months (visit 4), and
      twelve months (visit 5, end of treatments).

      Follow-up clinical visits will take place one month (visit 6), three months (visit 7), six
      months (visit 8) after the end of treatments.

      At visit 0, all eligible patients will inhale GSH (10 mg/Kg) and a dynamic spirometry will be
      performed before, 10 and 60 minutes after inhalation. Patients showing a decrease in FEV1
      greater than 15% after GSH inhalation will be excluded from the study.

      At visit 0 and at each following visits (visit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) will be performed
      and evaluated:

        -  Physical examination, measurement of vital signs, body temperature,BMI,and Spirometry;

        -  6 minute walking test;

        -  MMRC dyspnoea scale;

        -  Chronic cough impact questionnaire;

        -  Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire;

        -  Number of pulmonary exacerbations;

        -  Number and duration of hospital admissions for pulmonary exacerbations;

        -  Number, duration and route of administration of antibiotics;

        -  Blood sampling for haematological and biochemical analysis;

        -  Brushing of nasal epithelial cell, exhaled breath condensate with evaluation of markers
           of oxidative stress (H2O2), and blood sample for the measurement of markers of oxidative
           stress in serum will be performed in a subgroup of patients at visits 0, 3, and 5.
