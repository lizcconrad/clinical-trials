  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of oral aCD3 Monoclonal antibody (MAb) alone in subjects with hepatitis C is
      justified on the basis of scientific and medical reasons. There are data in multiple animal
      models that aCD3-alone confers efficacy in models of inflammatory or autoimmune disease and
      induces regulatory T cells and immune-modulation as desired in clinical studies. These
      observations are reinforced by data in the Phase 1 clinical study showing that aCD3-alone
      induced the desired immune-modulation in terms of immunological markers for regulatory T
      cells and appropriate rises and declines in certain cytokine levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral aCD3 MAb will be administered at a dosage level of 0.2 or 1.0 or 5.0 mg per day for 30
      days. Up of 9 subjects will be treated at each dosage level, and up to 9 subjects will
      receive placebo buffered in normal saline that is used as diluents for the MAb. One 20mg
      tablet of Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) will be taken orally as part of the study drug
      cocktail in order to neutralize stomach pH for enhancing stability of the MAb. During the
      treatment period, subjects will ingest the study drug/s every day for 30 days, and will be
      followed for clinical and laboratory effects. Subjects will be followed up to Day 60 (30 days
      after termination of treatment)
