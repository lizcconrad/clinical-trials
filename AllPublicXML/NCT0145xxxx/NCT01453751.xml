  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal vascular fraction cells implantation via intravenous infusion.

      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed Type II Diabetes Mellitus.

             or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study.

          -  Active infectious disease. If patients have tested positive, they will be consulted as
             to patient eligibility based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  History of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer) in
