  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) with
      methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX-alone in patients with early-stage rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) who are naive to MTX and have with poor prognostic factors, using inhibition of
      radiographically confirmed joint damage progression over a one-year period as a primary
      endpoint. Following a year of treatment with CZP plus MTX treatment, CZP will be
      discontinued, and the subjects will be monitored for one more year (the follow-up period) to
      investigate the sustainability of efficacy of CZP during the MTX monotherapy for exploratory
      purposes.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographs/X-rays of hands and feet (posteroanterior views of both hands and dorsoplantar views of both feet) were independently assessed by two radiographic readers. The degree of joint damage was graded by assessing bone erosion in 44 joints and joint space narrowing (JSN) in 42 joints.
The bone erosion score is a summary of erosion severity in 32 joints of the hands and 12 joints in the feet. Each joint was scored, according to the surface area involved, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone). The score for erosion ranges from 0 to 160 in the hands and from 0 to 120 in the feet (the maximum erosion score for a joint in the foot is 10). The JSN score summarizes the severity of JSN in 30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet. JSN, including subluxation, was scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (complete loss of joint space, bony ankylosis, or luxation), with a maximum JSN score of 168. The mTSS ranges from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Remission Rate: Percentage of Participants Meeting the Disease Activity Score-28 Joint Count (DAS28) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) (DAS28[ESR]) Remission Criteria at Weeks 24 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28(ESR) measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count (TJC);
28 swollen joint count (SJC);
ESR;
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGADA).
To obtain the tender joint count and swollen joint count, 28 joints of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, and knee joints were examined.
DAS28(ESR) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible ESR. A participant was considered to be in remission if DAS28(ESR) &lt;2.6.

    <description>The ACR/EULAR SDAI remission rate measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count (TJC);
28 swollen joint count (SJC);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGADA);
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGADA);
C-reactive protein (CRP)
To obtain the tender joint count and swollen joint count, 28 joints of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, and knee joints were examined.
A participant was considered to be in remission if SDAI ≤3.3.

28 tender joint count (TJC);
28 swollen joint count (SJC);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGADA);
C-reactive protein (CRP)
To obtain the tender joint count and swollen joint count, 28 joints of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, and knee joints were examined.
A participant was considered to be in remission if all the criteria for each variable was met:TJC (in 28 joints) ≤1; SJC (in 28 joints) ≤1; CRP ≤1 mg/dl; PtGADA ≤1.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 52</title>
        <description>Radiographs/X-rays of hands and feet (posteroanterior views of both hands and dorsoplantar views of both feet) were independently assessed by two radiographic readers. The degree of joint damage was graded by assessing bone erosion in 44 joints and joint space narrowing (JSN) in 42 joints.
The bone erosion score is a summary of erosion severity in 32 joints of the hands and 12 joints in the feet. Each joint was scored, according to the surface area involved, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone). The score for erosion ranges from 0 to 160 in the hands and from 0 to 120 in the feet (the maximum erosion score for a joint in the foot is 10). The JSN score summarizes the severity of JSN in 30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet. JSN, including subluxation, was scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (complete loss of joint space, bony ankylosis, or luxation), with a maximum JSN score of 168. The mTSS ranges from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst).</description>
