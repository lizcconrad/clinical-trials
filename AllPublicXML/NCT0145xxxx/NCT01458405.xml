    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients that experience active myocarditis possibly attributable to treatment accompanied by the presence of circulating antibodies specific to the CAP-1002 CDC donor, death due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, sudden unexpected death, or a major adverse cardiac event (MACE).
The primary efficacy endpoint is relative percentage improvement in infarct size assessed by MRI for the CAP-1002 group compared to the placebo group at 12 months post-infusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. History of MI (STEMI or NSTEMI) within the prior 12 months due to a coronary artery
             event and evidenced by at least two of the following: typical ischemic symptoms,
             serial ST-T changes (new ST elevation or new left bundle block) and/or elevated
             troponin or CK-MB &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal. Also at least one of the
             following: development of pathological Q wave ECG changes, imaging evidence of new
             loss of viable myocardium, or new regional wall motion abnormalities.

          2. History of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with stent placement resulting in
             TIMI flow = 3, in the coronary artery supplying the infarcted, dysfunctional territory
             and through which the treatment will be infused.

          3. At least one assessment of left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) ≤0.45 as
             determined by any one of the standard modalities (echocardiography, ventriculography,
             nuclear imaging, CT and/or MRI) prior to or during the screening period.

               -  For subjects that fulfill the criteria of Recent MI (i.e., within 90 days of MI)
                  at time of screening visit: assessment must be post-reperfusion after index MI
                  and the most recent test prior to or during the screening period.

               -  For subjects that fulfill the criteria of Chronic MI (i.e., greater than 90 days
                  from MI) at the time of screening visit: assessment must be at least 21 days
                  post-reperfusion after index MI and the most recent test prior to or during the
                  screening period.

             Note: subjects may screen as a Recent MI but be randomized into the Chronic MI strata
             if the infusion date is &gt; 90 days post-MI.

          4. Left ventricular infarct size of ≥ 15% of left ventricular mass in the qualifying
             infarct-related region to be infused as determined by centrally read screening MRI,
             with associated thinning and/or hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis, with no large
             aneurysmal area in the infarcted regions.

          5. No further revascularization clinically indicated at the time the subject is assessed
             for participation in the clinical trial.

          6. Ability to provide informed consent and follow-up with protocol procedures.

          7. Age ≥ 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, and a patent graft
             (arterial or saphenous vein graft) attached to the coronary artery to be infused.

          2. Diagnosed or suspected myocarditis.

          3. History of cardiac tumor, or cardiac tumor demonstrated on screening MRI.

          4. History of acute coronary syndrome in the 4 weeks prior to study infusion.

          5. History of previous stem cell therapy.

          6. History of radiation treatment to the central or left side of thorax.

          7. Current or history (within the previous 5 years) of systematic auto-immune or
             connective tissue disease including, but not limited to, giant cell myocarditis,
             cardiac or systemic sarcoidosis, Dressler's syndrome, chronic recurrent or persistent
             pericarditis.

          8. History of or current treatment with immunosuppressive , anti-inflammatory, or other
             agents to treat manifestations of systemic immunologic reactions, including chronic
             systemic corticosteroids, biologic agents targeting the immune system, anti-tumor and
             anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-VEGF, or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

          9. Prior ICD and/or pacemaker placement where study imaging site has not been trained and
             certified specifically for this protocol to conduct cardiac MRI in subjects with ICD
             and/or pacemaker placement.
