  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the absorption and distribution of a fixed-dose
      Combination (FDC) tablet of canagliflozin and metformin IR is affected when taken with food
      by healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteers and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the oral bioavailability (ie, absorption and distribution
      within the body) and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of a single dose of 1 fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) tablet of canagliflozin and metformin IR (abbreviated as 1 CANA/MET IR FDC
      tablet) when taken by healthy volunteers without food (in a fasting state) or with food (in a
      fed state). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance)
      assigned to receive Treatment A (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet taken by healthy volunteers in a
      fasting state) followed approximately 14 days later by Treatment B (1 CANA/MET IR FDC tablet
      taken by healthy volunteers in a fed state) or Treatment B followed approximately 14 days
      later by Treatment A.
