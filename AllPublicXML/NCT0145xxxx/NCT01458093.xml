  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal cancer screening era a huge burden of medical resources has been applied to
      surveillance. Although the adherence to post-polipectomy recommendations is a advocated as a
      mainstay for quality assurance colonoscopy programs, prospective data on appropriateness of
      surveillance are lacking.

      The aim of present study was to evaluate the percentage of subjects in which timing of
      surveillance colonoscopy in practice agrees with that recommended by guidelines and to
      identify factors associated to the appropriateness of surveillance.

    <description>Time interval between index and surveillance colonoscopies for patients undergoing post-polypectomy surveillance was calculated and compared to that suggested by the guidelines according to endoscopic findings at previous examination. For each patiens, surveillance time interval was regarded as correct if coherent with the recommended interval +/- 6 months, thus allowing to calculate the proportion of correct prescriptions</description>
