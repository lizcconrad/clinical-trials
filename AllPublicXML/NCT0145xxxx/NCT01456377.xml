      60 patients are being randomized, plank by randomization, the patient and the examiner will
      be blinded. Will be placed in opaque brown envelopes in order to maintain the secrecy of
      allocation.

      Included patients aged between 50 and 75 years of both sexes participate in the work to
      accept and sign the Informed Consent The patient will be screened in advance after the
      acceptance of it will be an anthropometric assessment, with assessment of height, weight and
      presence of associated comorbidities.

      After clinical evaluation they headed for the initial evaluation, after this evaluation,
      patients are randomized and and delivered to the patient the medication with corticosteroids
      or placebo for an unrelated medical research. It is also given a bottle of paracetamol 750 mg
      and a sheet dated, in which the patient is instructed to register the day this sheet and
      number of capsules taken, which is also an evaluation factor.
