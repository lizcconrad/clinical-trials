    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of transfusion of red blood cells in
      treating postoperative dizziness in patients with moderate postoperative anemia after total
      hip arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty is associated with bleeding and postoperative anemia. However, the optimal
      strategy for transfusing red blood cells (RBC) remains to be elucidated. Postoperative anemia
      may cause dizziness and fatigue which delays early mobilization after surgery and may trigger
      the transfusion of one or more RBC units. However, it is not known whether the administration
      of 1-2 units of RBC to patients suffering from moderate postoperative anemia (HB 7.5 - 10
      g/dl) will improve postoperative dizziness.

      Thus, this randomized controlled study aims to evaluate whether the administration of 1-2 RBC
      units on the first postoperative day improves postoperative dizziness in patients undergoing
      total hip arthroplasty.

    <description>Dizziness scale (0-3) evaluated by the study nurse. The scale is evaluated upon information on the 1) severeness of dizziness AND 2) it´s consequenses for early mobilization after surgery.
0 - No dizziness.
- Light dizziness / No consequences for mobilization
- Moderate dizziness / Only shorter periods of mobilization possible
