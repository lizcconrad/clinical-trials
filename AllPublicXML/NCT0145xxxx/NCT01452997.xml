    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two separate antiinflammatory products for the
      relief of symptoms through suppression of the immunological and inflammatory response
      following a mosquito bite. The investigators have selected ibuprofen gel as a NSAI
      formulation and 0.05% Clobetasone butyrate as a steroid cream with their appropriate physical
      matched placebo products.
