  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced heterogeneous emphysema experience improvement in clinical outcomes in
      the same way following either implantation of endobronchial valves or intrabronchial valves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient enrollment and data acquisition is to be carried out on a prospective basis. It is
      planned to enroll a total of 50 patients with advanced heterogeneous emphysema. After
      decision to undertake endoscopic lung volume reduction by valve implantation patients will be
      randomised to two treatment arms. 25 patients receive unilateral IBV treatment or unilateral
      EBV treatment in each case. All patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in
      Heidelberg.

    <description>In severe cases of COPD even optimum treatment involving bronchodilatation with drugs, physical training and possibly oxygen therapy is unable to influence exercise capacity and the perception of dyspnoea to a sufficient extent. Given the assumption that the elastic recoil of the small airways can be improved by a reduction in lung volume and pulmonary function overall by more ergonomic breathing mechanics and diaphragm function, various endoscopic procedures for lung volume reduction are available. The most advanced technique is the implantation of valves. The one-way mechanism of these valves allows air to be expelled during exspiration without any influx of air during inspiration.</description>
