  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is frequently characterized by patterns of inflexible, maladaptive, and ruminative
      thinking styles; these patterns themselves are thought to result from a combination of
      decreased attentional control, decreased executive functioning, and increased negative
      affect. Specifically, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been hypothesized to play a
      central role in emotion regulation by recruiting resources necessary for executive control.
      Recent advances have been made in neurobehavioral training strategies as interventions for
      emotional disorders such as depression. Cognitive control training (CCT) uses computer-based
      exercises to recruit and activate prefrontal neural networks via repeated behavioral
      exercises, with the aim of strengthening cognitive and emotional functions. A previous study
      found that severely depressed participants who received CCT exhibited reduced negative affect
      and rumination as well as improved focus and concentration. The present study aimed to extend
      this line of research by employing a more stringent control group and testing the efficacy of
      three sessions of CCT over a two-week period in a community population with depressed mood.
      Forty-eight participants with high BDI-II scores were randomized to CCT or a comparison
      condition (Peripheral Vision Training; PVT). The investigators hypothesized that relative to
      a control condition (PVT), CCT would be associated with less self-reported negative mood and
      emotional reactivity.

    <description>During this task participants viewed a circular array of 15 discs and were asked to move their attention, but not their eyes, clockwise around the array while auditory tones were presented. Following the presentation of a distinct target tone, the discs changed color and participants reported the color of the disc by pressing a designated button on the keyboard. This task was developed to be a non-active control condition, targeting visual and occipital areas of the brain, and therefore allows us to discriminate between the effects of completing a computer-based task from interventions that specifically target the PFC.</description>
