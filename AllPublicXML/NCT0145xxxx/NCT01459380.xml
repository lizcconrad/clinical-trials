      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given
      together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in
      treating patients with ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer
      that has returned after previous treatment. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride and carboplatin, may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth by
      blocking the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth
      of tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving
      veliparib together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, carboplatin, and
      bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated doses (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of two
      different regimens of ABT-888 (veliparib) when administered with carboplatin and PLD (Doxil,
      Lipodox) (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) in recurrent, platinum-sensitive
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. To assess the toxicity of these regimens using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program
      (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      version 4.0.

      III. To examine the tolerability of these treatment regimens in combination with bevacizumab
      at the MTD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate (complete and partial) in patients with measurable
      disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the relationships between platinum-free interval, activity of ABT-888
      (objective response rate) and measures of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2)
      status including mutations, alterations, rearrangements, promoter methylation, and
      immunohistochemical expression).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, and
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-28, and pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride and carboplatin as in Regimen I.

      BEVACIZUMAB: Once the MTD for veliparib has been determined, patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly for 1 year.

          -  Patients with seizures or a history of seizures are ineligible

          -  Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of central nervous system
             (CNS) disease, including primary brain tumor, any CNS metastases, or history of
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or
             subarachnoid hemorrhage within six months of the first date of treatment on this
             study; patients with CNS metastases must be stable for &gt; 3 months after treatment and
             off steroid treatment prior to study enrollment

          -  Patients who cannot swallow pills

          -  ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS BEING TREATED ON BEVACIZUMAB COHORT:

             composition to bevacizumab

             24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be &lt; 1000 mg for patient
             enrollment

             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to day 1

          -  Known CNS disease except for treated brain metastases; treated brain metastases are
             defined as having no ongoing requirement for steroids and no evidence of progression
             or hemorrhage after treatment for at least 3 months, as ascertained by clinical
             examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography
             [CT]); (stable dose of anticonvulsants are allowed); treatment for brain metastases
             may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or
             equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician; patients
             with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed
             within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease are excluded

               -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (HTN) (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 160

                  medication)

               -  History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months

               -  Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection)

               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy
