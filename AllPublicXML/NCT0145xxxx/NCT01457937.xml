    <textblock>
      The cohort of post-menopausal women represents a group of very-difficult-to-treat patients in
      whom a more powerful approach is required in order to improve the disappointing response
      rate. Thus the addition, in patients with previous failure to PEG/RBV treatment or in naïve
      patients, of a powerful drug like Boceprevir could greatly improve SVR rate as suggested by
      the results of SPRINT_2 trial in whom Boceprevir addition determined a 30% improvement in SVR
      rate in difficult gt 1 patients of African descent versus standard PEG IFN/Ribavirin therapy
      or by those of RESPOND-2 that showed the same percent improvement of RGT-retreatment with
      Boc/P/R of previous failure of standard therapy.

      Goal of the study is to verify whether the addition of a 24-week treatment with boceprevir to
      standard antiviral therapy with Peg IFN and ribavirin will increase the rate of SVR in
      patients difficult to treat, such as HCV-positive women in post-menopausal women with
      genotype 1, not only those who have never been treated, but also in those who have not
      responded to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (Riba).

      2.2.1 Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the addition of a 24-week treatment with boceprevir
      to standard antiviral therapy with Peg IFN and ribavirin will increase the rate of sustained
      virological response (SVR) in patients difficult to treat, such as HCV-positive women in
      post-menopausal women with genotype 1, not only those who have never been treated, but also
      in those who have not responded to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (Riba)
      Objectives Retreatment Primary objective Verify whether the sustained virological response
      (SVR defined as HCV RNA undetectable at 24 weeks of follow-up) in menopausal women with HCV
      CAH genotype 1 who have not achieved a sustained virological response with a previous
      treatment with PEG IFN/ribavirin may increase by at least 20% after treatment with PEG IFN
      alfa 2b and boceprevir (1.5 mcg / kg QW) + Ribavirin (800-1400 mg / day) The primary efficacy
      endpoint, achieving SVR, will be evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each
      treatment arm.

      Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early
      virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.

      Naïve patients

      Primary objective Verify whether SVR, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks of
      follow-up may increase by at least 25% after treatment with PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin
      and boceprevir vs. PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin alone, in postmenopausal women with CHC
      genotype 1 not previously treated The primary efficacy endpoint, achieving SVR, will be
      evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each treatment arm.

      Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early
      virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.
