  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a condition that is growing in prevalence and which harms not only the afflicted
      individual but also adversely affects the health of their family and other informal
      caregivers. New methods for delivering comprehensive assistance to persons with dementia and
      their caregivers are known to be effective and can delay nursing home placement, but this
      study will discover 1) whether more face-to-face involvement rather than telephone delivery
      of this assistance will work better among poor patients in Los Angeles, and 2) if one method
      is better than the other, what are the differences in costs between them. These data will
      enable administrators in public health care settings around the US and non-profit foundations
      addressing dementia patient and caregiver needs to decide what method provides the best value
      and the best outcome relative to its cost.

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (BI) is a widely used validated measure to assess stressors experienced by caregivers of persons with dementia. Originally a 29-item instrument, the 22-item modified version is easily completed by telephone. This instrument covers five constructs of burden: health, psychological well-being, finances, social life, and relationship with impaired person and an overall summary score of caregiver burden. Higher Zarit scores indicate greater caregiver burden. The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 110.</description>

    <measure>Change in Care Recipient Memory and Problem Behaviors at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) was developed by Teri and colleagues. The RMBPC instrument assess 24 care receiver problems in the areas of behavior, memory, and depression and whether each behavior had occurred in the prior week. Higher RMBPC scores mean worse memory/behavior problems. The minimum possible score for number of problems is zero, and the maximum score for number of problems is 24.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Depression at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - Nine (PHQ-9) is a 9-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 is the depression module of the PRIME- MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. It covers each of the 9 DSM-IV depression criteria scoring them as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Quality of Life at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver-Targeted Quality of Life (CG-QOL) measure covers 10 dimensions of QOL relevant to caregivers of persons with dementia, incorporates non-health related issues as well as positive aspects of caregiving, and has demonstrated feasibility as a phone-based instrument in both English and Spanish. Eighty items are distributed across 10 scales: assistance with ADLs, assistance with IADLs, personal time, role limitation due to caregiving, family involvement, demands of caregiving, worry, caregiver feelings, spirituality and faith, benefits of caregiving.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Care Recipient Quality of Life at 6 and 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will evaluate patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by proxy (caregiver) assessment using the 15-item Health Utilities Index (HUI2), a generic health state classification system with preference-based utility weights derived from the general population. The HUI is one of the more widely used utility measures and has been used in previous studies of elderly with dementia and their caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Change in Process Measures of Dementia Care Quality at 6 and 12 Months</measure>

Collaboration between the caregiver and the care manager results in problem prioritization and subsequent counseling, education, referrals as needed, and proactive follow-up to achieve resolution of these problems.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adult caregivers (CG) lived with dementia care recipient (CR) or were the main support for &gt;6 months. CRs had to live in the community (no nursing home). Admin data (ICD-9 codes) yielded eligible CRs from Olive View Med Center+local clinics. CRs got recruitment mailings to give to CG. CG were also recruited at CR's memory clinic+community outreach</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A research assistant (RA) got informed consent either in-person at clinic or by phone for outreach/admin data sources. Contact info was sent to the survey group who completed enrollment and a baseline survey; then participants were randomized by the RA. Between the survey and randomization, 3 CGs were found ineligible and 4 duplicates were found.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Caregiver Burden at 6 and 12 Months</title>
        <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (BI) is a widely used validated measure to assess stressors experienced by caregivers of persons with dementia. Originally a 29-item instrument, the 22-item modified version is easily completed by telephone. This instrument covers five constructs of burden: health, psychological well-being, finances, social life, and relationship with impaired person and an overall summary score of caregiver burden. Higher Zarit scores indicate greater caregiver burden. The minimum possible score is 0, and the maximum possible score is 110.</description>

            <description>The dementia care management protocol will be delivered via face-to-face interactions in participants' homes or in mutually convenient locations between a trained care manager and the care recipient/informal family caregiver dyad, supplemented by telephone.
Dementia care management: Care management is initiated via a structured assessment, to identify prevalent caregiving problems: unmet need for assistance, lack of social support, educational needs, difficulty with managing behavioral issues and safety concerns, need for respite, establishing advance care planning, depression of the person with dementia as well as the caregiver, management of other chronic medical issues, and need for diagnostic information and assistance with acute medical issues. Collaboration between the caregiver and the care manager results in problem prioritization and subsequent counseling, education, referrals as needed, and proactive follow-up to achieve resolution of these problems.</description>

        <description>The Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) was developed by Teri and colleagues. The RMBPC instrument assess 24 care receiver problems in the areas of behavior, memory, and depression and whether each behavior had occurred in the prior week. Higher RMBPC scores mean worse memory/behavior problems. The minimum possible score for number of problems is zero, and the maximum score for number of problems is 24.</description>

Dementia care management: Care management is initiated via a structured assessment, to identify prevalent caregiving problems: unmet need for assistance, lack of social support, educational needs, difficulty with managing behavioral issues and safety concerns, need for respite, establishing advance care planning, depression of the person with dementia as well as the caregiver, management of other chronic medical issues, and need for diagnostic information and assistance with acute medical issues. Collaboration between the caregiver and the care manager results in problem prioritization and subsequent counseling, education, referrals as needed, and proactive follow-up to achieve resolution of these problems.</description>
