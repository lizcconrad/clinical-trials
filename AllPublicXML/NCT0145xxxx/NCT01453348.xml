    <time_frame>Day 57 (previously unprimed subjects) day 29 (previously primed subjects) postvaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment was made to demonstrate the non-inferiority of hepatitis A/B vaccine with MenACWY-CRM as compared to hepatitis A/B vaccine without MenACWY-CRM, as measured by geometric mean concentrations on day 57 in previously unvaccinated subjects or on day 29 after a booster dose in previously vaccinated subjects.</description>

    <measure>Percentages of Subjects With antiHAV and antiHBsAg Antibodies Concentrations Above Seroprotection Level 28 Days After Primary or Booster Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days post primary or booster vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed as the percentages of subjects with anti-HAV concentration ≥20 mIU/mL and anti- HBsAg antibody concentration ≥10 mIU/mL, 28 days after primary or booster vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Percentages of Subjects With Seroresponse Against N Meningitidis A, C, W and Y Serogroups at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days postvaccination (day 29).</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed as the seroresponse rates for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y elicited by MenACWY-CRM on day 29 when given concomitantly with combined hepatitis A/B vaccine or given alone.
For a subject with a baseline hSBA titer &lt; 1:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8; for a subject with a baseline hSBA titer ≥ 1:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer of at least 4 times the baseline.</description>

    <measure>hSBA GMTs Assay Titers Against N Meningitidis A, C, W and Y Serogroups at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days post vaccination (day 29).</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibodies to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y on day 29 when given concomitantly with combined hepatitis A/B vaccine or given alone.</description>

    <measure>Percentages of Subjects With Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 57.</time_frame>

          <title>Percentages of Subjects With Seroresponse Against N Meningitidis A, C, W and Y Serogroups at Day 29</title>
          <description>Immunogenicity was assessed as the seroresponse rates for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y elicited by MenACWY-CRM on day 29 when given concomitantly with combined hepatitis A/B vaccine or given alone.
For a subject with a baseline hSBA titer &lt; 1:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer ≥1:8; for a subject with a baseline hSBA titer ≥ 1:4, seroresponse is defined as a postvaccination hSBA titer of at least 4 times the baseline.</description>
          <population>Analysis was done on modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population- subjects who provided evaluable serum samples whose assay results are available for at least one antigen on visit day 1 and a post baseline visit.</population>

      <desc>Safety was assessed in terms of percentages of all Serious AEs collected from the time the subject signed the informed consent form until he/she stopped study participation.One subject randomized to receive MenACWY-CRM, received HepA/B+MenACWY-CRM vaccine, instead. The safety set included 85 subjects for HepA/B+MenACWY group and 83 for MenACWY.</desc>
