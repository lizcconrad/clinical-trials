      In this phase I/II trial, immunostimulatory gene therapy (AdCD40L) will be investigated. In
      Part 1 patients with melanoma will receive AdCD40L as mono therapy. In Part 2A, patients with
      melanoma and patients with other solid tumors will receive AdCD40L in combination with low
      dose cyclophosphamide. In Part 2B, patients with melanoma will receive AdCD40L in combination
      with one local radiotherapy and cyclophosphamide.

    <textblock>
      In this phase I/II trial, immunostimulatory gene therapy (AdCD40L) will be investigated. In
      Part 1 patients with melanoma (n=6) will receive AdCD40L as mono therapy. In Part 2A,
      patients with melanoma (n=9) and patients with other solid tumors (n=6) will receive AdCD40L
      in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide. In Part 2B, patients with melanoma will
      receive AdCD40L in combination with one local radiotherapy and cyclophosphamide. AdCD40L is
      given by weekly injections of 2.5x10e11 VP, 4x; total dose 1x10e12 VP. A maximum of 30
      patients will be included in this trial.

      AdCD40L is an adenoviral nonreplicating vector carrying the human CD40L gene. AdCD40L infects
      tumor cells upon intratumoral injection and deliver the CD40L gene into the cells whereupon
      the virus is destroyed. CD40L is then expressed as a membrane-bound protein and interacts
      with the CD40 receptor expressed by for example dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor area. DCs
      mature upon CD40/CD40L interactions and activates tumor-specific T cell responses.

If no effect in less than 2 out of 6 melanoma patients, the following 9 melanoma patients and 6 patients with other solid tumors will receive preconditioning therapy 1-2 days prior to first and last treatment with 300mg/m2 cyclophosphamid. The next 9 melanoma patients will receive one local radiotherapy.</description>
