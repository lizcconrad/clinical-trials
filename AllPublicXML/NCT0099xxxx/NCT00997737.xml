      The objective of the present study is to evaluate diaphragm activity during three breathing
      exercises: diaphragmatic breathing (DB), flow-oriented (Triflo II)incentive spirometry and
      volume-oriented (Voldyne) incentive spirometry.

      Seventeen healthy subjects will be studied (8 man and 9 woman).

      Right diaphragmatic mobility will be evaluated by determining the craniocaudal displacement
      of the left branch of the portal vein using a B-mode ultrasound device (Logic 500, Pro
      Series®; General ElectricMedical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The ultrasound technician will
      use a 3.5 MHz convex transducer positioned in the right subcostal region, with the incidence
      angle perpendicular to the craniocaudal axis, in the direction of the inferior vena cava.
      Next, an intraparenchymal portal branch will be identified in the field of vision and its
      position will be traced with the curser during the forced inspiration and expiration. The
      craniocaudal displacement of these points will be considered to be the amount of right
      diaphragmatic mobility.

    <description>Two modalities of respiratory exercises based on deep and slow inspirations will be used: DB and IS. During DB, the researcher will place one hand slightly below the lower ribs in the abdominal region of the subject and the subject will be instructed to perform inspirations up to the maximum level of volume avoiding rib cage displacement; this recommendation will also be valid for exercises using incentive spirometers. IS will be executed using two different devices: Triflo II and Voldyne.</description>
