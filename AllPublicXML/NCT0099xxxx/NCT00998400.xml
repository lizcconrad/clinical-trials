  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional states of depression in association with ischemic heart diseases, such as
      myocardial infarction or unstable angina, are risk factors for subsequent cardiac events and
      mortality. However, the only psychological intervention trial attempting to reduce cardiac
      risk in depressed ACS patients showed that changes in depression did not translate into
      improved survival. Such intervention did not address issues such as lifestyle modification
      and improvement in psychological well-being, which were found to affect individual
      vulnerability to medical disease. Our research group has developed a well-being enhancing
      psychotherapeutic strategy, well-being therapy (WBT), which has been validated in a number of
      clinical trials. The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral
      treatment (CBT) together with lifestyle modification and WBT in reducing cardiac risk in
      depressed and/or demoralized ACS patients compared to a standard clinical procedure of
      patients' management, the clinical management (CM). The same protocol will be carried out in
      two centres (Bologna and Torino). 100 patients after a first episode of myocardial infarction
      or unstable angina, meeting DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders and DCPR criteria for
      demoralization will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 1) CBT supplemented by
      lifestyle modification and WBT; 2) CM. In both groups, treatment will consist of twelve,
      45-minute sessions once a week. A two-year follow-up will be performed. It is expected that
      psychological treatment may significantly decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality at
      follow-up compared to clinical management. The findings may entail considerable preventive
      implications and possible large reductions in health costs.

      The same protocol will be carried out in the two participating centres (Maggiore Hospital in
      Bologna and San Giovanni Battista Hospital in Torino).

      Participants will be patients recovering from a first episode of acute myocardial infarction
      or unstable angina. Myocardial infarction will be documented by cardiac symptoms (presence of
      acute chest, epigastric, neck, jaw, or arm pain or discomfort or pressure without apparent
      non- cardiac source) and signs (acute congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock in the
      absence of non-CHD causes) associated with ECG findings (characteristic evolutionary ST-T
      changes or new Q waves) and/or cardiac biomarkers (blood measures of myocardial necrosis,
      specifically CK, CK-MB, CK-MBm, or troponin, cTn). Instable angina will be documented by
      cardiac symptoms (chest pain lasting less than 20 minutes) with likely ECG findings
      (ST-segment depression and abnormal T-wave) in absence of myocardial necrosis biomarkers.

      Medically eligible patients involved in the study have to meet, when screened 30 days after
      their index event, the inclusion criteria

    <description>CBT involves several essential features: identifying and correcting inaccurate thoughts associated with depressed feelings (cognitive restructuring); helping patients to engage more often in enjoyable activities (behavioral activation); enhancing problem-solving skills; providing instruction and guidance in specific strategies for solving problems. The techniques included in WBT may be used in overcoming impairments in environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth, autonomy, self-acceptance and positive relations with others. CM will consist of reviewing the patients' clinical status, and providing the patient with support and advice if necessary.</description>
