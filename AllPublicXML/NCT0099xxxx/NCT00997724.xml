      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of assisted-VATS (video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery) sleeve lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer for non-small cell
      lung cancer. Success is defined as assisted-VATS sleeve lobectomy without conversion. If
      success rate over 90%, assisted-VATS sleeve lobectomy is considered as feasible procedures
      for non-small cell lung cancer.

      Sleeve lobectomy is removal of a portion of a main stem bronchus in continuity with the
      adjacent lobe or bilobe followed by end-to-end bronchial anastomosis. The first reported
      bronchial sleeve resection was performed in 1947 at the Brompton Hospital in London, England,
      by Sir Clement Price Thomas. Whether sleeve resection is radical enough and indicated for
      patients who could tolerate pneumonectomy continues to be debated, although many recent
      reports have suggested that sleeve resection can achieve adequate curability rates. However,
      sleeve lobectomy has a definite role in the surgical management of lung cancer for patients
      whose pulmonary reserve is considered inadequate to permit pneumonectomy, and should be used
      anytime it is possible to achieve a margin-negative (R0) resection.

      Although video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is regarded as a minimally invasive procedure
      with good long-term survival results, many surgeons think that VATS is too complex and has
      too many technical limitations to be applied to bronchoplasty. Therefore, there are few
      reports in the literature of VATS bronchoplasty for lung cancer. The purpose of this study is
      to examine the feasibility of assisted-VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) sleeve
      lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer for non-small cell lung cancer. Success is defined
      as assisted-VATS sleeve lobectomy without conversion. If success rate over 90%, assisted-VATS
      sleeve lobectomy is considered as feasible procedures for non-small cell lung cancer.

    <description>In brief, general anesthesia with selective lung ventilation was performed with the use of a double-lumen endotracheal tube. When postoperative mechanical ventilation was necessary, a standard endotracheal tube was substituted for the double-lumen tube. Patients were placed in the lateral decubitus position. Two thoracoports were placed in the sixth or seventh intercostal space (ICS) on the anterior axillary line and in the seventh or eighth ICS on the posterior axillary line; an anterolateral minithoracotomy (7 cm) was made in the fourth ICS for an upper lobectomy or in the fifth ICS for a middle or lower lobectomy.</description>
