      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of indigo naturalis oil extract
      in treating nail psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nail psoriasis treatment is notoriously difficult. While indigo naturalis has been
      demonstrated safe and effective in treating skin psoriasis, its effect on nail psoriasis
      remains unverified.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Single-Hand Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)and in the Modified Target NAPSI for the Single Most Severely Affected Nail of Each Hand at Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The nail is divided by imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each nail is given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of any of the features of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. The NAPSI score evaluates presence of signs in the nail bed (of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, nail bed discoloration, and subungual hyperkeratosis) and on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula and nail plate crumbling) in all 10 fingernails, providing a minimal score of 0 and a maximum of 80. This study is an intra-patient side-to-side comparison, it measures nail disease on a single hand. All 5 fingers in each group were scored providing a maximum score of 40 and a minimal of 0. The modified target NAPSI score for the target nail scores severity of nail matrix and nail-bed psoriasis from 0 (no sign) to 3 (severe involvement) in each nail quadrant, providing a maximum score of 96 and a minimal of 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Single-Hand Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)and in the Modified Target NAPSI for the Single Most Severely Affected Nail of Each Hand at Week 24.</title>
        <description>The nail is divided by imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each nail is given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of any of the features of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. The NAPSI score evaluates presence of signs in the nail bed (of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, nail bed discoloration, and subungual hyperkeratosis) and on the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula and nail plate crumbling) in all 10 fingernails, providing a minimal score of 0 and a maximum of 80. This study is an intra-patient side-to-side comparison, it measures nail disease on a single hand. All 5 fingers in each group were scored providing a maximum score of 40 and a minimal of 0. The modified target NAPSI score for the target nail scores severity of nail matrix and nail-bed psoriasis from 0 (no sign) to 3 (severe involvement) in each nail quadrant, providing a maximum score of 96 and a minimal of 0.</description>

          <description>Experimental group: randomized to receive Indigo Naturalis Oil Extract first; Control group: randomized to receive Olive Oil first.
In all participants, indigo naturalis oil extract was applied to the fingernails of one bilateral hand (experimental group) and olive oil was applied to the fingernails of the contralateral hand (control group) twice daily for 12 weeks. The randomization process was conducted by block randomization method with 1:1 ratio. After 12 weeks, olive oil treatment was discontinued and indigo naturalis oil extract was applied to both hands twice daily for another 12 weeks.</description>
