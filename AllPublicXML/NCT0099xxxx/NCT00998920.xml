  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating multiple
      doses of S-equol administered twice daily (BID) for 14 days to healthy male and female
      subjects and to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of S-equol.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of doses escalated by
      cohort. Volunteers will be randomized to receive active study drug or placebo twice daily
      (BID) for 14 days. This study will be staggered in timing with the single rising dose study
      (Protocol AUS-CT01) being conducted concurrently, such that the lowest dose cohort of this
      multiple rising dose study may begin after evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetic data from
      the first 8 subjects randomized to the 10 mg dose cohort of the single rising dose study and
      safety data from the 8 Subjects randomized in the 20 mg dose cohort of that study.
