      The purpose of this research is to find the optimal patterns of functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) of muscles in the lower legs that will improve walking ability in those who
      have had a stroke and at the same time ensure walking stability. FES involves applying small
      electric currents to the nerves, which cause the muscles to contract.

      FES research projects vary from simple investigations of the therapeutic effects of exercise
      on muscle function and skin health, to more complex studies of functional movements such as
      standing or walking.

      The study aims to find the optimal patterns of functional electrical stimulation (FES) of
      muscles in the lower legs that will improve walking ability in those who have had a stroke
      and at the same time ensure walking stability will be achieved through an analytical approach
      comprised of computational models and gait simulations to objectively determine
      patient-specific patterns of muscle activation. The investigators will develop a computer
      simulation of the dynamics of hemiplegic gait characterized by unilateral plantarflexor
      weakness. Then, the investigators will relate the results of the computer model results to
      real data collected from subjects with known plantarflexor weakness to provide a theoretical
      basis for improving gait efficiency and stability with FES.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This study includes stroke survivors greater than 18 years of age, &gt;180 days from first
        clinical hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic stroke with:

          -  Unilateral hemiparesis with sufficient endurance and motor ability to ambulate &gt;30
             feet continuously without an AFO requiring no more than 25% physical help

          -  Berg Balance Scale score &gt;23 without assistive devices

          -  Standing ankle dorsiflexion strength of &lt;4/5

          -  Foot-drop during ambulation with gait instability or inefficient gait defined as
             supervision need

          -  Possible use of physical assistance or assistive device (cane, walker)

          -  Evidence of foot-drop as seen by &quot;dragging&quot; or &quot;catching&quot; of affected toes during limb
             swing or circumducting affected limb

          -  Vaulting of the unaffected limb or hiking the affected hip to clear toes.

          -  Intact and electrically ex-citable lower motor neurons

          -  Ankle dorsiflexion to at least neutral while standing with electrical stimulation of
             common peroneal and tibial nerves without painful hypersensitivity to stimulation

          -  Adequate social support and stability

          -  Medically stable with intact skin in affected lower limb

          -  Willingness to comply during research procedures

          -  No systemic co-morbidities

          -  No history of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias i.e. ventricular tachycardia,
             supraventricular tachycardia and rapid ventricular response atrial fibrillation with
             hemodynamic instability

          -  No psychological problems or chemical dependency

          -  No acute medical complications such as depression or chronic anxiety requiring long
             term pharmacological therapy. Able-bodied controls must be of similar age, body mass
             and stature as those with hemiparesis and must be free of any medical and disabling
             orthopedic problems.

          -  Excessive edema of affected extremity

          -  Absent sensation in affected limb

          -  History of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia,
             supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid ventricular response, atrial fibrillation with
             hemodynamic instability

          -  Demand pacemakers or any implanted electronic systems
