      A prospective long-term follow up of peritoneal dialysis patients' outcome correlates with
      nutritional status and body composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wasting and malnutrition are common and serious complications in patients on peritoneal
      dialysis and are strongly associated with adverse outcomes. Techniques for assessing
      nutrition have limitations and, due to metabolic effects and confounding effects of altered
      hydration and other body composition abnormalities, these limitations are greater in the
      context of renal failure. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a promising method for the
      objective assessment and monitoring of body composition. Body composition techniques
      subdivide the body into compartments on the basis of differing physical properties. The
      different compartments reflect hydration, nutrition/wasting, body fat, and bone mineral
      content, which are all of great importance in patients on peritoneal dialysis. We will
      conduct a prospective long-term follow up of PD patients' outcome correlates with nutritional
      status and body compositions. The patients will receive BIA every three months, and other
      routine clinical data such as dialysis adequacy, peritoneal equilibration test and monthly
      biochemical data are collected to analyze. An additional blood sample 8 ml and 5 ml dialysate
      of overnight, 0 hour, 2 hour and 4 hour will be collected during annual PET for other
      inflammatory cytokines and nutritional markers such as adiponectin, leptin, ghrelin,
      prealbumin and transferrin. The follow up period will be as long as possible and the last
      recruited into this study is in the Aug 2014. These data will be used for the morbidity and
      mortality analysis to see if body compositions will be more useful and timely than the other
      nutritional parameters.
