      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prednisone in
      patients diagnosed with ocular myasthenia.

      The purpose of this study is to learn two things about prednisone in patients with ocular
      myasthenia. The first thing we aim to learn is whether or not prednisone is effective in
      improving the symptoms of double vision and drooping eyes that are experienced by patients
      with ocular myasthenia. The second thing we aim to learn is whether we can find a dose of
      prednisone that is well tolerated and safe. The overall goal is to find out whether a dose of
      prednisone that is safe and well tolerated is also effective in improving the symptoms of
      ocular myasthenia.

      After completing screening assessments to confirm eligibility, all participants will receive
      treatment with pyridostigmine. If a participant's symptoms do not resolve within the first
      month while being treated with pyridostigmine, they will be randomized to receive prednisone
      or placebo. The amount of study medication a participant receives will depend on how their
      symptoms respond to the medication and if they experience any side effects.

      After four months, participants that continue to have symptoms of ocular myasthenia and do
      not have side effects will receive open label high dose prednisone. Participants that no
      longer have symptoms will taper their dose of study drug in a double-blind fashion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Weakness confined to the extra-ocular muscles, eyelid levator and eye closure with an
             ocular-QMG1 score ≥ 1

          -  At least one of the following combinations of abnormal diagnostic testing: a) Elevated
             acetylcholine receptor antibody titers, (b) Abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation (&gt;
             10% decrement following slow repetitive nerve stimulation) of any nerve-muscle pair,
             (c) Abnormal jitter on single fiber or concentric needle electromyography in any
             muscle, (d) Positive ice test and brain MRI that demonstrates no central nervous
             system pathology that mimics ocular myasthenia, or (e) Positive Tensilon test and
             brain MRI that demonstrate no central nervous system pathology that mimics ocular
             myasthenia

          -  Either no prior treatment with pyridostigmine, or participant has persistent ocular
             symptoms that are functionally limiting or troublesome despite treatment with
             pyridostigmine.

             inadequately to pyridostigmine.

          -  Intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange within 90 days of randomization
