  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational registry with intent to detect the prevalence of
      intracranial aneurysms with contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) at 1.5T, and to
      determine the risk factors such as high blood pressure and cigarette smoking relating to
      intracranial aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysms are common and have been reported increased incidence rate because of
      the widespread use of high-resolution imaging techniques. They are clinically important
      because of the life-threatening rupture and hemorrhage. Early detection and diagnosis is the
      key of treatment. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA), as a simple, sensitivity and
      noninvasive method, is playing an important role in Vascular Imaging. CE-MRA has been an
      accuracy modality for intracranial aneurysm at most centers and proved the high sensitivity
      and accuracy comparing with DSA. Therefore, we use CE-MRA at 1.5T as a tool of
      epidemiological investigation of intracranial aneurysms.

      In retrospective analysis, conventional risk factors for intracranial aneurysms include
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking history, and family history,
      etc. However, retrospective analysis probably gives an underestimation or overestimation of
      the actual results. Prospective analysis will get accurate data on the risk factors relating
      to intracranial aneurysms

        People coming to Changhai hospital to get health check or consult docter, undergoing
        cerebral CE-MRA, and according with the criteria were recruited. Assuming an 8 percent
        prevalence of intracranial aneurysm in the general population and using a two-sided alpha
        value of 0.05, we estimated that 4000 persons would need to be enrolled for the study.
