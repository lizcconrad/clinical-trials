    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of allogenic eASCs (expanded
      adult stem cells) for the treatment of recto-vaginal fistula in patients with Crohn´s
      disease.

    <description>Administration will be preceded by localization and closure of the internal opening. Cell treatment injection will be performed following Major Ambulatory Surgery standards. Patients will receive an intralesional dose of 20 million cells at baseline. 50% of the cell suspension will be placed into fistula walls of the internal opening, with the remaining 50% being injected across the wall tracts of the target fistula. Patients without healing (complete fistula closure)at week 12 will receive a second dose of 40 million cells, using the same treatment approach.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Patients with Crohn´s disease diagnosed at least 12 months earlier in accordance with
             accepted clinical, endoscopic, anatomopathological and/or radiologic criteria.

          -  Fulfilling one of the following criteria:

               -  At least, one previous surgery for fistulous disease.

               -  Physical status which discourage liposuction.

          -  Rectovaginal fistula.

          -  Women of a childbearing age. Good general state of health according to the findings of
             the clinical history and the physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of severe proctitis (prominent friability, spontaneous bleeding, multiple
             erosions, deep ulcers) or dominant active luminal disease requiring immediate therapy,
             assessed by rectosigmoidoscopy

          -  Patients with CDAI≥201

          -  Patients with an abscess unless a complete toilet of the area with drainage of the
             collections and the absence of abscess and other collections is confirmed prior to
             treatment start

          -  Patients who have received infliximab or any other anti TNF agent in the 8 weeks
             before the cell treatment administration

          -  Patients who have received tacrolimus or cyclosporine in the 4 weeks before the cell
             treatment administration

          -  Patients with a history of abuse of alcohol or other addictive substances in the 6
             months prior to inclusion

          -  Patients with malignant tumor, except for basal cell or cutaneous squamous cell
             carcinoma, or patients with a prior history of malignant tumors, unless the neoplastic
             disease has been in remission for the previous 5 years

          -  Patients with cardiopulmonary disease which, in opinion of the investigator, in
             unstable or sufficiently serious to exclude the patient from the study.

          -  Patients with any type of medical or psychiatric disease which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could be grounds for exclusion from study

          -  Patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. HIV, HBV, HCV or treponema
             infection, whether active or latent.

          -  Patients allergic to local anesthetics or gadolinium (MRI contrast) MRI is unfeasible
             (e.g. due to the presence of pacemakers, hip replacements or severe claustrophobia)

          -  Patients who have suffering major surgery or severe trauma in the prior 6 months

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Patients currently receiving, or having received within 1 month prior to enrolment
             into this clinical trial, any investigational drug.
