  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: In the framework of a randomized concurrent controlled trial, to assess the
      effectiveness of a feasible educational mechanism based on the principles of Alfred Adler,
      that focuses on the family, to improve the dietary habits of schoolchildren, to induce them
      to increase their physical activity, and to prevent obesity and diseases related to obesity.
      Primary Objectives for Children: 1.To increase intake of fruits and vegetables, to reduce
      intake of sweets and unhealthy snacks at home and in school, to increase exercise and to
      reduce sedentary activities. Primary Objective for the Parents: Increase the involvement of
      parents in the education of their children regarding nutrition.

      Description: Study population: Approximately 600 students and 600 parents from 24 first grade
      classes in 4 schools. Schools are randomized into intervention and control groups. The
      intervention comprises a 5-session parental workshop and 5 joint parent-child school-based
      activities. The control group will be offered the intervention after conclusion of the trial.

      Participants are recruited in first grade, anthropometrics are measured, and pupils and
      parents are interviewed on eating habits and exercise. Snacks are observed. The intervention
      takes place in the second grade, and outcome assessment is done at the end of the 2nd grade
      and beginning of the 3rd grade. In-depth interviews will be conducted with parents of obese
      children.

      Significance: Most interventions geared to prevention of childhood obesity have failed
      dismally. A new approach that focuses on the parent-child interaction may be contributory.

    <description>Description of the Intervention:
5 joint classroom activities (parents and children together, involving children in food choices/food preparation-sense of belonging/decision making): 1. Healthy breakfasts and 10 o'clock snacks 2. Fats and oils in the diet, cooking methods, setting limits to oily food intake. 3. Fruit and vegetables in the daily diet, adults as role models. 4. Learning about food categories &amp; pyramid, healthy eating and growth. 5. Limiting consumption of sweets and snacks.
Workshop for Parents: Explaining nutritional needs of children; how to encourage good eating habits, how to deal with children's manipulations, providing tools to elicit change; use of food to attract parental attention; practical tools to deal with their children's eating habits/obesity/refusal to eat/chronic health problems/failure to grow; ways to prevent use of food as an answer to childhood frustrations.</description>
