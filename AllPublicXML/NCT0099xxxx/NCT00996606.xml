    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Synovitis of the Wrist According to Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RAMRIS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Synovitis of the wrist was assessed at three sites including the radioulnar joint (RUJ), the radiocarpal joint (RCJ), and the intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints (IC-CMCJ). Global RAMRIS scores were assigned on a scale of 0 to 3 at each site, where 0 represented normal appearance with no synovial enhancement and each 1-point increase reflected one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. The scores for all three sites were added to give an aggregated score of 0 to 9. Baseline absolute value (AV) and change from Baseline to Week 4 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in synovitis.</description>

        <description>Synovitis of the wrist was assessed at three sites including the radioulnar joint (RUJ), the radiocarpal joint (RCJ), and the intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints (IC-CMCJ). Global RAMRIS scores were assigned on a scale of 0 to 3 at each site, where 0 represented normal appearance with no synovial enhancement and each 1-point increase reflected one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. The scores for all three sites were added to give an aggregated score of 0 to 9. Baseline absolute value (AV) and change from Baseline to Week 4 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in synovitis.</description>

          <description>Synovitis of the wrist was assessed at three sites including the RUJ, the RCJ, and the IC-CMCJ. Global RAMRIS scores were assigned on a scale of 0 to 3 at each site, where 0 represented normal appearance with no synovial enhancement and each 1-point increase reflected one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. The scores for all three sites were added to give an aggregated score of 0 to 9.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 in Synovitis of the Wrist and Metacarpo-Phalangeal (MCP) Joints According to Modified RAMRIS Score</title>
        <description>Synovitis of the wrist was assessed at three sites including the RUJ, the RCJ, and the IC-CMCJ. Global RAMRIS scores were assigned on a scale of 0 to 3 at each site, where 0 represented normal appearance with no synovial enhancement and each 1-point increase reflected one-third of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. The scores for all three sites were added to give an aggregated score of 0 to 9. Synovitis of MCP joints was determined on the basis of Short Inversion Time Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence evaluation with modification of the RAMRIS score. Four MCP joint compartments were each assessed 0 to 3, so the aggregated MCP joint score ranged from 0 to 12. Combined synovitis in wrist and MCP joints was determined on the basis of STIR sequences to produce overall score from 0 to 21. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in synovitis.</description>

        <description>Erosion was evaluated at 15 sites in the wrist and 8 sites in the MCP joints. Bone erosion was scored on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represented no bone erosion and each 1-point increase reflected up to a 10% increase in extent of erosion. The number of bones with erosion was taken as the count of joints with a bone erosion score greater than or equal to (≥) 1. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in erosion.</description>

The number of bones with erosion was taken as the count of joints with a bone erosion score greater than or equal to (≥) 1. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in erosion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 in Erosion of the Wrist and MCP Joints According to RAMRIS Score</title>
        <description>Erosion was evaluated at 15 sites in the wrist and 8 sites in the MCP joints. Bone erosion was scored on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represented no bone erosion and each 1-point increase reflected up to 10% increase in extent of erosion. Global RAMRIS scores were calculated as the sum of all joint sites for the wrist (range, 0 to 150) and MCP joints (range, 0 to 80). Aggregate wrist and MCP joint scores could range from 0 to 230 points. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in erosion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 in Bone Marrow Edema of the Wrist and MCP Joints According to RAMRIS Score</title>
        <description>Edema was evaluated at 15 sites in the wrist and 8 sites in the MCP joints. Bone edema was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represented no bone edema and each 1-point increase reflected one-third increase in extent of edema. Global RAMRIS scores were calculated as the sum of all joint sites for the wrist (range, 0 to 45) and MCP joints (range, 0 to 24). Aggregate wrist and MCP joint scores could range from 0 to 69 points. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in edema.</description>

        <description>The Ritchie Articular Index was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, according to the grades of tenderness in each of 26 assessed joints. The total score was taken as the sum of joint scores and ranged from 0 to 78. Scores of 0 reflected no tenderness, while higher scores reflected increased tenderness. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated improvement in joint tenderness.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI assessed 20 items in eight functional activity domains including dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each item was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represented activities performed without difficulty and 3 represented inability to perform activities alone. The total score was calculated as an average of all item scores, and thus also ranged from 0 to 3. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an increase in ability to perform activities independently.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 in Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints (DAS28) Score</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was derived from assessments of C-reactive protein (CRP), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and general health according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28 scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.36 × natural log (CRP + 1)] + [0.014 × VAS] + 0.96. TJC was defined as the number of painful joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. CRP was measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). DAS28 scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. Baseline AV and changes from Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>
