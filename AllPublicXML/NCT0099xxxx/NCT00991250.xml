  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether SentoClone® gives improved treatment
      responses in patients with advanced malignant melanoma in comparison to established reference
      treatment(s).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant melanoma is one of the most common cancer forms worldwide and WHO estimates 132,000
      new cases each year. The incidence rate vary up to 150-fold between different regions and
      ethnicities, the highest rates are found in emigrated Caucasian populations (e.g. Australia
      and New Zealand).

      There are few therapy alternatives for advanced malignant melanomas. At present, dacarbazine
      (Dacarbazine Medac®) is the most commonly used therapy. Immunotherapy with IL-2 and IFN is an
      alternative, but it is associated with multiple side effects. Hence, there remains a
      considerable need for alternative treatments.

      By using SentoClone®, autologous tumour-reactive lymphocytes are expanded and infused to the
      patient, where they have the opportunity to seek out and attack the primary tumour and
      metastases. The first step is to identify the tumour draining lymph node(s), which is done in
      parallel to surgical resection of the primary tumour or metastasis. The sentinel and/or
      metinel node(s), the initial meeting place between tumour antigen and the immune system, are
      further dissected and collected during the surgery.

      In this study SentoClone® will be compared with Dacarbazine Medac® and Temodal® which are
      currently regarded as standard first-line therapies in advanced malignant melanoma.

The sentinel and/or metinel node(s), the initial meeting place between tumour antigen and the immune system, are further dissected and collected during the surgery. The lymphocytes are extracted from the collected lymph nodes and expanded in vitro, the lymphocytes are thereafter stimulated with tumour extract and returned to the patient intravenously as an autologous cell transfusion. The administered volume will be 100 ml for cell densities less than 3x106 cells/ml and 200 ml for cell densities of 3x106 cells/ml or more.</description>

    <description>Dacarbazine (5-[3,3-Dimethyl-1-triazenyl]imidazole-4-carboxamide) is a widely used systemic treatment against advanced malignant melanoma. Dacarbazine is a cytostatic agent, which inhibits tumour growth by interfering with DNA-synthesises. The DNA-synthesis is inhibited by alkylation of the DNA molecule; however, it is unclear whether dacarbazine has other cytostatic impacts on cell mechanisms. Dacarbazine is inactive until liver passage, the liver converts dacarbazine to its reactive metabolites MTIC and HMMTIC, which alkylate DNA. Dacarbazine is light sensitive and needs to be administered intravenously.
A newer analogue to dacarbazine, temozolomide (Temodal®), has been developed for oral administration. Temodal® is administered in capsules and is rapidly absorbed reaching peak concentrations after 20 minutes. Temodal® is converted to MTIC at physiological pH, the same reactive molecule as dacarbazine is metabolized to in the liver.</description>
