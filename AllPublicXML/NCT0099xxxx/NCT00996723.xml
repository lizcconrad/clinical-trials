    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age must be ≥ 18 months and &lt; 21 years

          2. Diagnosis of DIPG or high-grade glioma originating from the brainstem.

          3. Lansky (for research participants ≤ 16 years) or Karnofsky (for research participants
             &gt; 16 years) performance score ≥ 40 at the time of study enrollment

          4. Adequate organ function at the time of study enrollment as follows:

               -  Bone marrow: ANC ≥ 1,000/μL, platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (transfusion
                  independent), hemoglobin concentration ≥ 8g/dL (may be transfused)

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine concentration &lt; 2x the institutional normal values for
                  age or GFR &gt; 70ml/min/1.73m2

               -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin concentration &lt; 1.5x the institutional upper limit of
                  normal for age; SGPT &lt; 5x the institutional upper limit of normal; albumin ≥ 2
                  g/dL

          5. Electrocardiogram (EKG) with an average QTc interval &lt; 450 msec. If a research
             participant has QTc interval ≥ 450 msec on screening EKG, the screening EKG may be
             repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc interval from the three
             screening EKGs must be &lt; 450 msec in order for the research participant to be eligible
             for the study. Research participants with abnormal serum electrolytes and a QTc
             interval ≥ 450 msec should have a repeat EKG repeated once the concentration of serum
             electrolyte is corrected

          6. Female research participants of childbearing age must not be pregnant (confirmed by
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week of treatment start) or breast-feeding.

          7. Female research participants of childbearing age and male research participants of
             child fathering potential must agree to use safe contraceptive methods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Metastatic disease

          2. Use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants

          3. Research participants who received any other type of anticancer treatment

          4. Research participants with uncontrolled infection

          5. Research participants with any concomitant significant medical illness that in the
             investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, or
             that would impair the evaluation of side effects related to this treatment, alter drug
             metabolism or the tolerance to this treatment

          6. QTc interval prolongation with other medications that required discontinuation of that
             medication

          7. Research participants with any history of cardiac arrhythmias or congenital long QT
             syndrome

          8. Use of any concomitant medication that may cause QT interval prolongation and/or
             induce Torsades de Pointes

          9. Hypertension defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95th percentile for
             age, height and gender, or blood pressure &gt; 140/90 for research participants ≥ 18
             years of age. If hypertension is detected, blood pressure values &lt; 95th in two
             separate occasions need to be documented before registration. Body surface ≥ 1.8m2 for
             research participants enrolled on dosage levels 2, 3, and 4
