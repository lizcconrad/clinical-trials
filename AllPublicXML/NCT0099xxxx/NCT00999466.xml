  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD8848 is a new drug that is being tested for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis
      (hayfever). This study will be in two parts and will include 59 asthmatic patients in total.
      The first part will investigate the tolerability and safety of AZD8848 while the second part
      will investigate both the therapeutic effect of AZD8848 and how well patients tolerate the
      drug.
