      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of soy (NovaSoy®) and estrogen on
      menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and mood alteration in
      perimenopausal women.

    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that in addition to playing a role in disease prevention and
      menopausal symptom reduction, phytoestrogens can reduce anxiety-related behaviors in animals
      and improve memory in both animals and humans. This project seeks to investigate the
      potential anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and cognition-enhancing effects of phytoestrogen
      treatment, in comparison to another popular treatment, estradiol, and placebo, for
      perimenopausal women. Given the detrimental effects of stress on memory performance, a widely
      used laboratory stressor will be implemented to investigate whether phytoestrogens and/or
      estradiol enhance memory by counteracting the negative effects of stress on memory processes.

      Estrogen and Anxiety Recent animal studies suggest that estrogen can play an important role
      in modulating anxiety, yet there has been little human research on this topic. Research
      suggests that the anxiolytic effects of estrogens are mediated by estrogen receptor-beta 1
      (ER-beta), one of two known estrogen receptors in the brain 2. ER-beta agonists decreased the
      release of stress hormones after immobilization stress in rats compared to no treatment and
      treatment with ER-alpha agonists 3. Additionally, transgenic female mice lacking ER-beta
      exhibited increased anxiety and decreased serotonin in several brain areas, including the
      hippocampus 4. The regulation of anxiety by ER-beta is likely to be related to the effects of
      ER-beta on serotonin transmission 5. The inhibition of anxiety-related behaviors in female
      rats is mediated by ER-beta in the hippocampus 6. Whereas ER-beta agonists decrease
      anxiety-related behaviors in female rats, ER-alpha agonists may work in an opposite fashion
      3,7.

      Phytoestrogens and Anxiety Unlike estrogen, which binds equally to ER-alpha and ER-beta,
      phytoestrogens have a much greater affinity for ER-beta than ER-alpha 8. Phytoestrogens are
      plant compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to endogenous estrogens and
      are currently being widely investigated to determine their potential role in disease
      prevention. Phytoestrogens have been shown to have anxiolytic effects in female rats.
      Specifically, female rats fed soy diets or soy supplements exhibited less anxiety-related
      behavior in a well-validated behavioral maze task compared to control-fed counterparts 9.
      Though the animal literature supports a role for phytoestrogens in reducing anxiety and/or
      stress responses following an acute stressor, current research in humans is inconclusive and
      is based on self-report measures of day-to-day stress rather than responses to acute
      stressors. Trials examining the effects of different soy-based preparations and diets on
      cognition and menopausal complaints have yielded inconsistent results. To date, three trials
      have found improved overall mood, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms or better reaction to
      the stress of testing 10,11 while five trials have shown no changes in these outcomes 12-15.
      No human studies have examined the potential anxiolytic effects of phytoestrogens on stress
      and anxiety following a laboratory stressor. Past studies have shown mixed evidence for
      whether phytoestrogens are beneficial in regards to menopausal symptoms. A recent study has
      shown that women who have a specific intestinal microflora, and thus are able to produce the
      isoflavan equol, are the ones who receive the benefit from the phytoestrogens, such as
      reduced anxiety, as equol has a greater estrogenic activity and affinity for both estrogen
      receptors (Ishiwata et al., 2009).

      Stress and Anxiety in Midlife Women Recent studies demonstrate notable age and sex
      differences in stress responsivity. Postmenopausal women have larger increases in salivary
      cortisol after psychosocial laboratory stressors compared to premenopausal women 16. This
      finding was corroborated by a recent meta-analysis which indicated that the effect of aging
      on cortisol response to pharmacological or psychological challenge was about three times
      greater in women compared to men 17. A community-based study of adults in their 70s found
      greater 12-hour free cortisol excretion to be associated with poorer delayed verbal recall
      for women only 18. Women in this study who exhibited increases in cortisol excretion two and
      a half years later were more likely to show declines in memory performance at that time
      compared to women without increased cortisol excretion. Using a well-validated psychosocial
      laboratory stressor, Wolf and colleagues found a stronger detrimental effect of psychosocial
      stress on visual-verbal memory (pictorial memory for common items) for older women compared
      to older men 19. These data suggest that interventions that lower cortisol, particularly in
      women, may lower age-related memory declines.

      Phytoestrogens and Cognition Soy isoflavones have been shown to enhance hippocampal (memory)
      and frontal lobe (executive) functioning in both clinical trials and animal studies. Research
      indicates that the neuroprotective properties of phytoestrogens include a positive impact on
      choline acetyltransferase and nerve growth factor in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of
      female rats 20 and a weakening of tau phosphorylations associated with Alzheimer's disease in
      primates 21. Cognitive improvements such as enhanced working memory and visual-spatial memory
      have been noted for female rats fed phytoestrogen-rich diets or supplements 22. Clinical
      trials have revealed a consistent improvement in mental flexibility and planning abilities
      (complex executive tasks) in samples of postmenopausal women (17, 18) as well as younger men
      and women (16). Further research examining the effects of phytoestrogens on executive tasks
      is warranted, as many trials, including a large recently published trial have not adequately
      tested this cognitive domain (15, 19-21, Ho et al., 2007). To date, seven randomized trials
      in humans have been published which examine the effects of phytoestrogens on verbal memory.
      Results indicated significant verbal memory improvements with phytoestrogens in young men and
      women 11 and non-significant trends toward improved verbal memory in four additional trials
      of younger postmenopausal women 12,13. Phytoestrogen treatment did not benefit verbal memory
      in the one trial involving only older postmenopausal women 14 and a recent trial of women
      aged 55-76 (Ho et al., 2007). Interestingly, these findings are largely consistent with the
      &quot;critical period hypothesis&quot; that proposes estrogen therapy benefits cognitive functioning
      only when initiated during the menopausal transition or shortly thereafter 23. Accumulating
      evidence suggests that phytoestrogen treatment may also specifically enhance cognition in the
      early menopause.
