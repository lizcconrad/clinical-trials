WASO was measured on 2 consecutive days within a period. Arithmetic mean of WASO of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <description>NAASO1, as determined by PSG, was the number of times there was a wake period of at least 1 epoch from the onset of persistent sleep to light on. Each entry to be counted must be separated by a Stage 2 Non-REM [Stage N2] 30-second (30-sec) epoch, Stage 3 Non-REM [Stage N3] 30-sec epoch, or stage rapid eye movement [stage R] 30-sec epoch. The sum of 2 consecutive days of recording was divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period. Arithmetic mean of NAASO1 of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <description>NAASO2, as determined by PSG, was the number of times there was a wake period of at least 2 30-sec epochs from the onset of persistent sleep to light on. Each entry to be counted must be separated by a Stage N2 30-sec epoch, Stage N3 30-sec epoch, or Stage R 30-sec epoch. The sum of 2 consecutive days of recording was divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period. Arithmetic mean of NAASO2 of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

          <title>Number of Awakenings of at Least 2 Epochs After Sleep Onset (NAASO2)</title>
          <description>NAASO2, as determined by PSG, was the number of times there was a wake period of at least 2 30-sec epochs from the onset of persistent sleep to light on. Each entry to be counted must be separated by a Stage N2 30-sec epoch, Stage N3 30-sec epoch, or Stage R 30-sec epoch. The sum of 2 consecutive days of recording was divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period. Arithmetic mean of NAASO2 of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <description>IRLS: psychometrically; clinically valid; clinician-administered instrument assesses severity of RLS. RLS symptom severity and impact on daily living comprise of 10 items giving 2 subscale scores and 1 global score. Subscale scores: symptom severity(6 items) and impact on daily living(3 items), item 3 loaded equally on both subscales. Global score calculated from 10 items. Score of all items range from 0-4, total score range:0-40. Lower scores: lower severity and better quality of life. Arithmetic mean of IRLS of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

          <description>WTAS, as determined by PSG, was the number of wake (30-sec) epochs after the final awakening until the end of the 8-hour recording. WTAS was the sum of 2 consecutive days of recordings divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period. Arithmetic mean of WTAS of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <description>NAASO1, as determined by PSG, was the number of times there was a wake period of at least 1 30-sec epoch from the onset of persistent sleep to light on. Each entry to be counted must be separated by a Stage N2 30-sec epoch, Stage N3 30-sec epoch, or Stage R 30-sec epoch. The sum of 2 consecutive days of recording was divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period by each individual hour (8 hours total) and each individual quarter of the night (eight hours in 2 hour increments). Arithmetic mean of NAASO1 of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <title>Hourly and Quarterly Assessment of Number of Awakenings of at Least 2 Epoch After Sleep Onset (NAASO2)</title>
        <description>NAASO2, as determined by PSG, was the number of times there was a wake period of at least 2 30-sec epochs from the onset of persistent sleep to light on. Each entry to be counted must be separated by a Stage N2 30-sec epoch, Stage N3 30-sec epoch, or Stage R 30-sec epoch. The sum of 2 consecutive days of recording was divided by 2 at the end of each intervention period by each individual hour (8 hours total) and each individual quarter of the night (eight hours in 2 hour increments). Arithmetic mean of NAASO2 of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <description>PLM, as determined by PSG was number of periodic limb movements based on time in bed (TIB). Calculated at each individual hour (8 hours total) and each individual quarter of the night (eight hours in 2 hour increments). Arithmetic mean of PLM of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>

        <title>Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ): Number of Awakenings Subscale</title>
        <description>SSQ: participant-rated instrument to assess sleep behavior; measures sleep quantity, quality. Comprised of 5 items giving 5 subscale scores: latency, hours of sleep, number of awakenings, total wake time after sleep onset, quality of sleep. This (1 item) subscale: numerical rating completed by participant 30 minutes after waking; recall period: night before. Range: 0 awakenings to 30 awakenings. Lower value indicates better quality of sleep. Arithmetic mean of this subscale score of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model. Results of hours of sleep subscale reported as sTST.</description>

        <description>SSQ: participant-rated instrument to assess sleep behavior; measures sleep quantity, quality. Comprised of 5 items yielding 5 subscale scores: latency, hours of sleep, number of awakenings, total wake time after sleep onset, quality of sleep. This 1 item subscale: numerical rating completed by participant 30 minutes after waking; recall period: night before, Range: 0 to 100, higher score: better quality of sleep. Arithmetic mean of this subscale score of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model. Results of hours of sleep subscale reported as sTST.</description>

        <description>MOS-SS:Participant rated instrument, assesses sleep quantity, quality;with 12 items(7 subscale scores:sleep disturbance, snoring, awakening short of breath/with headache, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity, optimal sleep;2 composite index scores:sleep problems Index I, II). Subscale scores total range:0-100(except sleep quantity[range 0-24 hours], optimal sleep[range 0-1: 0= &lt;7 or &gt;8 hours;1=7/8 hours]). Higher scores=poorer sleep outcomes(except sleep quantity, adequacy). Arithmetic mean of MOS-SS scores of each participant for all periods was taken before linear mixed model analysis.</description>

        <description>RLS-QoL: psychometrically and clinically valid and reliable participant-rated instrument, assesses impact of RLS on participant quality of life. Specifically, it assessed effects of RLS on health status function (symptom severity, daily activity, social functioning, sleep, concentrating and decision making, travelling, sexual activity, and work) giving a summary score ranging from 0-100. Higher scores reflect better quality of life. Recall period: 1 week prior to assessment. Arithmetic mean of RLS-QoL score of each participant for all periods was taken prior to employing linear mixed model.</description>
