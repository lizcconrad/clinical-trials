  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Runaway and homeless youth are at risk for HIV based upon their rates of substance use,
      particularly injection drug use, unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple partners, and
      sexually transmitted diseases. Risk increases as the time away from home increases. STRIVE is
      a family intervention aimed at increasing residential stability, decreasing runaway episodes,
      and decreasing HIV risk. Families are randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral
      skills-building intervention consisting of five weekly sessions delivered at family homes, or
      are assigned to standard care. Sessions are aimed at increasing problem solving, role
      clarity, and positive interactions. It is hypothesized that the intervention will result in
      improved family dynamics, less runaway behavior, and less risky behavior.
