      The rationales of a clinical trial comparing intralesional antimonial therapy versus wound
      care management in patients with old world cutaneous leishmaniasis (OWCL) are the following:

        1. The effectiveness of the current mainstay treatment with intralesional antimonials for
           CL is subject to discussion, especially in L. major lesions which are predominant in
           Northern Afghanistan

        2. The importance of wound care management in patients with OWCL has been emphasized by
           Gonzalez et al. (2008) and its efficacy is confirmed in the Kabul trial with L. tropica
           patients.

      Parallel to the clinical efficacy the trial investigates the cost-effectiveness and -utility
      of the treatment options under study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Present a suspected Old World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis lesion confirmed by Giemsa
             stained wound smears with no other skin diseases or infections and who

          2. Have never been previously treated with antimonial injections or any other form of
             anti-leishmanial medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with more than one lesion are excluded.

          2. Patients with a lesion age of &gt; 3 months are also excluded. The experience of the
             Kabul trial shows that patients presenting themselves for the first time with a
             lesion, which is older than three months, have either been pre-treated somewhere else
             and/or show a poor compliance during the trial.

          3. Patients below 12 years of age have to be excluded from the trial, because they cannot
             fill in the EQ-5D and Skindex questionnaire part of the health economic evaluation.

          4. Intralesional antimony injections are too painful for lesions located on the nose,
             lips or eyes. Therefore, patients presenting these lesions are excluded from the
             trial.

          5. For compliance reasons addicted patients and patients not available for follow-up are
             exclude from the trial.

          6. Patients with major uncontrolled diseases as tuberculosis, diabetes or HIV are
             excluded from the trial, since their management requires additional co-medications,
             which may affect wound healing.
