      The objective of the present study was to investigate the possibility of using L-lysine, an
      amino acid that occurs naturally in food and which interferes with nitric oxide (NO)
      production, for the treatment of schizophrenia. L-lysine, 6 g/day, was administered to ten
      patients with schizophrenia as an add-on treatment to conventional antipsychotic treatment.
      The study was designed as a single-blinded, cross-over study where patients were randomly
      assigned to initial treatment with either L-lysine or placebo and screened at baseline, after
      four weeks when treatment was crossed over, and after eight weeks when treatment was
      terminated. The four-week L-lysine treatment regimen caused a significant increased in blood
      concentration of the amino acid and was tolerated well. The analysis of outcome measures
      showed a significant decrease in symptom severity as measured by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Furthermore, the patient's ability to solve the Wisconsin Card
      Sorting Task (WCST) was significantly improved indicating increased problem solving capacity
      and cognitive flexibility. Subjective reports from three of the patients also indicated
      decreased symptom severity and enhanced cognitive functioning. In summary, these findings
      suggest potential beneficial effects of L-lysine treatment on symptom severity and cognitive
      deficits in patients with schizophrenia.
