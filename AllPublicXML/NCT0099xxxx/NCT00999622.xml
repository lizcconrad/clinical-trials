      RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from laboratory tests of patients with newly
      diagnosed malignant supratentorial astrocytoma may help doctors learn more about the effect
      of treatment on white blood cell count and the risk of infection.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood samples and risk of infection in patients with
      newly diagnosed malignant supratentorial astrocytoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of decreases in CD4 counts as a function of therapy
           in patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytoma.

        -  Determine whether the decrease in CD4 counts is a significant predictor of infections or
           adverse outcomes in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo monthly collection of blood for serial CD4 counts and heme-8 with
      differential for 1 year for quantitative analysis. Patients also complete a monthly
      questionnaire about infections and antibiotic use.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients (100 with high-grade disease and 25 with low-grade
      disease) will be accrued for this study.
