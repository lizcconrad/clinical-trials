    <textblock>
      The Thelin Patient Safety Registry is a post-marketing program in the European Union (EU)
      that is designed to supplement the reporting of spontaneous adverse events (AE) and better
      characterize known and potential safety signals for Thelin. The registry is a secure,
      restricted access, electronic system which collects anonymous, pre-defined, patient-level
      data on demographic variables, safety monitoring measurements (i.e. liver function tests,
      haemoglobin and international normalized ratio (INR) measurements), concomitant medications,
      information on AEs and Thelin drug discontinuation. Regular review of the data is conducted
      to assess the frequency of identified safety risks and to monitor for the emergence of new
      safety signals at monthly pharmacovigilance meetings, quarterly signal detection meetings,
      and for each Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

    <description>Please note that this is a non-interventional study and no drug is actually given as an intervention. Instead, patients prescribed THELIN are being followed under real world circumstances. However at the request of the QA group at CT.gov, we were instructed to add sitaxentan sodium as the intervention type, regardless of the fact that this is a non-interventional study.</description>
