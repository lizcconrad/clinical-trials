    <textblock>
      Rationale: Giving bortezomib and low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before
      a donor stem cell transplant or peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth
      of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem
      cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any
      remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving sirolimus and
      tacrolimus before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

      Purpose: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib
      before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      Objectives:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib when used in a novel
      conditioning regimen for patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation for
      multiple myeloma.

      II. To evaluate the tolerability and feasibility of this novel conditioning regimen and GVHD
      prophylaxis strategy incorporating several anti-myeloma agents, including bortezomib, in
      patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma.

      III. To obtain an initial assessment of the efficacy of this novel conditioning regimen.

      Outline: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II study.

      Reduced-Intensity Conditioning: Patients receive bortezomib IV and then undergo fractionated
      total-body irradiation on days -5 and -2. Patients receive thymoglobulin IV over 6 hours on
      days -5 to -2 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -3.

      Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation: Patients undergo bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant on day 0.

      Graft versus Host Disease Prophylaxis: Beginning on day -3, patients receive oral sirolimus
      and taper beginning on day 61. Beginning on day -2, patients receive oral or IV tacrolimus
      and taper beginning on day 101. After completion of the study treatment, patients are
      followed every 3 months.
