  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main objective of this trial is to assess the hypothesis whether the application of TachoSil®
      as a dural sealant improves the quality of craniotomy procedure and outcome in general
      compared with standard dural closure techniques in a controlled and randomized way. As a
      primary endpoint the investigators look at possible postoperative occurrence of CSF pads or
      leakages needing any kind of intervention until day 30 after the primary craniotomy.
      Furthermore, the investigators will look at other surgery-related complications and at
      pharmacoeconomic endpoints such as hospital stay or cost of the implant. Overall, the results
      of this study will provide important information on whether or not the adjunct of a
      relatively expensive implant on a routinely basis for the closure of elective craniotomies is
      safe and effective, or not.

      To date, TachoSil® is often used in neurosurgery and other surgical disciplines in a
      non-standardized fashion also to prevent CSF leakage after dural closure. So far, adverse
      events directly related to the product have not been reported. Theoretically, any implant may
      be associated with a higher incidence of postoperative infections (e.g. epidural, subdural or
      subgaleal empyema). On the other hand, it is not known whether or not the application of
      TachoSil® on the dural suture may reduce CSF leakage.
