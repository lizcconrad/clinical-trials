    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if LY377604 + sibutramine work better than LY377604
      or sibutramine alone in the treatment of obesity.

    <description>Results presented as Least Squares Mean with treatment, visit, and their interaction as fixed effects, subject as random effect, baseline body mass index used as covariate. OWL-QoL consists of 17 items on scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 6 (A very great deal). Before calculating scores, each item is reversed. A single quality of life score is computed by summing each item and transforming this raw score onto standardized scale of 0 (greatest impact) to 100 (lowest impact) using formula: score = [(sum of component items score (minus) lowest possible score/ possible raw score range)*100].</description>

SF-36 is a self-reported questionnaire that consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains including vitality. The vitality domain results are presented. The vitality domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning.</description>

        <description>Results presented as Least Squares Mean with treatment, visit, and their interaction as fixed effects, subject as random effect, baseline body mass index used as covariate. OWL-QoL consists of 17 items on scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 6 (A very great deal). Before calculating scores, each item is reversed. A single quality of life score is computed by summing each item and transforming this raw score onto standardized scale of 0 (greatest impact) to 100 (lowest impact) using formula: score = [(sum of component items score (minus) lowest possible score/ possible raw score range)*100].</description>
