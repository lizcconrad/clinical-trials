      The current study tested the effectiveness of four potentially important tailoring factors
      (decisional framework, self-efficacy, navigation autonomy, and proactive outreach) in the
      context of an online motivational intervention for smoking cessation. A fifth factor was
      originally planned by dropped during intervention development due to confounds with the other
      planned factors. Information learned from this study will inform how to best design an online
      interventions for smoking cessation. Participants were recruited from a large, regional U.S.
      health plan. Using a full factorial design to screen for important main effects and 2-way
      interactions, participants were randomized to receive one of 16 different experimental factor
      combinations and followed for one year to assess program impact on smokers' use of
      empirically-validated cessation treatment and abstinence.

      The current study is a factorial screening experiment, consistent with the Multiphase
      Optimization Strategy. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 16 different
      combinations of the 4 experimental factors. Each factor was explored on 2 contrasting levels.
      Each contrasting factor level was then compared to the other, resulting in 4 analytic arms.
      Within each arm, all participants (n = 1865) were analyzed to determine the relative effect
      of each contrasting factor level on the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.

      <population>1865 participants were enrolled and randomized. For the analyses, participants assigned to each contrasting level of each of the 4 experimental factors were compared against one another. Thus, 1865 people were in each analytic arm in this factorial screening experiment.</population>
