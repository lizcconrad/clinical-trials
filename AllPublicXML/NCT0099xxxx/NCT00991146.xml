  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Canakinumab Administered for 6 Months (24 Weeks) in Japanese Patients With Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes Followed by an Extension Phase</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Canakinumab (Anti-interleukin-1Î² Monoclonal Antibody) Administered for 6 Months (24 Weeks) in Japanese Patients With the Following Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes: Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome, Muckle-Wells Syndrome, or Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease, Followed by an Extension Phase to Provide Canakinumab to Study Patients Until it is Approved and Marketed in Japan</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there are no approved effective therapies for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated
      periodic syndromes (CAPS) including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS),
      Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), or Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) in
      Japan.

      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in Japanese patients with
      cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). In previous and currently ongoing CAPS
      studies (CACZ885A2102, CACZ885D2201, CACZ885D2304, CACZ885D2306), it has been observed that
      treatment with canakinumab in patients with CAPS contributed to ensure absence of relapse, to
      improve signs and symptoms and to prevent secondary disease complications. However, no
      Japanese patients have been included in those studies. This study will allow access for
      Japanese patients to a new potentially efficacious treatment for CAPS patients with a
      convenient dosing regimen.
