  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen healthy subjects will be randomized to each of the 3 parallel treatment groups.
      Eligible subjects will check in to the clinical unit on Day -2 and have 24-hr pharmacokinetic
      collections on Day -1 and on Day 1. Once the pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations
      have been analyzed, doses of GSK2212836 will be selected for further study in Part B.
      Subjects from Part A will participate in Part B.

      Part B is a single blind, randomized, placebo controlled study that will consist of a 2-week
      repeat dose period with 3 dose levels and one dose of the marketed formulation of GSK2212836.
      Subjects will check in to the clinical unit on Day -3; will participate in a test meal on Day
      -2 and have 24-hr baseline pharmacokinetic profiles on Day -1 and Day 1. Subjects will be
      released from the clinic on Day 2, and return for daily dosing on Days 3 through 12. On Day
      6, they will also have a brief outpatient visit. Subjects will check into the clinic again on
      the evening of Day 12, and on Day 13 they will again have 24-hr pharmacokinetic profiles
      collected. Subjects will be released from the clinical research unit on Day 14, following a
      test meal, triglyceride sampling and check-out assessments, and will be released from the
      study 5-10 days later after completing a follow up visit.
