  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a widely used class of cholesterol-lowering drugs
      that have an established role in the medical management of cardiovascular disease. Their
      benefits have also been shown in the surgical setting with decreased cardiovascular
      complications and lower perioperative mortality following cardiac and vascular surgery. There
      is now considerable evidence showing statins have useful pleiotropic properties that extend
      beyond cholesterol lowering, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory and
      fibrinolytic effects. Growing evidence suggests these effects may be useful in attenuating
      the proinflammatory and metabolic stress response to surgery and the benefit of statins may
      extend to other surgical settings such as abdominal surgery.

      Laboratory studies demonstrate the surgically-relevant benefits of statins and show they
      decrease peritoneal inflammation, reduce the severity of intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion
      injury, improve survival in models of abdominal sepsis, decrease the formation of
      postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions and improve the healing of colonic anastomoses.
      Retrospective clinical studies show statins improve outcomes in sepsis, reduce the
      postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and are associated with
      decreased rates of surgical wound infections and postoperative respiratory complications
      following various non-cardiac general surgical procedures. However, no prospective studies
      have specifically evaluated the perioperative use of statins in abdominal surgery. Using
      colorectal surgery as a model for major abdominal surgery, the investigators will conduct a
      randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of perioperative statin use on
      postoperative morbidity, local and systemic inflammatory response, and functional recovery
      after surgery.
