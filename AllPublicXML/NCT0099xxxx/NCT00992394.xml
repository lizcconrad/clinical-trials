  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare 2 different methods for managing a subject with psoriasis who
      has achieved good disease control, as defined by a clinical response with a Physician Global
      Assessment (PGA) inferior or equal to 1 at the screening visit, on etanercept treatment.

      The first method involves stopping etanercept treatment on entry into the study, with the
      option to reinitiate etanercept at 50 mg once weekly after medical review and agreement
      between the subject and the investigator. The second method involves continuing on etanercept
      at 25 mg once weekly, with the option to increase the dose to 50 mg once weekly after medical
      review and agreement between the subject and the investigator. Subjects will be randomized
      into one of these two study arms.

    <measure>Time-Normalized Area Under Curve (AUC) of Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>PGA psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. PGA of Psoriasis scale ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 5 (severe disease). 'Clear' and &quot;Almost clear' includes all participants who were scored as a 0 or 1. For participants who discontinued the study before week 52, the final PGA score was carried forward to the remaining time points before calculating the 52-week AUC. The AUC was calculated on the PGA score profile with the method of trapeziums from baseline visit to visit 52. The time-normalized AUC is defined as the ratio between AUC and the expected treatment period (days): AUC/ 52 weeks*7days + 1.</description>

    <measure>Time-Normalized Area Under Curve (AUC) of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is the dermatology-specific quality of life measure used for psoriatic population. The 10-item questionnaire has a score range of 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor quality of life. An estimate of the minimal clinically important difference of the DLQI total score is a 5 point improvement. Total score range: 0 (best) to 30 (worst).</description>

    <baseline>
      <population>A total of 174 subjects were randomized.Three subjects were randomized but did not take at least 1 dose of investigational product, and were therefore excluded from the safety population. One subject was excluded from the mITT population. The reason for exclusion was lack of at least one post-baseline PGA.</population>

        <title>Time-Normalized Area Under Curve (AUC) of Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>PGA psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. PGA of Psoriasis scale ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 5 (severe disease). ‘Clear’ and “Almost clear’ includes all participants who were scored as a 0 or 1. For participants who discontinued the study before week 52, the final PGA score was carried forward to the remaining time points before calculating the 52-week AUC. The AUC was calculated on the PGA score profile with the method of trapeziums from baseline visit to visit 52. The time-normalized AUC is defined as the ratio between AUC and the expected treatment period (days): AUC/ 52 weeks*7days + 1.</description>
