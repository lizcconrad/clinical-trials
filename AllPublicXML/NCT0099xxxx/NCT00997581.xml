    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about a possible new medicine, apremilast, for treating
      acute gout and compare how it works to indomethacin, a medication that has been used to treat
      gout for over 50 years.

      In order to learn about apremilast, half the participants in this study will receive
      apremilast and half the participants in this study will receive indomethacin.

      This study will measure the severity and duration of acute gout attacks in research
      participants, as well as measures of quality of life and any side effects or adverse
      reactions to the medication.

      There will be three study visits: a screening/baseline visit on Day 1, a visit to evaluate
      response to treatment with study medication at Day 7, and a follow-up visit at Day 21.
