      Methods:

      The study is an observational prospective trial that includes 150 patients 18 or older
      admitted to our icu because of severe sepsis or septic shock as defined by the American
      College of Chest Physicians/ Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus conference.

      Patients whose primary reason for hospital admission is sepsis or patients developing sepsis
      after elective invasive procedure will be included.

      Only patients with known former primary coagulation/hypercoagulability disorder wil be
      excluded.

      Procedure:

      Within 12 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) blood will be drawn for the
      following:

      Blood count, glucose, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, prothrombin time, partial
      thromboplastin time, Ddimer, fibrinogen and TEG (thromboelastography) assay will be
      performed.

      These blood tests will be also drawn on day 2 and 4 of admission. On day one, another 3 cc of
      blood will be drawn and frozen in -80 degrees for levels of coagulation factors: I, II, V,
      VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, Antithrombin III, protein C, S.

      Demographic data will be collected according to patient chart, and the acute physiologic and
      chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score will be assessed after 24 hours. Vital signs will
      be collected from monitors.

      Informed consent will be waved due to lack of any intervention and the general condition of
      patients unable to sign an informed consent.

      Control group will include 10 healthy individuals.

      End point:

      The primary end point is to determine the common hypercoagulable/coagulation disorders
      according to TEG.

      The secondary end point is to determine whether TEG results have prognostic implications on
      this group of severe septic patients.
