        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of multiple myeloma based on standard criteria.

          -  Patients must have CD56-positive, relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
             Myeloma is considered CD56-positive if either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow
             cytometry criteria defined in Appendix X are met.

          -  Age &lt; 18 years at the time of signing Informed Consent.

          -  Patients have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2.

          -  During the dose escalation phase, patients must have received at least one prior
             therapy for multiple myeloma. The prior therapy or therapies can include lenalidomide
             treatment.

          -  Once the MTD/RPTD is defined, only patients who have received at least 1 but no more
             than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens will be enrolled at this dose level in the study.
             Prior regimen(s) may have included bortezomib or a bortezomib component. If prior
             regimen(s) included a lenalidomide component:

               -  Patients last dose of lenalidomide must be ≥ 6 months from Day 1 treatment with
                  BB-10901 (with the exception of maintenance lenalidomide treatment which should
                  be completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 treatment with BB-10901) ,

               -  Patients must have achieved a response of stable disease or better to any
                  lenalidomide treatment, and

               -  Patients must not have discontinued treatment due to lenalidomide intolerance.

          -  Patients must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          -  Patients must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document.

          -  Woman of child bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test within 10
             - 14 days and within 24 hours prior to writing an initial prescription for
             lenalidomide even if continuous abstinence is the chosen method of birth control. In
             addition, all sexually active WCBP must agree to frequent pregnancy tests as outlined
             in the protocol and must agree to use 2 contraceptive methods. WCBP must agree to
             follow these requirements for at least 4 weeks before beginning treatment with
             lenalidomide and for at least 4 weeks after the last treatment of lenalidomide.

          -  Male patients must agree to use a latex condom even if he has had a successful
             vasectomy and males can not donate sperm. Males must agree to follow these
             requirements for at least 4 weeks following last dose of study drug.

          -  Patients may have received chemotherapy or wide-field radiotherapy (e.g. .30% of
             marrow-bearing bones) if completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1, or focal radiation
             completed at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1, and the patient has recovered or stabilized
             from all adverse effects of such therapy. Therapy with nitrosoureas or mitomycin C
             must be completed 6 weeks prior to Day 1. Major surgery (this does not include
             placement of vascular access device or tumor biopsies) must be completed 4 weeks prior
             to Day 1. Antineoplastic therapy with biological agents must be completed at least 2
             weeks prior to Day 1.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL, and platelet
             count ≥ 50,000/mm3

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase(AST) (serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, SGOT) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase, SGPT) ≤ 3 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Amylase and lipase levels must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) on MUGA scan or ECHO.

             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, or any other concurrent disease which, in the

             increased amylase and/or lipase will be excluded. (Note: Enrollment of patients with
             any metastatic disease to, or around, the pancreas may be allowed only with agreement
             between the Sponsor and the Investigator).
