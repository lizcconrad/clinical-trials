      The investigators will determine if the MRI can be used to determine the temperature inside
      the brain. This is an important piece of information now that cooling the brain is being used
      to decrease brain damage in infants who had a decrease in brain oxygen or flow around the
      time of birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are presently two modes of providing cooling for the infant with HIE: 1) systemic
      cooling of the entire body (Body Cooling) to 33.5°C documented by rectal temperature and 2)
      selective head cooling via an FDA approved Cool-cap device which cools the rectal temperature
      to 34.5°C by applying a continuous flow of very cold (10°C) water to the scalp. The potential
      advantage of the latter approach lies in the brain being selectively cooled relative to the
      rectal temperature. Experimental direct temperature measurements in animals have shown that
      both methods cool the brain; however, despite FDA approval and world-wide application, no one
      has ever demonstrated that the brain of a human can be cooled effectively, and it is further
      not known if the cooling is uniform. Most investigators assume the surface will be cooled to
      a greater degree than the deep brain structures, especially with selective head cooling.We
      will use a modification of the information obtained from the MRI to determine the
      distribution of temperatures within the infants brain.
