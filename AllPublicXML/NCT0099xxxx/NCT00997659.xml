  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is to investigate the nutritional supplement chromium picolinate. A large
      number of people use chromium picolinate from health food stores to improve the function of
      the hormone insulin. The investigators are testing how effective this supplement is and are
      also monitoring its safety. In patients with diabetes, chromium has been shown to increase
      sensitivity to the hormone insulin. Since obesity can cause insensitivity or resistance to
      insulin, the investigators are studying obese individuals with documented insulin resistance.
      The investigators would like to know if chromium is also effective in treating the insulin
      resistance associated with obesity.
