  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of myofascial trigger (MTP) point
      deactivation for tinnitus control in a population with tinnitus and myofascial pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blind placebo control randomized clinical trial was made to verify the efficacy of
      the treatment by deactivation of MTP, after 10 sessions, in tinnitus patients by means of
      comparison with a placebo treatment in a control group. Patients with tinnitus and frequent
      regional pain for at least 3 months in the head, neck and shoulder girdle were investigated
      in the Tinnitus Research Group of University of São Paulo Medical School. All of them
      underwent an interview with the otolaryngologist (&quot;physician researcher&quot;), an audiologist
      evaluation (&quot;blind researcher&quot;), another blind researcher evaluation for tinnitus and pain
      and a physiotherapist evaluation and randomization. Both blind researchers evaluated tinnitus
      and pain in the first, fifth and tenth session. The real treatment was made by a gradual and
      persistent digital pressure in each MTP previously diagnosed by the blind researcher (8
      possible muscles) and some home orientations that included stretch, superficial heat in each
      treated muscle and watch the correct postures during daily activities and sleeping. In the
      control group physiotherapist researcher pressed in an adjacent non-tender muscle fibers of
      the same muscle that have MTP. No other complementary orientation was done.

    <description>The deactivation of MTP will be performed always by the same physiotherapist researcher using the same technique. Afterwards, a myofascial maneuver is performed in each treated muscle. All patients of the experimental group will be advised to perform complimentary procedures at home during the 10-week period treatment in order to maintain the status of the muscle up to the next session and to avoid losing the obtained result:(1) Stretching of the treated muscles, once a day for 25 seconds each, (2)Superficial heat in each treated muscle, once a day for 20 minutes, (3) Watch the correct postures during daily activities and sleeping.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects of any gender, age and race with presence of uni or bilateral tinnitus
             for at least 3 months;

          2. Presence of pain complaint for at least 3 months in head, neck and shoulder girdle
             areas

          3. Presence of at least one myofascial trigger point (MTP) related with the patient's
             pain complaint (active MTP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pain complaint involving three or more quadrants of the body, regardless of its cause

          2. Infiltration and/or specific treatment for deactivation of MTP in the last 6 months;

          3. Use of medications or other techniques to treat tinnitus, pain or muscle disorders
             during the previous last month;

          4. Impossibility of understanding the orientation and/or giving information during MTP
             evaluation (neurological or psychiatric diseases, bilateral severe or profound hearing
             loss, etc);

          5. Absence of tinnitus perception during evaluation;

          6. Pulsatile tinnitus or myoclonus (middle ear muscles or palatal myoclonus).

          7. Tinnitus due to certain etiologies that require other specific types of treatment,
             determined according to the medical evaluation.
