  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of neurocognitive enhancement on
      cognitive abilities and related social and adaptive behaviours in individuals diagnosed with
      major depressive disorder. Subjects in this study will be randomized to receive
      Neurocognitive Enhancement Therapy (NET) or to a wait list and then NET . Secondary aims
      include examining whether the cognitive benefits are potentiated by repeated exposure during
      in-home practice with complementary exercises. Additionally, the investigators will examine
      the durability of the effects and their generalization to functional capacity and everyday
      functional performance after completion of the groups.

    <description>Neurocognitive Enhancement Therapy (NET) uses behavioural treatment strategies that are designed to improve a range of cognitive skills. NET uses strategies such as coaching, repetition, practice, teaching, group discussion, and compensation for deficits by using cognitive strengths.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female.

          2. Subjects will be between the ages of 18 and 65, which is the age range with available
             normative comparison data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a medical diagnosis that is associated with known cognitive impairments,
             such as multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, dementia, or history of
             traumatic brain injury.

          2. Subjects with a reading level below grade 6, as assessed with the Wide Range
             Achievement Test - Reading Recognition Subtest, will be excluded because of the
             likelihood of not understanding task instructions.

          3. Subjects with uncorrectable vision or hearing impairment that would preclude valid
             assessments or intervention procedures.
