    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in the U.S. Targeted therapies such as tamoxifen
      have been revolutionary in reducing tumor recurrences and mortality in early breast cancer.
      Using this successful paradigm, there has been a continued search for other targeted biologic
      therapies directed at receptors with known potential for promoting tumor growth.

      The estrogen receptor (ER) and/or the HER signaling pathways are the dominant drivers of cell
      proliferation and survival in the majority of human breast cancers. Molecular targets of
      these pathways provide the most effective therapies in appropriately selected patients.
      However, de novo and acquired resistance remain major obstacles to successful treatment, and
      understanding the molecular pathways responsible for this resistance would enable the
      discovery of new strategies to overcome it.

      The superiority of multi-drug HER2-targeted therapy over single agent therapy has been
      demonstrated in the preclinical setting using mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab,
      lapatinib, and gefitinib, represent a group of therapeutic agents that target the HER family
      by different molecular mechanisms. Used as single agents in the MCF7/HER2-18 xenograft model,
      these drugs restored or enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, tumor growth inhibition
      lasted only 2-3 months before resistance to treatments occurred. However, when gefitinib, a
      HER1 inhibitor, was added to the two-antibody (T+P) regimen to block signals from HER1
      dimers, a complete disappearance of nearly all xenograft tumors was observed; moreover, there
      was evidence of complete tumor eradication in 50% of the mice. The combination of lapatinib +
      trastuzumab was also highly effective in eradication of tumor burden, with no evidence of
      re-growth after 200 days. These xenograft models demonstrate that multi-drug HER2-targeted
      therapy more effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, thereby resulting in
      tumor regression. Furthermore, HER2 combination therapy appears to more effectively reduce
      levels of phosphorylated pAKT and MAPK, thus resulting in sustained tumor inhibition.

      Breast cancer cells have certain characteristics or traits--these traits are called
      biomarkers. There are three biomarkers that help doctors decide which treatment to give any
      given patient. These biomarkers are the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR),
      and HER2 protein. Breast cancer cells that have a large number of estrogen or progesterone
      receptors are called ER and/or PgR positive. Cancers that are ER and/or PgR positive use the
      hormones estrogen and progesterone to help them grow. Not all breast cancers are ER or PgR
      positive. Patients are being asked to take part in this study that have a special type of
      breast cancer called HER2 positive breast cancer. HER2-positive breast cancer is a breast
      cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
      (HER2). HER2 is located on the outer surface of a cancer cell. The HER2 protein sends a
      signal to the inside of the cancer cells telling it to grow and divide.

      Two medications that directly target this HER2 protein. One is called trastuzumab(Herceptin),
      and the other is called lapatinib (Tykerb). Both medications are FDA-approved for the
      treatment of women with HER2+ breast cancer. Each medication attaches to the protein so that
      it can no longer function. Once the protein stops working, the cancer cells can no longer
      make copies of themselves. This makes cancer shrink. Both drugs target HER2; however each
      drug works a little bit differently.

      Some patients respond better to Herceptin, and some patients respond better to Tykerb. Right
      now, we are not sure why some patients respond to one drug but do not respond to the other
      drug. One possibility is that in some patients, the HER2 protein finds another way to send
      its message to the inside of the cell (similar to a road detour). For example, when one path
      is &quot;closed&quot; because the drug is blocking it, the HER2 protein finds a different way to send
      its signal. We think that we can completely block the HER2 protein by giving patients both
      Tykerb and Herceptin.

      Some patients with HER positive breast cancer are also ER and/or PgR positive. Even after
      HER2 is completely blocked, these types of cancer cells can still grow by using the estrogen
      or progesterone receptor. If a patient is told they are ER and/or PgR positive, they will
      also take an anti-estrogen pill along with Tykerb and Herceptin. We think that we can stop
      cancer growth more completely by blocking both the HER2 protein and the ER/PR receptors.
