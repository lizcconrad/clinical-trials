  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Condylomata acuminata (CA) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually
      transmitted disease with half a million new cases diagnosed in the United States per year.
      Recurrence is a major challenge for CA treatment. The investigators have demonstrated that
      FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells mediate the immunosuppression in large genital warts. And
      low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), a conventional chemotherapy drug, has been reported to
      selectively deplete Treg cells in cancer patients. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized
      that low-dose CY can be used to treat genital warts. In this study, 104 CA patients have been
      recruited for clinical trial with a 1:2 randomization. Among them, 64 patients received
      low-dose cyclophosphamide and 32 received placebo. In 8 extra patients, high-dose
      cyclophosphamide was given.

      Patients were first treated with CO2 laser therapy, and then treated with low-dose CY, orally
      50 mg per day for 7 days.The CA recurrence were observed.
