    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease, which means that it cannot be cured, but the investigators can
      use inhalers and tablets to control the symptoms. In asthma, the airways become inflamed and
      irritated which can cause coughing and make the airways tighten. This 'inflammation' is the
      root of the problem in asthma. Doctors have different ways to measure the inflammation in the
      airways. One way is to measure a gas called nitric oxide (NO) on the breath. This is made by
      the lungs when asthmatic inflammation is present. The investigators have been using NO as a
      test in research labs for many years, but there are still unanswered questions about how it
      changes between morning and night and how quickly medicines work on it. In most asthmatics,
      even small doses of inhaled steroids (preventers) can reduce the NO levels to normal, but in
      some people this does not seem to happen. The investigators now have portable NO machines
      that are designed for patients to use in the home. The investigators want to follow NO
      readings in patients with high levels to measure how they respond to different doses of
      steroid inhalers. The investigators hope this will help the investigators better understand
      asthma inflammation and treatments.
