  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how many irradiated natural killer (NK) cells can be
      safely given to patients with cancer that has recurred after an autologous stem cell
      transplant, and to see what effects (good and bad) it has on the patient and their cancer.
      This research is being done because currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for
      blood-borne cancers when it has come back after an autologous stem cell transplant.

    <textblock>
      Patients with hematological malignancies such as acute leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease
      and myeloma, are generally treated initially with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination
      of both. High dose therapy and autotransplantation are often utilized in the management of
      such patients, either as part of initial therapy or for treatment of relapsed disease. When a
      patient's cancer relapses after transplantation, the prognosis is dismal. Therapeutic options
      are usually limited to palliative chemotherapy and/or local radiation, and for persons with
      excellent performance status experimental treatments are considered on an ad hoc basis.

      Much interest in the last decade has focused on the role of cellular and immunotherapy in
      this setting. Cancer vaccines and the administration of adoptive cellular and immunotherapy
      have the theoretical advantage of being non cross-reactive with previous treatments (such as
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and are currently under investigation using a variety of
      methodologies. NK cells comprise roughly 15% of all lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. They
      normally function as part of the innate immune system, which provides the body's initial
      response to infection and malignancy. However, patients with malignancies frequently have
      impaired NK cell function, as evidenced by reduced in vitro proliferative responses and
      reduced cytotoxic activity. The infusion of an irradiated NK cell line is appealing as it is
      a source of cells that can be expanded to therapeutic quantities, and retains anti-tumor
      activity.
