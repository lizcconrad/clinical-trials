  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide expanded access (compassionate use) of 3,4
      diaminopyridine to patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 patients over the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of LEMS are eligible to enroll if
      they are medically stable. They may receive 3,4 diaminopyridine in addition to other
      treatments and standard of care investigations for LEMS under supervision of the primary
      investigator. Safety laboratory studies and EKGs will be obtained.

      The study has been approved by the University of Pittsburgh IRB. There is a local Data-Safety
      Monitoring Board.

      The investigator has a hold on enrolling new subjects.
