  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether a supplement called co-enzyme Q10 can help ease or
      eliminate some of the side effects that result from taking statin medications. These side
      effects include muscle pain, fatigue or muscle cramping.

      Specific Aim 1: to demonstrate that supplementation with coQ10 in patients treated with
      statins ameliorates symptoms of muscle pain and fatigue and improves energy metabolism and
      muscle function.

      This objective will be achieved in a randomized, placebo-controlled double blind trial by
      assessing the degree of muscle symptoms and interference of pain with daily activities,
      aerobic capacity, and muscle function before and after supplementation with either coQ10 or
      placebo in groups of statin-treated subjects.

      Specific Aim 2: to examine changes at a molecular/cellular level that are associated with
      improved pain and muscle function in statin-treated subjects supplemented with coQ10.

      This aim will be addressed by analyzing muscle biopsies taken from statin-treated patients
      before and after supplementation with coQ10 or placebo.
