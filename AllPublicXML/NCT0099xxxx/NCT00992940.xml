  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awake craniotomy for removal of brain tumour is performed because the tumour may be located
      close to areas of the brain that control specific functions such as movement or speech. Local
      anaesthesia (freezing) and sedation are required to make the patient comfortable and free of
      pain, but also to be able to cooperate for testing of brain function (speaking, moving) in
      order to preserve these areas while removing the brain tumour. The patient will be
      administered routine anesthetic drugs (sedatives (propofol) and pain killers (remifentanil)).
      The amount of sedation and analgesia (pain killer) is individually tailored to each patient
      as each person has different requirements. The usual way to give these medications is by the
      anesthesiologist assessing pain level, watching the patient and monitoring blood pressure and
      heart rate. Another way to give this medication is now available. This is with a special
      device, known as a patient-controlled analgesia pump (PCA). This device allows the patient to
      push a button to give pain medicine through an intravenous line and is frequently used for
      pain treatment after surgery and for other types of procedures. This device may be helpful
      during awake craniotomy, as it would allow patient-controlled administration of pain medicine
      and relaxing medicine whenever required. The amount of medication can be increased by more
      presses of the pump. At all times during the operation, the anesthesiologist will monitor the
      patient.
