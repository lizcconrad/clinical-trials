  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous cultured adipocytes (ANTG-adip) is produced by well-established techniques
      including cell harvesting from lipoaspirates, expansion of adipose tissue derived stem cells,
      and differentiation into pure and immature adipocytes. This was an open-label,
      dose-escalation study. Patients are given subcutaneous injection of ANTG-adip and followed
      for 12 weeks according to the clinical trial protocol.
