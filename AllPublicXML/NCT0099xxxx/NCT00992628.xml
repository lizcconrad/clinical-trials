  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing surgery or intensive care management often require a tube to be inserted
      into the trachea allowing lung ventilation. Usually a laryngoscope is used to allow
      visualisation of the larynx and facilitate intubation.

      During direct laryngoscopy, the blade of the laryngoscope is inserted into the patient's
      mouth and the structures pulled upwards out of the line of vision. If visualisation is
      difficult, users often exert excess force on the tissues to obtain an adequate view.
      Generally the applied force is evaluated by the patient's stress response such as increased
      heart rate, blood pressure or plasma cortisol levels. These changes, while important, may be
      confounded by a variety of patient factors, as well as anaesthesia. An increased force may
      also be associated with tissue trauma, dental damage, and prolonged attempts.

      The investigators' objective is to compare the force exerted on patient's tissues by the
      Macintosh laryngoscope and GlideScope video-laryngoscope. Video-laryngoscopes may be
      associated with the application of reduced force to the soft tissues of patients during
      intubation. While this is a common contention, it has not been proven. The GlideScope has a
      micro camera in the distal portion of the blade meaning a direct line of vision is not
      required. An adequate view can therefore be obtained with less displacement of tongue tissue.
      If the force exerted by the video laryngoscope is less, this would have beneficial
      implications by reducing stress response, neck movement, and trauma.
