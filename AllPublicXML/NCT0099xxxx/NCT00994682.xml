  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and Type 2 diabetes are creating a silent epidemic, Non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease, which is a chronic liver disease associated with insulin resistance, impaired
      glucose intolerance, and hepatic fat accumulation. The thiazolidinedione pioglitazone
      improves glucose/lipid metabolism and histology in NASH by improving insulin resistance in
      the liver/peripheral/adipose tissues and reducing subclinical inflammation. The aim of this
      study is to assess the underlying mechanisms at the clinical and molecular level and the
      long-term efficacy and safety of pioglitazone in NASH in a multiethnic cohort of subjects
      (predominantly Hispanics, Caucasians and African-Americans - the most common ethnic groups
      locally) and examine the response including patients with normal glucose tolerance, impaired
      glucose tolerance or established type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

    <textblock>
      NASH is a disease characterized by elevated plasma aminotransferases and histopathological
      changes in liver characterized by hepatocellular steatosis, chronic inflammation and
      perisinusoidal fibrosis. NASH affects (~30-40%) of obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. While
      the pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, there is consensus that insulin resistance and
      its associated abnormalities in lipid metabolism play a key role in the development of liver
      fat accumulation. Insulin resistance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is frequently associated
      with chronic hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and an excessive supply of plasma free fatty
      acids to the liver. This in turn promotes hepatic lipogenesis. Pioglitazone, a
      thiazolidinedione (TZD), reverses these abnormalities by ameliorating insulin resistance in
      adipose tissue, liver and muscle. TZDs decrease excessive ectopic triglyceride accumulation
      in liver and muscle, reduce visceral fat, and redistribute fat to subcutaneous adipose
      stores. We have shown in a proof-of-concept 6-month study that pioglitazone is safe and
      effective for the treatment of T2DM. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are also
      characterized by a low plasma adiponectin level. Thiazolidinediones increase plasma
      adiponectin levels, may activate AMP-activated protein kinase, stimulate hepatic/muscle fatty
      acid oxidation, and inhibit hepatic fatty acid synthesis in NASH nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis. Thiazolidinediones also have antiinflammatory effects which are believed to
      be of value for therapy for NASH.

      In order to evaluate this hypothesis, the investigators will treat for up to 36 months a
      group of patients with impaired (IGT) glucose tolerance and T2DM patients recruited from the
      University Hospital and medical school clinics and by newspaper add targeting the San Antonio
      and South Texas geographical area, with pioglitazone in a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint will be liver histologic response assessed by
      liver biopsy performed at 18 and at 36 months of treatment.

             tamoxifen, raloxifene, oral glucocorticoids or chloroquine will be excluded.

          9. Patients with a history of clinically significant heart disease (New York Heart
             Classification greater than grade II), peripheral vascular disease (history of
             claudication), or diagnosed pulmonary disease (dyspnea on exertion of one flight or

Participants were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500– kcal/d deficit from the calculated weight maintaining diet) and received pioglitazone 30mg/d (titrated after 2 months to 45 mg/d).</description>

          <description>Participants were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500– kcal/d deficit from the calculated weight maintaining diet) and received placebo pills with identical physical characteristics and in identical bottles to pioglitazone pills. After 18 months of treatment, metabolic measurements (OGTT and euglycemic insulin clamp), DXA, 1H-MRS, and liver biopsy were repeated, at which point the medication code was disclosed to investigators and patients. Patients whose NASH resolved after 18 months were instructed to discontinue the study because pioglitazone treatment or a repeated liver biopsy were considered unethical and were not indicated, whereas those with persistent disease were invited to start open-label pioglitazone therapy, titrated as described for the other arm.</description>

        <description>Number of patients with reduction of at least 2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) (with reduction in at least 2 different histological categories) without worsening of fibrosis. NAS is the sum of the separate scores for steatosis (0–3), hepatocellular ballooning (0–2) and lobular inflammation (0–3), and ranges from 0-8 .
The scoring system is based on the following grading:
Steatosis: 0 = &lt;5%; 1 = 5-33%; 2 = &gt;33-66%; 3 = &gt;66%. Lobular Inflammation: 0 = No foci 1 = &lt;2 foci/200x; 2 = 2-4 foci/200x, 3 = &gt;4 foci/200x.

            <description>Participants were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500– kcal/d deficit from the calculated weight maintaining diet) and received placebo pills with identical physical characteristics and in identical bottles to pioglitazone pills. After 18 months of treatment, metabolic measurements (OGTT and euglycemic insulin clamp), DXA, 1H-MRS, and liver biopsy were repeated, at which point the medication code was disclosed to investigators and patients. Patients whose NASH resolved after 18 months were instructed to discontinue the study because pioglitazone treatment or a repeated liver biopsy were considered unethical and were not indicated, whereas those with persistent disease were invited to start open-label pioglitazone therapy, titrated as described for the other arm.</description>

Steatosis: 0 = &lt;5%; 1 = 5-33%; 2 = &gt;33-66%; 3 = &gt;66%. Lobular Inflammation: 0 = No foci 1 = &lt;2 foci/200x; 2 = 2-4 foci/200x, 3 = &gt;4 foci/200x. Hepatocyte Ballooning: 0 = None; 1 = Few balloon cells; 2 = Many cells/prominent ballooning. Fibrosis: 0 = None; 1 = Perisinusoidal or periportal; 2 = Perisinusoidal and portal/periportal; 3 = Bridging fibrosis, 4 = Cirrhosis.</description>

            <description>Participants were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500– kcal/d deficit from the calculated weight maintaining diet) and received placebo pills with identical physical characteristics and in identical bottles to pioglitazone pills. After 18 months of treatment, metabolic measurements (OGTT and euglycemic insulin clamp), DXA, 1H-MRS, and liver biopsy were repeated, at which point the medication code was disclosed to investigators and patients. Patients whose NASH resolved after 18 months were instructed to discontinue the study because pioglitazone treatment or a repeated liver biopsy were considered unethical and were not indicated, whereas those with persistent disease were invited to start open-label pioglitazone therapy, titrated as described for the other arm.</description>

          <description>After being randomized to placebo for the first 18 months, patients whose NASH resolved after 18 months were instructed to discontinue the study because pioglitazone treatment or a repeated liver biopsy were considered unethical and were not indicated, whereas those with persistent disease were invited to start open-label pioglitazone therapy, titrated as described for the other arm.</description>

          <description>After 18 months of treatment, metabolic measurements (OGTT and euglycemic insulin clamp), DXA, 1H-MRS, and liver biopsy were repeated, at which point the medication code was disclosed to investigators and patients. Patients initially assigned to pioglitazone were asked to continue at the same dose.</description>
