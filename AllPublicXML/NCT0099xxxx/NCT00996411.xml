  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is characterizing the subject-rated and behavioral effects of salvinorin A in
      healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesize the salvinorin A will have
      hallucinogen-like effects.

          -  Have used hallucinogens (e.g., LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, Salvia divinorum) including
             having used Salvia divinorum or salvinorin A by the inhalation route (i.e., volunteers
             without histories of Salvia divinorum or salvinorin A use by the inhalation route will
             be excluded)

          -  Be 21 to 65 years old

          -  Agree to consume approximately the same amount of caffeine-containing beverage (e.g.,

             unit on the mornings of drug session days. If the volunteer does not routinely consume
             caffeinated beverages, he or she must agree not to do so on session days.

          -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages,

             include daily use of caffeine.

          -  Be healthy as determined by screening for medical problems via a personal interview, a
             medical questionnaire, a physical examination, an electrocarroutine medical blood and
             urinalysis laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General Medical Exclusion Criteria

          -  Cardiovascular conditions: uncontrolled hypertension, angina, a clinically significant
             ECG abnormality (e.g. atrial fibrillation), TIA in the last 6 months stroke,

          -  Epilepsy with history of seizures

          -  Diabetes mellitus

          -  Females who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or nursing, or are not practicing

          -  Currently taking psychoactive prescription medication on a regular basis

          -  More than 20% outside the upper or lower range of ideal body weight according to
             Metropolitan Life height and weight table

        Psychiatric Exclusion Criteria

          -  Current or past history of meeting DSM-IV criteria for Schizophrenia, Psychotic
             Disorder (unless substance-induced or due to a medical condition), or Bipolar I or II
             Disorder.

          -  Current severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, or Panic Disorder.

          -  Current or past history within the last 5 years of meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol
