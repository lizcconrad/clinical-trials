    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) in
      controlling diabetes in subjects with mild obesity (BMI 26-35). The primary endpoint will be
      the reduction of HbA1c (&lt; 7%), a standard measure of diabetes control; the secondary
      endpoints will be changes blood sugar , vitamin levels, insulin, c-peptide, and lipids
      levels, as well as retinal eye examinations, urinalysis to assess kidney function, carotid
      ultrasound as a marker of cardiovascular function, and alterations in diabetic medications.
      Fifty subjects with medically documented type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with BMIs between 26
      and 35 will undergo standard laparoscopic RYGB. Prior and after surgery, the subjects will
      undergo a clinical evaluation in regard to the primary and secondary endpoints listed. The
      pre-surgery evaluation is directed toward establishing the existence of diabetes related
      complications prior to surgery. After surgery subjects will be closely monitored for
      complications and required changes in their diabetes management. Repeat assessments will be
      made at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and at two years.

      The primary endpoint will be the reduction of HbA1c and secondary endpoints will be multiple
      associated parameters as listed below. A group of 50 subjects with medically documented T2DM
      and BMI of 26-35 will undergo standard laparoscopic RYGB. Prior to surgery, the subjects will
      undergo the standard pre-operative work up required for conventional bariatric surgery. This
      includes full history and physical exam, medical/cardiac clearances as needed, nutrition
      consultation and a gastrointestinal consultation for upper endoscopy. After thorough
      explanation an approved informed consent will be signed. Baseline parameters, as listed
      below, will be measured for each subject to identify possible complications of diabetes prior
      to the surgical intervention..

      After surgery perioperative complications will be monitored and required modifications of
      diabetes management advised. Followed up measurements at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months is
      consistent with standard clinical practice guidelines. Data analysis will be ongoing to
      observe the effects of the surgical intervention on glucose homeostasis.

    <description>The operation is performed under general anesthesia. It is done laparoscopically, meaning that several small openings are made in the abdomen for insertion of long, thin surgical instruments, one with an attached camera. The operation is video monitored. The top of the stomach is divided across, leaving a small pouch for food. The rest of the stomach remains but can receive no food. The gut is divided just past the stomach, and it is attached to the small stomach pouch so that food can get back into the bowel. A second connection is made so that the bile and digestive juices pass into the bowel with the food.</description>
