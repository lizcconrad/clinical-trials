  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnourished children and babies with birth weights under 2500 grams are at high risk for
      negative outcomes over their lifespan. Philani, a paraprofessional home-visiting program, was
      mounted in neighborhoods in three townships in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2002 to 2004 to
      improve nutritional outcomes.

      One mentor mother was recruited from each of 37 neighborhoods. Mentor mothers were trained to
      conduct home visits to weigh children and to support mothers to problem-solve life
      challenges, especially around nutrition. Households were randomly assigned on a 2-to-1 ratio
      to the Philani program or to a standard care condition. Children were evaluated over a 1-year
      period.

      The investigators hypothesized that children in the intervention would gain more weight than
      children in the control.

    <description>Behavioral intervention was offered through mentor mothers. Mentors were mothers in community who were selected by because they were doing well. They were trained to conduct home visits, up to 16 times over one year period, ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours. Mentor mothers worked to improve health of mother and their child and build social support in neighborhood.</description>
