    <textblock>
      Alcohol has well-established consequences in the lung including increased risk for upper
      respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There
      have even been a few reports of alcohol-induced asthma. Data from the investigators'
      laboratory have established that the airways are specifically impacted by alcohol exposure.
      Because the airways are heavily exposed to the vapor phase of alcohol during drinking and
      airway motor tone is modulated by cAMP, the investigators speculated that airway bronchial
      motor function would be altered in mice fed alcohol. The investigators' preliminary studies
      demonstrate that brief alcohol administration significantly attenuates airway
      hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a mouse model. This novel finding has led us to hypothesize
      that:

      Alcohol exposure modifies airway hyperresponsiveness through a cAMP/NO- dependent mechanism.
