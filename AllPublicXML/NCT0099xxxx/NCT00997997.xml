    <textblock>
      This international, prospective, non-interventional, non-controlled observational study
      obtains data on efficacy, safety and tolerability of Avelox treatment under daily-life
      treatment conditions. Specifically investigated are the improvement of clinical symptoms and
      the duration until infection improvement and cure.Any patient with a diagnosis of complicated
      skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) treated with Avelox can be documented. The
      observation period for each subject covers the treatment period with Avelox. For each
      patient, the physician documents data at an initial visit and one or two follow-up visit(s)
      in line with routine practice.
