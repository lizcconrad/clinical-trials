  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and best dose of a regimen
      including bevacizumab and erlotinib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone. In
      addition, the investigators wish to evaluate how well these drugs might work against this
      disease. Bevacizumab and erlotinib are novel drugs that attack the blood vessels supplying
      the tumor cells and attack a receptor on the tumor cells, respectively. This study has two
      parts. In the first part of the study, eighteen patients will be enrolled. Patients will
      receive escalating doses of docetaxel in combination with standard doses of bevacizumab and
      erlotinib until the safest dose is determined. An additional 37 patients will enter into the
      second part of the study and all will receive the safest dose. In this part of the study, the
      effectiveness of this regimen against hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) will be
      monitored by evaluating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and objective response of the tumor.

      In this Phase I/Phase II study, the primary objectives are to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose of docetaxel, erlotinib, bevacizumab, and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone
      refractory prostate cancer and to determine the efficacy of this regimen for treatment of
      metastatic HRPC. In the phase I portion of the study, eligible patients will be enrolled and
      treated using a &quot;3+3&quot; design. Docetaxel will be started at 55 mg/m2 every cycle (21 days) and
      dose escalated by 10 mg/m2 at each cohort level. The dose of bevacizumab will be held
      constant at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and erlotinib will be provided at 200 mg PO daily from
      days 216 as described in previous safety studies. All patients will receive prednisone 5 mg
      PO bid. Eighteen patients will be treated in the phase I portion. The phase II dose for this
      combined treatment will be defined as either the highest dosage cohort in which 6 patients
      are treated and there are less than 3 DLTs; or the combination of docetaxel, erlotinib, and
      bevacizumab at the cohort 3 dose level, whichever is the lower dose. Another 37 patients will
      be enrolled for the phase II study. All patients will receive the phase II recommended dose
      as determined by the phase I portion of the study.

             active serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.
