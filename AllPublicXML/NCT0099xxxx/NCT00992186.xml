  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the study drug
      carlumab in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (cancer of the
      gland that makes fluid that aids movement of sperm).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter trial
      (conducted in more than one center) in participants with metastatic castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer. The trial consists of 3 phases: screening period, treatment period of
      approximately 4 months, and a follow-up period (Week 1, 4, 8 and 12 after the last dose) of
      up to 12 weeks after the administration of last dose. The participants will receive carlumab
      at the dose of 15 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) by intravenous (into a vein) infusion (a fluid
      or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) at a constant rate over a 90 minute
      period once every 2 weeks until disease progression. Efficacy of the participants will be
      primarily evaluated by composite response. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Composite Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks before first dose, every 12 weeks after first dose, Week 12 after last dose of carlumab</time_frame>
    <description>The composite response is measured by change from Baseline in skeletal lesions, extra-skeletal lesions, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) values. A participant is considered to have composite response, if 1 of the following responses occurs after the first dose of carlumab: (1) Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST), (2) PSA response at 12 weeks and absence of skeletal and extra-skeletal progression or (3) Stable disease at 24 weeks defined as the absence of PSA, skeletal, or extra-skeletal progression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks before first dose, every 12 weeks after first dose, Week 12 after last dose of carlumab</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response based on assessment of confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study for at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks before first dose, every 12 weeks after first dose, Week 12 after last dose of carlumab</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS is defined as the time from the date of initiation of study treatment to the date of initial documented skeletal or extra-skeletal progressive disease, or date of death, whichever occurs first. A participant is considered to have extra-skeletal disease progression if the disease has progressed as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria. A participant is considered to have skeletal disease progression if they have 1 post-baseline bone scan demonstrating 2 or more new skeletal lesions compared to Baseline and confirmed by a second bone scan 6 to 12 weeks later or with evidence of clinical progression.</description>

    <description>The OS is defined as the time from the date of initiation of study treatment to death due to any cause. Participants were followed for 1 year after the last administration of carlumab for survival or until the end of study, whichever occurs first. For participants with unknown survival status as of the data cutoff date, OS was censored at the last date that the participant was known to be alive.</description>

    <description>Urinary NTx response for participants with elevated NTx level at Baseline (more than or equal to 50 nanomole per millimole (nmol/mmol)) is defined as a 30% reduction from Baseline NTx value, confirmed by a second NTx value 3 or more weeks later.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks before first dose, every 4 weeks after first dose, Week 4 after last dose of carlumab</time_frame>
    <description>Pain response is defined as 2-point decrease from Baseline in 'worst pain' intensity score (item 3) on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. The BPI is a nine-item questionnaire with 0 to 10 numeric rating scales in response to each item, where 0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study for at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>

        <description>Pain response is defined as 2-point decrease from Baseline in ‘worst pain’ intensity score (item 3) on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. The BPI is a nine-item questionnaire with 0 to 10 numeric rating scales in response to each item, where 0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

        <description>A worsening in ECOG performance status score was defined as greater than or equal to 1-point increase from Baseline.
