        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age at diagnosis equal or under 55 year

          -  Meeting the Durie and Salmon criteria for initial diagnosis of MM

          -  Stage II or III MM at diagnosis or anytime thereafter

          -  Symptomatic MM requiring treatment at diagnosis or anytime thereafter

          -  If receiving chemotherapy-based mobilization regimens, must be able to receive
             high-dose melphalan between 2 and 8 weeks after the initiation of mobilization therapy
             whether delivered at the transplant center or at a referring center

          -  Adequate organ function as measured by:

               -  Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest greater than 40%

               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 2 times the upper limit of normal and ALT and AST
                  less than 3 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Renal: Creatinine clearance greater than 40 ml/min (measured or
                  calculated/estimated)

               -  Pulmonary: DLCO, FEV1, and FVC greater than 50% of predicted value (corrected for
                  hemoglobin), or O2 saturation greater than 92% of room air

          -  An adequate autologous graft defined as a cryopreserved PBSC graft containing at least
             4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg patient weight; if prior to enrollment it is known that a
             patient will be on the auto-allo arm (i.e., a consenting, eligible HLA-matched sibling
             donor is available), the required autograft must contain at least 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+
             cells/kg patient weight; the graft may not be CD34+ selected or otherwise manipulated
             to remove tumor or other cells; the graft can be collected at the transplanting
             institution or by a referring center; for patients without an HLA-matched sibling
             donor, the autograft must be stored so that there are two products each containing at
             least 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg patient weight

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Never advanced beyond Stage I MM since diagnosis

          -  Non-secretory MM (absence of a monoclonal protein [M protein] in serum as measured by
             electrophoresis and immunofixation and the absence of Bence Jones protein in the urine
             defined by use of conventional electrophoresis and immunofixation techniques)

          -  Plasma cell leukemia

          -  Karnofsky performance score less than 70%, unless approved by the Medical Monitor or
             one of the Protocol Chairs

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections (currently taking medication and
             progression of clinical symptoms)

          -  Prior malignancies except resected basal cell carcinoma or treated cervical carcinoma
             in situ; cancer treated with curative intent less than 5 years previously will not be
             allowed unless approved by the Medical Monitor or one of the Protocol Chairs; cancer
             treated with curative intent more than 5 years previously will be allowed

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months following treatment

          -  Prior allograft or prior autograft

          -  Received mid-intensity melphalan (more than 50 mg IV) as part of prior therapy

          -  Prior organ transplant requiring immunosuppressive therapy
