    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Extension Phase of the COMPASS-HF study is to continue to observe the
      safety of the Chronicle® Implantable Hemodynamic Monitor (IHM) system and Chronicle ICD
      system and provide study doctors continued access to the heart pressure information recorded
      by the Chronicle devices which may be used to help manage heart failure. The Extension Phase
      of the COMPASS-HF study is limited to people who have already received the investigational
      system and are currently enrolled in a Chronicle IHM or ICD study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose of the Extension Phase, the Chronicle IHM and ICD systems are for continued
      use in patients with moderate to severe heart failure and are intended to monitor hemodynamic
      information, including right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures, heart rate and
      activity. The COMPASS-HF Extension Phase includes the following Chronicle IHM studies:

        -  The Chronicle IHM Phase I/II study, which was a 148 patient technology assessment study
           that began enrolling patients in 1998 and completed the endpoint driven follow up period
           of 3 months for safety and 12 months for efficacy in 2002

        -  The Chronicle Offers Management to Patients with Advanced Signs &amp; Symptoms of Heart
           Failure (COMPASS-HF) study, which was a 274 patient randomized study that began
           enrolling patients in 2003 and completed the endpoint driven follow up period of 6
           months in 2005

        -  The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Pilot (PAH Pilot) study, which was a 24 patient
           pilot study that began enrolling patients in 2003 and completed the endpoint driven
           follow up period of 12 weeks in 2006

        -  The Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing intraCardiac Pressures in Patients with
           Chronic HF (REDUCEhf) study, which was a 400 patient randomized study that began
           enrolling patients in 2006 and completed endpoint driven follow up period of 12 months
           in 2010.

      In all four studies, patients were implanted with a Chronicle IHM or ICD system and upon
      completion of the endpoint driven follow up period, entered long term follow up and have
      continued to be seen every six months for study visits.

      As the Chronicle IHM or ICD system has not received U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      approval, the COMPASS-HF Extension Phase is being initiated as a means to allow continued
      access of Chronicle IHM data to study investigators in one concurrently enrolled study and
      follow up schedule. No additional study objectives or new enrollments will be captured in the
      COMPASS-HF Extension Phase.
