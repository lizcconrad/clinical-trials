      The primary purpose of this study is to assess changes in shoulder muscle strength, shoulder
      movement, shoulder flexibility, muscle thickness, upper arm torsion angle, and subacromial
      width (space where the rotator cuff muscle passes through) after completing a 6-week shoulder
      strengthening and stretching program in division I collegiate swimmers. The result of this
      study may demonstrate the effectiveness of a strengthening and stretching program to
      positively influence factors that have been associated with pain and injury in division I
      collegiate swimmers and indicate the need to implement this program for the entire team.
      Following a 6-week strengthening and stretching program, it is believed that scapular
      kinematics, shoulder flexibility, and shoulder and scapular stabilizer strength will be
      improved compared to control subjects.

    <description>The shoulder strengthening program is a 6-week intervention aimed to improve shoulder and scapular stabilizer strength and scapular kinematics. The program includes 10 exercises: shoulder flexion, Ys,Ts,Ws, Throwing Acceleration, Throwing Deceleration, Low Rows, Dynamic Hug, IR @ 90, and ER @ 90. The program also includes 2 stretches: sleeper stretch and corner stretch.</description>

    <description>The intervention program is a 6 week shoulder and scapular stabilizer strengthening program that is performed 3 times per week. The program includes 10 exercises that are performed with Theraband rubber tubing and 2 stretches. The exercises are: shoulder flexion, Ys, Ts, Ws, IR @ 90, ER @ 90, Throwing acceleration, Throwing deceleration, dynamic hug, and low rows. The stretches include the sleeper stretch and the corner stretch.</description>
