      This study aims to identify and quantify the factors associated with excess weight gain
      following treatment for breast cancer. It is believed that breast cancer patients gain more
      than 4% of their weight at diagnosis which is likely accompanied by an increase in body fat
      and waist circumference. It is further thought that this excess weight and increase in body
      fat and waist circumference are associated to tumour characteristics, chemotherapy, menopause
      status at diagnosis and the presence of genes related to obesity. It is also thought that
      women treated with chemotherapy have higher levels of glucose and insulin.
