  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, we want to evaluate the prophylactic use of ibuprofen versus a placebo
      for medical abortion by mifepristone and misoprostol, at a gestational age of up to 7 weeks,
      in regard to the effect on pain relief and the overall procedure success.

      expected results:

      The prophylactic use of NSAIDs could offer significant pain relief and thereby a reduction in
      the need for additional pain relievers compared to the placebo, without interfering with the
      outcome of medical abortion

    <description>the group will receive 2 tablets of ibuprofen 400 mg at the time of misoprostol administration.

    <description>The most common side effect observed during medical abortion using mifepristone together with misoprostol is abdominal pain. The use of ibuprofen was not shown to interfere with the action of misoprostol to induce uterine contractions and pregnancy expulsion.</description>
