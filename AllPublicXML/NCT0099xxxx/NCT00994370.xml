    <textblock>
      This study is being done to investigate the influence of giving radiation to the liver on
      tumors involving the liver. Investigator is specifically looking at this effect on the blood
      vessels within the tumor. This effect will be measured by studying substances in the blood
      that the tumors produce and that cause blood vessels to grow. The effects seen on these
      substances may help design other treatments to improve the results of the radiation used to
      treat these tumors.

      Subjects are invited to participate in this study that have undergone a procedure as their
      standard of care. This procedure is known as Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), a
      procedure designed for the treatment of cancer in the liver. This includes cancer that has
      started in the liver as well as cancer that has spread to the liver. The purpose of the study
      is to collect blood samples to assess for &quot;biological markers,&quot; or substances within the
      blood that may promote cancer growth by causing new blood vessels to form. This study will
      also use a new method of analyzing medical imaging (CT scan, PET scan) to try and better
      understand how cancer in the liver forms new blood vessels. SIRT is standard therapy and not
      part of this study. This study involves blood draws only.

    <description>Patients referred for SIRT will be considered for this investigation. These patients will predominantly have stage IV colorectal metastases with liver dominant metastases or hepatocellular carcinoma. A team of oncologists, interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists and oncologic surgeons will determine that the patients are not candidates for surgical resection or ablative therapy. The patients will then be screened to confirm the patient's eligibility to receive standard of care SIRT treatment. SIRT treatment and imaging studies included in this investigation are standard of care for the patients' liver dominant disease.</description>

      Whole blood will be obtained at intervals based on standard of care blood draws. Each sample
