      Standard care of care and up to twelve (12) weekly debridements. Subjects randomized into the
      weekly debridement group will receive up to twelve (12) debridement during the twelve (12)
      weeks of the study. There will be two (2) subject groups in the study. Subjects will be
      randomized into either the monthly debridement group or the weekly debridement group.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate subjects enrolled and randomized to the
      weekly sharp debridement group.

      The major secondary objectives are incidence of complete wound closure at Week 12, rate of
      healing, ulcer recurrence, wound characteristics, and microbiologic information.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have evidence of a full-thickness cutaneous wound of at least 30 days
             duration.

          2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          3. Subject must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 1 year to be determined by the
             Investigator.

          4. The study ulcer must be from 1 cm2 to 20 cm2 in size.

          5. The study ulcer must have been present for at least 30 days at study Day -7.

          6. The subject's Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) must be equal to or less than 10.0% for
             subjects with diagnosed diabetes at study Day 0.

          7. The subject, legal guardian or authorized representative must have understood, signed
             and dated the IRB approved informed consent form.

          8. The subject must be available for evaluation on a weekly basis for the twelve (12)
             weeks of the study. Visits at Week 13 and Week 14 are required for initial wound
             healing, which is achieved in study Week 11 or 12. The Investigator will evaluate both
             groups at Week 16. Subjects must be available for evaluation at Week 16.

          9. The subject's TCpO2 must be equal to or greater than 25 mm of mercury in the periwound
             area and ABI greater than 0.7.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject whose ulcer has healed 30% or greater from the evaluation Study day -7 to the
             post-debridement Study Day 0 as determined by wound measurements using ARANZ
             Silhouette

          2. A history of alcohol or substance abuse, within the previous year, which could, or in
             the judgment of the Investigator, would interfere with study compliance or protocol
             requirements.

          3. Participation in clinical trials evaluating investigational pharmaceuticals, biologics
             or devices within 30 days of admission to the study.

          4. Subject with a history of receiving any of the following within the last 30 days:
             systemic corticosteroids exceeding a total daily dose of 20mg, immunosuppressive
             agents, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Anticipated use of the above during the
             study period will also exclude a subject from entry into the study. Topical and
             inhaled corticosteroids are not prohibited.

          5. Subjects with medical comorbidities known to affect wound healing such as end stage
             renal disease, severe hepatic insufficiency, vasculitis, and HIV will be excluded from
             this study
