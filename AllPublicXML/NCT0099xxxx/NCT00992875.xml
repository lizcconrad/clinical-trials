  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training in mindfulness, the non-judgmental observation of experiences as they arise in the
      present moment, has been increasingly and successfully applied to the treatment of normative
      stress conditions and mental disorders. Yet, the neurological mechanisms that underlie the
      reported improvements are still largely unknown. This longitudinal study will investigate the
      influence of mindfulness training on a key underpinning of mental health, namely emotion
      regulation, and its associated brain activity. Healthy participants will be randomly assigned
      to either a validated eight week Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program or to a
      control condition. In a pre-post investigation, participants' subjective reactions to
      aversive emotional stimuli (affective facial expressions) will be assessed, as will the
      associated brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
      investigators hypothesize that after the training the MBSR participants will rate the
      pictures as less aversive compared to control participants. Furthermore, the MBSR
      participants will show a patter of brain activation indicative of improved emotion
      regulation, relative to control participants. Finally, the effect of MBSR on the gray matter
      structure of the brain will be investigated.
