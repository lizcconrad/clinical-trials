      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of Real-time Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring on severe complications to pregnancy in women with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy outcome in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes is still significantly poorer than
      in the background population. The prevalence of large fat babies (LGA) is 50% in both types
      of diabetes, and perinatal death and preterm delivery is 4-7 times higher than in
      non-diabetic women. These complications are all closely related to non-optimal glycemic
      control in pregnancy, and improved metabolic control is crucial in our strive for improved
      pregnancy outcome in these patients.

      In 2007, a new generation of &quot;real-time&quot; Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) became available
      in Denmark. These sensors estimate tissue glucose values automatically and frequently with
      immediate display of the glucose level. In addition it is possible to set alarms for high and
      low glucose levels, and the patient can react immediately with changes in diet or insulin
      dose.

      In this trial, 154 patients were randomized to either continuous glucose monitoring at five
      times in pregnancy in addition to standard care ot to unchanged standard care. The main aim
      is to evaluate if the use of CGM in pregnancy can reduce the prevalence of LGA from 50 to
      30%, but other outcome measurements such as preterm delivery, neonatal disease, hypoglycemia,
      low grade inflammation and vascular dysfunction, quality of life and self- care are also
      recorded.
