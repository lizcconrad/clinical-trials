  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and relapse rate of low dose, short
      duration treatment with tamoxifen in benign breast disease amenable to hormonal therapy with
      respect to etiology and estrogen receptor status and to realize its side-effects and cost of
      therapy.

      To do a comparative analysis of the results with evening primrose oil which is one of the
      first line management in benign breast disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign breast disease is frequently encountered in female patients, a significant proportion
      of who are premenopausal women. Established methods of treatment do not yield significant
      results. This is not only a social burden but also entails high economic cost. As such the
      quality of life of these patients is a matter of concern for both the patients and their
      families and to attending physicians. Reported effects of tamoxifen on benign breast disease
      in premenopausal non high risk patients are scarce. Moreover published data has not yet
      revealed association of estrogen receptors in different benign breast lesions.The variability
      of response and its relation with estrogen receptor status is still a field of active
      investigation.

    <measure>Number of Participants Analysed for Reduction in Lump Size ( 60% Reduction in Lump Size Considered to be a Satisfactory Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasonography of the breast was used to ascertain the lump size at the beginning of therapy and a repeat Ultrasonography of breast was done after 3 months at the end of the proposed therapy to record the posttreatment lump size by the same operator. The difference between the two findings were recorded and noted and a 60% or more reduction in the size of the lump was considered as a satisfactory response.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Analysed for Reduction in Mastalgia (Cardiff Breast Pain Score).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients were categorized as Grade 0 for no pain, grade 1 for mild pain, grade 2 for moderate pain, Grade 3 for severe pain. Therapeutic response to mastalgia was expressed in terms of Cardiff Breast Pain Score (CBS) where CBS I = excellent response with no pain, CBS II = substantial response, CBS III = poor response and CBS IV = no response</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Analysed for Response of Cyclical Mastalgia (Good Response Was Defined as Disappearance of Mastalgia)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients who had an increase in breast pain in the &quot;perimenstrual period&quot; were designated as having cyclical mastalgia. Response was assessed following treatment in terms of either persistence of cyclical mastalgia after 3 months of treatment or disappearance of cyclical mastalgia</description>

        <description>Ultrasonography of the breast was used to ascertain the lump size at the beginning of therapy and a repeat Ultrasonography of breast was done after 3 months at the end of the proposed therapy to record the posttreatment lump size by the same operator. The difference between the two findings were recorded and noted and a 60% or more reduction in the size of the lump was considered as a satisfactory response.</description>

        <population>102(out of 127) patients receiving Tamoxifen and 99(out of 129) receiving Evening Primrose Oil were assessed for reduction in lump size. The remaining patients had mastalgia with no lump, hence were excluded from this assessment. A 60% or more reduction in lump size after completion of the therapy was considered as a satisfactory response.</population>
