  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single arm trial of two doses of 18 mCi/kg of Ultratrace iobenguane I
      131 administered to subjects with high-risk neuroblastoma. Iobenguane I 131 is a drug that
      has already been used in many children to treat neuroblastoma, and it is known to shrink some
      of the tumors, and cause manageable side effects. When administered intravenously, Iobenguane
      I 131 accumulates in the neuroblastoma cancer cells and causes them to die.

      In this study the investigators are investigating the use of a new form of Iobenguane I 131
      called Ultratrace iobenguane I 131. This form is expected to deliver higher amounts of
      radioactive I 131 to the neuroblastoma cells. The primary purpose of the study is to
      determine if Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 can be used to successfully treat high-risk
      neuroblastoma. The study will also assess the safety of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 when
      given to patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

    <description>Subjects will receive an Imaging Dose of 0.1 mCi/kg [3.7 MBq/kg] (a minimum dose of 1.0 mCi [37 MBq] but not to exceed 5.0 mCi [185 MBq]) of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 to have dosimetry performed and to confirm tumor uptake of the test article prior to receiving each of 2 planned Therapeutic Doses of Ultratrace iobeneguane I 131 . Within 28 days of screening, eligible subjects (as confirmed by the first Imaging dose study)will receive an Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 Therapeutic dose of of 15.0 - 18.0 mCi/kg (max. 666 MBq/kg) followed by imaging 7 days later or upon discharge from radiation isolation. A second Therapeutic Dose (preceded by a repeat Image Dose and dosimetry study)and imaging upon discharge from radiation isolation will be repeated approximately 8 weeks after the first dose.</description>

                  disease (only) is not considered craniospinal therapy.

               4. The last dose of any myelosuppressive or biologic (e.g., isotretinoin [also known
                  as cis-retinoic acid, or Accutane®]) therapy must be at least 14 days before the
                  administration of the first therapeutic dose of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 on
                  this protocol.

               5. The last dose of immunotherapy must be at least 28 days prior to the first

               6. All cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors must be discontinued for a minimum
                  of 7 days prior to the first therapeutic dose of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131or 14

                  must be ≥30 days prior to dosimetry dose.

               9. Prior autologous stem cell infusion must be ≥2 months prior to study entry. The
                  patient must have recovered from all toxicities

          7. Adequate Organ Function:

             contraception defined as abstinence or use of IUD, oral contraceptive, barrier and
             spermicide, or hormonal implant for the duration of their participation. Sexually
             active female patients using oral contraception will be required to use a second form

             malignancy (other than neuroblastoma) requiring additional treatment.

         10. Any other condition, that in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the
             safety or compliance of the subject or would preclude the subject from successful
             completion of the study.

         11. Patient unable to receive at least one 15 mCi/kg dose per dosimetry findings.
