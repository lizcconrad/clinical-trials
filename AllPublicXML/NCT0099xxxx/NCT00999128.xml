  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, two-part, single-center pharmacokinetics (PK) study to assess
      the relative bioavailability of capsule and tablet formulations of GDC-0941 in the fasted
      state (Part 1) and to determine the effect of food and proton pump inhibition on the PK of
      the tablet formulation of GDC-0941 (Part 2). Approximately 18 subjects will be enrolled in
      Part 1 and up to 32 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. Subjects who participate in Part 1
      are not eligible to participate in Part 2.
