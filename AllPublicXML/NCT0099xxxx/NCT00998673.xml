  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silica Gel Fiber is a bioresorbable, inorganic silica gel fibre patch promoting skin tissue
      growth and enhanced wound healing for all types of chronic wounds. It is applied as patch and
      will be hold in place by a secondary dressing for maintaining the moist wound environment.
      The study is aimed to demonstrate superiority over a standard wound treatment for chronic
      venous leg ulcers. The primary efficacy variable is time to healing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one chronic venous leg ulcer fulfilling all of the following criteria:

               -  Size: &gt;/= 5 cm2 and &lt;/= 40 cm2 (measured by Visitrak Wound Measurement System)

               -  Duration: &gt;/= 3 month &lt; 5 years

               -  Location: Between and including knee and ankle

               -  Depth: Involving dermis, with no exposed muscle, tendon or bone. Characterized by
                  a viable wound bed with granulation tissue

               -  The etiology of the ulcer as &quot;venous&quot; is proven by Duplex or Doppler sonography
                  and with ankle/brachial arterial Doppler pressure index &gt; 0.8 (exclusion
                  criterion for peripheral arterial disease) and &lt; 1.3 (exclusion criterion for
                  medial sclerosis), or with a laser Doppler value &gt; 40

          -  Treatment with active wound care agents paused for 14 days before start of study
             treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only ulcers of other than venous etiology, e.g., diabetic ulcers or ulcers resulting
             from electrical, chemical, or radiation insult, after contact eczema, etc.

          -  History of radiotherapy to the target ulcer site

          -  Signs of infection as defined by rubor, dolor, calor, tumor, functio laesa. Fever
             (38°C sublingual, rectal, or ear), rigors, or leukocytosis will be considered as signs
             of infection in the context of the general appearance of the wound

          -  Target ulcer lacking any sign of granulation tissue (bradytrophic wound bed)

          -  Presence of necrotic tissue

          -  Presence of fistula

          -  History of connective tissue disease, e.g., systemic lupus erythematodes, systemic
             sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome or mixed connective tissue disease

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure

          -  Malnutrition (albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dl; to be measured if clinical signs of malnutrition are
             being observed)

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 8 %)

          -  Previous organ transplantation

          -  Active malignant disease

          -  Severe rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Undergoing haemodialysis

          -  Active sickle cell disease

          -  Patients who are immunocompromised for reasons such as therapy with corticosteroids,
             chemotherapy, antiangiogenic or immunosuppressive agents, or due to immunodeficiency
             syndromes

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Woman of childbearing potential who are not practicing acceptable methods of birth
             control during the investigation period

          -  Known allergy to any of the devices' constituents
