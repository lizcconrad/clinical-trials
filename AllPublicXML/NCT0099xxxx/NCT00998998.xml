      Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with alterations in infant behavior and
      development that may not correct with iron therapy. The purpose of this study was to
      determine if a home-based intervention to foster child development improved behavior and
      development in infants with IDA. IDA and non-anemic infants were randomly assigned to a year
      of intervention or surveillance only. Infants were enrolled and began study participation at
      6 or 12 months. All infants were treated with oral iron and visited weekly to record iron
      intake, feeding, and health (surveillance). For infants randomized to intervention, the
      weekly home visit included an hour-long program fostering child development by supporting the
      mother-infant relationship. Psychologists, unaware of iron status or intervention assignment,
      assessed cognitive, motor, and social-emotional development (Bayley Scales) at the beginning,
      midpoint, and end of the year.
