      During a prostate biopsy, a needle is guided through the rectum into the prostate. Although
      patients are given antibiotics before the biopsy, there is still a risk of bacteria getting
      from the rectum into the bladder, prostate and bloodstream during the biopsy. For most
      surgical procedures, the surgical field is cleaned with antiseptic solution, but this is not
      common practice for prostate biopsies. In this study patients undergoing prostate biopsy will
      be randomly assigned to either receive an antiseptic preparation of the rectum or no
      preparation prior to biopsy, and the rate of infection after the biopsy will be determined.

      1. Purpose This research aims to determine the efficacy and safety of cleaning the rectal
           mucosa with antiseptic solution (Povidone-iodine) prior to transrectal prostate biopsy.

        2. Hypothesis We hypothesize that prophylactic cleaning of the rectal mucosa with
           antiseptic solution prior to transrectal prostate biopsy will decrease the rate of
           infectious complications after biopsy. We believe that this can be achieved without any
           significant complications related to the antiseptic solution.

        3. Justification Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Since the diagnosis of
           prostate cancer requires a transrectal prostate biopsy, this procedure is performed
           frequently. More than 6000 biopsies are performed in British Columbia each year, and
           more than 1000 are performed at Vancouver General and UBC Hospitals (combined numbers).
           In these hospitals, the biopsy is performed by the radiologists using transrectal
           guidance. Subjects receive antibiotic prophylaxis in the form of ciprofloxacin for three
           days starting one day before the biopsy. They also instill an enema into the rectum a
           few hours before the biopsy to empty the rectum. Local anesthetic is injected through
           the rectal mucosa into the periprostatic space prior to the biopsy. Depending on the
           size of the prostate, between 8 and 12 cores of tissue are remove from the prostate by
           repetitive passes of the 18 gauge biopsy needle through the anterior rectal wall.
           Cleaning the rectum with an antiseptic solution prior to biopsy is not routinely
           practiced and is not considered a current standard of care.

           Despite routine antibiotic prophylaxis, prostate biopsies are associated with a
           considerable rate of infectious complications. Sepsis after biopsy is described in the
           literature with an incidence 0.1 to 2.0 %.

           Rate of sepsis has been determined in a retrospective but contemporary study of
           approximately 4500 biopsies at VGH/UBC to occur with a rate of 0.55% (Lange et al.,
           submitted to Journal of Urology). Less severe but more common adverse events include
           urinary tract infection and fever, which both occur in approximately 10% of men
           undergoing biopsy.

           Cleaning the rectum prior to biopsy offers a potential method to decrease the risk of
           these infectious complications, and we propose the use of Povidone-iodine for this
           purpose. Surgical site disinfection is standard in most surgical procedures, and
           Povidone-iodine is a safe antiseptic utilized routinely for the surgical preparation of
           the body surface as well as mucosal surfaces, including the vagina, mouth and bowel.
           Park et al. reported that the mean number of colony-forming units decreased 99.9% after
           Povidone-iodine cleansing of the rectum. Hay et al. reported similar results with
           Povidone-Iodine enema administration when combined with metronidazole. Povidone-iodine
           has been shown to significantly reduce bacterial concentrations in the mucosa of the
           colon and rectum. Brown et al. reported that a Povidone-iodine enema provided a safe and
           effective means for preventing bacteremia and bacteruria after transrectal prostate
           biopsy. Furthermore, severe allergic reaction to Povidone-iodine is rare.

        4. Objectives

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine whether cleaning the lining of the rectum with an antiseptic solution
           before prostate biopsy is effective in decreasing the rate of three outcome variables:

             -  Urinary Tract Infection

             -  Fever

             -  Sepsis

        2. To determine at what rate bacteria are found in the rectum prior to biopsy that are
           resistant to ciprofloxacin.

        3. To determine at what rate bacteria are found in the urine after biopsy, with or without
           rectal cleaning.

        4. To determine any adverse reactions to antiseptic solution in the rectum.

        5. Research Method All subjects undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy as clinically
           indicated and determined by the treating Urologist at Vancouver General Hospital and
           University of British Columbia Hospital will be considered for entry into this trial. If
           the subject consents to participation, he will be randomized to undergo prostate biopsy
           with rectal cleaning with antiseptic solution (&quot;treatment&quot; group) or without rectal
           cleaning (&quot;control&quot; group). A urine sample will be collected before and after biopsy and
           sent for routine culturing. A rectal swab will be taken before the biopsy (and before
           rectal cleaning in treatment group) and will be cultured in ciprofloxacin-enriched
           medium.

           In the treatment group, the radiologist performing the biopsy will wipe the rectal
           lining overlying the prostate with gauze soaked with Povidone-iodine. Otherwise the
           biopsy is performed in standard fashion in both groups. After the procedure, the
           subjects are instructed to measure and record their temperature every 6 hours for 48
           hours. A telephone interview is conducted seven days after biopsy to ascertain any
           adverse events from the biopsy, including whether a temperature ≥38.0˚C was measured.

        6. Statistical Analysis The primary outcome in this study will be the rate of urinary tract
           infection and the rate of fever after biopsy (see definitions below). The rate of sepsis
           will be measured, but the study will not be powered to detect a difference in the rate
           of sepsis.

           The rate of UTI and fever is estimated from the literature data at 10% each. A relative
           reduction of 50% (absolute reduction from 10% to 5%)would be considered clinically
           significant. With type I &amp; II errors set at 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, and a two-sided
           test of significance, the necessary sample size is estimated at 435 in each group.
           Assuming 20% inability to enroll and loss to follow up, the total sample size is 1044.

           Descriptive statistics of baseline parameters will be provided in each group. The mean,
           median, standard deviation or range of the variables will be computed as applicable. The
           association between exposure and the defined outcomes will be assessed in univariate
           analysis. The proportion of each outcome in each group will be compared using the chi
           square test. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression will be performed to assess
           effect of variables such as age, number of biopsy cores, individual performing the
           biopsy and other co-morbidities. A test of interaction will be performed.

        7. Definition of Endpoints

             -  Urinary tract infection: &gt; 100 million colony forming units per liter in the urine
                culture obtained48 hours after biopsy.

             -  Fever: oral temperature ≥38.0˚C within 48 hours after biopsy.

             -  Sepsis(19),(20): positive urine or blood culture plus two or more of the following
                within 1week of biopsy:

                  1. temperature ≥38.0˚C or &lt; 36.0˚C,

                  2. heart rate &gt;90 beats/minute,

                  3. respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min,

                  4. WBC count &gt;12.0 or &lt;4.0 x 10 9/L, or &gt; 0.10 immature forms (bands).

        8. Summary of Procedures:

      Eligible subjects will be counseled in the office regarding the prostate biopsy as per each
      physician's routine. This includes instructions for ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (1000 mg of
      extended release ciprofloxacin daily for three days starting the day before the biopsy) and
      the use of a fleet enema at home approximately 2 hours before biopsy. The Urologist will also
      discuss this study with the subject at the same time as he/she orders the biopsy. He/she will
      ensure that the subject meets the eligibility criteria using a pre-biopsy questionnaire. The
      subject will be able to take the consent home for further consideration and discussion. It
      must be signed before the biopsy for the subject to participate in the study.

      Each subject will be assigned a study code. At the time of biopsy, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 by computer generated random numbers into two groups. The first group
      (&quot;controls&quot;) will undergo biopsy according to the current standard of care, which does not
      include antiseptic cleaning. The second group (&quot;treatment&quot;) will undergo biopsy in the same
      fashion, but after cleaning the rectal lining with 10% Povidone-iodine.

      Before the biopsy is started, the subject is asked to give a midstream urine sample for
      routine culture. A culture swab is also inserted into the rectum and then cultured in
      ciprofloxacin-enriched media in order to isolate ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora prior
      to the biopsy.

      The control group will undergo the routine biopsy while in the treatment group, the
      radiologist performing the biopsy will have a gauze soaked with Povidone-iodine over his/her
      index finger, and will insert this into the rectum. Before this, the Radiologist asks the
      subject again if he has allergy to Povidone-iodine, shellfish or IVP dye. The gauze will be
      wiped back and forth across the prostate with the finger at least five times from one lateral
      margin to the other. The radiologist will allow at least 2 minutes to pass between prep and
      the insertion of the first needle into the prostate in order to allow the Povidone-iodine to
      dry. The radiologist will ask the subject to inform the Radiologist if the subject does
      experience any symptoms of allergic reaction (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing;
      tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue ). The 2 minutes will be
      spent measuring the prostate size using the rectal ultrasound probe. After those two minutes
      the routine biopsy is done. A second rectal swab for culture will not be taken, as this will
      likely be negative due to the Povidone-iodine contamination of the swab, and due to the added
      cost.

      All subjects will be discharged from the recovery according to standard care. During the
      recovery period, a watchful eye is kept on the subjects in the treatment group for developing
      severe allergic reaction. A crash-cart will be available all the time during the procedure
      and in the recovery room. Should the subject develop an allergic reaction, the radiologist
      will take the necessary measures as per the Radiology Department standard of care protocol.
      The subjects will be asked to provide another midstream urine sample for routine culturing 2
      days after the biopsy. This will be grown in conventional media. Subjects will be asked to
      measure and record their oral temperature once they wake up and just before going to sleep
      and every 6 hours in between, for 2 days after the procedure. A telephone interview using a
      post-biopsy questionnaire will be performed with the subject seven days after the biopsy to
      ascertain any side effects from the biopsy, including whether a temperature ≥38.0˚C was
      measured.
