  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultrasound guided supraclavicular block is a peripheral nerve block which is considered
      safe, has a fast onset, is dense and provides complete block of the nerves supplying the
      hand, forearm and arm. However retrospective studies done at Toronto Western Hospital have
      highlighted the fact that most commonly the ulnar nerve fibres (responsible for sensations in
      the ring finger, little finger and the corresponding part of hand), sometimes escape this
      block and need additional supplementary block at a distal peripheral nerve site. It is a
      confusing fact since all nerve fibres are compactly arranged in a sheath at the
      supraclavicular level. The local anaesthetic agent at this level should be equally
      distributed among all nerve fibres. The purpose of this study is to compare two different
      approaches (medial and lateral) adopted by our clinicians to perform this block and to test
      the effectiveness of each approach for successful ulnar nerve fibre blockade.
