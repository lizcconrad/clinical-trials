      To compare the efficacy of global postural reeducation (GPR) with static stretching exercises
      (SS) in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

      Physical therapy is of importance in the treatment of myogenic temporomandibular disorders
      (TMD). Both stretching exercise and global posture reeducation are equally effective in the
      treatment of TMD.

      Purpose: To compare the efficacy of global postural reeducation (GPR) with static stretching
      exercises (SS) in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

      Methods: A total of 24 subjects with TMD were randomized into two treatment groups: GPR,
      where therapy involved muscle global chain stretching, or SS, with conventional static
      stretching. Eight treatment sessions lasting 40 minutes each (weekly) were performed.
      Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment end, and again two months
      later. Measurements included pain intensity at the temporomandibular joint, headache,
      cervicalgia (visual analogue scale - VAS) and teeth clenching. Additionally,
      electromyographic activity and pain thresholds were measured at the masseter, anterior
      temporalis, sternocleidomastoid, and upper trapezius muscles. Two-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc test was used for in-between group comparisons. Significance
      level was 0.05.

    <description>Treatment consisted of eight individual sessions (once a week), over two months. At the first 10 minutes of sessions, patients rested (supine position) with all limbs relaxed. Manual therapy maneuvers were made as described by Bienfait,17 associated to breathing exercises, in order to stretch the fasciae that recover the shoulders, as well as the cervical spine muscles. After that, stretching treatment (global or static) was conducted for another 30 minutes.</description>
