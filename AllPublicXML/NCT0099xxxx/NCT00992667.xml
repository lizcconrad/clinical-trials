    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of inhaled apocynin on ROS (reactive oxygen
      species) and NOS (reactive nitrogen species) synthesis in 10 nonsmoking mild asthmatics.
      Effects of nebulized apocynin (0.5 mg/ml, 6 ml) are assessed in exhaled breath condensate
      (EBC) after 30, 60 and 120 minutes.

    <textblock>
      The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, consisted of 2 visits,
      separated 30 ± 10 days. If during the first visit the drug was used, in the second visit -
      placebo or vice versa. Before and after procedure, safety measures (arterial blood pressure,
      heart rate value, and cough scale) were performed. The effect of a possible inhibitor of ROS
      formation was performed using corticosteroid-naive asthmatic subjects, which are more prone
      to oxidative stress than healthy non-smoking subjects. The study protocol was approved by the
      Ethics Committee of Medical University of Lodz (no. RNN/12/08/KE) and written consent was
      obtained from every subject prior to the study.

      EBC was collected using a modification of the method described previously by Doniec et
      al.2005. The subjects breathed spontaneously through a mouthpiece for 20 min. Each subject
      wore a nose clip during this procedure. Approximately 2 ml of condensate was collected and
      immediately stored at −80°C until the procedure of H2O2, NO2- and NO3- measurement.

      6 ml of apocynin of total dose 3 mg (0.5 mg/ml) has been nebulized through the mouthpiece
      with using of a nose clip.

      The H2O2 concentration in EBC was measured according to the method applied previously by
      Nowak et al.2001. Determination of NO2- and NO3- with Griess solution was performed by
      micromethod, carried out in 96-well plates, according to Griess' method, modified the method
      described by Dziedzic et al.2003.

    <description>Ten nonsmoking patients, suffering from mild bronchial asthma participated in the study (mean age 30±9 years, 5 men, 5 women). Asthma was diagnosed based on GINA 2008 criteria. The patients were free of any medication, at least 7 days before, and had not suffered from any infectious diseases including upper respiratory tract infections for at least 3 months prior to the study. Patients who did not meet these criteria were excluded from the study.</description>
