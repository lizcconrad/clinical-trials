  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound scanning of the back has been shown to increase success when used to guide
      epidural catheter insertion. However, this technique is not applied widely in clinical
      practice. Stronger evidence is required to prove that it will improve the clinical experience
      of labour epidurals.

      The study hypothesis is that anesthesiologists (both residents and fellows), will have an
      increased rate of success and ease of insertion of labour epidural catheters, and that there
      will be increased patient satisfaction, if ultrasound scanning of the lumbar spine is done
      prior to the procedure.

      Studies have shown that ultrasound scanning of the lumbar spine is beneficial in certain
      circumstances (eg. predicted difficult epidurals). However, no large scale studies with
      multiple anesthesiologists performing the technique have been done to show that ultrasound
      scanning may be of benefit in their everyday clinical practice.

      This study will involve residents and fellows, each performing epidural insertions with and
      without the use of ultrasound scanning of the lumbar spine prior to the procedure. If the
      hypothesis is correct, then the use of this technique may become widespread, resulting in
      less complications and increased patients satisfaction.
