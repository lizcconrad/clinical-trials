  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-treatment study. All subjects will receive 12 months of oral
      contraceptive therapy with DR-103. Study participants will receive physical and gynecological
      exams, including Pap smear. During the study, all participants will be required to complete a
      diary.

    <measure>All Users Pregnancy Rates Based on Pearl Index (PI) Analyses for 91-Day Cycles and Broken Out by Subpopulations Defined by Participant Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Contraceptive failure is measured by the pregnancy rate calculated using the Pearl Index (PI). PI used all pregnancies, as determined by a positive urine and/or serum pregnancy test, except those for which the date of conception was before starting DR-103 or &gt; 7 days after stopping the combination EE/LNG treatment of DR-103. The estimated date of conception and gestational age of the fetus was determined by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound.
The PI is defined as number of contraceptive failures per 100 women-years of exposure:
(100)*(total number of pregnancies)*(4)/(total number of 91-day cycles)</description>

    <description>Contraceptive failure is measured by the pregnancy rate calculated using the Pearl Index (PI). PI used all pregnancies, as determined by a positive urine and/or serum pregnancy test, except those for which the date of conception was before starting DR-103 or &gt; 7 days after stopping the combination EE/LNG treatment of DR-103. The estimated date of conception and gestational age of the fetus was determined by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound.
In order to compare the efficacy of extended treatment with DR-103 to conventional 28-day cyclic oral contraceptive treatment, the 91-day DR-103 treatment cycle was separated into three 28-day cycle-equivalents, derived from the 84-day active combination (EE/LNG) pill period of each 91-day extended cycle.

        <title>All Users Pregnancy Rates Based on Pearl Index (PI) Analyses for 91-Day Cycles and Broken Out by Subpopulations Defined by Participant Weight</title>
        <description>Contraceptive failure is measured by the pregnancy rate calculated using the Pearl Index (PI). PI used all pregnancies, as determined by a positive urine and/or serum pregnancy test, except those for which the date of conception was before starting DR-103 or &gt; 7 days after stopping the combination EE/LNG treatment of DR-103. The estimated date of conception and gestational age of the fetus was determined by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound.
The PI is defined as number of contraceptive failures per 100 women-years of exposure:

        <title>All Users Pregnancy Rates Based on Pearl Index (PI) Analyses for 28-Day Cycle-Equivalents and Broken Out by Subpopulations Defined by Participant Weight</title>
        <description>Contraceptive failure is measured by the pregnancy rate calculated using the Pearl Index (PI). PI used all pregnancies, as determined by a positive urine and/or serum pregnancy test, except those for which the date of conception was before starting DR-103 or &gt; 7 days after stopping the combination EE/LNG treatment of DR-103. The estimated date of conception and gestational age of the fetus was determined by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound.
In order to compare the efficacy of extended treatment with DR-103 to conventional 28-day cyclic oral contraceptive treatment, the 91-day DR-103 treatment cycle was separated into three 28-day cycle-equivalents, derived from the 84-day active combination (EE/LNG) pill period of each 91-day extended cycle.
The PI is defined as number of contraceptive failures per 100 women-years of exposure:
