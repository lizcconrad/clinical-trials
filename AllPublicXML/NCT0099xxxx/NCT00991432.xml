      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether this study treatment can improve
      the bone structure of the upper front part of the jaw in patients who are scheduled for
      surgery to have a dental implant(s) placed into the upper front part of their mouths and need
      to have more bone in their jaws to support the implant, so that a dental implant can later be
      inserted.

      The INFUSE® Bone Graft is a device approved by the FDA to be used instead of using your own
      bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE® Bone Graft
      is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a
      genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and
      changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It
      helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge
      itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether this study treatment can improve
      the bone structure of the upper front part of the jaw so that a dental implant can later be
      inserted. This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of INFUSE® Bone Graft, along with space holding devices, in a 2-part procedure. Your
      dental implants will be placed at approximately 6 months after the INFUSE® Bone Graft
      implant.

    <description>Patients will be treated with the commercially available INFUSE® Bone Graft material applied to an ACS concurrent with space maintenance devices for soft tissue management on Day 0 (Surgery). A follow-up visit will take place 2 weeks after implant of the INFUSE® Bone Graft material, or as regularly scheduled as per the standard of care (SOC) for the facility. Patients will return to the facility for final End of Study (EOS) assessments approximately 6 months after surgery. Between the follow-up visit and the EOS visit, patients will be seen as per the SOC schedule for the facility.</description>
