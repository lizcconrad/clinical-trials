  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look for new types of gene changes that may be related to cancer in some
      patients. Some gene changes (mutations) are passed on from parents to offspring (child).
      Other gene changes are new and are seen for the first time in a child. They are not seen in
      the parent.

      Some of these gene changes may cause cancers in the offspring. We will look for gene changes
      by studying patients with cancer their parents and family members without cancer. In this
      study, we will be able to find gene changes that occur in the cancer patient but not in the
      rest of the family. Knowing the role that new gene changes play in cancer risk may help us
      find people at a higher risk of getting cancer.

        The majority of eligible probands will be identified prospectively through the clinics of
        the Clinical Genetics, Medical Oncology and Pediatric Oncology Services of MSKCC by the
        patient's physician, the protocol investigator, or a research team member.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Proband must have living unaffected biologic mother and father available and eligible
             for participation in the study with one of the following (both incident and prevalent
             cases will be collected):

               -  Colorectal cancer diagnosed at or under the age of 50.

               -  Breast cancer diagnosed at or under the age of 45.

               -  Germ cell tumor diagnosed at or under the age of 40.

               -  Pediatric cancer of any type diagnosed at or under the age of 21

               -  Adult cancer or pre-neoplastic condition of any type diagnosed at or under the
                  age of 40

               -  Cancer at any age in 2 or more siblings suggestive of a genetic etiology, such as
                  brothers with testicular germ cell tumor or sisters with breast cancer and
                  ovarian cancer

          -  Parents:

               -  Must be the biologic mother and biologic father of affected proband.

               -  Must have (by self-report) no history of cancer other than non-melanomatous skin
                  cancer or cervical cancer in situ except in the case of inclusion criteria #6..

               -  In certain clinical situations, parent(s) with cancer may be included at the
                  discretion of the Principal Investigator, if the Principal Investigator deems
                  that the etiology of cancer in the parent(s) and proband are biologically
                  unrelated.

          -  Sibling(s):

               -  Must be age 18 or older and have same biologic parents as proband.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known genetic mutation in proband or a family history that is indicative of hereditary
             cancer susceptibility.
