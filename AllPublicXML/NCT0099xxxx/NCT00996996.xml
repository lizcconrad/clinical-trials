  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-institution, phase II study of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for
      patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage (stage III or IV) low-grade non-Hodgkin's
      B-cell lymphoma. A total of 75-80 patients will be enrolled.

      Patients will undergo two phases of the study. In the first phase, termed the &quot;dosimetric
      dose&quot;, patients will receive an infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) over 70
      minutes (including a 10-minute flush) immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion (including
      a 10-minute flush) of Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) which has been trace-labeled with 5 mCi of
      Iodine-131. Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained 5 to 8 times between Days 0 and 7
      following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric data from 3 imaging timepoints (the
      imaging timepoints to be used in decreasing order of preference depending on availability of
      data are Days 0, 3, and 7; Days 0, 4, and 7; Days 0, 3 and 6; Days 0, 4, and 6; Days 0, 2,
      and 7; and Days 0, 2, and 6), a patient-specific dose of Iodine- 131 to deliver the desired
      total body dose of radiotherapy will be calculated. In the second phase, termed the
      &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, patients will receive a 70-minute infusion (including a 10-minute flush)
      of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion
      (including a 10-minute flush) of Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) labeled with the patient-specific
      dose of Iodine-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy. Patients who are obese will be
      dosed based upon 137% of their calculated lean body mass. Patients will be treated with
      either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide
      tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine-131 Anti-B1
      Antibody (i.e., dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., therapeutic dose).

      The primary endpoint of the study is the determination of the response rate with Iodine-131
      Anti-B1 Antibody in previously untreated patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). The secondary endpoints include duration of response, safety, radiation dosimetry, and
      the predictive value of detection of the presence or absence minimal residual disease by
      molecular techniques on response duration.

    <description>The Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas is used to summarize the extent of the cancer's spread. Stages are classified by Roman numerals I (less spread) to IV (more spread). If the following symptoms (called B-symptoms) are present, a &quot;B&quot; classification is added to the stage: night sweats, intermittant fever, and weight loss. B-symptoms indicate the presence of systemic symptoms. The presence or absence of B-symptoms has prognostic significance and is reflected in the staging of these lymphomas.</description>

          -  Patients with evidence of active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics at
             the time of study entry.

          -  Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease or other
             serious illness that would preclude evaluation.

          -  Patients with active obstructive hydronephrosis.

          -  Patients with prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Patients of childbearing potential must undergo
             a pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry and radiolabeled antibody is not to be
             administered until a negative result is obtained. Males and females must agree to use
             effective contraception for 6 months following the radioimmunotherapy.

          -  Patients with previous allergic reactions to iodine. This does not include reacting to
             IV iodine-containing contrast materials.

          -  Patients who were previously given any monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies of any
             non-human species for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. This includes
             engineered chimeric and humanized antibodies.

          -  Patients who are concurrently receiving either approved or nonapproved (through
             another protocol) anti-cancer drugs or biologics.

          <description>PCR is a scientific technique in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. Applications of PCR technique include: selective DNA isolation, amplification and quantification of DNA, and the diagnosis of diseases. PCR positive: interchromosomal translocation t(14;18) is present. PCR negative: t(14;18) is absent.</description>

        <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment, as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I-131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed HAMA above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of HAMA.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Adverse Event (AEs) of Hypothyroidism</title>
        <description>Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone and is defined as either developing elevated TSH levels or initiating thyroid medication. An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study.</description>
