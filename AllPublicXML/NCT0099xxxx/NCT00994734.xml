      The primary aim of this study is to assess the acceptability of home-use mifepristone for
      termination of pregnancy among women who choose it and their providers. The investigators'
      secondary aims are to assess rates of follow-up, adherence, efficacy, complications, lost
      productivity, and to estimate the minimum proportion of women who choose home-use over clinic
      use of mifepristone.
