  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial of ultrasound guided intrauterine contraception
      insertion 10 minutes - 48 hours after vaginal delivery of single infant. A six month
      follow-up will entail three follow-up visits; 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

      The objective of this study is to measure intrauterine device (IUD) expulsion and the
      feasibility of conducting a future clinical trial to evaluate placement of the
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive 10 minutes - 48 hours postpartum.

    <textblock>
      This was a single arm cohort study of women who desired to receive a levonorgestrel releasing
      intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) within 48 hours of uncomplicated vaginal delivery.

      Women were enrolled during a prenatal care visit when they reported they desired to use the
      LNG-IUS after the birth of their infant.

      Forty women stated enrolled in the study prior to labor, and baseline data were obtained.
      After delivery 29 women remained both interested in the study and were still eligible to
      receive the LNG-IUS prior to discharge from the hospital.

      Of the 29 women who received the LNG-IUS prior to discharge from the hospital 11 women had an
      LNG-IUS expulsion prior to 6 months postpartum.
