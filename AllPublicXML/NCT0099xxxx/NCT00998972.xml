      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) administration in
      organ donors on the kidney graft function of recipients.

    <textblock>
      Ischemia-reperfusion is a major contributing factor for delayed renal function after
      transplantation. It has been shown that the administration of an antioxidant, i.e. NAC, in
      patients with chronic renal insufficiency may prevent radio contrast-induced nephropathy. Due
      to its antioxidant effects, organ donor pretreatment with NAC has demonstrated to improve
      renal graft function in two experimental studies. Study objectives: to compare the incidence
      of delayed graft renal function between two groups of patients, i.e., those receiving the
      graft from organ donors pretreated with NAC and a group control. The primary endpoint was the
      number of delayed graft function defined as the requirement of at least one sequence of
      dialysis during the first seven days following transplantation. Secondary endpoints:
      evolution of creatininemia, azotemia at day 1, 7, 14 and ,30 after surgery; acute and delayed
      transplant rejection; intrahospital mortality.

      Patients inclusion: all organ donors and recipients were eligible Exclusion criteria: for
      organ donors were preexistent chronic renal insufficiency and contra-indications for kidney
      procurement; for recipient were transplantation outside our hospital The donors were
      randomized in a single-blind fashion into two groups : the control group and the group
      receiving 600 mg IV of NAC 1 hour before and 600 mg IV 2 hours after cerebral arteriography
      required to diagnose brain death. Sample size has been calculated delayed graft function by
      50% leading to include 118 recipients in each group.

      Follow up: one year after transplantation. Study beginning in september 2006. Length of
      inclusion during 36 months.
