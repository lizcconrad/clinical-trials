  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the prevalence of bronchial responsiveness (BHR) among patients with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      Investigate correlation between bronchial reactivity and the severity of GERD, and similarly
      investigate the correlation between exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and the severity of GERD.

      Compare the effects of esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily and Nissen fundoplication on bronchial
      reactivity, exhaled NO, pulmonary function and quality of life.
