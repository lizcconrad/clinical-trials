    <textblock>
      The Primary Objective is to evaluate the progression-free survival after treatment with
      docetaxel plus cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (DCF) in comparison with cisplatin plus
      5-FU (CF) in patient with locally advanced inoperable SCCHN The Secondary Objective is to
      evaluate and compare the clinical response rate both before and after radiotherapy, the local
      symptoms, the duration of response, the time to treatment failure, the survival, the toxicity
      and the quality of life in the 2 study groups.
