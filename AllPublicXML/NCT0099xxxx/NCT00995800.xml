  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-response study to determine how various measurements of airway inflammation
      respond to high and low dose FlutiForm®, and compared to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two 4-week treatment periods, each preceded by a 14-21 wash-out period.
      Subjects will be randomised to receive two of the three study treatments - FlutiForm® pMDI
      50/5 µg, FlutiForm® pMDI 250/10 µg, or placebo (dummy inhaler). During the wash-out periods,
      subjects will take only salbutamol, if required, as rescue medication.

      Subjects will record a daily diary for PEFR, study medication use, rescue medication use,
      asthma symptom scores, and sleep disturbance due to asthma. Assessments performed at study
      clinic visits include inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) challenge test, induced sputum
      test, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) test, and spirometry tests. Safety will be assessed by lab
      tests, vital signs, ECG and adverse events.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive.

          2. Females less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test recorded at the screening visit prior to the first dose of study
             medication in each treatment period, be non-lactating, and be willing to use adequate
             and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. A highly effective
             method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e.,
             less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation,
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device,
             hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.

          3. Known history of mild to moderate asthma for ≥ 6 months prior to the screening visit.

          4. Subject has not received systemic (injectable or oral) corticosteroid medication in
             the 12 weeks prior to the study screening visit.

          5. Demonstrate a FEV1 of ≥ 60% predicted FEV1 (Quanjer et al, 1993) at the screening
             visit, following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (no long-acting
             β2-agonist or short-acting β2-agonist/anticholinergic use 12 hours and 6 hours prior
             to screening, respectively).

          6. Demonstrate AMP challenge PC20FEV1 &lt; 60 mg/mL, following appropriate withholding of
             asthma medication (no short-acting bronchodilator use 6 hours prior to the AMP
             challenge test at Visit 2).

          7. Non-smoker for at least 12 months prior to study screening. Ex-smokers must have a
             smoking history equivalent to less than &quot;10 pack years&quot; (i.e. at least 1 pack of 20
             cigarettes per day for 10 years or 10 packs per day for 1 year, etc.).

          8. Demonstrate satisfactory technique in the use of the pMDI.

          9. Willing and able to enter information in the diary and attend all study visits.

         10. Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre-study prescribed asthma
             medication for the duration of the study.

         11. Written informed consent obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Near fatal or life-threatening (including intubation) asthma within the past year.

             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk through study
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.

          5. In the investigator's opinion a clinically significant upper or lower respiratory
             infection within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.

          6. Significant, non-reversible, active pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).

          9. Subjects who have taken beta-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within one week prior to the screening visit.

         10. History of leukotriene receptor antagonist use, e.g. montelukast, within one week

         11. Current use of medications other than those allowed in the protocol that will have an
             effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary function.

         12. Anti-histamines within 2 weeks prior to the screening visit; non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs, oral decongestants, inhaled cromolyn sodium, nedocromil
             sodium within one week prior to the screening visit.

         13. Current evidence or history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test
             medications, rescue medication, or components.

         14. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the screening visit (12 weeks
             if an oral or injectable steroid).

         15. Current participation in a clinical study.
