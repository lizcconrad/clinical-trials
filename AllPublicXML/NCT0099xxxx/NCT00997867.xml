  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine if the effects of continuous peripheral nerve blocks
      are influenced by the distance of insertion past the needle tip of the perineural catheter.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim: Research study to determine the relationships between perineural catheter
      insertion distance and subsequent continuous peripheral nerve block effects.

      Hypothesis: during ultrasound-guided perineural catheter placement, inserting the catheter
      0-1cm past the needle tip is associated with decreased postoperative pain compared with
      inserting the catheter 5-6cm past the needle tip.

    <description>Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery who are getting a perineural catheter will be randomized to one of two groups: catheter tip placed 0-1cm past needle tip or catheter tip placed 5-6cm past needle tip. Patients will be called by research staff the day following surgery to assess their post-surgical pain using a numeric rating scale.</description>
