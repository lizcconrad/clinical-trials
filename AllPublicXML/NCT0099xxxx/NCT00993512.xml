    <textblock>
      This study is an open, non- randomized, phase I, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety
      and tolerance of Amphinex based PCI of bleomycin in patients with local recurrent or
      advanced/metastatic, cutaneous or sub-cutaneous malignancies.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be included in cohorts of 3 patients. The initial starting dose for
      Amphinex will be given 4 days prior to the fixed dose of bleomycin administered by
      intravenous infusion. The illumination, with red light (laser 652 nm), to the tumour surface
      and a margin of 2-3 mm outside the tumour surface, will be performed after bleomycin
      administration.

      There will be no comparative procedure in this study. Dose escalation will proceed according
      to a modification of Simon's accelerated titration design. The number of patients recruited
      depends on the DLT experienced. A total of 6 patients will be included at each dose level if
      no more than 1 patient experiences DLT.

      Additional cohorts may be added pending the outcome of the previous cohorts and discussions
      between the investigators and the Sponsor. The primary goal of the study is to assess the
      safety and tolerance of the Amphinex and determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of
      Amphinex as a PCI therapy in combination with bleomycin treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18 years or above who have given written informed consent.

          -  Skin type I- IV according to the Fitzpatrick skin classification (see appendix G).

          -  With a diagnosis of local recurrence or advanced/metastatic, cutaneous or subcutaneous
             malignancy

          -  Lesion measurement must not be done more than 2 weeks before the beginning of
             treatment. More than one field with lesion can be illuminated, but care must be taken
             to avoid overlap of the fields illuminated.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, anticancer hormone therapy, or other investigational therapy for at
             least 2 weeks prior to study entry, and have recovered from the acute effects of
             therapy.

          -  Have a performance status of 0-2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Scale (see appendix D).

          -  Clinically assessed as eligible for bleomycin chemotherapy.

          -  Have a predicted life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Geographic proximity that allow adequate follow-up.

          -  If female: have had childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or
             menopause or attenuated by the use of an approved contraceptive method during and for

             of the treated lesion.

          -  Planned dentist appointments in first 28 days after treatment.

          -  Anticancer therapy within the first 28 days after treatment.

             griseofulvin) within the first 14 days after treatment.

          -  Co-existing ophthalmic disease likely to require slit-lamp examination within the

          -  Known allergy to Cremophor.

          -  Known allergy to bleomycin.

          -  Conditions contraindicated for bleomycin treatment (lung infection, impaired pulmonary
             function).

          -  Conditions that worsen when exposed to light (including porphyria).

          -  Conditions associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.
