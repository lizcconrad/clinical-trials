      This study will look at how safe and effective, a novel agent, CT 327 cream is in treating
      patients with mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris (PV). Patients will be treated twice daily
      for 8 weeks on specific lesions of PV and safety and symptoms of PV will be assessed
      throughout the treatment period.
