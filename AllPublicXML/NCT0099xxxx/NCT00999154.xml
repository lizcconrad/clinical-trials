      Background:

      - Obesity is the result of many factors, including genetics and lifestyle, such as
      over-eating high-calorie foods and not being physically active. Obesity affects approximately
      one third of adults in the United States. Researchers often study individuals who are already
      overweight and obese, but another approach is to examine people who stay thin despite eating
      whatever they want and not exercising. Studying these thin individuals will enhance
      understanding of why some people become obese and others do not, which may lead to novel
      treatments for obesity.

      Objective:

      - To study the metabolism, body composition, body temperature, physical activity, and blood
      chemistries of healthy lean adults before and after adding 1,000 extra Calories per day to
      their normal diet.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults, 30 to 50 years of age, who have never been overweight after adolescence,
      who are currently weight-stable, sedentary, and eating without restrictions.

      Design:

      - The entire study will take about 9 weeks and will include the following outpatient and
      inpatient visits:

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Outpatient screening visit and monitoring: Physical examination and blood test at
      screening; then, one week of physical activity monitoring (e.g., with a pedometer-like device
      called an accelerometer) and completing a food diary.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Baseline inpatient visit (5 days): Volunteers will eat a normal diet to maintain body
      weight. Energy expenditure, body composition, physical fitness, activity level, and eating
      behavior will be measured. Urine and blood samples will be taken. Volunteers may go home for
      the weekend or stay at the metabolic clinical research unit (MCRU).

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Inpatient feeding week 1 (5 days): Volunteers will eat a normal diet plus milkshakes
      for added calories. All the same measurements during the baseline week visit will be
      repeated.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Outpatient feeding weeks 2 3: Volunteers will eat breakfast at the MCRU everyday for
      the next 2 weeks and take prepared meals home with them (volunteers may also stay at the MCRU
      for the 2 weeks if they prefer). Volunteers will drink a non-radioactive (heavy) water called
      doubly labeled water to measure energy expenditure in their normal living environment Daily
      urine samples will be collected.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Inpatient feeding week 4 (5 days): Volunteers will continue eating a normal diet plus
      milkshakes for added calories. This stay and measurement is identical to inpatient feeding
      week 1.

      - Volunteers will be contacted at 6 and 12 months to assess any changes in body weight, diet,
      and physical activity.

      While many obesity studies focus on the individuals who are already overweight and obese, a
      complementary approach to understand such a common disease is to define the mechanisms which
      allow some lean individuals to resist weight gain. The predominant cause of human obesity is
      the inheritance of genes favoring fat storage and efficient energy utilization interacting
      with an obesogenic environment, characterized by readily available, energy-dense food and
      sedentary lifestyle. However, a persistent percentage (about 30%) of the US adult population
      remains thin (BMI &lt;23 kg/M(2)). While some of these individuals maintain their weight by
      vigilantly controlling their diet, exercising or taking medication(s), others may have the
      ability to remain thin despite an excessive energy intake and without volitional exercise. To
      identify these individuals and define their phenotypes will provide unique insights into
      energy and body weight homeostasis, and may yield novel approaches for treating obesity.

      In this natural history protocol, we will recruit and characterize a cohort of
      constitutionally lean and healthy adult volunteers (age 25-50, BMI 18.5-25 kg/M(2)) who do
      not have pathological or exogenous factors that are known to stimulate energy expenditure,
      suppress food intake, or decrease absorption. We will recruit volunteers who are
      weight-stable, sedentary, and non-restrictive eaters, characterize their free-living dietary
      and physical activity energy expenditure using food records and portable accelerometers,
      respectively. Using an inpatient controlled setting, we will carefully characterize the
      details of their 24-hr energy metabolism, body composition, core and skin temperatures, and
      blood chemistries while they are on a one-week metabolic diet adjusted to maintain his/her
      body weight (baseline) vs. another week of higher energy intake level (1000 extra kcal per
      day above their baseline). Overfeeding will continue for two more weeks in the outpatient
      setting with all meals provided by our metabolic kitchen, followed by the fourth week of
      overfeeding and repeated measurements back in the inpatient setting. We hypothesize that
      spontaneous changes in energy expenditure and/or calorie intake may differ between
      individuals, and such difference may explain the ability for some to resist body gain. The
      accruals of humans with obesity-resistant phenotypes will significantly enhance our
      understanding of the mechanisms of energy homeostasis and identify potential novel regulators
      for controlling obesity.
