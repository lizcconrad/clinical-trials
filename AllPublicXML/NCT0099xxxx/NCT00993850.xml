    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate a psychological intervention for individuals who suffer from sleep
      disturbance and bipolar disorder. We are hoping that this treatment will: (1) improve the
      quality of life of individuals with bipolar disorder who are suffering from sleep disturbance
      and (2) reduce the risk of, or help prevent, episodes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Bipolar disorder patients with sleep disturbance

          1. Meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Text Revision
             (DSM-IV-TR; APA, 2000) diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder type 1 (established
             with the SCID: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV).

          2. Being inter-episode throughout the experiment as defined by cutoffs widely used in
             previous research. On the basis that a drug-free group would likely be unfeasible and
             unrepresentative, participants will not be excluded on the basis of medications
             prescribed for bipolar disorder. Comorbidity will be allowed as long as bipolar
             disorder is the primary diagnosis. However, it is necessary to assess comorbidity for
             reporting purposes.

          3. Participants who have a history of bipolar 1 or suicidal ideation must be under the
             care of a psychiatrist.

          4. Experience distress related to significant sleep disturbance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of an active and progressive physical illness (e.g., congestive heart
             failure, cancer, COPD) or neurological degenerative diseases (e.g., dementia, multiple
             sclerosis) directly related to the onset and course of insomnia;

          2. Alcohol or drug abuse (except nicotine) within the past year

          3. Active posttraumatic stress disorder

          4. Evidence of sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements during
             sleep, or a circadian-based sleep disorder (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase
             syndrome)

          5. Patients who pose a current suicidal risk or homicidal risk (assessed by treating
             psychiatrist) or who have made a suicide attempt within the past 6 months.

          6. Pharmacotherapy for sleep defined as the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine
             hypnotics that operate via the GABA A receptor complex and are FDA approved for the
             treatment of insomnia, selective melatonin agonists, benzodiazepine anxiolytics and
             over the counter medications with proven efficacy such as melatonin or herbs such as
             St. Johns wort.

          7. Use of certain medications known to alter sleep (e.g., steroids, theophylline,
             propranolol, antihistamines that cause drowsiness).
