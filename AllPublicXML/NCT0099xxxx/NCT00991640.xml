  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a program aimed at enhancing primary care physician (PCP) teams'
      expertise, self-efficacy and attitudes with respect to obesity management. The investigators
      implemented and evaluated this obesity management system based on a preceptorship combined
      with a virtual learning community favouring continuous support of family medicine groups
      (FMGs, Groupes de Médecine Familiale) by a team of experts in obesity management; significant
      improvements regarding their attitudes and perception of self-efficacy were observed
      immediately after the preceptorship and maintained after one year. Furthermore, the
      investigators observed significant changes in their practice that were maintained one year
      later.

      The investigators hypothesize that their program combining preceptorships with a virtual
      community will improve: (1) management and weight loss of obese/overweight subjects who are
      treated by PCPs for hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes (DM2) or impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT); and (2) screening and initial management of obesity among unselected patients of PCPs
      who practice in FMGs.
