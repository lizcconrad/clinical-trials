  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe haemophilia A lack clotting factor FVIII and suffer from spontaneous and
      traumatic bleeds. In the absence of treatment, frequent bleeds in joints lead to severe joint
      destruction. In 1960s, prophylactic therapy was developed involving the infusion of clotting
      factor on a regular schedule in order to keep clotting levels sufficiently high to prevent
      spontaneous bleeding episodes. Prophylaxis is started at an early age before the age of 2
      years or after the first joint bleed. The Malmö experience indicates that treatment is most
      effective when administered in large doses at least 3 times weekly. However, such an
      intensive treatment in young boys may be very difficult to carry out for home treatment.
      Currently, there is no international recommendation on prophylactic therapy regimens. Because
      of the high cost and limited availability of factor concentrates, dosing is an important
      issue in prophylaxis therapy. It was recently shown that 24 hours after FVIII concentrate
      administration, in patients presenting similar FVIIII levels, thrombin generation capacity
      may be significantly different. In addition, independently of the FVIII level, a correlation
      was found between severe clinical bleeding phenotype and thrombin generating capacity. The
      aim of the present clinical study is to assess the thrombin generation test as the main
      surrogate marker to evaluate the coagulating capacity of haemophiliacs on prophylaxis
      regimen. Optimizing prophylactic therapy to patient's phenotype with no loss of clinical
      effectiveness can significantly improve patients' quality of life, protect haemophilic
      children against arthropathy and possibly limit the cost of the prophylaxis therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe haemophilia A (FVIII &lt; 1 IU/dl)

          -  Currently on prophylactic therapy administered at least 3 times per week with a
             clinical efficiency

          -  Ability of patient or family (for minors) to give informed consent

          -  Patient affiliated to French Social Insurance System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 6 years and &gt; 45 years

          -  Hemophilia A with documented history of inhibitor

          -  Clinically symptomatic liver disease (supported by e.g. diagnosis of cirrhosis, portal
             hypertension, ascites, PT &gt; 5 seconds above upper limit of normal)

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100x109/l

          -  Planned elective surgery within 13 months

          -  Poor venous access according inclusion criteria
