  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial, and the objective is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of Mycophenolic acid (MA) and Azathioprine (AZA), immunosuppressive
      drugs, in myasthenia gravis patients. This prospective study will enroll 40 myasthenia gravis
      (MG) patients who are poor controlled under prior steroid therapy. All subjects should be
      randomly assigned to MA group and AZA group that will receive routine pyridostigmine and
      prednisolone in combination with MA or AZA.

      This will be a double-dummy study to keep the blinded quality.

        -  MA group: 1 tablet AZA placebo and 4 tables MA (180 mg/tab,720 mg/day) twice daily.

        -  AZA group: 1 tablet AZA (50mg/tab) and 4 tables MA placebo twice daily.

             -  When patients achieve minimal manifestation (MM, i.e. complete remission), which
                lead to normal daily routine, the dose of pyridostigmine should reduce to 240
                mg/day (4 tablets) or less. The dose of steroid should be stepped down by 10 mg qod
                (every other day) for every 2 weeks until the dose achieves 40 mg qod. After that,
                the dose should be stepped down by 5 mg qod for every month.

             -  When disease progresses and is no longer maintaining minimal manifestation, the
                dose of steroid will be stepped up by 10 mg qod for every 2 weeks until achieve
                clinical stable remission. The taper rule of steroid could start again 1 month
                after stabilization.

             -  Every patient will be treated for 1 year. If the patient could not achieve MM
                within 1 year, the blind of individual patient will be opened and the patients will
                be crossed over to another medical treatment. The efficacy and safety of second
                medication will be observed openly until the end of study.

             -  When the muscle weakness worsens under established study schedule, plasmapheresis
                could be conducted to improve the condition rapidly.
