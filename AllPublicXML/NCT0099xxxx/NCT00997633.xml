  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPECT was performed in 51 patients after cytoreductive surgery in combination with
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The detected volume was compared to the number of subsequent
      sequential postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy courses that could be performed without
      further surgical intervention. SPECT data was found to predict feasibility of sequential
      postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
