    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to shorten the treatment time course for patients who
      are scheduled for surgery to have a dental implant(s) placed into the upper front part of
      their mouths and need to have more bone in their jaws to support the implant.

      The INFUSE® Bone Graft is a device approved by the FDA to be used instead of using your own
      bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE® Bone Graft
      is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a
      genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and
      changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It
      helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge
      itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms.

      The purpose of this research study is to shorten the treatment time course for the patients.
      This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      INFUSE® Bone Graft, along with dental implant placement, in a single procedure.

    <description>Patients will be treated with the commercially available INFUSE® Bone Graft material applied to an ACS in the area of the dental implant on Day 0 (Surgery). A follow-up visit will take place 2 weeks after implant of the INFUSE® Bone Graft material, or as regularly scheduled as per the standard of care (SOC) for the facility. Patients will return to the facility for final End of Study (EOS) assessments 6 months after surgery for placement of the appropriate prosthetic, and assessment of osseointegration and stability. Between the follow-up visit and the EOS visit, patients will be seen as per the SOC schedule for the facility.</description>
