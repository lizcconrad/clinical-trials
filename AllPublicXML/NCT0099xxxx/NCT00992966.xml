      The VRI device may provide a complementary diagnostic tool for lung examination and aid the
      physician in determining whether a chest x-ray should be performed.

      This study is a prospective, single center study to determine the value of VRI images as an
      aid in determining whether a chest x ray is necessary to evaluate children presenting with
      acute respiratory complaints.

      Study participants will be children, selected from the Emergency Department (ED), who were
      designated to undergo a PA and Left Lateral CXR because of acute respiratory complaints such
      as a new respiratory condition, acute cough, onset of shortness of breath, or fever.

      Patients who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and will be
      recorded by the VRI device.

      A technician will perform a CXR on the enrolled patients. The CXR and the VRI will be
      performed on the same day within 6 hours of each other.

      VRI readers, who are blinded to the patient's CXR, history, and physical exam, will evaluate
      the VRI recording. The VRI reader will review the VRI images and, using the lexicon of images
      supplied by Deep Breeze, determine whether the VRI is normal or abnormal.

      Certified radiologists will review the patient's CXR and will determine whether the CXR is
      normal or abnormal based solely on the CXR.

      The VRI readers determination of normal or abnormal for each subject will be compared to the
      radiologists determination of normal or abnormal CXR for each subject.

          4. Patient referred by ED physician and presented for CXR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Body habitus or skin condition that might prevent the placement of the sound sensors
             on the back (e.g. severe scoliosis, kyphosis, chest wall deformation, skin lesion on
             the back or compression fracture);

          2. Potentially contagious skin lesion on the back;

          3. Subject has had lung surgery;

          4. Subject was prescribed the CXR for monitoring or follow up of a lung condition that
             pre-existed the current, acute symptoms.
