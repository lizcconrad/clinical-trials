  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania (hair pulling) has an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1-3%. Children with
      trichotillomania can experience significant impairment due to peer teasing, avoidance of
      activities (such as swimming and socializing), difficulty concentrating on school work and
      medical complications due to pulling behaviors. Despite the fact that trichotillomania has a
      childhood onset, no randomized, controlled trials have been completed in childhood
      trichotillomania.

      Research in adults with trichotillomania has demonstrated that most commonly currently
      prescribed treatment for trichotillomania, (pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors) is ineffective in treating this condition. By contrast, randomized controlled
      trials in adults have suggested the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as well as behavioral
      treatments such as Habit Reversal Therapy.

      The goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy of N-Acetylcysteine for pediatric
      trichotillomania. N-Acetylcysteine is a glutamate modulating agent, with a fairly benign
      side-effect profile.

    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale (MGH-HPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Massachusetts General Hospital - Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS) is a 7-question scale that measures the severity of hair pulling. The scale ranges from 0-28. The higher the score, the more severe the hairpulling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trichotillomania Scale for Children - Child Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Trichotillomania Scale for Children (TSC) - Child Version assesses hair pulling severity, distress, and impairment in children. The scale is split into two sections (severity and distress/impairment), with 12 questions (5 severity and 7 distress/impairment). The severity score is summed from questions 1-5 and divided by 5. The distress/impairment score is summed from questions 6-12 and divided by 7. The total score is calculated by summing the severity score and the distress/impairment score. Scores range from 0-4. Higher total scores indicate greater severity/distress/impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) assesses major dimensions of anxiety in children. The MASC contains 39 items rated on a scale of 0-3. Scores range from 0-117. The higher the score, the greater the anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Trichotillomania Scale for Children (TSC) - Parent Version assesses hair pulling severity, distress, and impairment in children. The scale is split into two sections (severity and distress/impairment), with 12 questions (5 severity and 7 distress/impairment). The severity score is summed from questions 1-5 and divided by 5. The distress/impairment score is summed from questions 6-12 and divided by 7. The total score is calculated by summing the severity score and the distress/impairment score. Scores range from 0-4.

    <measure>The Milwaukee Inventory for Styles of Trichotillomania-Child Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Milwaukee Inventory for Styles of Trichotillomania (MIST) - Child Version assesses &quot;focused&quot; pulling, hair pulling that occurs intentionally to relieve tension or distress, and &quot;automatic&quot; pulling, hair pulling that occurs outside of the child's attention. This scale contains 25 questions, 21 questions in the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale and 4 questions in the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale. The scores range from 0-36 on the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale and 0-189 on the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale. Higher scores on the subscales indicate more of the hair pulling is of that style.</description>

This scale contains 25 questions, 21 questions in the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale and 4 questions in the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale. The scores range from 0-36 on the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale and 0-189 on the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale. Higher scores on the subscales indicate more of the hair pulling is of that style.</description>

        <title>Trichotillomania Scale for Children - Parent Version</title>
        <description>The Trichotillomania Scale for Children (TSC) - Parent Version assesses hair pulling severity, distress, and impairment in children. The scale is split into two sections (severity and distress/impairment), with 12 questions (5 severity and 7 distress/impairment). The severity score is summed from questions 1-5 and divided by 5. The distress/impairment score is summed from questions 6-12 and divided by 7. The total score is calculated by summing the severity score and the distress/impairment score. Scores range from 0-4. Higher total scores indicate greater severity/distress/impairment.</description>

        <description>The Milwaukee Inventory for Styles of Trichotillomania (MIST) - Child Version assesses &quot;focused&quot; pulling, hair pulling that occurs intentionally to relieve tension or distress, and &quot;automatic&quot; pulling, hair pulling that occurs outside of the child's attention. This scale contains 25 questions, 21 questions in the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale and 4 questions in the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale. The scores range from 0-36 on the &quot;automatic&quot; pulling subscale and 0-189 on the &quot;focused&quot; pulling subscale. Higher scores on the subscales indicate more of the hair pulling is of that style.</description>
