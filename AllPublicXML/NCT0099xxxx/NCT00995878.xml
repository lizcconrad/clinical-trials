  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of two standard
      fibroid treatments: MRI guided ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) and uterine artery embolization
      (UAE). Both treatments are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for women who
      do not plan to become pregnant.

      A second goal of this study is to better understand which symptoms bother women with fibroids
      the most. Understanding and addressing the symptoms of clinically-significant uterine
      fibroids is important in order to optimize treatment outcomes and control health care costs.

      Women who are eligible to participate in the study, are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms (UAE or MRgFUS). Women in both arms will receive treatment but will not be able to
      choose which treatment she will receive.

      A comprehensive assessment of symptoms-including experienced pain- will take place at
      baseline, 6 weeks, and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following treatment with UAE and MRgFUS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids affect up to 70 to 80% of women and about 30% of women are symptomatic. Over
      200,000 hysterectomies are performed each year for uterine fibroids in the USA. The direct
      health care costs attributable to uterine fibroids exceed $2.1 billion annually. Fibroids are
      reported to cause a number of symptoms including heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding,
      pelvic pressure, pain with menses and bowel and bladder dysfunction. However, fibroid
      symptomatology is incompletely understood. Understanding and addressing the myomas pain are
      important in optimizing treatment outcomes and controlling health care costs from a societal
      perspective. This study proposes to optimally characterize symptoms and symptom relief in
      women with leiomyomas severe enough to seek interventional therapy. Secondly we will
      characterize a variety of symptoms utilizing standardized instruments for other pelvic
      diseases and symptoms to optimize comparisons with other disease processes.

      Clinical and scientific significance of the studies is high. We look to generate resources
      which can be used at a later time to assess the biologic and genetic variables affecting
      treatment outcome and to comprehensively assess the societal economic impact of uterine
      fibroids and their treatment with UAE and MRgFUS.

      Participants will be in the study for up to 36 months following fibroid treatment.

    <description>MRgFUS treatment will take place in a MRI machine and powerful ultrasound waves go through the abdominal wall to destroy the fibroid or fibroids. No incision is made during this treatment and light sedation is required. There are certain fibroids that may not be treated with this technique and there is no treatment of normal uterine tissue.ough the abdominal wall to destroy the fibroid.</description>

    <description>UAE treatment takes place on a regular x-ray machine. A small incision is made where the leg meets the trunk and a small tube is used to use very small pellets to block off the blood supply to the entire uterus. Sedation is used. Most fibroids are treated with this technique and normal uterine tissue is also affected.</description>
