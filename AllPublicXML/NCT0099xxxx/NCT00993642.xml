  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of
      acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to
      the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies that can target and overcome altered gene
      networks involved in controlling breast cancer progression. While patients with tumors over
      expressing HER1, 2, or 3 have been shown to have reduced survival, patients with those tumors
      which overexpressed HER4 (erbB4) had increased survival (Witton 2003).

      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, proof of principle trial. Selected are patients with
      advanced-stage breast cancer whose tumors are ER+, tamoxifen refractory. Histologically
      proven diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is advanced cancer for which there
      is no treatment available which would have a reasonable chance of cure. Treatment failure is
      defined as tumor progression after chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy. Patients will be given
      five 30mg doses of HDAC inhibitor (LBH) over a period of two weeks. A dose will be taken on
      Days 1,3,5,8 and 10. Patients will have a diagnostic tumor biopsy prior to drug
      administration and a diagnostic biopsy within 48 hours (2 days) of the last dose. Primary
      endpoints are measured by biopsy of palpable tumor with immunohistochemical staining for
      ERBB4. Secondary end points include the evaluation of cell death, apoptosis, with
      immunohistochemical staining for DNA breaks by TUNEL assay.
