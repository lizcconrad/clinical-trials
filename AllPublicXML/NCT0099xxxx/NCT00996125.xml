    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GlaxoSmithKline
      Biologicals' human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in pre-teen and adolescent female subjects
      aged 9 - 17 years. One group of subjects will receive the HPV vaccine and the other group
      will receive the control.

    <measure>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) for Antibodies Against Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 Antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after the third dose (at Month 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Titers were given as geometric mean titers and were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and expressed as Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Units Per Milliliter (EL.U/mL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 7</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti- HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination. Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti- HPV-18 antibodies.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7 days (Days 0 - 6) following each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any was defined as any solicited local symptom reported irrespective of intensity. Grade 3 pain was defined as pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as redness/swelling above 50 millimeter (mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7 days (Days 0 - 6) following each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were arthralgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal, headache, myalgia, rash, urticaria and fever (= axillary temperature above 37.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 fever = axillary temperature above 39.0°C. Grade 3 urticaria = urticaria distributed on at least 4 body areas. For other symptoms, any = occurrence of any general symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and grade 3 = a general symptom that prevented normal activity. Related was a general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Medically Significant Conditions (MSCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Medically significant conditions (MSCs) are defined as: adverse events (AEs) prompting emergency room or physician visits that are not (1) related to common diseases or (2) routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, or serious adverse events (SAEs) that are not related to common diseases. Common diseases include: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury.
MSCs were collected regardless of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30 days (Days 0 - 29) after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 was an event that prevented normal activities and related was defined as an unsolicited AE assessed by the investigator to be causally related to the study vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibodies</title>
        <description>Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti- HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination. Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti- HPV-18 antibodies.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 7</time_frame>
