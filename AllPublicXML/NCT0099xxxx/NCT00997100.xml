    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory open label single arm study to evaluate changes in disease activity
      and biomarkers in patients with mild active SLE, during treatment with ABR-215757 given as
      add-on to standard therapy. To be eligible for the study SLE patients should present with
      symptoms from skin, mouth and/or joints. After a screening period of one week patients will
      be treated with ABR-215757 for 12 weeks. The initial dose of ABR-215757 will be 1.5 mg/day.
      There will be an option to increase the dose to 3.0 mg/day following 28 days of treatment.
      Follow-up visits will take place 4 weeks and 8 weeks after last day of treatment. Disease
      activity during treatment will be studied using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus disease
      Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) as well as organ system specific disease activity indexes (CLASI
      for skin involvement and number of swollen/tender joints using 28- and 66/68-joint counts).
      At specified time points during the study, blood samples and biopsies will be collected for
      analysis of established and exploratory biomarkers of SLE. Concomitant SLE treatment allowed
      include: prednisolone or equivalent at a dose of ≤15 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine,
      azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil, all at stable doses from specified
      timepoints prior to the study and throughout the study.

    <textblock>
      All patients will initially receive ABR-215757 at 1.5 mg/day. There will be an option to
      increase the dose to 3.0 mg/day following 28 days of treatment. The selected dose levels (1.5
      and 3.0 mg/day ABR-215757) are predicted to be effective based on preclinical studies of
      autoimmune disease including the SLE MRL model. Previous experience in humans as well as in
      preclinical models supports safe administration of ABR-215757 at doses up to and including
      3.0 mg/day. The duration of the study is expected to be sufficient to detect changes in
      disease activity in this group of patients. Near steady state plasma levels of ABR-215757 in
      humans are reached in 14 days.

             method of contraception. All female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at the Screening and Baseline Visits. As interaction
             studies between ABR-215757 and oral contraceptives have not yet been performed, women
             using the contraceptive pill must also use a complementary contraceptive device, i.e.

             investigator's opinion would confound the study result or put the patient at risk.

         24. Patients likely to receive oral or intravenous steroids or immunosuppressant for other
             non-SLE condition during the study duration, as this will confound the study result.
