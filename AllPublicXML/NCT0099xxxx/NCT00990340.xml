      The purpose of this study is to obtain psychological response and user preference information
      on the use of the T jet® device versus the traditional subcutaneous injection administration
      of Tev Tropin®.

      This study will compare subject-reported injection anxiety immediately before the
      administration of each dose of Tev-Tropin® between a needle-syringe injection method and a
      needle-free injection method (T-jet®)

    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean subject-reported injection anxiety
      between the two injection methods as recorded on a 5-point FIS immediately before
      administration. A higher score denoted greater anxiety.

      The injection anxiety score was to be reported by the subject from a row of five faces with
      values ranging from 5 (the face with the most negative affect) to 1 (the face with the most
      positive affect).

    <description>The difference in mean subject-reported injection anxiety between the two injection methods as recorded on a 5 point scale immediately before administration, which scale consisted of a row of five faces with values from 1(most positive)to 5(most negative or greater anxiety.) The score is an average of the Period 1 (Days 1-14) and Period 2 (Days 15-28) assessments; like groups were combined and then averaged. There were 3 visits: Visit 1 (Begin Period 1) Screening and Randomized assignment, Visit 2 (first day of Period 2) Cross over to other assignment, Visit 3 End of Study.</description>
