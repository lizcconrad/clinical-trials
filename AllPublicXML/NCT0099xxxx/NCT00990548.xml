      The purpose of the FIT-O study was to estimate the prevalence of having a caregiver (paid
      and/or informal) among hospitalized cardiac patients by demographic factors such as patient
      age and race/ethnicity, and to link caregiver status to clinical outcomes following
      hospitalization. A secondary aim was to collect anonymous family tree data to provide an
      estimate of the number of first degree family members, their basic demographics, and the
      distance at which they live from the medical center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been established that cardiac caregivers are a vehicle by which health information can
      be transmitted, and that caregivers themselves may be at increased CVD risk. Our research
      evaluated the potential pool and demographic profile of cardiac caregivers as well as the
      role(s) they play in improving quality of patient care and to enhance adherence to secondary
      prevention guidelines post discharge. This research also provided important information about
      targeting educational efforts to specific caregivers to enhance the clinical outcomes of
      hospitalized coronary patients. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of
      caregiving in hospitalized cardiac patients by demographic factors such as patient age and
      race/ethnicity, and to link caregiving to clinical outcomes in cardiac patients. A secondary
      aim was to collect family tree data which would allow us to estimate the number of first
      degree family members, their basic demographics, and the distance at which they live from the
      medical center in order to determine the feasibility and scope of a targeted preventive
      intervention. The significance of this research is that it addressed specific challenges
      outlined in the recent NHLBI strategic plan to develop and evaluate programs to improve
      patient, provider, and health care system behavior and performance to enhance quality of care
      and health outcomes, especially in populations that experience a disproportionate disease
      burden. Unique information was obtained about caregivers as a potential intervention to
      improve preventive care and health outcomes of patients and families that suffer
      disproportionate CVD burden. Improved adherence to evidence-based preventive therapies could
      have a substantial public health benefit.
