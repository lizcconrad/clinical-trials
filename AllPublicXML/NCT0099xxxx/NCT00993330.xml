  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The macular pigment (MP) in humans consists of the yellow, blue-absorbing carotenoids lutein
      and zeaxanthin, which are contained in vegetables and fruits. The highest concentrations of
      lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the fovea. Since light entering the eye passes through the
      MP before reaching the photo receptors it absorbs a significant portion of short-wavelength
      light. There is evidence that these absorbing properties of the MP as well as the ability of
      inactivating highly reactive oxygen species are protective for the retina.

      Measurement of macular pigment is difficult and the investigators have recently proposed a
      way of measuring macular pigment optical density (MPOD) based on optical reflectometry. There
      is increased interest in these measurements in the recent years, because a number of studies
      has provided evidence that low fruit and vegetable consumption increases the risk of age
      related macular degeneration (AMD). The present study investigates MP optical density (OD) in
      healthy volunteers and is used to form a database.

      Furthermore the nutritional habits and the influence on MP density will be evaluated.
