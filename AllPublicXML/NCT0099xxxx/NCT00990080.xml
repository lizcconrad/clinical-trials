      To demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of two mixed primary immunization schedules:
      Pediacel® at 2 and 4 months of age followed by one dose of Infanrix™ IPV/Hib at 6 months of
      age; and, Infanrix™ IPV/Hib at 2 months of age, followed by Pediacel® at 4 and 6 months of
      age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunogenicity will be evaluated using the following:

      Serological outcome measures will be assessed on day 0 (visit 1) and 28-42 days after the 3rd
      dose of the primary series for both groups:

        -  Seroprotection rates for antibodies against PRP (anti-PRP), defined as percentage of
           subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml and ≥ 1.0 µg/ml.

        -  Geometric mean concentration (GMC) for antibodies against PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM.

        -  Anti-pertussis antibody concentrations ≥4-fold rise (post-Dose 3/pre-Dose 1).

      Safety will be evaluated using the following:

        -  Occurrence, time to onset, number of days of occurrence, severity and seriousness of
           solicited injection site reactions (tenderness, erythema, swelling) and systemic
           symptoms (fever, vomiting, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite decreased,
           irritability) within 8 days (Day 0 - Day 7) after each vaccination and across all
           vaccinations.

        -  Occurrence, nature, time to onset, duration, severity, and relationship to vaccination
           of unsolicited adverse events (AE) occurring within 31 days (Day 0 -Day 30) of each
           vaccination.

        -  Occurrence, nature, time to onset, duration, and relationship to vaccination of any
           serious adverse events (SAE) during the entire study period for all groups.
