    <textblock>
      Peri-operative fluid therapy is a controversial area with few randomized trials to guide
      practice. Fluid management has a significant influence on outcome following surgery. Yet
      practically, fluid prescription practice during this period is sub-optimal, resulting in
      avoidable iatrogenic complications.

      Several studies have assessed the effect of a 'liberal' vs. a 'restrictive' perioperative
      fluid regimen on post-operative outcome. However, most of these studies have focused
      primarily on intra-operative fluid management, whereas postoperative strategies have been
      less well defined, even though the immediate postoperative period is of critical importance
      to the patient's recovery. Moreover, whereas intra-operative fluid administration is
      monitored by the anesthesiologist, postoperatively it is less supervised and may result in
      excess or lack of intravenous (IV) fluids. Therefore, fluid management audit at the
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is of paramount importance for patient healthcare. The
      objective of this study is to follow and report the current practice of fluid administration
      in the PACU of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, for an extended period of time as a first
      step towards establishing evidence-based guidelines for postoperative fluid management.

      Background

      Perioperative intravenous (IV) fluid management has been a historically controversial issue
      in anesthesiology. Accumulating evidence suggest that regulated perioperative fluid
      management has beneficial effects on postoperative outcomes. A restricted perioperative IV
      fluid regimen aiming at unchanged body weight resulted in reduced complications after
      elective colorectal resection (1). In another study, patients receiving a reduced
      intraoperative fluid volume demonstrated less postoperative complications, lower morbidity
      rates and shorter hospital stay after intraabdominal surgery (2). Conversely, whereas
      restricted postoperative IV salt and water intake shortened gastrointestinal (GI) function
      and hospitalization after colonic resection in one study (3), it had no effect on the same
      outcomes in another randomized clinical trial (4).

      Despite the reported benefits of restrictive fluid therapy, this strategy may be associated
      with adverse outcomes. Inadequate fluid administration can lead to a reduced effective
      circulating volume resulting in inefficient tissue perfusion (5-7). On the other hand,
      overhydration, resulting from perioperative fluid excess, has shown association with
      deleterious effects on cardiac and pulmonary function (8-12), and on recovery of GI motility
      (2,3,13), tissue oxygenation (14), wound healing and coagulation (15-16). Erroneous fluid
      administration is generally associated with increased morbidity and postoperative
      complications (17-21). Altogether, these observations call for a standardized and regulated
      fluid therapy throughout the perioperative period taking into account patients' premorbid
      diseases and type of surgery.

      Previous studies have focused primarily on intra-operative fluid management. Postoperative
      strategies have been less well defined, even though the immediate postoperative period is of
      critical importance to the patient's recovery. Moreover, whereas intra-operative fluid
      administration is monitored by the anesthesiologist, postoperatively it is less supervised
      and may result in excess or lack of IV fluids.

      The aim of this study is thus to follow and present the current practice of fluid
      administration in the PACU of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, for an extended period of
      time as a first step towards establishing evidence-based guidelines for postoperative fluid
      management.

      Methods

      We will collect data regarding intra- and postoperative fluid administration from the charts
      of &gt;18 years old ASA I-III patients undergoing elective general or orthopedic surgery.
      Patients with renal/cardiac failure will be analyzed separately, since their pathology
      dictates extra caution with fluid therapy. Patients demographics, type of surgery, and the
      type and volume of fluids given during the operation and PACU stay, will be documented as
      well as the occurrence of morbidity in PACU, without any interventions. Data collection will
      be anonymous and will last six months. The setting will be the PACU of the Tal Aviv Sourasky
      Medical center.

      Suggested benefits

      The purpose of this data report is to provide an overview on the current practice of fluid
      management in Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center's PACU. We believe that this is a preliminary
      necessary step towards establishing guidelines for postoperative fluid management.

      Study Objective

      To describe the contemporary practice of postoperative fluid management in the PACU of the
      Sourasky Medical Center.
