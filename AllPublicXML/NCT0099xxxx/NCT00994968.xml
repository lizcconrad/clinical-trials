      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,
      docetaxel, and S-1, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving doxorubicin hydrochloride together with
      cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and S-1 before surgery in treating women with stage II or stage
      III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of pathologic complete response in women with previously untreated
           stage II or III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride and
           cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and S1.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of overall radiologic response in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of breast-conserving procedures in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival of these patients.

        -  Investigate the relevant pharmacogenomics and biomarker(s) which will be useful to
           predict any responses to the anticancer treatments.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive neoadjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses. Patients then receive docetaxel
      IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral S-1 on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4
      courses. Two to four weeks later, patients undergo surgery to remove the tumor (either
      breast-conserving procedures or mastectomy). Patients may then undergo radiotherapy and
      receive endocrine therapy.
