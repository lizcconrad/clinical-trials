      Study of the factors that affect interest in - and uptake of - genetic testing for variants
      that predispose to prostate cancer from the perspective of the patient.

      This study will use a mixed methods approach to follow men as they move through the genetic
      testing process, from initial contact through to receiving their genetic testing results. A
      questionnaire will be used to measure variables at both baseline and after proceeding through
      the testing process. A small cohort of men will be invited to be interviewed to gather some
      in depth qualitative data about the issues that have arisen during the study process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with a positive family history of prostate cancer. The definition of a positive
             family history will be: Men with a first degree relative with prostate cancer
             diagnosed at &lt;70 years; Men with two relatives with prostate cancer where at least on
             is diagnosed at &lt;70 years; Men with three relatives with prostate cancer diagnosed at
             any age

          -  Age 40-69 years

          -  No previous biopsy for raised PSA

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographic situation
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous prostate cancer

          -  Men from families where there is known to be a mutation in a high-risk prostate cancer
             gene

          -  Men who have had a prostate biopsy within the last 12 months.
