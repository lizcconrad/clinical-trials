  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major purpose of this exploratory developmental study will be to develop a
      patient-centered and feasible protocol for communicating genetic data as it relates to drug
      efficacy for smoking cessation inpatients receiving medication that is matched to individual
      genotypes associated with increased efficacy for bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy.

      Therefore, our specific aims are to:

      Aim 1: Conduct formative research to develop and refine a clinical protocol for a
      multi-component smoking cessation intervention, grounded in the extended parallel process
      model, consisting of pharmacogenetic treatment (smoking cessation drug matched to each
      individual smoker's genotype) and genetic feedback (delivery of patient-centered,
      personalized genotype information and its predictive value for smoking cessation treatment
      efficacy): We will adapt, pilot-test, and refine a theoretically-grounded PGx smoking
      cessation intervention using formative interviews of 20 African-American and
      European-ancestry smokers.

      Aim 2: Conduct a mixed-methods feasibility trial randomizing treatment-seeking smokers to
      pharmacogenetic (PGx) treatment combined with genetic feedback (GF) vs. PGx treatment without
      GF for smoking cessation to examine the feasibility of the newly developed protocol in a
      primary care setting and characterize its psychological and behavioral impact: Smokers (N =
      100) will be randomized to GF vs. no GF and all will receive motivational interviewing
      (standard care/SC) and PGx treatment. We will assess the impact of GF on time to relapse,
      medication adherence, and a comprehensive assessment battery of process and cognitive,
      psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we will synthesize quantitative and
      qualitative data to revise protocols, generate hypothesizes, and estimate effect sizes for a
      follow-up R01 submission.

          <title>Formative Interviews</title>
          <description>Phase 1 involved formative research to develop and refine a patient-centered, theoretically grounded behavioral intervention for delivering genetically-tailored smoking cessation treatment. We convened a panel of doctorate level experts (n = 10) in pharmacogenetics; smoking cessation treatment; ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research; genetic literacy; patient-clinician communications; and mixed-methods research to guide development of the pharmacogenetic treatment, GF and evaluation.
Next, smokers were asked about their familiarity with genetic concepts (e.g., DNA, genes), understanding of the roles genes play in smoking behavior and treatment response, reaction to the concept of genetically-tailoring pharmacotherapy, familiarity with the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, concerns about privacy of genetic information, and interest in genetically-tailored treatment. Interviews were continued until response saturation was achieved (n = 10).</description>
