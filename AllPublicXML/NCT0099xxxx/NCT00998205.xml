  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heart becoming &quot;stiff&quot; due to increased fibrous tissue or decreased elasticity of the
      heart tissue is one of the earliest changes caused by heart failure. These changes can be
      detected by simple non-invasive echocardiogram techniques. However, these techniques usually
      detect the increased &quot;stiffness&quot; of the heart only after it has progressed to a significant
      extent. The investigators hypothesize that if they stress the heart using a Dobutamine
      infusion and measure the filling pressure using echocardiogram, it will provide them with
      tools to identify these changes earlier.

      The heart becoming &quot;stiff&quot; due to increased fibrous tissue or decreased elasticity of the
      heart tissue is one of the earliest changes caused by heart failure. These changes can be
      detected by simple non-invasive echocardiogram techniques. However, these techniques usually
      detect the increased &quot;stiffness&quot; of the heart only after it has progressed to a significant
      extent. The investigators hypothesize that if they stress the heart using a Dobutamine
      infusion and measure the filling pressure using echocardiogram, it will provide them with
      tools to identify these changes earlier.

      The investigators are planning to include people have normal heart function. It is standard
      procedure to measure cardiac pressure during catheterization. Simultaneously, the
      investigators will infuse Dobutamine (standard drug used for chemical stress testing, DSE).
      This drug increases the heart rate and mimics exercise in normal humans who are unable to
      exercise for various reasons. The investigators would continue to monitor the pressure inside
      the heart as they infuse Dobutamine and see of there is an increase in filling pressure. The
      investigators will correlate the invasive pressures with their echo derived measurements.

      The investigators plan to include 25 veterans in this study. For each individual the study
      would increase the amount of time they will spend in the Catheterization Lab from 30 to 120
      minutes. The entire procedure will be monitored by Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
      certified nurses and doctors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prospectively enroll 25 veterans age range from 18 to 65 who are found to have normal
             left ventricular (LV) systolic function and no significant coronary artery disease by
             cardiac catheterization.

          -  Subjects identified during routine cardiac testing to have significant diastolic
             dysfunction may also be enrolled to rule out coronary disease and study DSE -invasive
             pressure correlations.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with LV systolic dysfunction, severe coronary lesions (&gt; 50%), uncontrolled
             hypertension (BP &gt; 160/100) and significant pulmonary hypertension (PASP &gt; 50 mmHg)
             would be excluded.

          -  Subject will not be included if they have a significant rhythm abnormality, frequent
             premature ventricular complexes, atrial fibrillation and technical reasons in the
             catheterization laboratory which preclude the study protocol.

          <description>Dobutamine intravenous infusion would be undertaken starting at 10 micrograms/kg per minute in three minute intervals increased to 20, 30, 40 or 50 micrograms/kg per minute or to a peak heart rate response of at least 85% age predicted maximum heart rate. If at the end of the Dobutamine protocol, there is inadequate heart rate response, intravenous atropine boluses of 0.5 milligrams (maximum 1.0 mg) would be used as needed to achieve a heart rate of at least 85% of age predicted maximum heart rate.</description>
