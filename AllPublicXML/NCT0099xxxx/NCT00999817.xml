    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female of non childbearing potential subjects between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Subjects must be CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, ultrarapid metabolizers or
             intermediate metabolizers, as predicted by CYP2D6 genotyping.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for men (1 drink =5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the
             first dose of study medication. Depo ProveraÂ® must be discontinued at least 6 months
             prior to the first dose of study medication. As an exception,
             acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of &lt;1 g/day. Limited use of non
             prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the overall
             results the study may be permitted on a case by case basis.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.
