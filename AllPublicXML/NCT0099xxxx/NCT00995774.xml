  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and test a new robotic system to accommodate practice
      of tasks requiring reach, grasp and release of objects. Our previous work has shown that the
      MIME robot is safe and effective for improving reach in stroke subjects. But adequate control
      of hand movements is critical to a functional upper limb, and is often resistant to
      conventional therapeutic interventions. Many stroke survivors have residual ability to flex
      the fingers, but extension is often limited and impeded by increased passive stiffness in
      flexors, abnormal levels of increased tone in flexors and weakness in extensors. In a recent
      study, 38% of stroke survivors reported that impaired hand function was the most disabling
      motor impairment they faced.

      Research Design:

      We hypothesize that: 1) Gains in proximal arm function (shoulder, elbow) immediately after
      robotic training will be greater than after dose-matched conventional therapy; 2) Unlike in
      previous studies, gains in hand function immediately after robotic training will be greater
      than after dose-matched conventional therapy.

      Methodology:

      In the first year of the study, we will develop a robotic system with the ability to assist
      hand movement. Since many stroke survivors in the subacute and chronic recovery stages have
      residual ability to flex the fingers but severely limited finger extension, we will build a
      hand exoskeleton that can apply precise extension forces to the digits of the hand. This
      exoskeleton will be integrated with the ARMin III arm exoskeleton so that tasks such as arm
      reach, grasp of an object and release of the object can be trained. In the last 2 years of
      the project, we will perform a pilot clinical trial comparing this new training paradigm to
      dose-matched conventional therapy in chronic stroke survivors. Outcome measures will be taken
      before training and immediately after training.

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was through &quot;word of mouth&quot; with therapists at the outpatient clinics of the DC Veterans Affair Medical Center and the MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital. Recruitment took place approximately between 9/2010 and 3/2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Fourteen individuals were recruited. One subject was excluded due to a prior orthopedic injury and another subject did not meet the Folstein Mini–Mental State Examination criterion. Two subjects completed the protocol up through the intial training period and the washout period, but did not return for the second therapy block.</pre_assignment_details>
