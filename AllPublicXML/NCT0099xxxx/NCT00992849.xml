  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the inhibitory
      effect of bevacizumab (Avastin) with different routes including topical and subconjunctival
      application on corneal neovascularization in the human eyes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The compassionate off-label use of bevacizumab as well as the potential risks, benefits, and
      adverse effects of this medication are discussed extensively with each patient. To further
      minimize systemic absorption, silicone punctual plugs are placed in the lower eyelids. One
      group of patients apply topical bevacizumab, 1.0%(10mg/ml), 4 times of day. The other group
      of patients received subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab(2.5mg/0.1ml) once. The patients
      are examined at 1day, 1week, 2weeks, 3weeks, and 1month, then monthly till the corneal
      neovascularization are gone or reduced to some degrees. Best-corrected visual acuity,
      slip-lamp examination, tonometry, external photography, pachymetry, specular microscopy (if
      possible), and systemic blood pressure are completed at all visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant unilateral or bilateral corneal neovascularization that extending over the
             limbus at least 2mm.

          -  The underlying etiologies that caused corneal neovascularization included post
             penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), ocular surface reconstruction , trauma, infectious or
             non-infectious corneal ulcer.

          -  Corneal neovascularization induced lipid keratopathy, corneal edema, or irregular
             corneal surface. The best-corrected visual acuity was less than 20/25.

          -  Post-PSP or ocular surface reconstruction corneal neovascularization that had no
             associated lipid keratopathy, no corneal edema, or corneal irregularity. But the
             neovascularization was highly possible to cause graft rejection.

          -  The corneal neovascularization was refractory to other medical treatment.

          -  The patient had received PKP or other corneal surgeries mort than half a year ago and
             was not in the acute post-operation phase.

          -  The patient had no active endophthalmitis, glaucoma with uncontrolled intraocular
             pressure, or vitreoretinal diseases.

          -  The patient signed inform consent to have regular follow up and treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The neovascularization had clinical improvement three months before the first
             injection.

          -  The lipid keratopathy had clinical improvement three months before the first
             injection.

          -  The patient that suspected to have poor visual outcome or had already been light sense
             negative Glaucoma patient that had uncontrolled intraocular pressure.

          -  Poor corneal epithelialization.

          -  Patient that had systemic disease which was not suitable for bevacizumab use.

          -  Pregnant patient.
