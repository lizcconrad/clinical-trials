  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ovicidal activity of three head lice treatment
      products.

      The study population will consist of Queensland primary school-aged children (Grades 1 - 7)
      who have at least 20 live eggs on the hair and who have not used any head lice product in the
      four weeks prior to the study.

      Enrollment will continue to achieve 30 subjects in each treatment group (total of 90
      subjects).

      Subjects will be examined for the presence of head louse eggs. Those subjects who have at
      least 20 live eggs will be randomised into one of 3 treatment groups: NeutraLice Lotion,
      NeutraLice Advance or Moov Head Lice Solution treatment groups.

      Pre-treatment: 10 eggs will be removed from the head by cutting the single hair with the live
      egg attached, before the treatment.

      Treatment: The subject will then receive a single treatment application according to
      manufacturers instructions. Then the treatment will be washed from the hair as per the
      manufacturer's instructions.

      Post-treatment: At least 10 treated (live) eggs will be removed from the head by cutting the
      single hair with the egg attached, after the treatment.

      All of the eggs will be held in an incubator for 14 days. The proportion of eggs which hatch
      after 14 days will be compared for the pre-treatment and post-treatment eggs. Demographic
      data will be collected for each subject (hair type, hair colour, hair length, subject age,
      subject sex) to investigate the affect of hair type on ovicidal efficacy.
