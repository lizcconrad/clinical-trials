    <textblock>
      The MBD-5D is a prospective observational study with a case-cohort and a cohort design.
      Eligible patients are receiving hemodialysis and have secondary hyperparathyroidism. The
      study's three goals are (1) to record the patients' characteristics, and variation in the
      patterns of their treatment; (2) to analyze factors associated with variation in those
      medical practice patterns; and (3) to identify practice patterns and other factors that
      affect hospitalization, mortality, and other patient-level outcomes.

      The MBD-5D is a 3-year prospective observational study with a case-cohort and a cohort
      design. Eligible patients comprise all patients who are receiving hemodialysis at the
      participating facilities, and who also have secondary hyperparathyroidism(2HPT). The study
      has 3 goals: to record the characteristics of those patients and variation in the patterns of
      their treatment; to analyze factors associated with variation in those medical practice
      patterns; and to identify the practice patterns and other factors that affect
      hospitalization, mortality, and other patient-level outcomes. In the case-cohort study, the
      outcomes are relatively infrequent events (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality). The
      cohort study includes a randomly selected sample of 40% of all study participants; and the
      outcomes are hospitalization, parathyroid interventions, bone fracture, MBD management
      status, etc. Explanatory variables comprise medications and other factors likely to be
      associated with outcomes of dialysis and of 2HPT, and facility-level practice patterns.
