      The purpose of this investigation, using hardcopy film, is to compare the accuracy of the
      Philips MammoDiagnost DR (FFDM device) and screen-film (SF) mammography in detection of
      breast cancer among women undergoing screening or diagnostic mammography.

      Per the new FDA Guidance document for FFDM, accuracy in comparison to Screen-film is no
      longer required.

      The proposed research study is a prospective enriched reader trial in which patients who meet
      the study's eligibility criteria, subject to certain constraints specified in this protocol,
      will undergo both SF and the investigational Philips FFDM mammography. Two to five sites will
      participate as image acquisition centers. Images will be read by 9 mammographers reading the
      SF and Philips FFDM acquired images at various locations under the supervision of study
      managers.

      Per the new FDA Guidance document for FFDM (Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
      Full-Field Digital Mammography System), there is no longer a requirement for screen film
      images for a comparison and a reader study to determine accuracy is not required. 10 images
      acquired under protocols 2008-002a, 2010-002a and a European site will be read in a MQSA type
      study. This record has been modified to support the new FDA Guidance document.

      The reviewers will evaluate the cases, using soft copy and hard copy images, noting the
      mammographic attributes for each case and documenting the findings on a clinical image
      evaluation form, which is very similar to what is used for MQSA Accreditation.

      The following attributes will be assessed: in order to provide an overall assessment of
      whether these image sets collectively are of sufficient acceptable quality for mammography:

        -  Breast positioning, assessing coverage of the breast on craniocaudal(CC) and
           medio-lateral oblique (MLO) views, separately;

        -  Exposure, assessing visualization of the adipose and fibroglandular tissues and
           visualization of breast tissue underlying the pectoralis muscle, separately;

        -  Breast compression, assessing overlapping breast structures, uniformity of exposure of
           fibroglandular tissues, adequacy of penetration of thicker portions of the breast,
           exposure of thinner areas, and motion unsharpness;

        -  Image contrast for differentiation of subtle tissue density differences;

        -  Sharpness, assessing the edges of fine linear structures and tissues;

        -  Borders and benign calcifications;

        -  Tissue visibility at the skin line;

        -  Noise, i.e., noise obscuring breast structures or suggestive of structures not actually
           present;

        -  Artifacts due to image processing, detector failure and other factors external to the
           breast on hard-copy and soft-copy displays; and

        -  Overall clinical image quality

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was initiated at out primary Diagnostic site in April 2010 and concluded in February 2011. A total of 35 diagnostic cases were obtained. Recruitment was initiated at out primary Screening site in May 2010 and concluded in November 2011. A total of 67 screening cases were obtained.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial was to evaluate performance of a FFDM system. During image acquisition FDA modified the trial criteria from an efficacy trial to a SE trial. Images from our diag site prior to Nov could not be used in this study as mag views were now required. Mag views were acquired in Jan-Feb 2011. Selected images were used from our screen site.</pre_assignment_details>
