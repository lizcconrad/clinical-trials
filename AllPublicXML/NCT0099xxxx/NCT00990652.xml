  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      bortezomib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed. Giving bortezomib together with temozolomide after surgery may kill
      any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib before surgery followed by giving
      bortezomib together with temozolomide after surgery works in treating patients with recurrent
      malignant glioma.

    <textblock>
      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, and 8. Patients then undergo surgical resection
      of the tumor on day 8 or 9.

      Beginning approximately 14 days after surgery, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-7
      and 14-21 and bortezomib IV on days 7 and 21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker analysis, gene
      methylation studies, and pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <measure>Number of Patients Surviving Without Disease Progression After 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first treatment until disease progression, death, or early discontinuation of treatment (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be monitored from date of first treatment to the date of first observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurologic progression or increasing steroid requirements, death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. Progression-free survival will be defined as the absence of any of the above after 6 months.
Progression (defined by MacDonald Criteria) is a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed compared to baseline, OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to the cancer).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving a Response to Treatment (Either Complete or Partial Response) as Defined by MacDonald Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of treatment post-surgery and then approximately every 8 weeks thereafter until off treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This measure was assessed only in patients who had residual tumor post-operatively. Per MacDonald Criteria:
Complete Response requires complete disappearance of all measurable &amp; evaluable disease, no new lesions, no evidence of non-evaluable disease, and only minimal or no use of steroids.
Partial Response is defined as &gt;= 50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, no progression of evaluable disease, and no new lesions. Responders must be on the same or decreasing doses of steroid.
Response was assessed by imaging (MRI or CT with contrast).</description>

    <measure>Number of Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Adverse Events Observed During Study Treatment (Defined by CTCAE v 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 4, 8 pre-surgery, and then at the start of every cycle (approximately every 4 weeks) post-surgery while on treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. In general, AEs are graded according to the following:
Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study opened on May 21, 2009 with an accrual goal of 29 patients; the study was designed to enroll 10 patients initially and do an interim efficacy assessment. Accrual was suspended on February 11, 2011 for this analysis. The interim results did not support further accrual, and so the study was permanently closed to accrual on March 29, 2011.</recruitment_details>

        <description>The effects of bortezomib on the endogenous modulators of NF-Kappa B pathways, especially the NFKBIA gene (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha) were assessed using novel assay technology; expression of NFKBIA was then correlated with response to therapy and patient survival.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients Surviving Without Disease Progression After 6 Months</title>
        <description>Patients will be monitored from date of first treatment to the date of first observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurologic progression or increasing steroid requirements, death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. Progression-free survival will be defined as the absence of any of the above after 6 months.
Progression (defined by MacDonald Criteria) is a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed compared to baseline, OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to the cancer).</description>

Once recovered from surgery (approximately 14 days later), patients receive combination treatment with temozolomide and bortezomib in periods called cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks or 28 days). Temozolomide (75 mg/m^2) is taken by mouth on days 1-7 and 14-21 of each cycle, and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) is given intravenously (IV) on days 7 and 21 of each cycle. Patients continue to receive cycles of treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months.</description>

        <description>This measure was assessed only in patients who had residual tumor post-operatively. Per MacDonald Criteria:
Complete Response requires complete disappearance of all measurable &amp; evaluable disease, no new lesions, no evidence of non-evaluable disease, and only minimal or no use of steroids.
Partial Response is defined as &gt;= 50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, no progression of evaluable disease, and no new lesions. Responders must be on the same or decreasing doses of steroid.
Response was assessed by imaging (MRI or CT with contrast).</description>

            <description>Patients receive an injection of bortezomib 1.7mg/m^2 on days 1, 4 and 8. Patients then undergo their standard of care surgery on day 8 or 9 to remove the tumor. Once recovered from surgery, patients receive combination treatment with temozolomide and bortezomib in periods called cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Temozolomide is taken by mouth on days 1-7 and 14-21 of each cycle, and bortezomib injections are given on days 7 and 21 of each cycle.
Bortezomib: Before surgery, an injection of bortezomib is given on days 1, 4, and 8. After surgery, bortezomib is given on days 7 and 21 of each cycle (1 cycle = 28 days).
Temozolomide: After surgery, temozolomide is taken by mouth on days 1-7 and 14-21 of each cycle (1 cycle = 28 days).</description>
