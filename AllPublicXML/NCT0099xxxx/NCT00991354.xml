      An effective vaccine may be the only way to stop the HIV pandemic. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the safety of and immune response to the DNA vaccine, PENNVAX-B with or
      without an IL-12 adjuvant when given using electroporation.

      An effective and safe vaccine must be developed in order to halt the HIV pandemic. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immune response to the HIV DNA vaccine,
      PENNVAX-B when given with and without an IL-12 adjuvant and delivered via electroporation.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and will visit
      the study clinic 9 times over 9 months. Group 1 will enroll first. Participants in this group
      will receive 3 mg of the PENNVAX-B or placebo vaccine at Months 0, 1, and 3. Once safety data
      has been examined for Group 1, Group 2 will begin enrollment. Group 2 participants will
      receive 3 mg of PENNVAX-B vaccine plus 1 mg of IL-12 adjuvant or placebo at Months 0, 1, and
      3. Once Group 1 and Group 2 safety data have been collected Group 3 will begin enrollment.
      These participants will also receive 3 mg of PENNVAX-B vaccine plus 1 mg of IL-12 adjuvant or
      placebo at Months 0, 1, and 3.

      At clinic visits participants will have physical exams and blood and urine collected. After
      receiving study injections, participants will be observed in the clinic for at least 30
      minutes. In addition, participants will be asked to monitor symptoms for 3 days after each
      injection.
