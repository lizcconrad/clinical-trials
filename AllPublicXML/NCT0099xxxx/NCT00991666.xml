  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several methods have been proposed for the measurement of pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF).
      The pneumatic tonometer, which is commercially available, assesses POBF by measurement of
      intraocular pressure (IOP) changes during the cardiac cycle. The investigators have recently
      developed a method for the measurement of ocular fundus pulsation, which is based on laser
      interferometry. In contrast to the Langham system the method is non-contractile and yields a
      high topographic resolution. Moreover, the pneumatic tonometer assesses the ocular pressure
      pulse, whereas ocular fundus pulsation is a point measure of the ocular volume pulse. These
      two parameters are related by the ocular rigidity, which refers to the mechanical properties
      of the eye coats.

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the
      industrialized nations. The mechanisms behind this severe eye disease are, however, still
      obscure. It has been hypothesized that alterations in choroidal blood flow and ocular
      rigidity may contribute to the development and progression of AMD. However, there is
      currently little data to confirm this hypothesis. The present study is an attempt to
      investigate choroidal blood flow and ocular rigidity by employing laser interferometric
      measurement of fundus pulsation and pneumotonometric measurement of fundus pulsation.
