    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in obese patients. Most of vitamin D supplementation studies
      were done with non-obese subjects. This study looks at vitamin D supplementation requirements
      in obese patients as compared to non-obese subjects. This study also looks at changes in
      vitamin D level in obese patients undergoing medical weight loss. It is thought that obese
      patients have vitamin D deficiency through storage of vitamin D in the fat compartment not
      readily available for blood measurement. The investigators' hypothesis is that with medical
      weight loss vitamin D levels will increase in obese subjects.

      We intend to study changes in serum 25(OH)D level with calorie restricted weight loss in
      obese subjects. This will be a double dummy, placebo controlled randomized trial. Subjects
      whose serum 25(OH)D level is below 80 nmol/L will be assigned randomly to either the vitamin
      D supplemented or the placebo group. Those who are assigned to the placebo group will be
      weighed on a weekly basis and serum 25(OH)D level will be followed every 8 weeks for a
      minimum of 16 weeks and extended to the duration of weight loss along with serum calcium
      level. Changes in serum 25(OH)D level will be obtained with weight loss through restricted
      caloric intake.

      To study the 25(OH)D dose-response curve with vitamin D supplementation in obese subjects,
      vitamin D supplemented group will receive initial daily vitamin D3 supplementation dose based
      on their baseline serum 25(OH)D level as described in Methods and Procedures section. Serum
      25(OH)D levels will be drawn at 8 weeks and adjustments to the dose will be made based on the
      an algorithm to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels between 80 and 140 nmol/L. The dose-response
      curve obtained at 8 weeks will be compared to the one already established with non-obese
      subjects. Serum 25(OH)D level will be obtained at 16 weeks and compared with the data
      available from non-obese subjects.
