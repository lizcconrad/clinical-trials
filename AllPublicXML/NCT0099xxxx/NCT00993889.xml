  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to determine whether Virtual Reality (VR) analgesia continues to be effective
      for reducing pain when administered for a clinically relevant treatment duration over
      multiple, repeated exposures (i.e., up to ten sessions of physical therapy per patient).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is done in a hospital for inpatients pediatrics. By randomization some subjects
      will immersive Virtual Reality (VR) during a painful procedure on daily basis up to 10 days
      to see whether this will reduce the pain and anxiety.
