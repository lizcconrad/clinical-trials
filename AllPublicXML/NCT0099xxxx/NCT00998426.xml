      HepaGam B Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) solution contains 10% maltose, which could
      possibly interfere with the measurement of glucose levels when using glucose non-specific
      tests. The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of HepaGam B HBIG shows an
      increase in glucose levels in the body using non-specific glucose monitoring, as well as
      specific glucose monitoring. The sponsor believes that this medication will not cause a
      significant increase in glucose levels in the body when measured by glucose non-specific
      tests.

      BACKGROUND:

      Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) is used post liver transplantation (OLT) in hepatitis B
      surface antigen-positive recipients to prevent recurrence of hepatitis B. One formulation of
      HBIG, HepaGam B, contains the disaccharide maltose, which can potentially falsely elevate
      glucose readings when glucose nonspecific point of care (GNSPOC) testing is used, such as a
      glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ)-based method. This can result in
      inappropriate administration of antidiabetic agents and resultant episodes of clinically
      significant hypoglycemia. Glucose specific point of care (GSPOC) testing, such as a glucose
      oxidase-based method, however, is not affected by the presence of maltose. The purpose of
      this study was to determine if there was a significant difference in glucose readings using
      GSPOC and GNSPOC monitoring devices after HBIG administration.

      METHODS:

      This is a nonrandomized, prospective study evaluating patients receiving maintenance HBIG
      therapy over 3 months post liver transplantation. Blood glucose levels in each subject were
      analyzed by GSPOC and GNSPOC devices at specific times around HBIG administration.

    <description>Glucose monitoring before and after HepaGam B administration. Prior to receiving the dose of HepaGam B HBIG, blood glucose will be monitored in 3 manners. These will include two finger stick tests, one with a glucose-specific monitoring device and one with a glucose non-specific monitoring device; a venous blood glucose level; and a urine glucose test. Patients will receive the HBIG infusion and then immediately after the dose will have the same blood glucose tests repeated (finger sticks, venous glucose and urine glucose). Then at 60 minutes and 120 minutes after the dose is given, patients will again have finger stick tests with the glucose specific and glucose non-specific monitoring devices.</description>

          <description>Study procedures will occur one time between post-op day 1 and post-op day 7. These will include blood glucose monitoring prior to and after (various time points for 2 hours after) infusion with HBIG.
Prior to receiving the dose of HepaGam B HBIG, blood glucose will be monitored in 3 manners. These will include two finger stick tests, one with a glucose-specific monitoring device and one with a glucose non-specific monitoring device; a venous blood glucose level; and a urine glucose test. Patients will receive the HBIG infusion and then immediately after the dose will have the same blood glucose tests repeated (finger sticks, venous glucose and urine glucose). Then at 60 minutes and 120 minutes after the dose is given, patients will again have finger stick tests with the glucose specific and glucose non-specific monitoring devices.Subjects will be given 20,000 IU HepaGam B after the initial blood glucose monitoring, and prior to the post-infusion blood glucose monitoring</description>
