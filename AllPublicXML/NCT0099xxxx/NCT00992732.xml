    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with HQK-1004 and valganciclovir will
      result in complete or partial responses in patients with EBV-positive lymphoid malignancies
      or lymphoproliferative disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed lymphoid malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder with EBV
             detected by either immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization. Pathology can be
             assessed on either a current or previous biopsy. All disease stages are eligible

          -  Disease that is refractory or relapsed after at least one prior standard therapeutic
             regimen, which includes biologic agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), chemotherapy or
             chemoradiotherapy regimens. Prior therapy may include high dose chemotherapy and stem
             cell rescue or bone marrow transplantation

          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI; patients with sensitivity to contrast or for tumor types that
             are less accurately measured by CT) scan or physical measurement (cutaneous lesions
             only) with at least 1 lesion ≥ 10 mm in the greatest diameter. PET-CT should be used
             at baseline for patients with Hodgkin's Disease (HD) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
             (DLBCL).

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm3 and platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times upper limit of normal (ULN) with the exception of patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome (bilirubin ≤ 3.5 times ULN allowed), and both AST and ALT ≤ 3 times
             ULN

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from previous treatment with chemotherapy

          -  Patients who have been treated with biologic agents within two weeks prior to first
             dose of HQK-1004

          -  Uncontrolled ischemic heart disease or uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or
             myocardial infarction within the past 3 months
