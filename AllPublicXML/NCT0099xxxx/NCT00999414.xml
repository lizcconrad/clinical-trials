  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use, open-label, IND study for the purpose of providing carfilzomib
      to patients with relapsed or resistant refractory multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol has been designed for relapsing or refractory multiple myeloma patients. A
      maximum of 30 patients may be treated on this protocol.

      Since this is a compassionate use study of an investigational agent, the size is determined
      by agreement with the manufacturer of carfilzomib. Therefore, the time period for enrollment
      and accrual number will be limited to N=30.

    <description>Carfilzomib (20mg/m2) IV push to be given at maximum rate of 10ml/minute on Days 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1 only.
Carfilzomib (27mg/m2) IV bolus to be given at maximum rate of 10ml/minute on Day 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycle 1, then through Cycle 2 and beyond if initial dosing with 20mg/m2 tolerated.
For patients who tolerated 27mg/m2 through cycle 2 Days 1 and 2, Carfilzomib dose may be escalated to 36mg/m2 on days 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 2. If tolerated, subsequent cycles will utilize 36mg/m2.</description>
