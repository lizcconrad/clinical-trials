  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn more about how to lower the patient's risk of
      the most common complications after their pancreas operation. After tumors are removed and
      the remaining part of the pancreas is connected to the intestine or closed, a leakage of
      pancreatic fluid may occur. This fluid may form an &quot;abscess&quot; (collection of pus) or &quot;fistula&quot;
      that would need to be drained. A fistula is a persistent leakage of pancreatic fluid that
      sometimes occurs after pancreatic surgery. Fistulas, leaks, and abscesses are complications
      that are seen in roughly every 15-20 patients out of every 100 that have pancreas surgeries.
      Complications like these extend the patient's stay in the hospital after surgery. These
      complications may require the patient's doctor to perform additional tests or procedures to
      treat them.

      The physical and emotional burden these complications place upon patients, as well as the
      financial cost to the health care system, can be great. The surgeons at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a study to determine if a drug, SOM230, can help
      reduce the rate of these complications. SOM230, also known as Pasireotide, is a drug that has
      been observed to reduce the rate of similar complications in other studies.

      The surgeon would like to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of SOM230 with &quot;placebo&quot;
      (solution without medication) to see if SOM230 reduces the rate of fistulas, leaks and
      abscesses.

    <description>Patients will receive subcutaneous injection of SOM230 or placebo (NS, equivalent volume) on the day of operation prior to resection in the pre-surgical center. The initial subcutaneous injection of drug or placebo will be given at least one hour prior but no longer than 8 hours prior to transection of the pancreas. Patients will be continuously monitored in the OR following this dose administration, and both their cardiac and respiratory status will be closely followed.
Postoperatively patients will receive study drug or placebo every 12 hours. Subcutaneous injections will continue until postoperative day 7, with the last dose administered in the evening on postoperative day 6, or until a pancreatic complication has been identified.</description>

            <description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III trial of SOM230 vs. saline placebo in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy at MSKCC. Pasireotide (SOM230): Patients will receive subcutaneous injection of SOM230 or placebo (NS, equivalent volume) on the day of operation prior to resection in the pre-surgical center. The initial subcutaneous injection of drug or placebo will be given at least one hour prior but no longer than 8 hours prior to transection of the pancreas. Patients will be continuously monitored in the OR following this dose administration, and both their cardiac and respiratory status will be closely followed. Postoperatively patients will receive study drug or placebo every 12 hours. Subcutaneous injections will continue until postoperative day 7, with the last dose administered in the evening on postoperative day 6, or until a pancreatic complication has been identified.</description>
