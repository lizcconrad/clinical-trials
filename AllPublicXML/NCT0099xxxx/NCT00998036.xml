      This is a Phase I research study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      cisplatin, temsirolimus, and erlotinib in combination for treatment in triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stratification of breast cancer patients for treatment targeting either the estrogen
      receptor (ER) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor based upon the
      measurement of ER/progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 in tumor tissue has changed the
      treatment of breast cancer. However, the success of this stratification has resulted in the
      recognition that no effective rational treatment exists for patients that lack these
      receptors. The term &quot;triple negative breast cancer&quot; (TNBC) has been used to define a class of
      unresponsive patients, which is based upon their lack of the hormone receptors for estrogen
      and progesterone and the HER2 oncogene. TNBC represents a form of breast cancer for which no
      targeted therapy is known.

      Thus, identifying and understanding the signaling pathways and receptors that contribute to
      triple negative tumor growth is of high priority in order to develop therapies analogous to
      the ones that have already been developed for HER2 and ER.

      Available data from Phase I trials have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors
      have been safely given together at doses shown to inhibit their respective targets and Phase
      II studies are ongoing in advanced renal cell, pancreatic, glioma, and breast (not
      specifically TNBC) cancers.

      The rationale for adding cisplatin to erlotinib and an mTOR inhibitor are many. Cisplatin is
      a known active cytotoxic against breast cancer. It has non overlapping toxicity with
      erlotinib and TORC1 mTOR inhibitors and patients are unlikely to have been previously treated
      with cisplatin. Therefore, as a cytotoxic DNA damaging agent, cisplatin could trigger cell
      death in a cell whose survival pathways are effectively inhibited by mTOR inhibition and
      erlotinib.

    <description>Temsirolimus will be administered intravenously weekly on days one and eight of a three week cycle. Temsirolimus will not be given on week three (usually dosed weekly) for increased tolerability given its possible plasma accumulation during week three. Temsirolimus will be given second over a 30 minute infusion during posthydration.
Dose escalation will follow the standard 3 by 3 design with three set dosing levels.
