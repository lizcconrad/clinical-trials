    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and activity of
      Rituximab-Bendamustine-Cytarabine(R-BAC) regimen in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
      aged 65 years or more, as well as in younger patients who are not eligible for intensive
      regimens including/not including autologous transplantation.

      Since Bendamustine has recently shown promising safety and efficacy in combination with
      monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of patients with MCL, the goal of this study is to
      investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of combining Ara-C with Bendamustine and
      Rituximab (R-BAC). All three agents exhibit individual and unique mechanisms of action in
      MCL, and a synergistic or additive effect might be expected when these agents are used in
      combination, as suggested by the pre-clinical studies.

             affect the interpretation of the results, or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.
