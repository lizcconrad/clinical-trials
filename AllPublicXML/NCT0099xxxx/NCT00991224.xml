  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being carried out to study a new way to possibly treat HIV. T‐cells
      are one of the white blood cells used by the body to fight HIV. CD8 T‐cells are a type of
      T‐cell used by the body to detect and kill cells which have been infected by foreign viruses
      or organisms, including the HIV virus. CD8 T‐cells must identify the HIV virus in order to
      kill it. Because HIV is constantly changing the way it looks to the CD8 T‐cells, some of the
      HIV virus escapes detection and is not killed by the CD8 T‐cells.

      This research study uses a T cell receptor (TCR) protein specific for HIV (SL9 TCR) and adds
      it to the CD8 T‐cells in the laboratory in order to help the CD8 T‐cells recognize the
      constantly changing HIV virus and make it able to fight HIV more efficiently. TCR stands for
      T cell receptor. TCRs are found on the surface of T cells and allow the T cells to recognize
      other cells. Laboratory studies have shown that when CD8 T‐cells are modified with SL9 TCRs,
      they kill cells that are infected with HIV better than normal CD8 T‐cells can. On the basis
      of these laboratory results, there is the potential that SL9 TCRs may work in people infected
      with HIV and improve their immune system by killing HIV infected cells and thus may help
      control HIV infection.

      Two different SL9 TCRs will be tested in this study, WT‐gag‐TCR and α/6‐gag‐TCR. Two
      different types of SL9 TCRs are being used in this research study because the laboratory
      studies suggest that the different SL9 TCRs will function differently depending on the amount
      of virus in your body. A goal of this clinical study is to test the effects of infusions of
      either SL9 TCR in the presence or absence of a viral load.

      All subjects who receive WT‐gag‐TCR or the α/6‐gag‐TCR T cells will be enrolled in a Long
      Term Follow up study to monitor subjects. Subjects will be followed every 6 months for five
      years following the 1st infusion of the T cells. If the WT‐gag‐TCR or the α/6‐gag‐TCR T cells
      are no longer found in the blood after five years, then subjects will be contacted yearly for
      the next 10 years. If the WT‐gag‐TCR or the α/6‐gag‐TCR T cells are found in the blood at
      five years after the 1st infusion of T cells, then the subjects will continue to be seen once
      a year until the WT‐gag‐TCR or the α/6‐gag‐TCR T cells are no longer found in the blood for a
      maximum of 15 years.
