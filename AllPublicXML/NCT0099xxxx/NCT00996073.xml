  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of NeoFuse in
      subjects with a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in 1 or 2 adjacent vertebral
      levels between L1 and S1. All subjects in this study will undergo interbody fusion via
      Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) or Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF)
      procedures with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved/cleared supplemental posterior
      instrumentation.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled Phase 2 study designed
      to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of adult, allogeneic mesenchymal precursor
      cells (MPCs) combined with MasterGraft Matrix when compared to use of autologous iliac crest
      bone graft in the lumbar interbody fusion site in subjects requiring 1 or 2 level interbody
      fusion procedure with instrumentation. All subjects in this study will undergo a 1 or 2-level
      (2 or 3 vertebrae) interbody fusion with supplemental posterior instrumentation.

      After the screening and surgical visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and
      radiographically within 3 days and 30 days after surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36
      months after surgery.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the same time points for safety.
