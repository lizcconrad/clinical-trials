    <textblock>
      Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive impairment,
      communication dysfunction, stereotypic movement disorder, and growth failure. Rett syndrome
      is caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG-Binding Protein-2 (MECP2) gene and has no treatment.

      A mouse experimental model of Rett syndrome created by genetic invalidation of the MECP2 gene
      is available. It had been then observed that adult MECP2-deficient mice show respiratory
      alterations and found that endogenous noradrenaline helps to maintain a normal respiratory
      rhythm. Desipramine, a selective inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, seems to be efficient
      to reduce the respiratory alteration occuring in MECP2-deficient mice (Insem patent 2005,
      Villard and Roux 2006).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate these obtained results in MECP2-deficient mice on
      patients with Rett syndrome.

      Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive impairment,
      communication dysfunction, stereotypic movement disorder, and growth failure. The diagnosis
      of Rett syndrome is based on consensus clinical criteria. Rett syndrome is caused by
      mutations in the Methyl CpG-Binding Protein-2 (MECP2) gene and has no treatment.

      Only a few improved cases have been reported concerning buspirone (Andaku, 2005, 1 patient),
      topiramate (Goyal, 2004, 8 patients), diazepam (Kurihara, 2001, 1 patient) and carnitin
      (Plochl, 2004, 1 patient).

      Only one randomized study versus placebo has been published about a treatment by naltrexone
      including 25 patients. A light improvement of respiratory parameters was then observed with a
      deterioration of the cognitive function (Percy, 2004).

      A mouse experimental model of Rett syndrome created by genetic invalidation of the MECP2 gene
      is available. It had been then observed that adult MECP2-deficient mice show respiratory
      alterations and found that endogenous noradrenaline helps to maintain a normal respiratory
      rhythm. Desipramine, a selective inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, seems to be efficient
      to reduce the respiratory alteration occuring in MECP2-deficient mice (Insem patent 2005,
      Villard and Roux 2006).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate these obtained results in MECP2-deficient mice on
      patients with Rett syndrome.
