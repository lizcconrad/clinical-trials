      The purpose of this study is to provide long-term follow-up immunogenicity and safety data on
      participants who were vaccinated with the second-generation smallpox vaccine in Study VVL04
      (NCT 00258947).

      Primary Objectives:

      Immunogenicity: To yearly describe the vaccinia antibody persistence up to 5 years
      post-vaccination.

      Safety: To follow-up the long-term safety up to 5 years post-vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      None of the participants in this study will receive any vaccination as part of the study. All
      participants will provide blood samples for immunogenicity testing at the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
      year anniversaries of vaccination. Safety will be assessed for up to 5 years after
      vaccination, including follow-up of reactions that occurred during Study VVL04 (NCT
      00258947).
