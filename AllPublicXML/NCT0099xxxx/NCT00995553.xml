  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to test the efficacy of a novel cognitive remediation
      intervention that targets working memory-related functions. To accomplish this goal, 80
      volunteer patients with schizophrenia will be enrolled and randomized to either a cognitive
      remediation condition that targets working memory or a computer skills training intervention
      that teaches computer applications. In both conditions participants will receive computer
      training three times a week for 4 months. The investigators hypothesize that patients who
      receive the cognitive remediation intervention will demonstrate significantly greater change
      on neuropsychological measures of working memory and executive abilities than patients who
      receive the computer skills course. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention-induced cognitive change will be associated with concurrent improvements in
      functional capacity and psychosocial functioning in the community. A second study goal is to
      examine the stability of the intervention-induced changes in cognition. Cognition and
      psychosocial functioning will be reassessed 4 and 8 months after treatment termination to
      examine the stability of treatment effects and to assess whether a less intense maintenance
      training (once a week sessions) provides any additional benefit to participants. Lastly, this
      study will examine in an exploratory manner whether there are individual differences in
      treatment response. The Val158Met polymorphism of the COMT gene has been found to be
      associated with working memory and prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia. The study will
      test whether the COMT polymorphism is predictive of response to cognitive remediation.

        <title>Functional Capacity - University of California, San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment</title>
        <description>The UPSA is a measure of the ability to apply cognitive skills to functional tasks. The total score from this scale was used. Scores may range from 0 - 100, with higher scores being better.</description>
        <time_frame>Post-intervention, within 2 weeks of completion of the 4 month intervention</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who engaged in the intervention, defined as completing at least 3 sessions, were included in an Intent to Treat analysis. 80 of the 81 participants who started one of the study conditions met this definition of engagement. One participant who attended only 1 session of computer skills was excluded from the analysis.</population>

            <description>A 48-session working memory focused cognitive remediation program is conducted. Training tasks have been selected from 3 software programs, PSS CogRehab, BrainTrain, and custom made N-back tasks.
Cognitive Remediation: This is an adaptive, computer-based cognitive training intervention. Participants will complete 3 1-hour cognitive training sessions focused on attention and working memory processes weekly for 4 months.</description>
