  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Objective: It has been reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
      from periodontal patients have a different profile of cytokine release when compared to the
      ones of healthy patients. Cigarette smoking is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis and
      is known to affect the systemic and local immune responses. Thus, the aim of the present
      study was to obtain preliminary data about the interaction of periodontal condition and
      smoking in the secretion of some cytokines by PBMC.

      Material and Methods: PBMC samples were isolated from 19 donors, divided into generalized
      chronic periodontitis (P; n=10) and periodontal health (H; n=9) groups. In addition, the
      smokers and non-smokers of each group were separately evaluated: SP- smokers with severe
      generalized chronic periodontitis (n=5); SH- periodontally healthy smokers (n=5); NSP-
      non-smokers with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (n=5) and NSH- periodontally
      healthy non-smokers (n=4). Cells were incubated for 24-48 hours in 500 µL wells containing
      RPMI 1640 and stimulated with 1.0 ng/mL of E. coli LPS. Supernatants were used to quantify
      the amounts of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 released using ELISA kits.
