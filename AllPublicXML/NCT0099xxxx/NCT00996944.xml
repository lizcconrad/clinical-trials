  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, placebo controlled, parallel group, double-blind, randomized
      comparison study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ropinirole IR tablets orally
      administered for 12 weeks in patients with symptomatic restless legs syndrome associated with
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) managed with haemodialysis (including haemofiltration and
      haemodiafiltration) (hereinafter referred to as &quot;uRLS&quot;), to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of long-term administration of ropinirole IR tablets, and assess the effect on the steady
      state pharmacokinetics in the long-term administration period of ropinirole IR tablets.

    <measure>International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Week 0 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS rating scale is an investigator-rated scale consisting of 10 questions with a choice of 5 responses each. These responses are numerically scored from 0 (the least severe response) to 4 (the most severe response). The IRLS rating scale total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores. The highest possible score is 40, which represents the most severe RLS; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of RLS. A total of 17 participants were prematurely withdrawn from the study before Week 12.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was prematurely terminated after 5 months had passed since its initiation, because GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) concluded that it was impossible to recruit sufficient participants within a reasonable timeframe. In this study, no participants had completed. The maximum duration was 24 weeks plus follow-up (up to Week 64).</recruitment_details>

          <description>Participants received immediate-release (IR) tablets of ropinirole once daily for 12 weeks in the double-blind treatment period. The dose of investigational product (IP) was upward titrated from 0.25 milligrams (mg)/day to 0.5 mg/day at an interval of at least 1 week, followed by upward titration in increments of 0.5 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week until sufficient efficacy was obtained (targeting “much improved” or “very much improved” in the investigator/subinvestigator-assessed Clinical Global Impression–Improvement [CGI-I]) without a safety/tolerability problem, although the dose did not exceed 3 mg/day. All participants completing the double-blind treatment period were eligible to continue in the open-label long-term treatment period. In the open-label period, participants were to receive ropinirole IR tablets once daily for 52 weeks with a similar upward titration method as in the double-blind treatment period.</description>

        <title>International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Week 0 and Week 12</title>
        <description>The IRLS rating scale is an investigator-rated scale consisting of 10 questions with a choice of 5 responses each. These responses are numerically scored from 0 (the least severe response) to 4 (the most severe response). The IRLS rating scale total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores. The highest possible score is 40, which represents the most severe RLS; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of RLS. A total of 17 participants were prematurely withdrawn from the study before Week 12.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS): participants who were progressed to the treatment phase, but excluding those who did not have the target indication, those who had not received at least one dose of the investigational product, and those who did not have any measured efficacy data after initiation of the study treatment.</population>

            <description>Participants received immediate-release (IR) tablets of ropinirole once daily for 12 weeks in the double-blind treatment period. The dose of IP was upward titrated from 0.25 milligram (mg)/day to 0.5 mg/day at an interval of at least 1 week, followed by upward titration in increments of 0.5 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week until sufficient efficacy was obtained (targeting “much improved” or “very much improved” in the investigator/subinvestigator-assessed Clinical Global Impression – Improvement [CGI-I]) without a safety/tolerability problem, although the dose did not exceed 3 mg/day. All participants completing the double-blind treatment period were eligible to continue in the open-label long-term treatment period. In the open-label period, participants were to receive ropinirole IR tablets once daily for 52 weeks with a similar upward titration method as in the double-blind treatment period.</description>

        <title>Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLSQOL) Questionnaire Overall Life Impact Score at Week 0 and Week 12</title>
        <description>The RLSQOL questionnaire is a participant-rated questionnaire designed to assess the impact of RLS on the lives of participants. It consists of 18 items, 10 of which contribute to a single summary score (overall life impact). The response for each item is coded from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the best quality of life and 5 representing the worst quality of life. The lowest possible overall life impact score is 0, and the highest possible overall life impact score is 100. The score of 100 represents the best possible quality of life.</description>

          <title>Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLSQOL) Questionnaire Overall Life Impact Score at Week 0 and Week 12</title>
          <description>The RLSQOL questionnaire is a participant-rated questionnaire designed to assess the impact of RLS on the lives of participants. It consists of 18 items, 10 of which contribute to a single summary score (overall life impact). The response for each item is coded from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the best quality of life and 5 representing the worst quality of life. The lowest possible overall life impact score is 0, and the highest possible overall life impact score is 100. The score of 100 represents the best possible quality of life.</description>

        <title>IRLS Rating Scale Total Score for Participants Who Withdrew From the Double-Blind Treatment Period (DBT WD)</title>
        <description>The IRLS rating scale is an investigator-rated scale consisting of 10 questions with a choice of 5 responses each. These responses are numerically scored from 0 (the least severe response) to 4 (the most severe response). The IRLS rating scale total score is calculated by summing the individual response scores. The highest possible score is 40, which represents the most severe RLS; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of RLS. A total of 17 participants were prematurely withdrawn from the study before Week 12, and 2 participants had missing DBT WD data.</description>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole IR tablets once daily for 12 weeks in the double-blind treatment period. The dose of IP was upward titrated from 0.25 mg/day to 0.5 mg/day at an interval of at least 1 week, followed by upward titration in increments of 0.5 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week until sufficient efficacy was obtained (targeting “much improved” or “very much improved” in the investigator/subinvestigator-assessed CGI-I) without a safety/tolerability problem, although the dose did not exceed 3 mg/day. All participants completing the double-blind treatment period were eligible to continue in the open-label long-term treatment period. In the open-label period, participants were to receive ropinirole IR tablets once daily for 52 weeks with a similar upward titration method as in the double-blind treatment period.</description>

          <title>The PSQI Total Score for Participants Who Withdrew From the Double-Blind Treatment Period (DBT WD)</title>
          <description>The PSQI consists of the following 7 domains: sleep quality, duration getting to sleep, sleep duration, sleep adequacy, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping pill, and somnolence. These domains are numerically scored from 0 to 3, with 0 representing the least severe response and 3 representing the most severe response. The PSQI total score is calculated by summing the individual domain scores. The highest possible score is 21, which represents the most disturbances in sleep quality; the lowest possible score is 0, which represents an absence of disturbances in sleep quality.</description>
