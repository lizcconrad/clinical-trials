  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACE possibly plays a significant role in contributing to a subgroup of surviving residual
      tumor tissue which is characterized by more aggressive biology. This explains the strong
      scientific rationale for exploring the role of anti-angiogenic therapy such as sorafenib to
      remedy and strengthen the therapeutic efficacy of TACE to combat liver cancers. Sorafenib
      plays a prominent auxiliary role by further suppressing the tumor growth and prolonging the
      time to recurrence and progression. Performing TACE under sorafenib administration may have
      synergic effect on hepatic tumoral lesions.
