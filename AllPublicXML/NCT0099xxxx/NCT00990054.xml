    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if plerixafor can make cells more
      sensitive to killing by cytarabine and daunorubicin, an anti-cancer drug regimen referred to
      as &quot;7+3&quot; that is commonly used in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study,
      plerixafor is used with treatments cytarabine and daunorubicin and with and without
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF). Subjects will be monitored to see how well they
      tolerate the use of these drugs together and how well they work to treat the leukemia.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) per plerixafor
      dosing schedule (once daily [QD] or twice daily [BID]), and/or recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), by assessing safety and tolerability of plerixafor (Mozobil®) when used in
      combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin, and with and without granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF)
