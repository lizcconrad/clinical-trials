    <textblock>
      The prevalence of acute renal failure in intensive care is estimated at between 5 and 20%
      depending on diagnostic criteria retained. And half of patients require the use of
      hemodialysis. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is one of the hemodialysis
      technique widely used in intensive care unit.

      The CVVHDF is performed at the bedside, by a mobile generator with a semi permeable membrane,
      a blood circuit, a dialysate circuit and a feedback circuit.

      The implementation of a CVVHDF requires the use of large amounts of biological liquid
      essential to enable the purification of blood during its passage through the artificial
      kidney.

      The objective of this study is to assess time nursing work and the costs of each method.

      The prevalence of acute renal failure in intensive care is estimated at between 5 and 20%
      depending on diagnostic criteria retained. And half of patients require the use of
      hemodialysis. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is one of the hemodialysis
      technique widely used in intensive care unit.

      The CVVHDF is performed at the bedside, by a mobile generator with a semi permeable membrane,
      a blood circuit, a dialysate circuit and a feedback circuit.

      The implementation of a CVVHDF requires the use of large amounts of biological liquid
      essential to enable the purification of blood during its passage through the artificial
      kidney. The biological fluid may be supplied to the generator of CVVHDF in 2 ways:

        -  The conventional method, the most used: the generator operates with pockets containing
           dialysis fluid, these pockets to be changed regularly by nurses

        -  The on-line method: the generator operates with a specific water system supplying the
           dialysis fluid available in every room of the unit The objective of this study is to
           assess time nursing work and the costs of each method.

      For this, 15 patients will be included in this study. Each patient performs 12 hours of each
      method (conventional and online), whose order will be randomized.
