          4. Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory evaluations

          5. Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study
             and to abide by the study restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the first dose until 3 months after the final dosing occasion

          2. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14
             days of the first dose administration

          3. Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication within 7 days
             of the first dose administration

          4. Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort, known to
             chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days of the first
             dose administration

             preceding the first dose administration

          7. Subjects with a significant history of drug allergy as determined by the Investigator
