  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug and to look at how the drug is
      handled by your body. This is the first time the drug will be given to people, the drug has
      been safely given to animals over many days at higher doses than will be given in the study.
      The study will be done in healthy men and woman to determine what effects, good or bad, it
      has on thier health. This study will find out:

      If the drug has any side effects after one dose of the drug is given? How much of the drug
      gets into the bloodstream, and how long does the body take to get rid of it? If the drug
      causes any changes to a substance that is in skin, hair or blood.

      This study represents the first administration of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor
      GSK2256098 to humans to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
      and preliminary food effect following single oral doses in adult healthy subjects before
      proceeding to studies in subjects with cancer that will be given at higher doses over an
      extended period of time. FAK is a protein in the body that is important in cancer
      development. Objectives of the study will be to characterize the safety of single doses of
      GSK2256098; to characterize the single dose PK of GSK2256098 in the presence and absence of
      food; to examine the dose proportionality of GSK2256098 PK parameters following single dose
      administration; and to characterize the effect of single doses of GSK2256098 on phospho-FAK
      (pFAK) tyrosine 397 (Y397) levels in skin and hair follicles. Dose- and concentration-effect
      relationships for various safety parameters will be explored as appropriate.
