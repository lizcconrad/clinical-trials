  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long acting injectable
      (LAI) risperidone and oral risperidone treatment on participants with schizophrenia
      (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often
      with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) or schizoaffective disorder
      (a mixed psychiatric disorder relating to a complex psychotic state that has features of both
      schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (treatment group assigned by chance), open-label (all involved people
      know the identity of the study drug), active-controlled study to evaluate the improvement in
      social functioning among participants with schizophrenia taking LAI risperidone and oral
      risperidone tablet. The study drug will be administered for 52 weeks in flexible dose (range
      as per Investigator's discretion) and a total of 11 assessment visits will be conducted per
      participant, including Screening. The participant may be withdrawn from the trial for any
      medical reason at the sole discretion of the investigator. Before starting the study
      treatment, participants undergo the period of switching from the previous medication to
      risperidone for 4 weeks, and then they will be evaluated for tolerability for 2 weeks (run-in
      period for stabilizing to risperidone). In this 2-week period, participants will take oral
      risperidone. The efficacy will be primarily evaluated through Personal and Social Performance
      Scale. Safety will be evaluated through Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Barnes Akathisia
      Rating Scale, and Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP assesses degree of participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1=absent to 6=very severe) in each of 4 domains. Based on the 4 domains there will be one total score. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Verbal Working Memory (VWM) Response Based on Neurocognitive Function Test (NCFT) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NCFT is neuropsychological test which measures psychological functions. The VWM was measured by Korean-Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), which consists of two subscales, the Verbal scale (6 subtests) and the Performance scale (5 subtests). The verbal tests were: information, comprehension, arithmetic, digit span, similarities, and vocabulary. Arithmetic and Digit Span test of Verbal WAIS scales was conducted. Arithmetic test (arithmetic questions were asked orally) involved calculations that measured concentration while manipulating mental mathematical problems. Digit span test (children were asked to repeat the orally given sequences of numbers either as heard or in reverse order) measured attention, concentration, and mental control. Here, mean number of correct responses in limited time period are reported for arithmetic (calculation) and Digit span. Increase in number of correct response indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Working Memory Based on Neurocognitive Function Test (NCFT) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NCFT is neuropsychological test which measures psychological functions. Working memory was assessed using Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) which measured verbal fluency and is a sub-test of the multilingual aphasia examination. The COWAT uses the three letter set of C, F, and L to assess phonemic fluency. Individuals are given 1 minute to name as many words as possible beginning with one of the letters. The procedure is then repeated for the remaining two letters. More words indicate improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Continuous Performance Task (CPT) Based on Neurocognitive Function Test (NCFT) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The NCFT is neuropsychological test which measures psychological functions. The CPT assessed CPT (Omissions) and CPT (Commissions). Omission errors indicate the number of times the target was presented, but the participant did not respond/click the mouse. High omission rates indicate that the participant is either not paying attention (distractibility) to stimuli or has a sluggish response. Commission errors indicate the number of times the participant responded but no target was presented. A fast reaction time and high commission error rate points to difficulties with impulsivity. A slow reaction time with high commission and omission errors indicates inattention in general.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The PSP assesses degree of participant’s dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1=absent to 6=very severe) in each of 4 domains. Based on the 4 domains there will be one total score. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Verbal Working Memory (VWM) Response Based on Neurocognitive Function Test (NCFT) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The NCFT is neuropsychological test which measures psychological functions. The VWM was measured by Korean-Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), which consists of two subscales, the Verbal scale (6 subtests) and the Performance scale (5 subtests). The verbal tests were: information, comprehension, arithmetic, digit span, similarities, and vocabulary. Arithmetic and Digit Span test of Verbal WAIS scales was conducted. Arithmetic test (arithmetic questions were asked orally) involved calculations that measured concentration while manipulating mental mathematical problems. Digit span test (children were asked to repeat the orally given sequences of numbers either as heard or in reverse order) measured attention, concentration, and mental control. Here, mean number of correct responses in limited time period are reported for arithmetic (calculation) and Digit span. Increase in number of correct response indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Verbal Working Memory (VWM) Response Based on Neurocognitive Function Test (NCFT) at Week 52</title>
          <description>The NCFT is neuropsychological test which measures psychological functions. The VWM was measured by Korean-Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), which consists of two subscales, the Verbal scale (6 subtests) and the Performance scale (5 subtests). The verbal tests were: information, comprehension, arithmetic, digit span, similarities, and vocabulary. Arithmetic and Digit Span test of Verbal WAIS scales was conducted. Arithmetic test (arithmetic questions were asked orally) involved calculations that measured concentration while manipulating mental mathematical problems. Digit span test (children were asked to repeat the orally given sequences of numbers either as heard or in reverse order) measured attention, concentration, and mental control. Here, mean number of correct responses in limited time period are reported for arithmetic (calculation) and Digit span. Increase in number of correct response indicates improvement.</description>

Omission errors indicate the number of times the target was presented, but the participant did not respond/click the mouse. High omission rates indicate that the participant is either not paying attention (distractibility) to stimuli or has a sluggish response. Commission errors indicate the number of times the participant responded but no target was presented. A fast reaction time and high commission error rate points to difficulties with impulsivity. A slow reaction time with high commission and omission errors indicates inattention in general.</description>

        <description>The TOM scale is used to assess the ability of participant to infer other's mental states. It includes recognition that other individuals experience thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires. It is measured by cartoon task, score ranging from 0-30 and stork task which includes stork task set A (false belief), stork task set B (double bluff, white lie, persuasion, misunderstanding), and physical story, score ranging from 0-12, 0-26 and 0-24 respectively. Higher score indicates improvement.</description>
