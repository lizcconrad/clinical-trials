    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of the novel H1Nl influenza
      (inactivated/killed formulation) vaccine among both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons.
      The administration of the H1Nl vaccination is not part of the study's procedures, but is
      being given as part of routine care.

      The investigators study is being conducted to evaluate and compare the seroresponses of the
      novel H1N1 vaccination among HIV positive and negative persons receiving the novel H1N1
      vaccination as part of routine clinical care, with secondary objectives examining the impact
      of prior seasonal vaccinations on subsequent seroresponse to the novel H1N1 vaccination,
      determining potential reactions (local or systemic) to this new vaccine among patients, and
      assessing for potential immunologic/virologic changes (in CD4/HIV RNA levels) after H1N1
      vaccination among HIV patients. Finally, the investigators will collect data on
      influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and H1N1 events during the study follow-up period and
      influenza isolates causing ILI events will be genetically characterized.

      Blood samples will be collected for immunologic studies including antibody titers and
      cellular responses. Viral isolates will be obtained and characterized among ILI cases during
      study participation. Blood for CD4/HIV RNA levels will also be obtained among HIV patients to
      determine the impact of the vaccine on these counts.

        Males and females of all races and all military beneficiaries including active duty
        enlisted and officers (from all branches of service), retirees, and their dependents
        presenting for H1N1 vaccination as part of routine clinical care will be eligible for
        participation. Both HIV-positive and negative persons can participate. Since most of our
        HIV patients are 18-50 years of age, and seroresponse varies by age, we will enroll persons
        between the ages of 18-50 years.
