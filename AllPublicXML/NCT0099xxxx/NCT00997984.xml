      The primary purpose is to assess the efficacy of once daily dosing with optimized SPD503 (1,
      2, 3 and 4mg/day), dosed either in the morning or evening, compared to placebo, in children
      with ADHD as measured by change from baseline score at endpoint on the ADHD-RS-IV.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Utilities Index-2/3 (HUI 2/3) Scores at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HUI is used to describe health status and to obtain utility scores by collecting data using one or more questionnaires in formats selected to match the specific study design criteria. Scoring ranges from 0.00 (dead) to 1.00 (perfect health). Higher scores represent better health status.</description>
