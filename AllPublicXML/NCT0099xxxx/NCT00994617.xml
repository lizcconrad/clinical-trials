  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test whether the current custom of initiating treatment for hypertension with a single
      drug is less effective in the short-term than initial combination therapy, and results in the
      eventual need for comparatively more antihypertensive drug therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if patients randomised to more aggressive (combination therapy) treatment for
      the initial treatment of hypertension have better blood pressure control compared to those
      randomised to less aggressive (monotherapy) treatment despite subsequent add-on treatment
      being similar in each group. This will test the hypothesis that monotherapy patients 'never
      catch up' with combination therapy patients.

        1. To determine if this 'never catch-up' phenomenon of improved BP control persists for at
           least one year.

        2. To understand the underlying mechanism of improved BP control; specifically:

             1. To determine if it is due to haemodynamic compensation, such as increased sodium
                retention and volume expansion.

             2. To determine if it is due to increased peripheral resistance.

        3. To understand the predictors of BP control i.e. age, baseline renin status, sodium
           status and plasma volume.

        4. To validate the National Institute for Clinical Excellence / British Hypertension
           Society joint guideline ACD algorithm by comparing BP control in the monotherapy
           crossover arm of phase 1 and to correlate this with age (≤ 55 or &gt; 55y), and baseline
           characteristics such as renin.

        5. To determine the safety and tolerability of a strategy of prescribing combination
           therapy as the initial step versus monotherapy as the initial step.

             contraceptive pill, an intra uterine device or who are surgically sterilised or
             postmenopausal Females

          3. BP ≥150 mmHg (systolic) OR ≥ 95 mmHg (diastolic). Patients may be included if the PI
             anticipates BP criteria for inclusion will be met at randomisation

          4. Either never-treated or received a maximum of one antihypertensive drug class in the
             previous year

        Patients will be excluded for ANY ONE of the following reasons

          1. Clinic SBP &gt; 200 mmHg or DBP &gt; 120 mmHg, with PI discretion to override if home BP
             measurements are lower

         18. Treatment with any of the following prohibited medications:
