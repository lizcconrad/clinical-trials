    <textblock>
      This study uses an open-label design and will be conducted in approximately 40 sites in the
      United States. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure that
      approximately 300 subjects will have 6 months exposure to PA32540 and at least 100 subjects
      will have 12 months exposure to PA32540.

      PA32540 is proposed for the secondary prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular events in
      patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers. This study is designed to
      provide long-term safety data for PA32540 in order to gain regulatory approval to make
      PA32540 available for clinical use in this subject population.

             mg for at least three months and who are expected to use daily aspirin 325 mg for at
             least six months (Daily is defined as &quot;at least 5 days per week&quot;):

             AND, who are

                  within the past five years.

          2. A. Aspirin use should be for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular or
             cerebrovascular events as defined as follows:

             Or have established, clinically significant coronary and other atherosclerotic
             vascular disease (meaning at high risk for surgical intervention or for MI, TIA,
             stroke, if left untreated), including:

               -  Angina (stable or unstable)

               -  Carotid endarterectomy

          3. A. If female, subjects are eligible if they are of

        risk or influence the results of the study 19. Use of any excluded concomitant medication
        (see Section 9.2) 20. Screening laboratory ALT or AST value &gt; two times the upper limit of
        normal 21A. History of renal insufficiency 22. Other than noted specifically, any screening
        laboratory value that is clinically significant in the Investigator's opinion and would

        investigational treatment in the 4 weeks before screening 24. History of malignancy,
        treated or untreated, within the past five years, with the exception of successfully
