      RATIONALE: Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution may help increase eyebrow and eyelash growth in
      patients who have undergone chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how wells bimatoprost ophthalmic solution
      works in increasing eyebrow and eyelash growth in patients who have undergone chemotherapy

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the effectiveness of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution in expediting regrowth of
           eyebrows and eyelashes in patients who have undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer and
           in increasing eyebrow growth in healthy participants with no known underlying disease as
           assessed by two physicians and an aesthetics expert on a scale of 0-4.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effectiveness of this treatment as assessed by patient self-report on a
           scale of 0-4.

        -  To assess the psychological impact of this treatment as assessed by patient-completed
           questionnaires.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients apply topical bimatoprost ophthalmic solution to base of upper eyelid
           margins OR to eyebrow region once daily for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients apply topical placebo solution to base of upper eyelid margins OR to
           eyebrow region once daily for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and monthly for 5 months about changes in
      eyebrows/eyelashes, side effects of treatment, and the psychological impact of treatment.
      Photographs of eyebrows or eyelashes and surrounding skin are taken at baseline and monthly
      for 5 months and reviewed by a physician and aesthetics expert.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
