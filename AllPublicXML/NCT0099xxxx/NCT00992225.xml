  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the objective response rate (complete and
      partial response) for patients who receive LY573636 for metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient will receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of study drug (LY573636) once every 28
      days. Radiologic imaging scans will be performed before the first dose of study drug and then
      after every other treatment. Patients will be assessed for clinical progression at every
      visit and for response approximately every 56 days (every other cycle).
