  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate whether a new
      compound, liraglutide, reduces the level of lipids (fat), including cholesterol, in the blood
      of type 2 diabetics, following a meal with high fat content.

             combination therapy) diagnosed at least 3 months previously

          -  BMI between 18.5 and 40 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected allergy to trial products or related products

          -  Previous participation in this trial (randomised). Re-screening of screening failures

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become
             pregnant or are not using adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptives are
             defined as combination oral contraceptives (OC), hormonal intra uterine devices
             (IUDs), implants and injectables; for Germany, a condom for the male partner must be
             used in combination with OC, IUD, implant or injectables for the duration of the trial
             and for 30 days following the last dose of trial medication) if not sterile or
             post-menopausal

          -  The receipt of any investigational drug within 3 months prior to this trial

          -  Previous insulin treatment (short-term insulin treatment of up to 7 days are exempted
             if this has occurred no later than 3 months prior to screening).

          -  Cancer (except basal cell skin cancer or squamous cell skin cancer) or any clinically
             significant disorder (except type 2 diabetes)

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease including history of myocardial
             infarction (heart attack) within the past 6 months and/or heart failure at the
             discretion of the Investigator.

          -  History of alcoholism or drug abuse during the last 12 months

          -  Blood donation within the last 3 months. Plasma donation within the last month.

          -  Additional exclusion criteria for Germany: Male subjects who are sexually active and
             have partners who are or could be pregnant, not using a barrier method of
             contraception (e.g. condom) for the duration of the trial and for 30 days following
             the last dose of trial medication
