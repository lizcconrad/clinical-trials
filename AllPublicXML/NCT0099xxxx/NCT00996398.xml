  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to assess the effect of cold water immersion on knee joint
      re-positional sense in healthy subjects. Cryotherapy, in the form of cold water immersion,
      had previously been shown to improve athletic performance however, debate exists within the
      existing literature regarding whether proprioception, in the form or joint position sense, is
      effected post treatment.

      Null hypothesis (H0): Water immersion has no effect on joint position sense (JPS).

      Alternate hypothesis (H1): Water immersion has an effect on joint position sense.

      This was a prospective, randomised, cross-over design where volunteers acted as their own
      controls. The volunteers were immersed at two temperatures (detailed below) and these
      sessions were separated by six to ten days. The order of the testing was randomly assigned
      using a random number generator. Ethical approval of the design of this trial was gained from
      the University of Limerick's Research Ethics Committee and signed informed consent was gained
      from each participant before any data collection took place.
