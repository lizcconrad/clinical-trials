      Hypothesis: Combined treatment with valproic acid and ATRA can be used to achieve disease
      stabilization for a subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and this effect
      can be improved without serious toxicity by adding low-dose cytarabine to this treatment.

      Adult patients &gt;18 years of age who can be included:

      Elderly patients who cannot achieve standard chemotherapy, patients with relapsed or
      resistant AML.

      Treatment: Combined therapy with:

      Valproic acid, continuous therapy until disease progression ATRA, oral therapy for 14 days
      every three months Low-dose cytarabine 10 mg/m2 up to 10 injections during week 2 and 3,
      repeated every 3 months.

      Patients to be included:

        1. Elderly patients (&gt;60 years of age) or other patients unfit for conventional intensive
           chemotherapy with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

        2. Adult patients of any age (&gt;18 years of age) with relapsed or resistant AML who cannot
           receive conventional therapy.

      Treatment:

      Valproic acid to be started on day 1 as continuous therapy until disease progression.

      ATRA administered from day 8 orally as 22.5 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, repeated every
      third month.

      Low-dose cytarabine 10 mg/m2 from day 14 and continued as daily injections for up to 10 days,
      repeated every third month.

      Supportive therapy is given according to the hospitals general guidelines.

      Followup: The first 2 days treatment in hospital, later regular out-patient treatment.
      Controls will include clinical examination, peripheral blood parameters (including serum
      valproic acid levels), bone marrow samples.
