  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of collagen subtype subcutaneously and genetic analysis of patients from families
      with a tendency to hernias. Furthermore circulating biomarkers and biomarkers extracted from
      the subcutaneously tissue such as MMP's (matrix metallo proteinases) and TIMP's (tissue
      inhibitor of metallo proteinases) will be measured.

      Research has shown relationship between hernias and collagen subtype I/III ratio, biomarkers
      such as MMP's TIMP's and other diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos, Marfans syndrome, AAA
      (abdominal aortic aneurysms), diverticulosis and rectal prolapse. Furthermore has research
      raised hypothesis about inheritance of hernias. The investigators are performing genetic
      examination combined with analysis of collagen and biomarkers on patients belonging to
      families with tendency to hernias.

      Other examinations performed on the patients enrolled in this study:

        -  Ultrasound (US) examination of the abdominal aorta to discover possible abdominal aortic
           aneurysms.

        -  Beightons score to evaluate the degree of joint hypermobility.
