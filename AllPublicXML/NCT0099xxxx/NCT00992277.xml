      This study will:

      Evaluate the in vivo histological and molecular effects of treatment with eMatrixCO2 and to
      determine the dynamics of their development over time following treatment.

      Determine the safety and efficacy of treatment with eMatrixCO2 for use in Aesthetic
      dermatological procedures requiring the ablation, vaporization, excision, incision, or
      coagulation of soft tissue.
