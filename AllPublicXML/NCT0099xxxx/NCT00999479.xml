  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether or not continuous combined oral contraceptive
      pills (COCP's) decrease the risk of recurrent endometrioma formation. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that patients who have endometriomas surgically removed and then are started on
      COCP's will have a decreased incidence of recurrent endometrioma formation. The
      investigators' research protocol is designed to show a statistically significant decreased
      incidence of endometrioma formation in the hopes that physicians will use COCP's in patients
      they have removed an endometrioma in who do not desire immediate fertility. Long term, the
      investigators hope to establish a standard of care that COCP's be used postoperatively in
      appropriate candidates to decrease the chance of recurrent endometrioma formation.

    <textblock>
      We plan to identify patients planning to undergo conservative surgery for endometrioma at the
      University of Oklahoma private practice OB/GYN clinic and at the University of Oklahoma
      Resident Women's clinic. After clear and appropriate consent and discussion regarding
      options, we plan to randomize patients to monophasic OCPs vs. placebo following surgery. We
      plan to enroll 35 patients in each arm and follow them for 24 months following the surgery.
      Surveillance with pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasonography will occur at 2, 6 and 12
      months. The patients surgery will be done prior to enrolling in our study. We will use
      information from their surgery only to confirm the diagnosis of endometrioma. The only
      procedure the subjects will undergo during the protocol are periodic transvaginal
      ultrasonography.

    <description>Patients randomized to this study arm will receive combined oral contraceptive pills. Patients will follow up at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. On follow up visits pts will have clinical assessment with vaginal and rectal examinations and with transvaginal ultrasonography. As a measure of compliance, patients will return their empty pill packages</description>
