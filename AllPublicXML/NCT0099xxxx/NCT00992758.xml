  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalation, open-label, multicenter study of iodine-131 Anti-B1
      Antibody for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who have more than 25% bone marrow
      involvement with NHL. Prior studies with Iodine-131 Anti B1 Antibody for the treatment of NHL
      have excluded patients with more than 25% bone marrow involvement with NHL. To be eligible,
      patients must have been previously treated and failed to achieve an objective response on or
      relapse during or following their last treatment.

      Patients will undergo two dosing phases while on study. In the first phase, termed the
      &quot;dosimetric dose&quot;, patients will receive 450 mg unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody infused over 1
      hour or longer followed by 35 mg of Anti-B1 Antibody of which 1-2 mg has been labeled with 5
      mCi of Iodine-131 infused over 20 minutes. Whole body camera scans will be obtained on Day 0,
      Day 2, 3, or 4, and Day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose. Using dosimetric data from
      three imaging time points, a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody to deliver
      the desired total body dose of radiotherapy will be calculated. In the second phase, termed
      the &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, 450 mg Anti-B1 Antibody will be infused over 1 hour or longer
      followed by 35 mg of Anti-B1 Antibody labeled with the subject-specific dose of Iodine-131 to
      deliver the desired total body radiation, infused over 20 minutes. The dose escalation will
      be initiated at 45 cGy and will be increased in 10 cGy increments until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached.

      Patients will be treated with either saturated potassium iodide, Lugol's solution, or
      potassium iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the infusion of the dosimetric
      dose and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of the therapeutic dose.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Iodine-131 Anti B-1
      Antibody in patients with previously treated NHL having more than 25% bone marrow involvement
      with lymphoma. Secondary endpoints include assessment of response rate, duration of response,
      relapse-free survival, time to treatment failure, safety, and survival.

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of low-grade
             non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma according to International Working Formulation (i.e.,
             small lymphocytic [with or without plasmacytoid differentiation]; follicular small
             cleaved, or follicular, mixed small cleaved and large cell), or low-grade lymphoma

             greater than or equal to 2 x 2 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active obstructive hydronephrosis.

          -  Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease or other

             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease-free for 5 years. Patients who have been disease-free of another cancer for
             greater than 5 years must be carefully assessed at the time of study entry to rule out
             recurrent disease.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  Patients who are HAMA positive.

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Patients who have undergone therapy with either stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Patients who have received cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, or cytokine
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosourea compounds). The
             use of systemic steroids must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to study entry.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients of childbearing potential must
             undergo a serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry. Males and females

             entry.

          -  Patients who have previously received radioimmunotherapy.

          -  Patients with de novo intermediate- or high-grade NHL, except for intermediate subtype
