  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the efficacy at one year of an interdisciplinary approach including
      individual counseling and group seminars versus group seminars alone to induce weight loss in
      subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

      This study also compare if a participant's presence in small informative meeting groups as
      the only form of intervention is sufficient to induce a lifestyle change, thus inducing the
      weight loss needed for the prevention of the diseases associated with obesity.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into 2 intervention groups (30 per group):

        1. Small Meeting groups: a curriculum of 25 meeting-seminars will take place for 45
           minutes, each one approaching various aspects of nutrition, physical activity,
           psychology, motivation and medical needs. These seminars are administered by the
           professionals of the obesity clinic and are already in place. However, these are usually
           only offered to the patients registered with the obesity clinic.

        2. Obesity Clinic of CHUS: combination of 25 described meeting-seminars see-high, in
           addition to individual interviews every 6 weeks with the interdisciplinary team of the
           obesity clinic of CHUS (usual operation).

      Subjects will be evaluated initially and then every 3 months during 1 year by the following
      measurements: questionnaires to evaluate motivation and physical activity; 3 day dietary
      journals; weight assessment, using both metabolic and mechanical balance; waist
      circumference; and blood pressure.

      A medical evaluation with size measure, a test evaluating knowledge of the participants on
      obesity, OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) - a 5 hour determination of secretion and
      resistance to insulin, insulin-mediated suppression of plasma non-esterified fatty acids, a
      plasma lipid profile, accelerometry, bio electric impedance, and an activity physical test (6
      minute walk test) will be carried out initially, and then repeated for up to 1 year.
