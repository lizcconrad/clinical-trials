    <time_frame>Day 0 (preoperative) through postoperative Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Skin sensitivity was measured using Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament set to detect neurological damage. Filament sizes are noted by handle numbers of measuring tools ([handle number = log10(10*force in milligrams applied to skin)], range = 1.65 to 6.65). Detection of filament with smaller handle number = greater skin sensitivity. Smaller change in filament size detection from pre-op to post-op = less impact to recovery of sensation. Smallest filament felt for each side of face was noted. Change in skin sensitivity computed as (Handle Number Postop Day 3, 7, or 14) - (Handle Number Preop Day 0).</description>

    <measure>Participants' Assessment of Difference in Numbness Between Two Sides of Face</measure>
    <time_frame>Through postoperative Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>During each postoperative visit (Day 1, 3, 7, and 14), participants were asked:
How would you rate your numbness on each side of your face on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the worst numbness possible?
Difference in scores on a scale = (SoC score) - (FS VH S/D 4 s-apr score)
The planned and approved Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) called for a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0, Preoperative) in Skin Sensitivity on Postoperative Days 3, 7, 14</title>
        <description>Skin sensitivity was measured using Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament set to detect neurological damage. Filament sizes are noted by handle numbers of measuring tools ([handle number = log10(10*force in milligrams applied to skin)], range = 1.65 to 6.65). Detection of filament with smaller handle number = greater skin sensitivity. Smaller change in filament size detection from pre-op to post-op = less impact to recovery of sensation. Smallest filament felt for each side of face was noted. Change in skin sensitivity computed as (Handle Number Postop Day 3, 7, or 14) - (Handle Number Preop Day 0).</description>

        <title>Participants' Assessment of Difference in Numbness Between Two Sides of Face</title>
        <description>During each postoperative visit (Day 1, 3, 7, and 14), participants were asked:
How would you rate your numbness on each side of your face on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the worst numbness possible?
Difference in scores on a scale = (SoC score) - (FS VH S/D 4 s-apr score)
The planned and approved Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) called for a pre-aggregation of the data whereby differences between the two sides of the face were computed first within participants to retain the inherent correlation (pairings) in the measures. Summary statistics and statistical tests were then computed on the differences between the two sides of the face using paired sample tests.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>Baxter’s agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of the individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until the earlier of the primary multicenter publication or 1 year after study completion. Baxter requires a review of results communications (e.g., for confidential information) ≥90 days prior to submission or communication. Baxter may request an additional delay of ≤60 days (e.g., for intellectual property protection)</restrictive_agreement>
