      This is a multi-centre, multinational, open-label, single-dose acute hemodynamic study
      followed by randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled study. Eligible
      subjects will undergo an open-label, single-dose acute hemodynamic study with
      ACT-293987(NS-304) and 21 weeks of double-blind treatment during which subjects will receive
      either ACT-293987 (NS-304) or placebo b.i.d. Subjects who have completed the double-blind
      study can enter the open extension study (separate protocol) and receive administration of
      ACT-293987 (NS-304) if the subject wishes and the Investigator considers it appropriate.

      This is a multi-centre, multinational, open-label, single-dose acute hemodynamic study
      followed by a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled study. Eligible
      subjects will undergo screening followed by randomized allocation to treatment group for the
      double-blind study, followed in turn by immediate enrollment in an open-label, single-dose
      acute hemodynamic study with ACT-293987 (NS-304) and 21 weeks of double-blind treatment
      during which subjects will receive either ACT-293987 (NS-304)or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.).
      Subjects who have completed the double-blind study can enter the open extension study and
      receive administration of ACT-293987 (NS-304) (separate protocol)if the subject wishes and
      the investigator considers it appropriate.

      Unblinding will occur on a subject-by-subject basis when the Week 17 data for the subject
      have been fixed.

      Approximately 44 subjects are to be randomized in a ratio of 3:1 to the two treatment groups,
      ACT-293987 (NS-304) and placebo (33 subjects to ACT-293987 (NS-304) and 11 subjects to
      placebo).

      Subjects will be randomized to the study following screening.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to the study following screening.
Each subject will then undergo an acute hemodynamic study with right heart catheterization after a single oral administration of ACT-293987 (NS-304)on Day 0. The objectives are to collect data about the drug effect on the right heart hemodynamic parameters (PVR, calculated SVR and PVR/SVR) measured by right heart catheterization after single oral dose administration of NS-304 and to assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of NS-304.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 18 years of age or older with symptomatic PAH despite
             treatment with anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, cardiac
             glycosides, supplemental oxygen, endothelin-receptor antagonists and/or
             phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase
             inhibitors must have been used at a stable dose for more than 12 weeks before
             screening.

          2. Subjects with idiopathic PAH, familial pulmonary arterial hypertension and PAH
             associated with collagen vascular disease, corrected congenital vitium (congenital
             systemic to pulmonary shunts surgically repaired at least five years before) or
             anorexigen use.

          3. Diagnosis of PAH established according to the standard criteria:

               1. Resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 25 mmHg.

               2. PVR &gt; 240 dynes s/cm5.

               3. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end diastolic pressure &lt;

             the screening visit unless the subject was taking another investigational drug or

             infection or unrepaired congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts.

          5. Subjects with ventilation-perfusion lung scan or pulmonary angiography indicative of
             thromboembolic disease.

          6. Subjects with significant obstructive (forced expiratory volume in one second
             [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt; 70% predicted) or restrictive (total lung
             capacity &lt; 70% predicted) lung disease.

          7. In collagen vascular diseases, subjects with significant interstitial disease (FVC &lt;
             70% predicted).

          8. Subjects with evidence of left sided heart disease.

          9. Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C).

         10. Subjects with clinically significant chronic renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine
             clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute, or serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL).

         11. Subjects who are receiving or have been receiving any investigational drugs within 30
             days before screening.

         12. Subjects with musculoskeletal disorder limiting ambulation.

         13. Females who are breast-feeding, pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study
             and females who are not using a highly effective method of birth control (failure rate
             less than 1% per year) such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives,
