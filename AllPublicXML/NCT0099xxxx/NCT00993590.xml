      The primary aims are to test whether an asthma care management system (M-CHESS) delivered via
      a smartphone (cellular phone with internet access) can support low income teenagers (ages
      12-18) with significant asthma and can improve asthma control and reduce asthma-related
      emergency or urgent care visits and hospitalizations. Secondary aims include whether M-CHESS
      increases adherence to asthma control medication and reduces absenteeism from school, work or
      an event they wanted to attend.

      Four hundred Milwaukee Medicaid recipients (ages 12-18), with an asthma-related emergency
      care visit or hospitalization in the last twelve months, will be recruited through their
      managed care organization (MCO). They will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms and
      will participate in a 12-month intervention plus a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects in the
      control group will receive a smartphone with internet access &amp; text messaging service. These
      devices will provide the ability to collect smartphone use data electronically. The
      experimental group will also receive the same smartphone devices (with internet access and
      text messaging service and ability to collect usedata. In addition the experimental group
      will have access to the Mobile CHESS (M-CHESS) interface. The M-CHESS smartphone interface
      features an interactive, internet based asthma education program, peer support mechanisms and
      automated reminders for asthma control medicines and data collection.

    <description>The intervention group will receive access for 12 months to M-CHESS via a smartphone to: (1) contact their case managers and primary provider; (2) communicate with the managed care organization case managers; (3) communicate with peers; (4) share information about changes in health status; (5) receive reminders to take medications and complete medical follow-up; (6) receive feedback on use of their asthma action plan; (7) receive tailored inquiries and insights regarding attendance or use of asthma resources; and (8) access audio and video versions of asthma educational materials and lower reading level versions of text materials; (9) provide monthly study outcome data monthly for 12 months.</description>
