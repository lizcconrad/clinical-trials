      The purpose of this study is to test a mother-to-mother intervention during pregnancy and
      after delivery with mothers in South Africa, most of whom are at risk delivering babies with
      fetal alcohol syndrome, babies that are underweight, or babies that are infected with HIV
      from an HIV-positive mother. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will reduce
      the chance of these three health outcomes occurring in the babies and improve the health of
      the mother.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four intersecting epidemics among pregnant women in South Africa: hazardous alcohol
      use (30%), HIV (27%), TB (60% of HIV+), and malnutrition (24% of infants). Unless the
      prevention programs for these epidemics are horizontally integrated, there will never be
      adequate resources to address these challenges and stigma will dramatically reduce program
      utilization. Furthermore, while clinics are the typical sites for treating each of these
      health problems, this proposal will examine a home-visiting prevention program delivered by
      neighborhood Mentor Mothers (MM) as an alternative to clinic-based interventions to reduce
      the consequences of hazardous alcohol use, HIV, TB, and poor nutrition. The intervention will
      encourage mothers to care for their own health, parent well, maintain their mental health,
      and, if the mother is living with HIV (HIV+ MAR), reduce HIV transmission and/or reduce
      alcohol use and abuse. The results begin to inform the optimal delivery strategy for next
      generation of preventive interventions in order to be feasible and sustainable for broad
      dissemination immediately following an efficacy trial.

    <description>Offered to pregnant women / mothers through mentor mothers, i.e. mothers in community who are selected because they are doing well. They are trained to conduct home visits, 2 times a months through pregnancy. After childbirth, visits are spaced depending on the perceived need. If the baby is thriving and mother is coping well with health risks, mentor mother will visit once a month.</description>
