  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the link between rheumatoid arthritis and
      cardiovascular disease by studying inflammation, joint disease, cholesterol abnormalities,
      and endothelial function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the general population, individuals with elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive
      protein, CRP) have increased cardiovascular disease. Patients with RA have chronic elevations
      in CRP and other inflammatory markers that are usually higher than the levels associated with
      increased cardiovascular risk in the general population. Indeed, RA patients have accelerated
      disease of their blood vessels, and increased cardiovascular death not explained by
      traditional cardiac risk factors but associated with chronic inflammation. However, the
      mechanisms by which inflammation leads to cardiovascular disease are not well characterized
      in RA. Moreover, current treatment strategies of RA largely target joint symptoms rather than
      inflammation, potentially leaving patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
      Studies of markers that increase the risk of heart disease in the full spectrum of RA are
      missing. We hypothesize that inflammatory markers will be more strongly associated with
      abnormalities in blood vessels in RA patients than any clinical measure of disease activity.
      This hypothesis will be tested with a cross-sectional study of patients in the UCSF RA
      cohort. Aim 1 will characterize abnormal blood vessel changes across the spectrum of RA
      disease activity, specifically measuring ultrasound of the upper arm artery, markers of
      oxidative stress, and abnormalities in cholesterol proteins. Aim 2 will identify factors
      associated with these changes across the spectrum of RA disease activity, specifically
      focusing on the association between inflammatory markers, cholesterol, and blood vessel
      abnormalities.
