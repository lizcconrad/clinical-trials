    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid(TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent to reduce blood loss in cardiac surgery.
      Previous seven RCTs comparing effects of TXA in pediatric cardiac surgery showed conflict
      results. The reason why they showed mixed results would be the imbalance of patients
      population with regard to presence of cyanosis. TXA would reduce blood loss in pediatric
      cardiac surgery with well balanced patients population.
