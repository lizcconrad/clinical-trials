  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several works show breast hypertrophy as pain cause, postural alterations, dermatitis and
      decrease of the functional capacity and of the self-esteem. The economical evaluations are
      destined to esteem the costs in alternative ways of attendance to the health, comparing, for
      instance, clinical strategies with surgical strategies.

      OBJECTIVE: To analyze cost-effectiveness in reduction mammaplasty.

      1. Design: This is a primary, prospective, analytical, controlled study in humans.

        2. Settings: Data will be collected at the Plastic Surgery and Orthopedic and Traumatology
           Outpatient Clinics of the Samuel Libânio General Hospital (Hospital das Clínicas Samuel
           Libânio, HCSL), Pouso Alegre, MG, Brazil, in july/2008-december 2009.

        3. Participants: Fifty women with breast hypertrophy (25 study group and 25 control group)
           according to the Sacchini index,12 aged 18 to 59 years, were consecutively selected to
           participate in this study.

           Pregnant women, and patients who gave birth or were breastfeeding less than one year
           before the beginning of the study, as well as patients with uncontrolled systemic
           diseases, acute diseases, breast asymmetry, who had undergone breast or spine surgery,
           and who had body-mass index (BMI) lower than 18.5 kg/m2 (low body weight) or greater
           than 30 kg/m2 (obese women) were excluded from the study.

        4. Instruments: Pain intensity in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions of the back has
           been assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). also will be used SF36, HAQ 20 and
           SF-6D.
