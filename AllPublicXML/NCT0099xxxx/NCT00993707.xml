  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of administering repeated doses of CTX-100
      (formerly ETX-100) to subjects with smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study primarily aims to establish safety and evaluate biochemical activity of CTX-100
      (formerly ETX-100) with respect to elastin breakdown, but will also concurrently gather data
      that may point to efficacy. The preliminary efficacy results will be used to assist in the
      design of subsequent phase 2b clinical studies of longer duration to examine both efficacy
      and safety of CTX-100 as a therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <description>3 mL of either 0.01%, 0.03% CTX-100 (formerly ETX-100), or placebo will be dispensed into the PARI LC STAR nebulizer and inhaled using the PARI Ultra II compressors.
Number of cycles: if the study drug (0.01% CTX-100 Inhalation Solution or placebo) bid is well tolerated in the first cohort, the second cohort of subjects will begin dosing with 0.03% CTX-100 Inhalation Solution or placebo in the same manner as the first cohort.</description>

          -  Diagnosis of COPD at screening consistent with National Institutes of Health
             guidelines.

          -  Evidence of emphysema on chest x-ray.

          -  A ratio of prebronchodilator FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≤ 70% at
             screening.

          -  FEV1 ≥ 50% (prebronchodilator) and ≤ 79% (postbronchodilator) of predicted normal at
             screening.

          -  Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)
             within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the PI/sponsor at screening.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception (oral contraceptives, depot progesterone, condom plus
             spermicide, or IUD) during the study and for 1 month after the final dose of study
             drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a measured DLCO of ≤ 50%, or unable to perform a reproducible DLCO.

          -  Subjects unable to perform 3 reproducible spirometry tests after 5 attempts.

          -  Upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks prior to screening and
             baseline (day 1).

          -  Presence of clinically relevant abnormality on chest x-ray (other than evidence of
             emphysema) at screening or within the previous 12 months.

             months.

          -  History of lung transplant.

          -  Presence of clinically relevant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, would compromise study
             participation or the evaluation of the study drug.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening (including
             subjects who participated in the first phase of this study).
