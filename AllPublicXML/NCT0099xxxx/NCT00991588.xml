  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the clinical outcome of surgical
      reconstruction of complete ruptures to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and
      posterolateral structures of the knee joint. The outcome will be determined with validated
      and rigorous knee rating systems between 2 and 10 years postoperatively. The results will be
      determined by the analysis of subjective and functional factors, sports and occupational
      activity levels, a comprehensive physical examination, and a radiographic evaluation. We
      hypothesize that the appropriately indicated procedures will effectively restore normal knee
      stability and function in patients with isolated or combined injuries to these structures.

      Because injuries to the PCL and posterolateral structures occur with less frequency than
      other structures in the knee joint (such as the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci),
      fewer studies are available to assist the surgeon and patient with appropriate
      decision-making regarding conservative versus surgical treatment. The majority of patients
      who sustain injury to these structures are treated conservatively. Unfortunately, several
      investigations describe noteworthy symptoms and functional limitations following conservative
      management, and a high percentage of patients develop knee osteoarthritis that can be
      disabling for both recreational and daily activities. The investigators of this study have
      nearly three decades of experience and have extensively studied the effects of this injury in
      both the laboratory and clinic settings. It is our opinion that surgical reconstruction
      provides significant benefit when appropriately indicated, as has been demonstrated in our
      previous studies. Especially in athletic individuals, PCL and posterolateral reconstructive
      procedures have advanced to the point where more predictable results can be expected to
      restore sufficient knee function. Studies have demonstrated, at least in the short-term, that
      the majority of patients with acute ligament ruptures treated with reconstruction are able to
      return to various levels of sports activities.12 Whether these procedures will decrease the
      risk of the patient developing future osteoarthritis is unknown and requires further study.

    <description>The operative procedures involve either a single- or double-strand PCL graft which is usually harvested from the patient's knee. In cases of multiple ligament procedures, allograft tissues may be used which are obtained from tissue banks certified by the American Associate of Tissue Banks and that have passed FDA inspection. The posterolateral structures, including the fibular collateral ligament (FCL), are reconstructed with one or two grafts, depending upon the severity of damage encountered at surgery.</description>
