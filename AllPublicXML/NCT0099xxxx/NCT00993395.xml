  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance-using adults are admitted to hospital for medical complication from their drug and
      alcohol use at very high rates; yet, their care is often defined by low rates of referral to
      addiction treatment programs and recidivism. In 1997, we instituted an integrated
      medical-substance use treatment program at Johns Hopkins, the First Step Day Hospital,
      designed for intensive post-acute care of previously hospitalized substance using adults. We
      have shown that patients with dual diagnoses admitted to First Step more often complete their
      course of medical care and stay in recovery longer than patients not admitted to First
      Step.(1;2) On discharge from First Step, patients are medically stable and drug-free. Their
      substance abuse care is transferred to an out-patient substance abuse treatment facility and
      their medical care is transferred to their primary care provider. Unfortunately, many
      patients are lost to follow-up during this transition. We believe that a peer mentor-based
      disease management program (PM) can provide continuity of care that begins in First Step and
      continues after discharge thereby increasing the proportion of patients who remain in
      treatment for their addiction and medical conditions. Peer mentors are persons from the
      target community who have been in recovery for 5 or more years. In cooperation with patients
      and providers, peer mentors improve the integration of care, quality of care, and access to
      healthcare services. This pilot study will test the effectiveness of a peer mentor-based
      disease management program. The specific aims are to compare the impact of the PM
      intervention verses enhanced usual care on outcomes in three domains (1) medical/psychiatric
      health status, (2) addiction recovery, and (3) social resource acquisition. If successful,
      this study will provide evidence supporting a larger randomized controlled trial of the
      impact of field workers on post-acute care among patients with dual diagnoses.
