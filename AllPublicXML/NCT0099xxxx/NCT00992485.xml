    <textblock>
      Up to date, a sure cure for Crohn's fistula has not known and the fistula recurrence rate is
      high. On 15 October 2008, orphan drug designation was granted by Korea FDA to Anterogen Co.
      Ltd., for human adipose-derived stem cell. In this study, patients are given injection of
      ADIPOPLUS in fistula site and followed for 8 weeks to test the safety and efficacy.
