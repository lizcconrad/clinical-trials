  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the introduction of a Promotora to
      provide education and proactive follow-up to women with GDM will increase compliance with
      postpartum glucose tolerance testing. The secondary hypothesis is that the Promotora will
      improve participation in referral visits for diabetes or preventive care. We will develop the
      promotora program and begin pilot implementation.

    <textblock>
      As Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center (LAC+USC) serves an
      indigent Latino population at increased risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM),
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) complicated 13% of deliveries at LAC+USC between
      2006-2007. While over 50% of GDM patients will develop overt diabetes mellitus within a
      decade of the incident pregnancy, less than half of these patients ever return for even one
      post-partum follow up visit at this institution (45%). Lifestyle Interventions and
      medications have been shown to delay or prevent the onset of T2DM. However, prevention is
      only possible if patients follow-up and individual risk assessment is made. While identifying
      the 2-hour glucose tolerance test as the appropriate postpartum screening technique for
      patients with a history of GDM, the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational
      Diabetes Mellitus did not identify strategies to improve follow up among this patient
      population. Promotoras (bi-lingual, bi-cultural lay community health workers representative
      of the Latino community base) have been successful in improving follow up for other areas of
      diabetes and women's preventive services but have not been studies in the context of GDM. We
      will develop the Es Mejor Saber training materials and program and pilot a randomized control
      trial (RCT),a total 216 subjects completing a GDM affected pregnancy will be randomized on
      the postpartum ward to the standard-of-care versus proactive follow-up with a Promotora. The
      Promotora will provide education, address barriers to follow-up, remind subjects of their
      appointments, and call them to reschedule if they miss appointments. In the first phase of
      the study, these appointments will include the OGTT and the initial postpartum visit. In the
      second phase, these visits will include referrals to internal medicine (for those diagnosed
      with T2DM) or nutrition counseling (for those found not to have diabetes). The primary
      hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the introduction of a Promotora providing
      education and pro-active follow-up into postpartum GDM management will result improve
      post-partum follow-up for screening, treatment, and preventive services when compared with
      the standard of care.

    <description>The Promotora will deliver education regarding postpartum follow-up and steps to take to decrease the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The Promotora will clarify misperceptions and answer questions related to risk of developing diabetes and contraception. If the subject has barriers to accessing care with transportation or childcare, she will help the subjects to access existing resources. The Promotora will give the subject her contact information and will also contact the subject to remind her of her appointments and reschedule if she missed an appointment.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes prior to most recent pregnancy (pre-gestational diabetes)

          -  Current ICU admission during delivery hospitalization that would interfere with

        A Medical Record Abstraction Only Cohort is a third group of patients who live within 60
        miles of LAC+USC, plan to obtain postpartum care at LAC+USC, and completed a GDM affected
        pregnancy but refuse participation or do not qualify based on the following: elevated
        glucose consistent with diagnosis of T2DM or maintained on insulin postpartum,
        incarceration or resides in inpatient psychiatric facility, age &lt;18, no telephone,
        unwilling to be contacted by Promotora, or are unable to consent for participation.This
        cohort can not be enrolled in the study but data is abstracted from the medical records to
        compare demographics and follow up in our study to all patients with GDM who deliver at
        LAC+USC.
