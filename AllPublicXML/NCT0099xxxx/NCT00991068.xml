  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ZARS Pharma, Inc. has developed Synera® (lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg topical patch),
      a drug delivery patch that utilizes controlled heat to enhance the delivery of a local
      anesthetic formulation consisting of a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and tetracaine. Synera
      was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 23, 2005 and is indicated for
      use on intact skin to provide local dermal analgesia for superficial venous access and
      superficial dermatological procedures such as excision, electrodesiccation, and shave biopsy
      of skin lesions.

      The purpose of this single center, 2-week open-label pilot study is to explore the potential
      usefulness of Synera for the treatment of pain associated with mild to moderate CTS.
