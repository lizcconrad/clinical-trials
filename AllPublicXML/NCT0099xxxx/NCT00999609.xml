    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial of gene therapy intervention
      by subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl). At least
      twenty-four subjects, three years of age or older, will be recruited. The intervention group
      will receive AAV2-hRPE65v2 at either The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia or University of
      Iowa to determine if it improves visual and retinal function in individuals with RPE65 gene
      mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a disease where part of the eye (the retina) is severely
      diseased. Usually it is detected in affected people within the first few months of life, as
      there is significantly poor vision at birth. Cells in the retina are lost over time in people
      with LCA, which typically leads to total blindness. There are no pharmacological treatments
      available. This study will focus on the form of LCA caused by changes (mutations) in DNA that
      makes a certain protein (called the 65 kDa retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific protein,
      or RPE65). This can be confirmed by a special method of testing (molecular testing) to verify
      the presence of RPE65 gene mutations.

      This study uses a gene therapy vector made from an adeno-associated virus (AAV) called
      AAV2-hRPE65v2 (voretigene neparovec-rzyl). Gene therapy refers to the incorporation of new
      DNA into cells with the goal of supplying a therapeutic gene or a gene that is missing or not
      functioning in the cell. The AAV parts of the gene therapy vector work as a delivery vehicle
      for providing the normal human RPE65 gene to the cells of the retina. An earlier Phase 1
      clinical study of AAV2-hRPE65v2 was conducted based on the demonstration of safety and
      effectiveness of the vector in animals with a similar eye disease. The earlier Phase 1
      clinical study was a dose-escalation study primarily designed to evaluate safety in humans,
      and tested three doses of the vector in twelve children and adults. The safety of injecting
      into the second eye was also evaluated. The results from these earlier Phase 1 studies showed
      an acceptable safety profile.

      This study will deliver AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) to at least sixteen
      intervention group subjects, age three or older; subjects will receive the vector in both
      eyes via subretinal injections during surgeries (on separate days). The purpose of this
      research study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the AAV2-hRPE65v2 gene therapy vector
      (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) as a possible treatment for LCA due to RPE65 gene mutations. The
      control group of at least eight subjects will be able to cross-over to the intervention group
      after one year, provided they still meet all eligibility criteria.

    <measure>Multi-luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT), Bilateral</measure>
    <time_frame>One year (change from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The MLMT measures changes in functional vision, as assessed by the ability to navigate a course accurately and at a reasonable pace at different levels of environmental illumination. MLMT was assessed using both eyes at 1 or more of 7 levels of illumination, ranging from 400 lux (a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (a moonless summer night). Each light level was assigned a score code ranging from 0 to 6. A higher score indicated that a subject was able to pass the MLMT at a lower light level. A score of -1 was assigned to those who could not pass MLMT at 400 lux. The MLMT of each subject was videotaped and assessed by independent graders. The MLMT score was determined by the lowest light level at which the subject was able to pass the MLMT. The MLMT score change was defined as the difference between the score at Baseline and the score at Year 1. A positive MLMT score change from Baseline to Year 1 visit indicated that the subject was able to complete the MLMT at a lower light level.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness to adhere to protocol and long-term follow-up as evidenced by written
             informed consent or parental permission and subject assent (where applicable).

          -  Diagnosis of LCA due to RPE65 mutations; molecular diagnosis is to be performed, or
             confirmed, by a CLIA-approved laboratory.

          -  Age three years old or older.

          -  Visual acuity worse than 20/60 (both eyes) and/or visual field less than 20 degrees in
             any meridian as measured by a III4e isopter or equivalent (both eyes).

          -  Sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means, such as optical
             coherence tomography (OCT) and/or ophthalmoscopy. Must have either: 1) an area of
             retina within the posterior pole of &gt;100 µm thickness shown on OCT; 2) ≥ 3 disc areas
             of retina without atrophy or pigmentary degeneration within the posterior pole; or 3)
             remaining visual field within 30 degrees of fixation as measured by a III4e isopter or
             equivalent.

          -  Subjects must be evaluable on mobility testing (the primary efficacy endpoint) to be
             eligible for the study. Evaluable is defined as: 1) The ability to perform mobility
             testing within the luminance range evaluated in the study. Individuals must receive an
             accuracy score of ≤ 1 during screening mobility testing at 400 lux or less to be
             eligible; individuals with an accuracy score of &gt; 1 on all screening mobility test
             runs at 400 lux, or those who refuse to perform mobility testing at screening, will be
             excluded. 2) The inability to pass mobility testing at 1 lux. Individuals must fail
             screening mobility testing at 1 lux to be eligible; individuals that pass one or more
             screening mobility test runs at 1 lux will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study, including receiving bilateral
             subretinal vector administrations.

          -  Any prior participation in a study in which a gene therapy vector was administered.

          -  Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past six months.

          -  Use of retinoid compounds or precursors that could potentially interact with the
             biochemical activity of the RPE65 enzyme; individuals who discontinue use of these
             compounds for 18 months may become eligible.

          -  Prior intraocular surgery within six months.

          -  Known sensitivity to medications planned for use in the peri-operative period.

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions or complicating systemic diseases that would preclude the
             planned surgery or interfere with the interpretation of study. Complicating systemic
             diseases would include those in which the disease itself, or the treatment for the
             disease, can alter ocular function. Examples are malignancies whose treatment could
             affect central nervous system function (for example: radiation treatment of the orbit;
             leukemia with CNS/optic nerve involvement). Subjects with diabetes or sickle cell
             disease would be excluded if they had any manifestation of advanced retinopathy (e.g.,
             macular edema or proliferative changes). Also excluded would be subjects with
             immunodeficiency (acquired or congenital) as there could be susceptibility to
             opportunistic infection (such as CMV retinitis).

          -  Individuals of childbearing potential who are pregnant or unwilling to use effective
             contraception for four months following vector administration.

          -  Individuals incapable of performing mobility testing (the primary efficacy endpoint)
             for reason other than poor vision, including physical or attentional limitations.

          -  Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study or, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study.

          -  Subjects will not be excluded based on their gender, race, or ethnicity.

          <description>The multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT) measures changes in functional vision, based on the ability to navigate a course accurately and at a reasonable pace at different levels of environmental illumination. The MLMT was assessed at 1 or more of 7 light levels ranging from 400 lux (a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (a moonless summer night). At baseline, stratification was based on the lowest passing light level (less than or equal to 125 lux or greater than 125 lux).</description>

        <title>Multi-luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT), Bilateral</title>
        <description>The MLMT measures changes in functional vision, as assessed by the ability to navigate a course accurately and at a reasonable pace at different levels of environmental illumination. MLMT was assessed using both eyes at 1 or more of 7 levels of illumination, ranging from 400 lux (a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (a moonless summer night). Each light level was assigned a score code ranging from 0 to 6. A higher score indicated that a subject was able to pass the MLMT at a lower light level. A score of -1 was assigned to those who could not pass MLMT at 400 lux. The MLMT of each subject was videotaped and assessed by independent graders. The MLMT score was determined by the lowest light level at which the subject was able to pass the MLMT. The MLMT score change was defined as the difference between the score at Baseline and the score at Year 1. A positive MLMT score change from Baseline to Year 1 visit indicated that the subject was able to complete the MLMT at a lower light level.</description>

        <title>Multi-luminance Mobility Testing (Monocular)</title>
        <description>The MLMT measures changes in functional vision, as assessed by the ability to navigate a course accurately and at a reasonable pace at different levels of environmental illumination. MLMT was assessed using the first eye at 1 or more of 7 levels of illumination, ranging from 400 lux (a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (a moonless summer night). Each light level was assigned a score code ranging from 0 to 6. A higher score indicated that a subject was able to pass the MLMT at a lower light level. A score of -1 was assigned to those who could not pass MLMT at 400 lux. The MLMT of each subject was videotaped and assessed by independent graders. The MLMT score was determined by the lowest light level at which the subject was able to pass the MLMT. The MLMT score change was defined as the difference between the score at Baseline and the score at Year 1. A positive MLMT score change from Baseline to Year 1 visit indicated that the subject was able to complete the MLMT at a lower light level.</description>
