      This trial is a randomised controlled trial with a parallel design taking place in centres
      across the UK, Scandinavia and Brazil.

      650 infants with a diagnosis of isolated cleft palate who are considered medically fit for
      operation at 6 months, and who meet the inclusion criteria, will be included in the trial and
      randomised to receive either:

        -  Surgery at age 6 months, OR

        -  Surgery at age 12 months.

      The main objective is to determine whether surgery for cleft palate, using a specified
      technique, at age 6 months, when compared to surgery using the same technique age 12 months,
      improves speech development. All infants will be followed up at age 12 months, 3 years and
      five years for the assessment of the primary outcomes(age 5) and secondary outcomes.

      Infants will be followed up at age 12 months, 3 years and five years. At each visit the
      following will be assessed:

      Age 12 months

        -  Speech development (canonical babbling)

        -  Audiological assessments

        -  Growth

      Age 3 years

        -  Speech development

        -  Audiological assessments

      Age 5 Years

        -  Speech development

        -  Audiological assessments

        -  Dentofacial development (dental impressions and photographs)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants with isolated cleft palate

          -  Medically fit for operation at 6 months

          -  Written informed proxy consent

          -  One parent/carer a native language speaker in the country of residence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Consent not obtained

          -  b. Infants with syndromic cleft palate (except Van der Woude syndrome, which can be
             included if hearing is not affected) or severe developmental delay

          -  Congenital sensorineural hearing loss or middle ear anomalies;

          -  Variation in the anatomical presentation is such that the surgeon who will perform the
             procedure considers that one stage closure with the Sommerlad technique would be
             inappropriate;

          -  Submucous cleft palate (defined by the classical triad of signs, bifid, uvula, bony
             defect of the hard palate, muscular diastasis, as described by Jensen et al (1988).

          -  Where the language spoken at home is not the majority language in the country of
             residence.
