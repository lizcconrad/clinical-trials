  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - An experimental drug called ABT-888 has been studied in combination with temozolomide (a
      type of chemotherapy) in adults who have certain kinds of cancer. ABT-88 has been shown to
      increase tumor sensitivity to temozolomide and improve treatment outcomes in people who have
      cancer. More research is needed to determine if this combination of drugs will work well as
      an effective treatment for children who have brain tumors. This will be the first time this
      combination has been studied in pediatric patients.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum doses of ABT-888 and temozolomide when given in combination in
           children with brain tumors.

        -  To learn how children metabolize and clear ABT-888 from their bodies so that appropriate
           doses of this medication can be recommended for future clinical trials of this drug.

        -  To learn what side effects may occur when ABT-888 and temozolomide are given together.

        -  To learn how certain tumors respond to this combination of drugs by studying the
           characteristics of these tumors in a laboratory.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals less than 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with a cancer of the nervous
      system (including brain and brain stem tumors) that has not responded to standard therapy.

      Design:

        -  Before beginning the study, participants will have a full medical history and physical
           examination, and may also be required to have scans of the brain and spine or provide
           samples of cerebrospinal fluid.

        -  Treatment will consist of up to 13 28-day cycles of therapy, for a total of 52 weeks (1
           year). Participants will receive a dose of ABT-888 twice daily for 5 days, and will
           receive a dose of temozolomide once daily for 5 days, every 28 days. The morning dose of
           ABT-888 will be given 60-90 minutes before the dose of temozolomide.

        -  Participants will have routine blood tests at least once a week throughout the treatment
           cycles, and will have scans of the brain and spine performed as required by the
           researchers.

      Background

        -  A subset of patients with pediatric CNS tumors continue to have a poor prognosis despite
           advances in surgery and radiation. Novel strategies are required for improving outcome
           for these patients.

        -  Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown modest activity in recurrent pediatric
           CNS tumors, including high-grade gliomas, medulloblastoma/PNET, and low-grade gliomas.

        -  Temozolomide induces single-stranded DNA breaks, the majority of which are repaired by
           the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, is a
           critical nuclear enzyme that binds to DNA breaks, recruits and activates key proteins in
           the BER and other DNA repair pathways, halts DNA replication, and facilitates repair of
           damaged DNA.

        -  ABT-888 is a potent and orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor that has been shown to
           enhance cytotoxicity of temozolomide and other chemotherapy agents in several
           pre-clinical models of human tumors.

      Objectives

        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with temozolomide
           in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

        -  To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 and PARP inhibition in peripheral
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to recommend a Phase 2 dose of ABT-888 in
           combination with temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

        -  To describe the toxicities of the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide in children
           with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      Eligibility

        -  Patient must be less than or equal to 21 years of age at registration.

        -  Patients with a diagnosis of a primary CNS malignancy (including low-grade glioma) that
           is recurrent or refractory to standard therapy and for which there is no known curative
           therapy Progression and recurrence will be documented by review of MRI scans. If time
           permits we will have the diagnosis confirmed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.
           Patients with intrinsic brain stem tumors must have radiographic evidence of
           progression.

        -  Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for greater than 16 yrs of age) or Lansky Performance
           Score (LPS for less than or equal to 16 years of age) greater than or equal to 50
           assessed within two weeks of study enrollment.

        -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of all prior therapy.

        -  Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at
           least 1 week prior to registration.

      Design

      -ABT-888 will be given twice daily on day 1-5, and temozolomide will be given once daily on
      day 1-5, every 28 days. The morning dose of ABT-888 will be given 60-90 minutes prior to
      temozolomide.

        Age:

        Patients must be less than or equal to 21 years of age at the time of study enrollment. At
        the time the MTD or the dose to be recommended for future trials is identified, up to 12
        additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level to further define the toxicity
        profile. Six of these patients will be less than 12 years of age and the other half will be
        greater than or equal to 12 years.

        recurrent or refractory to standard therapy and for which there is no known curative
        therapy. All patients must have had histological verification of malignancy at initial
        diagnosis or relapse, excluding patients with diffuse intrinsic brain stem tumors, optic
        pathway tumors or CNS germ cell tumors with elevations of reliable serum or CSF tumor
        markers (alpha-fetoprotein or beta-HCG). Patients with intrinsic pontine gliomas or optic
        pathway tumors do not require histological confirmation of disease but should have clinical
        and/or radiographic evidence of progression.
