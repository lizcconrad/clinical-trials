      This project seeks to understand differences in the serum vitamin D levels and immune status
      in cutaneous malignant melanoma patients with different UV exposure histories in New Mexico.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure is related to the development
      of melanoma. There is also evidence that immune reactions are altered after UV exposure in
      the skin (locally) and perhaps throughout the body (systemically). Additionally, while the
      role of vitamin D and melanoma development has not been fully established, UV-B exposure is
      essential for vitamin D production in the skin. Increased sun exposure is also related to the
      presence of solar elastosis, which might protect (1) or improve survival from melanoma. Thus,
      melanoma represents a unique model for studying UV exposure, the immune system, and vitamin
      D. Malignant melanoma is an antigenic cancer; therefore, the role of UV exposure-induced
      immunosuppression and vitamin D production in the recognition, destruction and growth
      inhibition of cancerous melanocytes is worth further study.

      To underscore the importance of this project, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the
      Melanoma Research Foundation and the Steering Committee of the Society of Melanoma Research
      have indicated a need to collect more human data on the host immune response mechanisms in
      melanoma and also to focus on the skin as a whole microenvironment, moving away from only in
      vitro experiments.

      -  Serum samples will be collected to evaluate the immune status of these patients.

        -  Serum cytokine profiles

        -  Whole blood samples - lymphocyte sub-populations from fresh, refrigerated whole blood
           samples. Whole blood samples will be used to extract DNA and RNA material. The remaining
           DNA for future research related to cytokine gene and vitamin D receptor single
           nucleotide polymorphisms studies of the Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory

        -  H &amp; E slides will be evaluated by our collaborating pathologist to validate diagnoses
           and Breslow thickness

        -  Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks will be sectioned and stained for
           immunohistochemistry

        -  One slide will be prepared from the skin block to evaluate the presence of solar
           elastosis in relation to UV exposure
