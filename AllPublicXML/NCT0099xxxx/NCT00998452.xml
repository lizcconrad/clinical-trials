      This study is being conducted with the Veterans Affairs National Center for Health Promotion
      and Disease Prevention (VANCP), which is overseeing the current dissemination of MOVE!
      (Managing Overweight/Obesity for Veterans Everywhere), a national weight management program
      for veterans. It will be based at 10 local sites in the national network of VA medical
      settings and community-based outpatient clinics and will compare two different models for
      disseminating and implementing MOVE! using a randomized experimental design. One study arm
      will implement the MOVE* VETS! (Volunteer Education and Tailored Self-management and support)
      model that includes tailored newsletters and peer counseling MI calls and activities, and the
      other will receive the standard MOVE! program.

      The purpose of this research is to study the dissemination and implementation of MOVE!. MOVE!
      is a national weight management program for veterans that has moved form pilot to full
      dissemination. Overweight and obesity are rapidly rising in the United States and
      interventions to combat this epidemic are desperately needed. Within the VA population,
      approximately 70% of veterans are overweight and or obese. Participants will be male and
      female Veterans, aged 21 and over receiving health services at one of the 10 study sites, who
      qualify for the MOVE! program. We are recruiting a minimum of 800 -1000 Veterans to complete
      a baseline survey at the 10 VA sites participating in the study. Participants at the 10 VA
      sites are recruited during a primary care visit by primary care provider, they will not be
      chosen based on the presence or absence of any disease, thus health status will vary. The
      primary outcome measures will be participation after enrollment into MOVE! and participant
      weight loss.
