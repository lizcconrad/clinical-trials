      The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of a stress reduction treatment
      compared to psychoeducation in helping minority patients with major depression get better.

      The study will last 10 weeks. During the main portion of the study, subjects will receive
      either individual weekly sessions of stress-reduction therapy or psychoeducation for six
      weeks. The stress reduction therapy will consist of mindfulness-based stress reduction and
      problem solving therapy, which focuses on linking psychological problems with psychosocial
      issues and helping you use your skills and resources to improve your functioning. The
      psychoeducation will consist of six sessions of education on depression and the treatment and
      management of symptoms. Each session will last 50 minutes, and four of the visits will also
      include filling out questionnaires which will take approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.
      One month after the last session, subjects will come in for a follow-up visit with a study
      clinician to see how they are doing and to fill out questionnaires.
