      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Naturetti (capsules) , considering the following
      criteria:

        -  Evacuation frequency during the treatment and follow-up period

        -  Consistency of stools during the treatment and follow-up period

        -  Global evaluation, regarding increase in frequency of evacuation and shape of stools.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Number of days without evacuation

        -  Proportion of evacuation with pain

        -  Proportion of evacuation with strain

        -  Proportion of evacuation with incomplete sensation

        -  Proportion of blocked stools

        -  Proportion of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation

        -  Proportion of subjects that adhere to the diet recommended

        -  Proportion of the patients who have to use rescue medication

        -  Level of constipation improvement, according to the patient evaluation

        -  To evaluate clinical tolerability of the study medication by the continuous use

        -  To evaluate the occurrence of adverse events related to the study drug

        -  To identify any drug interaction.
