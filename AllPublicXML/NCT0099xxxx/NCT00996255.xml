    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, multi center, phase I study, was to determine the safety
      profile of PHA-793887 administered by intravenous infusion to patients with
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors. This was a dose-finding study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and the dose of PHA-793887 that can be safely used in phase II investigations.
