    <textblock>
      Given the availability of aspheric diffractive IOLs with varying negative spherical
      aberration it may be feasible, by selecting the best fit IOL, to minimize aberrations and
      thereby maximize visual performance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Scheduled to undergo bilateral cataract or refractive lens surgery

          -  Visual potential of 20/30 or better in each eye after lens removal and IOL
             implantation

          -  Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 3.5 mm (with no dilation medications)
             for both eyes

          -  Preoperative regular corneal astigmatism of 2.5 D or less

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract

          -  Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular disease other than cataract which could potentially limit uncorrected visual
             acuity or visual performance.

          -  Astigmatism not correctable by limbal relaxing incisions (greater than 2.5 D)

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect visual outcomes

          -  Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results
             (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.)

          -  Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease

          -  History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery

          -  Amblyopia or strabismus

          -  Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that
             affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.)

          -  Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal
             disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of worse than
             20/30

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical
             intervention

          -  Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of
             the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome)

          -  Pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, tonic pupils or abnormally shaped pupils)

          -  Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA lenses, 1 month for gas permeable lenses
             or 1 week for extended-wear and daily-wear soft lenses

          -  Requiring an intraocular lens power &lt;15.0 or &gt;26.0 diopters
