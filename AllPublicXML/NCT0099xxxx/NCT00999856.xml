  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to evaluate a non-invasive method of glucose measurement in diabetics.
      The medical device that is evaluated consists on a sensor-insert which is placed under the
      conjunctiva of the eye of diabetic patients and a photometer. The goal is to prove that the
      sensor signal correlates with the blood glucose of the patients determined by standard
      laboratory blood glucose measurement.

    <description>In the Cohort 1 an uncoated Insert and the photometer version 1 is used. Twelve trial subjects are appointed into 4 subgroups. The difference between these subgroups is the wearing time of the insert.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohort 2 consists of 12 trial subjects who are appointed to 2 subgroups. One group will wear the insert for a minimum of 12 month and the other group for a minimum duration of 18 month. In Cohort 2 an improved insert is used. The photometer will be the same than in cohort 1.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Twelve trial subjects are appointed to two subgroups that differ in the minimum wearing duration of the insert (12 month and 18 month). In Cohort 4 a new insert will be tested together with a better photometer.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 5</arm_group_label>
