  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pralatrexate, given with vitamin B12 and
      folic acid, is effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL). The study will also investigate the safety of pralatrexate with vitamin B12
      and folic acid in this patient population. Additionally, this study includes the collection
      of blood samples to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pralatrexate in this patient
      population (PK is the activity of a drug in the body over a period of time, including how the
      drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, localized in the tissues, and excreted from the
      body).
