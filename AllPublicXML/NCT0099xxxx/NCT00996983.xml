  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is difficult to control because it is only partially sensitive to opioid
      analgesics, and requires the addition of other therapies such as antidepressants and
      epileptics. Ziconotide is a drug that is used to treat neuropathic pain in patients who have
      had inadequate pain control with prior combination of medicines.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and the tolerability of intrathecal
      ziconotide in cancer patients suffering from severe neuropathic pain not controlled by
      previous therapies.
