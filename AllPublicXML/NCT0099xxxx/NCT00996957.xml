  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For cancer cells to grow, they need to have nutrients supplied to them through blood vessels.
      The study drug, ACE-041, is designed to work by blocking the growth of those blood vessels
      and preventing cancer cells from growing. The purpose of this study is to establish safe dose
      levels of ACE-041 in patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma following multiple dose administration. This study will also evaluate if ACE-041 has
      an effect on tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of metastatic or unresectable advanced solid tumors (solid tumors must be
             measurable) or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma for which the disease has
             progressed despite available standard therapies or for which no standard therapy
             exists.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (not
             declining within 2 weeks prior to study day 1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to study day 1, and/or
             nitrosoureas within the 6 weeks prior to study day 1.

          -  Lack of recovery from all toxic effects of previous chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
             biologic therapy, and/or experimental therapy with the exception of alopecia.

          -  Radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to study day 1.

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic,

             multiple myeloma

          -  Significant cardiac risk (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
             pulmonary hypertension, clinically significant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure
             within 1 year prior to study day 1).

          -  Diagnosis or family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

          -  Major surgery within 6 weeks prior to study day 1.

          -  Parenteral antibiotics, or any life-threatening or active infection requiring
             parenteral antibiotic therapy within 1 month prior to study day 1.

          -  Therapeutic anti-coagulation.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Autoimmune or hereditary hemolysis.

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any other clinically significant
             active bleeding within 3 months prior to study day 1.

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or device, or approved therapy for
             investigational use within 28 days prior to study day 1.
