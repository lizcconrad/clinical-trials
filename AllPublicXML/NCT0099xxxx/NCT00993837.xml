  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic thyroidectomy has been used to treat thyroid diseases in China. However, whether
      this technique is rational to treat thyroid carcinoma is still in controversy. The diagnosis
      of thyroid carcinoma is predominantly made according to intra-operative frozen section
      pathological examination in China. In this research, the investigators want to compare
      clinical index (blood loss, operation duration, number of lymph nodes dissected, complication
      rates, etc) between patients underwent endoscopic thyroidectomy ( total thyroidectomy) and
      those underwent conversion to open procedure. The investigators want to evaluate the
      technical feasibility of endoscopic thyroidectomy for treating thyroid carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      intra-operative diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma is usually considered the indication of
      conversion to open surgery. with accumulation of experience of endoscopic thyroidectomy, the
      investigators want to evaluate the technical feasibility, completeness and safety of
      endoscopic thyroidectomy.
