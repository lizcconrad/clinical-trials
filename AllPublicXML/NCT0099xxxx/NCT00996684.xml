  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether microplasmin given by intravitreal
      injection is effective and safe for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD) in patients who have focal vitreomacular adhesion (VMA)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human vitreous gel undergoes progressive liquefaction with age. Concurrent with the
      process of vitreous liquefaction, there is a weakening of the adhesion at the vitreoretinal
      interface between the cortical vitreous gel and the inner limiting lamina. Posterior vitreous
      detachment (PVD) is a separation of the cortical vitreous get from the inner limiting lamina.
      PVD is usually a sudden event during which liquefied vitreous from the center of the vitreous
      body bursts through a hole in the posterior vitreous cortex and then dissects the residual
      cortex gel away from the inner limiting lamina. If there is residual vitreoretinal traction
      around the break, this process may induce a tear in the retina that can in turn result in
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, macular hole, or cystoid macular edema. The importance of
      the vitreous in the progression of diabetic retinopathy may also extend beyond tractional
      considerations. For example, it is believed that the vitreous serves as scaffolding for new
      vessel formation and may also contribute to molecular imbalances that lead to retinopathy
      progression. Therefore, total PVD, by releasing vitreoretinal traction as well as other
      potential mechanisms, may be beneficial in various vitreoretinal diseases such as neovascular
      AMD.

      Vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) in exudative (wet) AMD may be associated with poor prognosis in
      patients with AMD. This trial is primarily aimed at showing that release of VMA can be
      induced by microplasmin, a proteolytic enzyme, in patients with wet AMD, and that
      microplasmin is safe in patients w/ neovascular (wet) AMD. Secondary endpoint will be
      assessment of improved AMD outcomes.
