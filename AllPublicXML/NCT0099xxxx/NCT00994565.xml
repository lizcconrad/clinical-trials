  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CoAct study is investigating a novel lifestyle intervention, aimed at the working
      population, with daily activity monitoring and distance counseling via telephone and secure
      web messages. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle
      counseling on the level of physical activity in an occupational health setting. The purposes
      include also analyzing the potential effects of changes in physical activity on productivity
      at work and sickness absence, and health care costs.

    <textblock>
      CoAct is a randomized controlled trial with two arms: a control group and intervention group
      with daily activity monitoring and distance counseling. The intervention focuses on lifestyle
      modification and takes 12 months. The study population consists of those volunteering from
      1100 eligible employees from a Finnish insurance company. The primary outcomes are change in
      physical activity measured in MET hours per week, work productivity and sickness absence, and
      health care utilization. Secondary outcomes include various physiological measures.
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will also be performed. The outcomes will be measured by
      questionnaires at baseline, after 6, 12, and 24 months, and sickness absence will be obtained
      from the employer's registers.

    <description>The physical activity monitoring and distance counseling concept combines the use of a personal activity monitor with web-based tailored physical activity advice. Users can interactively plan and evaluate their own activity advice based on their actual PA scores and their PA preferences and goals.</description>
