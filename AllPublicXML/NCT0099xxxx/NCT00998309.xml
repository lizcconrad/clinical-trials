    <measure>Number of Participants With an Investigator's Assessment of Clinical Outcome (Effective (Cured)/ Not Effective (Not Cured)) at End of the Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>The physician in charge of the survey performed comprehensive clinical effect evaluation on result of clinical findings, bacteriological effect and others. Clinical effect (Effective (cured)/ Not effective (not cured)/ unable to evaluate effectiveness evaluation) was performed at visits during the observation period by comparing to the data before administration of this drug.Criteria of cured was disappearance or improvement of clinical findings with infections and/or causal bacterial disappearance.</description>
