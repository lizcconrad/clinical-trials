      this study is to analyze and compare the ultrastructure of the retinal and vitreous plane of
      the epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane removed during macular surgery and to
      evaluate relation between the ultrastructure of the epiretinal membrane and internal limiting
      membrane and surgical outcomes.

      prospective, interventional study and includes patients who underwent vitrectomy,peeling of
      an epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane excision with or without intraoperative
      intraocular ICG injection.

      Excised specimens were placed on a Millipore filter, fixed in a paraformaldehyde solution,
      and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections were stained
      with uranyl acetate-lead citrate and inspected in a Zeiss EM electron microscope. The
      assessment was done in a blinded, masked fashion so that the clinicians who reviewed the
      histologic specimens

    <description>three-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed in each case using a vitreous cutter surrounded by a coaxial optic fiber connected to a xenon light source (Lausanne set, Oertli, Switzerland-developed at Jules Gonin, Lausanne, by Gonvers and Bovey). Separation of the posterior hyaloid membrane was performed when necessary. Visualization of the fundus was achieved with a special noncontact wide-angle viewing system 37 during vitrectomy and with a planoconcave contact lens for macular peeling. The MEM was peeled in the macular area using an end gripping forceps.</description>
