  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque is responsible for at least two-thirds of acute
      coronary syndrome. Thus, identification of plaques vulnerable to rupture has become
      important. The natural history of individual plaques is unknown and needs to be established.
      Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is a useful noninvasive imaging modality
      for assessing coronary plaque characteristics. Using MDCT, the researchers prospectively
      investigate the relationship between the characterization of coronary plaques and
      cardiovascular events in a large multicenter study.
