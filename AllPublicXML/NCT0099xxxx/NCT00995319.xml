  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate acute and longlasting side effects
      in patients undergoing radiotherapy for cancer treatment in the head and neck area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Dental Team&quot; at the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Trondheim takes
      care of patients before, during and also after radiotherapy in the head and neck area. In
      spite of the use of advanced radiation protocols and prevention measures such as fluoridation
      splints the team observes significant side effects, both under radiation and also on the long
      term after concluding treatment. Common problems are for example dermal and mucosal damages,
      reduced salivation, dysphagia and lesions of the teeth. Aim of the study is the investigation
      and documentation of side effects and complications in relation to the oral cavity. During
      the acute and postradiation phase a continuous follow-up over a longer lasting period is
      proceeded with registration of all relevant parameters. This includes among others dental
      status and evaluation of quality of life.
