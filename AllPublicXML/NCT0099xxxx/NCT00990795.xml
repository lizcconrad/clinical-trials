  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of cyclosporine has been found to have a myocardial protective effect,
      improving post-operative cardiac function in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      interventions by diminishing infarct size. The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a
      randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing isolated valvular heart surgery,
      or coronary artery bypass surgery. Specifically the investigators will evaluate the
      cardio-protective effects of cyclosporine on post ischemic-arrest myocardium. The two factors
      will be treatment group and cyclosporine versus placebo.

      The specific aim of this study is to perform a randomized controlled study to compare the
      effects of cyclosporine v. placebo on changes in myocardial functioning associated with open
      heart surgery for isolated valvular or coronary artery bypass procedures.

      The research question is:

      Compared to placebo, does administration of cyclosporine just before surgery improve
      myocardial functioning in terms of:

        -  Transthoracic ECHO (TTE) assessment of ejection fraction

        -  Cardiac index (CI), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2), systemic vascular resistance
           (SVR)

        -  Length of stay

        -  30-d mortality

        -  Angina Scale

        -  SF-36 measure of quality of life

        -  Measures associated with myocardial function:

             1. Cardiac Index

             2. Blood glucose level

             3. Serum Troponin I level

             4. Free Fatty Acid levels

             5. Serum CPK-MB levels

             6. Serum phosphoratase levels
