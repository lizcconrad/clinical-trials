      1. Primary Objective:

           The primary endpoint to this study will be to document the toxicities, and reversibility
           of toxicities, of this regimen of hydralazine and valproic acid in patients with
           advanced, unresectable, previously treated lung cancers, for whom no acceptable standard
           therapy is available. A primary endpoint will be to determine any potential dose
           limiting toxicities, and the Maximal Tolerated Dose of this regimen.

        2. Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary endpoint of this study will be to determine any potential anti-tumor effects,
      as determined by the objective tumor response (complete and partial responses), clinical
      benefit (complete and partial responses, and clinical benefit), the time to tumor response,
      the time to tumor progression, and the overall survival.
