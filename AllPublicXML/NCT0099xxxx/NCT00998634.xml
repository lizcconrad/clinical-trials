    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of the treatment with
      lithium in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 2. Moreover, clinical symptoms, neuronal loss, quality of
      life and depressive symptoms, will be considered to further investigate the effect of lithium
      therapy.

      Patients will be progressively enrolled in the study and undergo a screening visit to test
      for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will then be randomized to receive either Lithium
      carbonate or placebo. Patients will visit study center at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks,
      for endpoint and laboratory assessments.
