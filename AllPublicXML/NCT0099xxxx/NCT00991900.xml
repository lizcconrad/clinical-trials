    <textblock>
      Adequate perfusion and oxygenation is essential for the function of the inner retina.
      Although this is a well known fact, measurement of oxygen saturation in the eye is still a
      delicate and not fully explored task. However, recently a new instrument for the non-invasive
      measurement of retinal vessel oxygen saturation has been introduced. Unfortunately, no data
      about reproducibility in humans is yet available for this instrument. Consequently, the
      current study seeks to evaluate the short term and day to day reproducibility of retinal
      vessel oxygenation in healthy volunteers.

      20 healthy volunteers will be included and oxygen saturation of retinal vessels will be
      determined. The reproducibility of the results will be tested by repeated measurements and
      the collected data will be independently analyzed by two observers.
