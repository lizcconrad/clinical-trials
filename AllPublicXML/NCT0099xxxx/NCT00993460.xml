  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that fat stored within muscles affects the muscle's sensitivity to insulin
      and ability to handle blood glucose. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
      weight loss surgery-induced caloric restriction on the accumulation and types of fats within
      skeletal muscle, as well as the effects of such caloric restriction on insulin sensitivity
      and inflammatory responses in skeletal muscle. The investigator proposes that caloric
      restriction will result in decreases in diacylglycerols enriched with saturated fat and
      increases in diacylglycerols enriched with monounsaturated fats.

      We hypothesize that in a setting of surgically-induced weight loss decrements in select DAGs
      result in improved glucose utilization, altered insulin signaling and decreased inflammatory
      responses. We propose to examine the impact of molecular DAG species accumulation on glucose
      utilization, insulin signaling and inflammation in skeletal muscle from morbidly obese
      subjects before/after 10% weight loss facilitated by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). We will
      compare these results to those from a control, normal weight cohort

      The detected differences in DAG molecular species, insulin action, inflammatory responses
      between normal and obese subjects (before/after weight loss) will emphasize pathways
      coordinately altered as a consequence of adiposity and RYGB surgery. The primary endpoints
      for this study will be: Insulin sensitivity (glucose Rd, insulin levels, DAG mass, DAG
      species amounts).Secondary endpoints will be: FFA levels, inflammatory cytokine production,
      and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle.
