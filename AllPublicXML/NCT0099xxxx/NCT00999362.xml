      The purpose of this study is to determine whether calcineurin phosphatase in the
      T-lymphocytes is up-regulated after long-term treatment with tacrolimus, a calcineurin
      inhibitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The immunosuppressive effect of both tacrolimus and cyclosporine is believed to be through
      inhibition of the enzyme calcineurin phosphatase (CaN) in T-lymphocytes. We have
      demonstrated, that tacrolimus decreases CaN activity in patients early after renal
      transplantation. In stable renal transplant patients treated this inhibition was hardly seen
      in patients treated with tacrolimus, while it was clearly demonstrated in patients treated
      cyclosporine. One explanation to this finding could be, that calcineurin phosphatase is
      up-regulated by long-term treatment with tacrolimus. The findings seem to imply, that
      tacrolimus has mechanisms of immunosuppression apart from inhibiting CaN. This could have
      implications for side-effects due to CaN inhibition. Among side-effects thought to be due to
      CaN inhibition is nephrotoxicity. The results may therefore be and indication of tacrolimus
      being less nephrotoxic compared to cyclosporine in long-term stable renal transplant
      patients.

      Purpose:

      The aim of the project is find out if long-term treatment with tacrolimus results in
      up-regulation of CaN in lymphocytes.

      Study plan:

      The general plan of the investigation is to compare CaN in lymphocytes in two groups of renal
      transplant patients treated with tacrolimus. One group just prior and just after
      transplantation compared to a group of stable renal transplanted patients a long time after
      transplantation. CaN is determined as enzyme activity, amount of protein, and by
      gen-activation.
