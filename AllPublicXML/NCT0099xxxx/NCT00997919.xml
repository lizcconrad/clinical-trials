        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male subjects aged 18-50 years and female subjects aged 18-50 years who are not of
             childbearing potential and who are in good general health at the screening visit

          -  Body weight between 50 and 100 kg

          -  For male subjects of reproductive potential, a reliable means of contraception must be
             used (e.g., abstinence or a condom) for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Female subjects with reproductive potential.

          -  Subjects with evidence of clinically significant neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic,
             renal, hematologic, pulmonary, respiratory, immunologic system abnormalities, acute
             infection, or other unstable medical disease

          -  Subjects with any malignancy (with the exception of completely excised basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  History of alcohol, drug, or substance abuse within 6 months prior to randomization
             that, in the judgment of the investigator, may put the subject at risk for being
             unable to participate fully in the study for the duration of the study

          -  Past history of seizures, with the exception of childhood febrile seizures

          -  Clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities

          -  Hospitalization during the 4 weeks prior to screening
