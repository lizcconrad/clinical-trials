      The purpose of this Phase 1 open-label, non-randomized dose escalation study is to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the safety and tolerability of Birinapant
      (TL32711) when administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion once weekly for three weeks
      per repeated 4 week intervals in subjects with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.
      Additionally study will assess anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory
      biomarkers as a measurement of pharmacodynamic effects.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced metastatic or unresectable malignancy that is refractory to currently
             available standard therapies or no effective therapy exists. The subject's malignancy
             must be confirmed by prior pathologic study.

          -  Evaluable disease (measurable or non-measurable) by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.1) or Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma
             (RRCML) (Cheson 2007).

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2.

          -  Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal
             (ULN), or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min.

          -  Adequate hepatic function, defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≤ 3 X ULN and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, defined as absolute neutrophil (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3 (≥1.5
             X106/L), platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3 (≥ 75 X106/L), and hemoglobin ≥ 10 mg/dL in the
             absence of transfusion.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent anti-cancer treatment defined as:

               -  Standard or investigational anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to first
                  dose of TL32711. Exception: continued hormonal interventions for sensitive
                  diseases.

               -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of TL32711.

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary illness resulting in Grade ≥ 2 hypoxia (National
             Cancer Institute Common Terminology criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE, v4]) or
             any requirement for supplemental oxygen, or pulse oximetry less than 90% saturation on
             room air.

          -  Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases requiring current treatment (less than 4
             weeks from last cranial radiation or 2 weeks from last steroids).

             5 years. Auto-immune disease include but are not limited to systemic lupus
             erythematosis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
             ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis (Crohn's disease).

          -  Systemic or chronic topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy within 4
             weeks prior to study entry or anticipated need of systemic corticosteroids or
