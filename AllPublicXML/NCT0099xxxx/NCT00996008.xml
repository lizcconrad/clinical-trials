    <textblock>
      This study will look at how safe and effective, a novel agent, CT 327 cream is in treating
      patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). Patients will be treated twice daily
      for 14 days on specific lesions of AD and safety and symptoms of AD will be assessed
      throughout the treatment period.
