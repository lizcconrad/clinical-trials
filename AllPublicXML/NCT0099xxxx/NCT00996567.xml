    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open phase 2 study on patients with malignant mesothelioma. Standardly, 4 to 6
      cycles of palliative chemotherapy, platinum in combination with pemetrexed, are given.
      Despite of this treatment, median survival is poor (9-12 months). By combining conventional
      cytotoxic agents with a novel agent, hopefully treatment and survival can be approved.
      Cetuximab or Erbitux is a monoclonal antibody against the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor). By blocking the receptor, it interferes with cel growth and division. Most
      mesothelioma show a strong expression of the EGFR protein. Apart from that, Cetuximab also
      has antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

      In this trial, patients will be treated with standard chemotherapy, combined with Cetuximab
      weekly. After a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, administration of Cetuximab will be
      continued until disease progression. Every 6 weeks, a CT scan will be done to evaluate
      therapy. Most common side effect of Cetuximab is acneiform rash.

      The translation research program consists of the determination of EGFR- and K-Ras mutations
      on the tumor tissue and the correlation with outcome.

      In the first part of the trial, 18 patients will be included. After a positive interim
      analysis, a total of 43 patients will be included.
