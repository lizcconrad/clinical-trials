    <textblock>
      INGAP Peptide acetate is the active ingredient of INGAP Peptide Solution for Injection. It is
      being developed as an antidiabetic agent for the restoration of endogenous insulin secretion
      in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in insulin-deficient patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This clinical study is designed to generate additional data
      regarding the appropriate dose and dosing regimen and to evaluate safety and efficacy in
      patients with T1DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In contrast to currently approved therapies that are directed at controlling either the
      metabolic abnormalities or tissue complications of diabetes, INGAP Peptide therapy is
      intended to restore ß cell mass and islet cell function. INGAP Peptide has been identified as
      a substance that induces islet cell regeneration from progenitor cells resident in the
      pancreas in a manner that recapitulates islet development during normal embryogenesis.

      INGAP Peptide therapy has been evaluated in phase 1 and 2 studies of both T1DM and T2DM
      patients (Dungan K, Diab Met Res Rev 2009; 25:558-565). Once daily injections of INGAP
      Peptide for 3 months caused a statistically significant increase in C peptide secretion in
      T1DM patients, and a trend towards increased C-peptide levels was seen in T2DM patients.
      Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by -0.6% (p&lt;0.0125) in T2DM patients and by -0.4%
      (p&lt;0.06) in T1DM patients.

      Given the very short half-life or INGAP Peptide (i.e., &lt;1 hour), the findings of these
      earlier phase 2 studies in patients with T1DM and T2DM are very encouraging in that despite
      suboptimal exposure to the drug, there was evidence of efficacy. Local injection site
      reactions observed in those studies may have been due to relatively large doses of
      formulations that were not optimized for tonicity and patient comfort.

      This study has been designed such that the dose of INGAP Peptide will be divided across three
      daily administrations using a formulation that has been improved with respect to tonicity.
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and C-peptide response associated with this
      dosing regimen in patients with T1DM.
