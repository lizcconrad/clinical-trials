  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panobinostat (LBH589) is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) which belongs to a structurally novel
      cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds. It is one of the most potent class I/II pan-DAC
      inhibitor (pan-DACi) that has shown anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models and patients
      with solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

      To date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of panobinostat has been characterized in patients with
      solid tumors and hematological malignancies participating in several phase I/II clinical
      studies. Panobinostat PK does not appear to be different in patients with solid tumors and
      hematological malignancies. However, the effect of organ dysfunction on PK of panobinostat is
      yet to be elucidated.

      Kidney and liver are involved in the elimination and metabolism of panobinostat. The current
      study is designed to evaluate the impact of renal function status on panobinostat PK.
