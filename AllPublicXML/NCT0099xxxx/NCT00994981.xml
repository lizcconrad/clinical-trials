  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravenous magnesium infusion before
      reperfusion with employing some clinical parameters including blood lactate levels, because
      the intraoperative changes in the blood lactate levels after hepatic allograft reperfusion
      served as an accurate predictor of the initial graft function in living donor liver
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically significant hemodynamic deterioration occurs immediately after reperfusion of the
      grafted liver by unclamping of the portal vein. Profound hypotension, bradycardia, systemic
      vasodilation, and a decrease in cardiac output have been reported, and this is described as
      postreperfusion syndrome (PRS). This hemodynamic instability usually requires adequate and
      aggressive cardiovascular pharmacologic management and fluid support, and recovers slowly
      over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.Because the severity of PRS correlates with patient and
      allograft outcome, prevention of its occurrence or attenuation of the hemodynamic changes may
      improve outcome. However, not much is known about how to protect against this reperfusion
      injury.

      Reperfusion injury also occurs in myocardial infarction, ischemic spinal cord injury and
      stroke. Recent experiments have shown protective effects of magnesium to reduce the
      reperfusion injury of these conditions. Magnesium administration may provide cellular
      protection during ischemia and reperfusion with stabilizing the cellular transmembrane
      potential, suppressing excessive cellular calcium influx and energy demand.
