  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with liver cancer will receive interventional therapy plus radiotherapy. Maintenance
      Sorafenib will be taken after the completion of radiotherapy. Hypothesis of the current study
      is that Sorafenib as a maintenance therapy is safe and superior to radiotherapy combined with
      interventional therapy in terms of survival in comparison to historical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with solitary lesion (bigger than 5 cm in diameter) histologically or cytologically
      confirmed HCC receive TACE (1-3 cycles) plus 3DCRT/IMRT 4-6 weeks later. Maintenance
      Sorafenib will be administered only for the patients with non-progression disease 4 to 6
      weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. The dose will be 400 mg, p.o., twice a day.
      Sorafenib will be continuously given for 12 months unless intolerable toxicities and/or tumor
      progression. Hypothesis of the current study is that Sorafenib as a maintenance therapy after
      combined therapy of 3DCRT/IMRT and TACE is safe and superior to radiotherapy combined with
      TACE alone in terms of time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in comparison to historical data.
