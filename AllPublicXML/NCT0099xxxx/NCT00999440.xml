    <textblock>
      QTc:

      Since the reports of three deaths attributed to Torsade de Point (TdP) related to treatment
      with the long-acting methadone derivative levomethadyl acetate HCl (LAAM), methadone has been
      scrutinized for any possible association with TdP. Since then, several studies among
      Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) patients and chronic pain patients were done, reporting
      diverse results about possible association between methadone dose and QTc prolongation. Most
      studies however were cross-sectional and generally found insignificant clinical prolongation
      of QTc. A follow up studies are of importance, and although few studies have started
      evaluating QTc among MMT patients, none was done among chronic pain patients with no history
      of drug usage. One study of 8 chronic pain patients experiencing insufficient pain control or
      intolerable side effects during treatment with oral morphine switched to oral methadone
      showed insignificant modest increase QTc following 9 month.

      Perceived Sleep:

      Chronic pain patients as well as drug addicts are known to suffer from poor sleep. Some
      studies found possible relation to methadone dose, however, no causal association was found
      and importantly some also found association with duration of opiate usage before starting
      methadone when entry to MMT clinic. Thus, patients with no history of opiate addiction are an
      important interesting group that may help understand relation between methadone usage and
      sleep quality. However, sleep must be evaluate before opiate administration and a follow up
      study is needed
