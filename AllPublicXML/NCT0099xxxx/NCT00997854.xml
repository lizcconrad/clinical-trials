    <textblock>
      Doctors have tried many different methods of feeding to try to decrease feeding intolerance
      in preterm babies so that they spend less time receiving liquid nutrition and have fewer
      problems with feeding intolerance.

      The purpose of this study is to test two different methods of feeding preterm babies in the
      hopes of identifying a method that will decrease some of the feeding intolerance that can
      occur when feeding premature babies.
