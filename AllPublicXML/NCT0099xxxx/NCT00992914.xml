      This study is being done to determine whether stellate ganglion injection with local
      anesthetic (the study procedure) can reduce the number and severity of hot flashes in women
      who have hot flashes.

      Hot flashes can have a significant impact on daily living, disrupt sleep, and lead to fatigue
      and irritability during the day. Hot flashes are the most common reason that women seek
      hormonal therapy. However, for many women, including breast cancer survivors, this is rarely
      an option, and these women seek alternatives to hormonal therapy to treat hot flashes.

      The study procedure has been in clinical use for more than fifty years in treating certain
      disease states and chronic pain. The study procedure has not been used to relieve hot flashes
      and the use of the study procedure with local anesthetic for the reduction of hot flushes is
      considered experimental.
