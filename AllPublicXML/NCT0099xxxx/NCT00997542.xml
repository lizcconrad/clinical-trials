  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to discover whether the inhibition of the xanthine oxidase with
      allopurinol leads to a reduction of the production of oxygen free radicals in patients with
      CHF and thereby improves characteristics of oxydative metabolism, peripheral blood flow,
      immune function and functional status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is a male and at least 21 years of age.

          -  The patient has clinical evidence of heart failure: a) reduced ejection fraction
             (≤40%) or cardiomegaly on CXR or left ventricular impairment on echocardiography
             (LVEDD ≥60mm), b) stable clinical condition and medication for at least 1 month prior
             to the study.

          -  No history of unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke within 3 months prior
             to the study.

          -  The patient is receiving full conventional medical therapy for heart failure (ACE
             inhibitor or angiotensin II blocker, diuretics etc.).

          -  The patient is willing and capable of complying with the requirements of this
             protocol.

          -  The patient has provided written informed consent .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any life-threatening disease, other than heart failure (including
             patients with known, or suspected, myocarditis or with automatic implantable
             cardioverter/defibrillators).

          -  The patient has an active malignancy of any type, or history of a malignancy (Patients
             who have a history of basal cell carcinoma that has been surgically removed are
             acceptable). Patients with a history of other malignancies that have been surgically
             removed and who have no evidence of recurrence for at least five years prior to study
             enrolment are also acceptable.

          -  The patient has severe renal disease (S-Creatinine &gt;300 μmol/l), severe liver disease
             (ASAT or ALAT &gt; 3 times of upper limit of normal range), rheumatoid arthritis, or
             complains of gout.

          -  The patients has received allopurinol therapy previously or if he is known to suffer
             from gout (acutely or chronically).

          -  The patient has an exercise capacity of &gt; 20 ml/kg/min (treadmill, Bruce protocol) or
