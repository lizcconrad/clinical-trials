      This study will determine whether blood tests, tumour imaging and tumour tissue analysis can
      reveal effects of drugs that block blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in patients with renal
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      This single-centre, two-part, open-label study is designed to evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD)
      effects of bevacizumab and pazopanib in subjects with renal cancer who experience disease
      progression following at least one prior therapy of documented clinical benefit. In Part I,
      subjects will receive 3 infusions of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab, administered at 2-week intervals.
      The PD response to bevacizumab will be evaluated over 6 weeks using imaging techniques
      (magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography [CT]; and positron emission tomography),
      intratumoural VEGF signaling by immunohistochemisty, plasma and serum biomarkers, and
      circulating tumour cells. Subjects may continue into Part II if, in the opinion of the
      investigator, the subject would derive continued clinical benefit from anti-angiogenic
      therapy. In Part II, each subject will receive sequentially escalating doses of oral
      pazopanib in 3-week cycles as follows: 1) 200 mg twice weekly, 2) 200 mg every other day, 3)
      200 mg daily, 4) 400 mg daily, 5) 800 mg daily, and 6) 1200 mg daily. Subjects entering Part
      II will be randomised to receive treatment either throughout each 3-week cycle (Group 1) or
      for the first 2 weeks of each cycle only, followed by a 1 week treatment holiday (Group 2).
      After completion of Part II dose escalation subjects will receive continuous pazopanib at a
      dose of 800 mg daily in repeating 3-week cycles. These subjects will receive pazopanib until
      loss of clinical benefit, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for
      other reasons.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically (any histological subtype) or cytologically confirmed unresectable RCC
             with a clear cell component.

          -  Experienced documented evidence of radiological progression based on Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] while on first line (or greater) RCC
             therapy and within 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication (bevacizumab).

          -  Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 malignant tumour
             mass that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter
             greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional CT or MRI or V10 mm with spiral CT
             scan [if spiral CT scan is used, minimum lesion size should be twice the
             reconstruction interval used, e.g., if reconstruction size is 7 mm, lesion size should
             be greater than or equal to 14 mm]) Note: Subject should be excluded if all baseline
             measurable lesions are within previously irradiated areas.

          -  Free of any malignant disease other than RCC for at least 5 years prior to the first
             dose of study medication (bevacizumab) in this study, with the exception of the
             following: Cervical carcinoma in situ, Melanoma in situ, Basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1

          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical
             procedures to NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or less.

          -  Adequate organ function as defined by laboratory ranges Note: Laboratory values just
             outside of these ranges may be included if in the view of the investigator and medical
             monitor, these findings will not interfere with the study or pose an unacceptable risk
             to the subject.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, and willing and able to comply with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Males and females greater than or equal to 18 years of age at screening. A female
             subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential (see below)
             or if she is of childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the defined
             contraception methods from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab)
             until 4 months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib).

        Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented bilateral
        tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal females with 12
        months of spontaneous amenorrhea. If the exact duration of amenorrhea is unknown, a blood
        sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than or equal to 40
        MIU/mL and estradiol less than or equal to 40 pg/mL (less than or equal to 140 pmol/L) will
        be required as confirmation. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
        menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception
        methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
        discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.
        For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
        the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation
        of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of
        a contraceptive method.

        A male subject is eligible to participate if he agrees to use one of the contraception
        methods listed in from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab) until 4
        months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib).

             90 mmHg.

        Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to
        study entry. If antihypertensive medications are initiated or adjusted, blood pressure must
        be re-assessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 24 hours. The SBP/DBP

             the judgement of the investigator, would be unable to forego therapy for an
             approximate 24-hour period around each [18F]FDG-PET procedure.

          -  Any other acute or chronic medical condition or abnormality (e.g., laboratory
             abnormality) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may result in an unacceptable
