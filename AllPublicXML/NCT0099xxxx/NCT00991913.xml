  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in postoperative delirium research, the proportion of patients with
      postoperative delirium is still high ranging between 20-80%. Although postoperative delirium
      is a frequent complication and is associated with the need for more inpatient hospital care
      and longer length of hospital stay, little is known about risk factors for recovery room
      delirium (RRD) occurred in postanaesthesia care unit. The aim of the study was to determine
      pre- and intraoperative risk factors for the development of RRD among patients undergoing non
      cardiovascular surgery.

      Recovery room delirium (RRD) defined as delirium occurred in PACU was diagnosed according to
      CAM criteria. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data of patients undergoing elective non
      cardiovascular surgery were prospectively collected, univariate and multivariate logistic
      regression were performed to find the risk factors related to postoperative delirium.
