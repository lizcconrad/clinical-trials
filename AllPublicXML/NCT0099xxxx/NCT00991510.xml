  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to further investigate how much of the drug substance
      &quot;mycophenolate mofetil&quot; can be found in the blood of patients with kidney or renal
      transplants when treated with Myfenax® or CellCept®. Additionally, the safety and side
      effects of the two products will be compared. All information already available on these
      products indicates that the safety profiles of the two products will be the same.

    <description>Summary of adverse events across three study time periods. The on-treatment time frame spanned the time during which study drug was administered. Relation to study drug was assessed by the investigator.
The Adverse Event count includes serious and non-serious AEs. A serious AE (SAE) was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an important medical event could have jeopardized the patient's safety or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Severity was measured on a three-point scale: mild, moderate, severe.</description>

The Adverse Event count includes serious and non-serious AEs. A serious AE (SAE) was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an important medical event could have jeopardized the patient's safety or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
