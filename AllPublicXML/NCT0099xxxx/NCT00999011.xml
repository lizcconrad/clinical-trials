  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of once and twice daily activity performed with patients
      who are breathing with the aid of a machine in an intensive care unit. Activity can occur in
      bed. Activity can include transfer to a chair and even walking once the patient's condition
      allows safe, out-of-bed activity. The investigators hypothesize that early, progressive
      activity will reduce inflammatory molecules in the blood, promote muscle and physical health
      and help patients to recover more quickly from critical illness.

    <textblock>
      Early therapeutic mobility (ETM) activity has been recommended to facilitate recovery and
      improve outcomes for the survivors of critical illness who experience prolonged mechanical
      ventilation. The effective dose (i.e., type, frequency and duration) of ETM activity is not
      known and there are limited reports about the application and effects of ETM in mechanically
      ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Three inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin
      (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein, are potentially altered by a single episode of ETM
      activity. Systemic markers of physical health (i.e., vital signs, delirium, muscle strength,
      ventilator associated pneumonia, and duration of mechanical ventilation) may also be
      positively influenced by ETM. The primary aim of this interdisciplinary study is to compare
      the immediate effects of frequency--single and twice daily episodes--of ETM activity and the
      effects of type--low and moderate intensity--of ETM activity on molecular biomarkers of
      inflammation and systemic markers of physical health in mechanically ventilated adults. This
      is an experimental design, using repeated measures; subjects will be randomized to receive
      either one or two episodes of ETM activity daily during week days while in the ICU. Type of
      activity will be determined by patient condition. The research questions are:

        1. a. What are the differences between the frequency (once versus twice daily) of ETM
           activities on inflammatory biomarkers: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein
           (CRP)? 1.b. What are the differences between the type (low or moderate) of ETM
           activities on inflammatory biomarkers: IL-6, IL-10 and CRP?

        2. a. What are the differences between frequency of ETM activities on systemic markers of
           physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia
           and duration of mechanical ventilation? 2.b. What are the differences between type of
           ETM activities on systemic markers of physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle
           strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation?

      Data will be collected for a maximum of 3 contiguous days in ICU patients who are
      mechanically ventilated for &gt;48 hours, then weekly to examine short-term patient responses to
      ETM activities in this preliminary study. Daily episodes of activity will be provided by a
      study interventionist. Repeated measures MANCOVA and ANCOVA will be used to answer the
      research questions. This collaborative study evaluates a biobehavioral methodology within an
      interdisciplinary team consistent with the biobehavioral methods to improve outcome research
      (PA-07-008) and the mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to improve
      treatments and health based on evidence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 continuous
             hours in the surgical (SICU) or medical ICU (MICU)

          -  a P:F ratio &gt; 100

          -  FiO2 &lt; 60% and PEEP less than 10 cmH20 at baseline

          -  resting vital signs of HR 50-110, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-110 mmHg, peripheral
             oxygenation saturation (SpO2) greater than 88%. Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no exclusions based on gender or minority status.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have pre-existing or current neurological, muscular
             or orthopedic disorders that require inactivity or immobilization during acute care or
             experience paresis/paralysis that will not improve. Examples of exclusionary
             conditions include end-stage muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, new quadriplegia,
             coma, increased intracranial pressure, unrepaired hip fracture and multiple lower
             extremity fractures.

          -  Patients for high risk of death will also be excluded, using criteria established by
             Norton et al.: ICU admission following a hospital stay of &gt;9 days in the past 12
             months; age &gt;80 in the presence of 2 or more life-threatening illnesses (e.g.,
             end-stage renal disease, severe heart failure (HF); diagnosis of an active stage IV
             malignancy; status post cardiac arrest; and diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage
             requiring mechanical ventilation.[99].

          -  Subjects over 400 pounds can be excluded from mobilization based on the judgment of
             the bedside nurse or project manager; if the risk for staff or patient harm from
             moving a patient with excessive weight is considered likely, mobilization will not
             occur.

          -  Criteria for exclusion include inability to stand or walk for at least 10 minutes
             prior to admission; inability to shift weight in bed or assist with turning, inability
             of staff to access bariatric equipment such as an overhead trapeze, chair, or walker.
