      Few written resources for families have been tested in the primary care setting. Kid STRIDE
      (STRiving to Improve Diet &amp; Exercise) is an educational booklet designed for parents of
      overweight children. We hypothesize that this booklet will benefit a small percentage of the
      overweight and obese population of children as a first-tiered approach to treatment of
      overweight and obese children.
