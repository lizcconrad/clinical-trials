  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, single-center, single-dose administration study to determine
      the absolute bioavailability, clearance, and volume of distribution of GDC-0449 (Part A) and
      to determine the routes of excretion and extent of metabolism of GDC-0449 (Part B). Parts A
      and B will be conducted sequentially, with ≥ 7 days between dosing the sixth subject in Part
      A and dosing the first subject in Part B. In each part, 6 healthy female subjects of
      non-childbearing potential, between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive), will be dosed.
