  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of JNJ-42160443 when administered as a single, subcutaneous injection every 28
      days to patients with diabetic painful neuropathy (a disease condition in diabetic patients
      that affects all peripheral nerves including pain fibers, motor neurons and the autonomic
      nervous system).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor the patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is
      compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in
      clinical study), dose-ranging study (study carried out at different doses) to evaluate the
      analgesic efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of JNJ-42160443 in patients
      with neuropathic pain, followed by a double-blind safety extension and an open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention) safety extension. The study will consist of 5
      sequential phases: 1) screening, 2) a 12-week double-blind efficacy, 3) a 40-week
      double-blind safety extension, 4) a 52-week open-label safety extension, and 5) a 26-week
      post-treatment/follow-up. After the screening phase, patient randomization will be stratified
      by current pain medication use (patients who are currently using or who are not currently
      using permitted pain medication). The planned doses for the double-blind efficacy phase and
      double blind safety extension phase are placebo, JNJ-42160443 1, 3, or 10 mg administered as
      a single, subcutaneous injection every 28 days. Safety assessment will include adverse
      events, injection site evaluations, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital
      signs, physical examinations, neurological examinations, and joint safety which will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total study duration (including all the 5 phases) will be
      approximately 131 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The mean of the daily evening assessment of average pain intensity is measured by using 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as the patient can imagine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at its worst</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of pain at its worst in the past 24 hours will be performed once daily, in the evening, using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as the patient can imagine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-SF) includes 4 items assessing pain intensity (pain intensity subscales) and 7 items assessing how much pain has interfered with daily activities (pain interference subscales). The intensity of pain is assessed with 4 items using an 11-point NRS from 0 = no pain to 10 = higher severity of pain. This assessment will be conducted on daily basis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The NPSI contains 12 questions designed to evaluate the different symptoms of neuropathic pain. The questions make up the following 5 subscales: burning (superficial) spontaneous pain, pressing (deep) spontaneous pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain and paresthesia/dysesthesia. Subscale scores can be derived from averaging the scores from the item scores that make up the subscales, ranging from 0 to 10. A total intensity score is the sum of the subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate worse pain. This assessment will be conducted on daily basis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to rate their change in their neuropathic pain with the following responses: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, not changed, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. This assessment will be conducted on daily basis.</description>
