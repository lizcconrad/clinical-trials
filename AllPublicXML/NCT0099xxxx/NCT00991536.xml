  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of sleep is profoundly affected in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and
      restrictive disorders, with a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep, and
      an increase in sleep fragmentation. Assisted ventilation aims at improving blood gases, but
      may also have a favorable impact on sleep structure. The investigators reviewed
      polysomnographic and blood gas data obtained between 1987 and 2008 in 95 patients with
      restrictive pulmonary disorders, before and after implementing non-invasive ventilatory
      support.

      Chart review of all patients with predominantly restrictive pulmonary disorders treated for
      respiratory failure by NIV at our institution between 1987 and 2008.

      Data systematically recorded included pulmonary function tests, diurnal arterial blood gases,
      and polysomnography before and after implementation of nocturnal NIV.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with restrictive pulmonary disorders (neuro-muscular diseases, chest wall
             disorders, sequellae of tuberculosis) leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure
