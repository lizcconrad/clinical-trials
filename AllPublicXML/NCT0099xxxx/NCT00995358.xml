      The purpose of this study is to evaluate overall survival and immunological monitoring for
      peptide vaccination therapy using novel cancer testis antigens for locally advanced,
      recurrent, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

      The phase I vaccination study using peptides derived from TTK, LY6K, and IMP-3 for locally
      advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who had failed
      for the standard therapy indicated that the vaccine treatment were well tolerated and
      feasible, and that antigen-specific T cell responses were strongly induced by the vaccination
      with some objective clinical responses. Thus, we are currently initiating the randomized
      phase II clinical vaccination study for the same cohort with ESCC to evaluate the survival
      benefit of the cancer vaccination.
