  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this project is to determine whether this 8-month parenting for healthy
      weight intervention is able to help parents improve their parenting skills and make positive
      changes in the nutrition and physical activity environment at home.

    <textblock>
      The early years between ages 3-7 are critical in the development of obesity. The importance
      of the family in the development of children's eating and activity behaviors has been
      emphasized by experts, yet to date no obesity prevention interventions incorporating a strong
      family focus with emphasis on improved parenting practices have been developed. The work
      proposed here will address this gap by testing the efficacy of an 8-mo parenting intervention
      designed to change both social and physical aspects of the home environment, which in turn
      will reduced % body fat in children. Subjects will be 280 families (one parent and one child
      from each) with at least one preschool-age child (2-5 years old). Following baseline
      measures, pairs will be randomized into intervention or control. The intervention will teach
      more effective parenting skills (child management, communication, routines, etc.), then apply
      these skills to specific practices that encourage healthier behaviors. The intervention will
      include group sessions and tailored phone calls facilitated by a registered dietitian who has
      also received training in parent education. Group sessions will use multiple teaching
      strategies and include separate child activities. Tailored calls will use motivational
      interviewing techniques to help parents overcome barriers to behavior change. The
      intervention is guided by Darling and Steinberg's Integrative Model of parenting, which
      highlights the importance of parenting values, style and practices in child socialization,
      and Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory, which suggests ways to foster autonomous
      motivation to adopt new behaviors. The resulting intervention will help parents learn skills
      to reduce their parenting-related stress and create home environments that support
      healthy-weight behaviors. The primary outcome, % body fat in children, will be assessed using
      anthropometry and a validated prediction equation (Dezenberg, 1999). Analyses will include
      baseline measurements of the outcome as a covariate. Secondary measures include child and
      parent diet and physical activity, parenting style and practices, and home environment.
      Maintenance effect will be assessed following a 6-mo no-intervention period. A comprehensive
      analysis is included to test for mediation effects. This intensive intervention will create
      the exposure necessary to make life-altering changes in weight-related behaviors. Plans build
      on extensive formative work conducted by our experienced researchers.

    <description>The parenting program is an 8-month intervention for parents with preschool-age children designed to teach strategies and skills that help parents better manage their day to day stresses of parenting while also promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors. Topics will include stress management, child management, family routines, emotion regulation, and coparenting. In later sessions parents will be encouraged to draw on these general parenting skills to promote healthier nutrition and physical practices at home. The intervention will be delivered through in-person group sessions (n=12) and tailored one-on-one telephone calls (n=11). A complementary child program will be delivered to children while parents are attending the group sessions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Families must have at least one child age 2-5 years. The scientific rationale for
             focusing on this young population is that this age range includes the period often
             referred to as the &quot;adiposity rebound,&quot; which has been identified as one of the
             critical periods for obesity development. Additionally, children of this age are still
             subject to strong parent and family influences which may be amenable to intervention.

          -  At least one parent or caregiver in the household must be overweight (BMI ≥25);
             however, this does not have to be the participating parent. The scientific rationale
             for focusing on families with at least one overweight parent is that having an
             overweight parent increases the child's risk of becoming overweight.

          -  Parents must be willing to participate in measures and intervention activities, and
             give consent for child's and his/her own participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents who are unable to speak English or comprehend standard age-level materials
             will be excluded. Currently funds are not available to translate and provide the
             program in Spanish or other languages.
