  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Iodine I-131 Anti B1 Antibody
      (Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab) for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who
      were previously treated with rituximab antibody. Patients must have been treated with at
      least 4 doses of rituximab and have progressed during or following rituximab therapy.

      Patients will undergo two dosing phases of study. In the first phase, termed the &quot;dosimetric
      dose&quot;, patients will receive an infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) over 70
      minutes immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion of Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) which has
      been radiolabeled with 5 mCi of Iodine-131. Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained on
      Day 0; Day 2, 3, or 4; and Day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric
      data from three imaging timepoints, a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 will be calculated
      to deliver the desired total body dose of radiotherapy. In the second phase, termed the
      &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, patients will receive a 70-minute infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody
      (450 mg) immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody labeled with
      a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to patients with
      no hematologic risk factors. Patients who have platelet counts of 100,001-149,999 cells/mm3
      will receive 65 cGy and patients who are obese will be dosed based upon 137% of their lean
      body mass. Patients will be treated with either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI),
      Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first
      infusion of the Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14
      days following the last infusion of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., therapeutic dose).

      The endpoints of the study are to determine the response rate, complete response rate,
      duration of response, and time to progression or death, based on both a Masked Independent
      Randomized Radiographic and Oncologic Review (MIRROR) panel and the Investigators, and the
      Investigators' assessment of safety and survival of survival of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody
      therapy in NHL patients who have previously been treated with rituximab.

    <time_frame>Participants were evaluated until death (up to 80.2 months in Study BEX104507) or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 10.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants received radioimmunotherapy of tositumomab (TST) and Iodine I 131 TST in 2 phases: Phase 1, dosimetric dose; Phase 2, therapeutic dose. After radioimmunotherapy, participants could have entered a 10-year Long-Term Follow-Up study (Study BEX104526; NCT00240591) for continued evaluation.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>TST and Iodine I 131 TST</title>
          <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years. Participants did not receive any study medication during the LTFU study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Infection</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated until death (up to 80.2 months in Study BEX104507) or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 10.5 years</time_frame>
