        <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) measures permanent functional disability using questions regarding activities of daily living (ADL), specifically disturbance in ADL related to chronic back pain. Higher score indicate a ‘more limited’ life.
The ten topics of the ODI are rated from zero (no pain/limitation) to five (high pain/very limited physically). Calculated values range from zero (0% disability) to 100 (100% disability).
