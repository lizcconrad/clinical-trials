  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a cross-curricular physical
      activity intervention on cardiovascular disease risk factors in 11-14 year olds. The null
      hypothesis states that the intervention will have no effect on cardiovascular disease risk
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Risk factors associated
      with cardiovascular disease including obesity, blood pressure and blood lipids have been
      shown to track from childhood through to adulthood. The prevalence of overweight and obesity
      for children (4-18 years) in the UK is reported to be 15 % and 4 % respectively. Furthermore,
      in comparison to England (2.9 %) obesity is more prevalent for those living in Scotland (7.6
      %) and Wales (6.5 %). Previous research from two Welsh secondary schools indicate overweight
      and obesity rates for boys and girls aged 12-13 to be even greater at 26 % and 38 %
      respectively. Further to this, 19 % were identified as having elevated total cholesterol
      (â‰¥5.2 mmol/L).

      For many, overweight and obesity is the result of the combined effect of excess energy
      consumption and inadequate physical activity. Previous school-based physical activity
      interventions have demonstrated modest improvements to cardiovascular disease risk factors by
      implementing extra-curricular activities or improving current physical education curriculum.
      Few have attempted to increase physical activity using normally, class-room taught curriculum
      subjects. This study examines the impact of activity knowledge circuits to combat
      cardiovascular disease risk factors in 11-14 year old children.

    <description>The activity knowledge circuits were implemented, where in addition to regular physical education (PE) activity was increased by two hours a week over an 18-week period. Participants briskly walked 3200 m twice weekly during curriculum lessons (60 min). Short tasks, in line with current curriculum, were provided by subject teachers for participants to complete at stations set every 400 or 800 m. Crucially participants continued to follow national curriculum whilst exercising. Tasks designed by teachers lasted no longer than 60 seconds at each station. With the exception of PE, each curriculum subject delivered a total of four intervention lessons. Circuits were performed outdoors on school premises, with an indoor course of equal distance used during adverse weather conditions.</description>
