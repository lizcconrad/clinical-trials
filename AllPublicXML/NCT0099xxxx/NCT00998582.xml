      Recent research as suggested that use of the HIV medication abacavir (Ziagen, or
      co-formulated with lamivudine as Epzicom) may increase risk for heart disease, though
      findings from multiple studies have been inconsistent. This pilot study will examine vascular
      function, a marker of heart disease risk, among patients taking abacavir as part of their HIV
      medications and are then randomized to: 1) switch to tenofovir, another HIV medication, or 2)
      continue to take abacavir.

    <measure>Change in Small Artery Elasticity (mL/mmHg x100) From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Small artery elasticity is a measure of vascular function, estimated through analysis of the blood pressure waveform. A sensor is placed on wrist over the radial pulse. The blood pressure waveform of the pulse is recorded and analyzed the elasticity, or compliance, of the small (and large) vasculature. Impaired artery elasticity, or increased stiffness, is an early sign of vascular disease that predicts risk for future cardiovascular events.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (≥18 years) males or non-pregnant females, non-lactating females.

          -  HIV-infected participants currently receiving fixed-dose abacavir/lamivudine based
             regimen for ≥3 months preceding the screening visit.

          -  HIV-infection documented by a positive HIV-1 antibody (confirmatory western-blot) or
             an HIV RNA level ≥1000 copies/mL

          -  Two consecutive plasma HIV RNA concentrations below the limit of detection for
             clinical-based assays used for HCMC and ANW HIV clinics. The 1st HIV RNA concentration
             must be at least 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Subjects receiving lipid lowering agents will be allowed; however, dosing for these
             medications must be stable for ≥3 months prior to study entry

          -  Adequate renal function defined as a calculated creatinine clearance (CLCr) ≥50 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula:

               -  MALE: (140 - age in years) x (wt in kg) = CLCr (mL/min) 72 x (serum creatinine in
                  mg/dL)

               -  FEMALE: (140 - age in years) x (wt in kg) x 0.85 = CLCr (mL/min) 72 x (serum
                  creatinine in mg/dL)

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only)

          -  Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Males and females (of childbearing potential) must agree to avoid pregnancy by sexual
             abstinence, or utilization of a highly effective method of birth control throughout
             the study period and for 30 days following discontinuation of study drug (refer to
             Appendix A for definitions of 'childbearing potential' and 'highly effective method of
             birth control')

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known resistance to abacavir, lamivudine, tenofovir DF, or emtricitabine
             at anytime in the past (including but not limited to K65R, L74V/I, M184V/I, or
             thymidine analog mutations).

             days of baseline

          -  Previous therapy with agents with systemic myelosuppressive, pancreatoxic, hepatotoxic
             or cytotoxic potential within 3 months of study entry or the expectation for such
             therapy at the time of enrollment

          -  Proven or suspected acute hepatitis in the 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Receiving ongoing therapy with any of the following (administration of any of the
             following medications must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to the baseline
             visit and for the duration of the study period):

               -  Nephrotoxic agents (aminoglycoside antibiotics, amphotericin B, cidofovir,
                  cisplatin, foscarnet, IV pentamidine, other agents with significant nephrotoxic
                  potential)

               -  Adefovir dipivoxil

               -  Probenecid

               -  Systemic chemotherapeutic agents (i.e., cancer treatment medications)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids

               -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2)

          -  Evidence of gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome or chronic nausea or vomiting
             which may confer an inability to receive an orally administered medication.

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere
             with subject adherence

          -  Malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) or basal cell carcinoma.
             Participants with biopsy-confirmed cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have

             anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study.

          -  Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral
             antimicrobial therapy within 15 days prior to screening.

          -  Prior history of significant renal or bone disease.

          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with
             the dosing requirements.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs, the metabolites or formulation excipients

        <title>Change in Small Artery Elasticity (mL/mmHg x100) From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>Small artery elasticity is a measure of vascular function, estimated through analysis of the blood pressure waveform. A sensor is placed on wrist over the radial pulse. The blood pressure waveform of the pulse is recorded and analyzed the elasticity, or compliance, of the small (and large) vasculature. Impaired artery elasticity, or increased stiffness, is an early sign of vascular disease that predicts risk for future cardiovascular events.</description>
