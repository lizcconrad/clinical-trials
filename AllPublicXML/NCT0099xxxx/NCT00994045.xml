  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAAA) repair is a major elective vascular operation associated
      with a large blood loss and potentially life-threatening clotting abnormalities. Theses
      clotting abnormalities are principally treated using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (derived from
      human blood donations), the administration of which carries a number of risks including virus
      transmission (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C) and infection
      with variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCJD). FFP is no longer administered to children or
      high-usage adults in the UK because of the infection risk, and recently it was decided by a
      UK advisory body that the use of UK-derived FFP should cease.

      Fibrinogen concentrate is an alternative treatment option to FFP which is thought have less
      infection risk (purified, heat treated) and has been in licensed use for many years in other
      European countries. The investigators have been using fibrinogen concentrate recently in
      their department as an alternative to FFP with encouraging results.

      20 patients undergoing elective TAAA repair at The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh will be
      randomly allocated to receive standard treatment (FFP) or fibrinogen concentrate as treatment
      for clotting abnormalities during their surgery. The investigators will take a number of
      additional blood samples which will provide valuable information about the pattern of
      clotting abnormalities during this type of operation. The investigators will also record
      blood loss and the number of allogeneic (derived from human donors) blood components
      transfused to the patient (red cells, FFP and platelets). Our primary objective is to assess
      the pattern of coagulation abnormalities in both groups. We will also examine whether the use
      of fibrinogen concentrate during TAAA repair avoids the need to administer FFP.
