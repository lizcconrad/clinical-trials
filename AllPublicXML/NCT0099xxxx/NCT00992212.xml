      This present study, a phase II, open label study will evaluate the immunogenicity,
      tolerability and safety of an adjuvanted, inactivated Novel Swine Origin A/H1N1 Monovalent
      Subunit Influenza Virus Vaccine in healthy subjects aged 18 years and above. This study will
      explore the effect of the previous and concomitant exposure to a seasonal influenza
      vaccination to the immunogenicity and safety profile of two different doses of an adjuvanted
      H1N1sw vaccine.

      At enrolment, subjects were stratified into two age strata (18 to 60 years, over 60 years).
      Total duration of the study is eight weeks, which include two weeks for enrolment and 6 weeks
      for study participation. Vaccinations were to be administered on day 1 and day 22. Blood
      samples were collected at day 1 (baseline, before the first vaccination), at day 22 (before
      the second vaccination), at day 29 (one week after the second vaccination) and at day 43
      (three weeks after the second vaccination). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination Inhibition
      (HI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays. Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the first
      and second vaccination.
