      This study will assess alternative formulations of lapatinib for relative bioavailability and
      bioequivalence (BE) with the current commercial formulation (reference). Subjects will be
      dosed for at least one week (7 days) on each formulation and PK samples will be collected
      after each lapatinib formulation dosing Period on Period 1 Day 7 and Period 2 Day7 at
      pre-dose and up to 24 hrs post dose. The study may evaluate up to three alternative test
      formulations. After subjects complete the PK evaluation at the End of Study Visit, if they
      are eligible, they will have the option to enter EGF111767, an open-label, Phase Ib
      continuation study of lapatinib monotherapy or lapatinib in combination with other
      anti-cancer treatments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of: Metastatic breast cancer that
             over-expresses ErbB2 (3+ by IHC; FISH or CISH positive)and the subject has received
             prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab OR Recurrent,
             advanced, or metastatic solid tumor malignancy (including breast cancer that does not
             over-express ErbB2) that is refractory to standard therapies, for which there is no
             approved therapy, or for which lapatinib in combination with one of the permitted
             anti-cancer regimens specified in the continuation study EGF111767 may provide
             clinical benefit.

          -  Is at least 18 years of age.

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:
             Non-childbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
             including any female who is: Pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral oophorectomy
             (ovariectomy), bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy. Post-menopausal defined as
             total cessation of menses for &gt;/=12 months (in questionable cases a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml
             [&lt; 140 pmol/L] is confirmatory). Childbearing potential, has a negative serum
             pregnancy test at Screening and agrees to one of the contraception methods listed in
             the protocol for the time period from 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug
             until 30 days post the last dose of study drug to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point.

             liver metastases.

          -  Has a LVEF within the normal institutional range (or &gt;/= 50%) based on ECHO or MUGA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Has malabsorption syndrome, a disease affecting gastrointestinal function, a GI tract
             bypass in place, or has undergone a resection of the distal stomach and pylorus, small
             bowel, or ascending or transverse colon that could impact lapatinib absorption.

        NOTE: Resection of the gastric antrum, the appendix, descending colon, sigmoid colon and
        rectum are permitted if there is no overt evidence of malabsorption.

          -  Has acute or currently active (e.g.,requiring anti-viral therapy) hepatic or biliary
             disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones,

        Grade 1 (except alopecia or Grade 2 neuropathy that has been stable for at least 4 weeks)
        or any toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is progressing in severity will render
        the subject ineligible unless agreed to by the GSK Medical Monitor and the Investigator.
