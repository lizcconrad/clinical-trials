  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now a general consensus that the combination of excessive energy intake and a low
      capacity to oxidize fat will lead to muscular fat accumulation and insulin resistance. It is
      known for many years that physical exercise is the most powerful treatment to combat insulin
      resistance, but it is also known that it is difficult to get people to exercise. A major
      breakthrough has come from the nutrition field, with the finding that resveratrol, a natural
      polyphenolic compound, could serve as an &quot;exercise mimetic&quot; by protecting mice from many
      detrimental effects of diet-induced obesity. Therefore the researchers would like to
      investigate if resVida can increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and fat oxidative
      capacity in obese subjects. The researchers hypothesize that an increased mitochondrial
      function together with an increased intrinsic activity will lead to a better control of fatty
      acid handling in muscle, upon a high-fat challenge.
