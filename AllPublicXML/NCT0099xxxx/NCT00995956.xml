  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we aim to investigate to what extent the serum albumin concentration in liver
      transplant patients treated with mycophenolic acid (MPA) affect the free fraction of MPA.
      Furthermore we will investigate if a change in free fraction has implications for the
      immunosuppressive effect of MPA by measuring the IMPDH activity. This might in the future
      provide opportunity for further individualisation of the treatment with MPA. We will also
      investigate if the stabilizers present in pharmaceutical-grade albumin have a displacement
      effect on MPA in Vitro (ref).

      This is a prospective, open, non randomised study without intervention. Our main goal is to
      find out what effect the albumin concentration has on the free fraction MPA and IMPDH
      activity in the lymphocytes.

      There will be taken blood samples on day 2, 3 or 4 after transplantation. There will be taken
      one sample before intake of MPA then another 8 samples during the next 4 hours. The samples
      will be analyzed with regards to MPA and IMPDH. We will follow the progress of free fraction
      MPA and IMPDH activity (variables; area under the curve, maximum value, minimum value, time
      to max and min)

      The results will be correlated with the other laboratory results and clinical data. In
      addition to our main aim, to find correlation between free fraction MPA and albumin values,
      we will describe the relationship between free fraction MPA and IMPDH activity. We will also
      study the effect on free fraction MPA after adding stabilizers present in
      pharmaceutical-grade albumin to our serum samples.

      The samples will be taken from an indwelling central venous catheter routinely introduced
      during the transplant surgery. The drug analyses will be performed by the Section for
      analytic pharmacology and endocrinology. MPA concentrations will be measured by a method
      based on HPLC with UV-detection. Enzymatic activity for IMPDH will be analysed by a validated
      method developed in-house (ref). Other biochemical analyzes included in this study is
      routinely analyzed in liver transplant patients
