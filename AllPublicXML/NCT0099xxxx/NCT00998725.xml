      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the birth control pill called LoFemenal
      in HIV+ and HIV negative women who live in Malawi. This is a pilot study to determine the
      effect of antiretroviral therapy on the pharmacokinetics of the most commonly used oral
      contraceptive in HIV+ women; and to measure ovulation suppression in women taking the oral
      contraceptive pill and antiretroviral therapy at the same time. Nine women will be enrolled
      and will be followed for a total of 4 months.
