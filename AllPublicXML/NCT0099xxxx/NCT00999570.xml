      To determine whether specialty training or high volume of operative experience is associated
      with better clinical outcome and quality-of-life scores.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary total knee replacements are becoming a commonly performed procedure. Many general
      orthopaedists can perform large numbers of such surgeries. Thus, we aim to find out if there
      is value of having surgeons with AR fellowship training to perform primary total knee
      arthroplasty. This has an implication in the direction of the training of future AR surgeons
      and in the distribution of operative cases.
