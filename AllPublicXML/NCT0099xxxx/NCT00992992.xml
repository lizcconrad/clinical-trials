  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine the duration of response of the
      sequential administration of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP for
      patients with previously untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). The secondary efficacy
      endpoints for this study are to determine the response rate, confirmed response rate,
      complete response rate, confirmed complete response rate, duration of response for confirmed
      responders, duration of response for complete responders, duration of response for confirmed
      complete responders, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and the predictive
      value of detection of minimal residual disease by molecular techniques on response duration.
      The pharmacokinetic endpoint is to determine the total body residence time of Iodine-131
      Anti-B1 Antibody following the dosimetric dose. The safety endpoints are to determine the
      incidence of adverse experiences, hematologic toxicity, (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time
      to recovery), use of supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine
      antibody (HAMA) positivity, the effects of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody on the growth and
      function of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and survival of patients with previously
      untreated MCL treated with Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP.

    <description>Patients will receive an infusion of unlabeled Tositumomab (450 mg) followed by an infusion of Tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 mCi of Iodine-131 (dosimetric dose). Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained on Day 0; Day 2, 3, or 4; and Day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose. Patients will then receive an infusion of unlabeled Tositumomab (450 mg) followed by an infusion of 35 mg Tositumomab containing a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 calculated to deliver a 75 cGy total body radiation dose (therapeutic dose). Patients who have platelet counts of 100,000-149,000 cells/mm3 will receive 65 cGy; obese patients will be dosed based upon 137% of their lean body mass. Patients will be treated with a thyroid blocking agent 24 hours prior to the dosimetric dose and continuing for 14 days following the therapeutic dose. Approximately 13 weeks following the therapeutic dose, CHOP will be administered every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles.</description>

          <description>Participants (par.) with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were dosed with iodine I-131 tositumomab in two phases, followed by six cycles (21 days per cycle) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). In the first phase (dosimetric dose), par. received an infusion of unlabeled tositumomab (450 milligrams [mg]) over the course of 60 minutes, followed by a 30-minute infusion of tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of iodine-131. In the second phase (therapeutic dose), par. received a 60-minute infusion of tositumomab (450 mg), followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg tositumomab containing a participant-specific dose of iodine-131. This dose was calculated based on the dosimetric dose results to deliver a total body radiation dose of 75 centigray (cGy).</description>

          <description>Participants (par.) with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were dosed with iodine I-131 tositumomab in two phases, followed by six cycles (21 days per cycle) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). In the first phase (dosimetric dose), par. received an infusion of unlabeled tositumomab (450 milligrams [mg]) over the course of 60 minutes, followed by a 30-minute infusion of tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of iodine-131. In the second phase (therapeutic dose), par. received a 60-minute infusion of tositumomab (450 mg), followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg tositumomab containing a participant-specific dose of iodine-131. This dose was calculated based on the dosimetric dose results to deliver a total body radiation dose of 75 centigray (cGy).</description>

        <description>Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and the disappearance of all disease-related symptoms. Complete response unconfirmed is defined as CR, with one of the following: residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters or indeterminate bone marrow. Partial response (PR) is defind as a &gt;=50% reduction in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions; no new lesions. Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented response to the first documented progression.</description>

In the first phase (dosimetric dose), par. received an infusion of unlabeled tositumomab (450 milligrams [mg]) over the course of 60 minutes, followed by a 30-minute infusion of tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of iodine-131. In the second phase (therapeutic dose), par. received a 60-minute infusion of tositumomab (450 mg), followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg tositumomab containing a participant-specific dose of iodine-131. This dose was calculated based on the dosimetric dose results to deliver a total body radiation dose of 75 centigray (cGy).</description>

            <description>Participants (par.) with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were dosed with iodine I-131 tositumomab in two phases, followed by six cycles (21 days per cycle) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). In the first phase (dosimetric dose), par. received an infusion of unlabeled tositumomab (450 milligrams [mg]) over the course of 60 minutes, followed by a 30-minute infusion of tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of iodine-131. In the second phase (therapeutic dose), par. received a 60-minute infusion of tositumomab (450 mg), followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg tositumomab containing a participant-specific dose of iodine-131. This dose was calculated based on the dosimetric dose results to deliver a total body radiation dose of 75 centigray (cGy).</description>
