  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, patients with advanced lung cancer who were inoperable underwent chemotherapy
      with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. More recently, novel new agents targeting specific
      enzymes or pathways responsible for cell division have been developed and clinicians have
      begun to utilize various combinations of these drugs with standard chemotherapeutic agents
      for the treatment of NSCLC. Some of these approaches have demonstrated a small but
      significant increase in survival among patients with advanced disease. Because a recently
      completed Phase 3 study of bevacizumab + Taxol/Carboplatin in first line NSCLC therapy
      demonstrated a 23% improvement in median survival, it would be appealing to see if a regimen
      of bevacizumab/ cisplatin/Alimta would also demonstrate a similar, or perhaps better,
      response rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with NSCLC present with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic
      disease for which no curative therapy is available. For these patients, platinum based
      doublet combination regimens have become standard of care due to increased survival rates
      over platinum therapy alone.

      In order to try to improve on the overall survival, clinicians have attempted to add a third
      cytotoxic agent to their standard regimen(s). Although this approach demonstrated an improved
      objective response, no additional benefit was noted in overall survival.

      Recent development and approval of new targeted chemotherapies during the past 10 years has
      prompted clinical trials to test the efficacy of newly FDA approved agents such as gefitinib,
      erlotinib, and bevacizumab in advanced NSCLC.

      Although gefitinib and erlotinib have both demonstrated clinical activity in refractory
      NSCLC, neither agent improved clinical outcome when added to standard 1st line platinum based
      chemotherapy. In contrast, a recently completed randomized Phase 3 trial investigating the
      addition of bevacizumab to 1st line paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy reported a 23%
      improvement in the median overall survival for the paclitaxel/carboplatin plus bevacizumab
      treatment arm (12.5m vs. 10.2m; p=0.007). It is therefore appealing to study a cisplatin
      combination with bevacizumab to determine if there is any additive benefit. Pemetrexed is an
      ideal agent to use in combination with cisplatin since it is well tolerated and efficacy is
      comparable to other cisplatin combinations. Patients will receive a maximum of 6 cycles.
      Those who complete 1 cycle will be evaluated for toxicity; more than 1 cycle, response.

             include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or
             equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients
             with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed

             must be established by a negative serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
             pregnancy test result obtained during the Screening Period. Pregnancy testing is not
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

          -  Are unwilling to employ adequate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth
             control pills, injections, intrauterine device, or abstinence).

          -  Are currently receiving or have previously received an investigational agent for any
             reason within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage.

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.
