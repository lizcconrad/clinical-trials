    <description>Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial Response (PR) = at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. Progressive disease (PD) = at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment start or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) = neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment start.</description>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

        <description>Stage 2A PK data were reported for each indication specific cohort separately. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. As planned, summary statistics were not derived if fewer than 3 participants had available data; however, if the number of participants analyzed = 1, then the observed data of the single participant was reported as geometric mean.</description>

          <title>CL/F of Cobimetinib on Cycle 1 Day 18 – Stage 2A Individual Indication Specific Cohorts</title>
          <description>Stage 2A PK data were reported for each indication specific cohort separately. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. As planned, summary statistics were not derived if fewer than 3 participants had available data; however, if the number of participants analyzed = 1, then the observed data of the single participant was reported as geometric mean.</description>

Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.

          <description>Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial Response (PR) = at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter. Progressive disease (PD) = at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment start or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) = neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment start.</description>

        <description>Duration of objective response was defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR) until the time of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST, or death from any cause during the study (within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment).

          <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Dose Escalation Stages 1, 1A and 1B</title>
          <description>PFS was the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST, or death from any cause during the study (within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment). PD = at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment start or appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
