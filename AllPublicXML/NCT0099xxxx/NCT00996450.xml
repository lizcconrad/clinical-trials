      This will be a retrospective study. Cases will be identified by looking at the Royal Marsden
      Hospital (RMH) coding database. All the patients will have completed treatment for a brain
      tumour. The children all need to have started school before the diagnosis of their brain
      tumour so that we can look at easily defined educational assessments in this cohort. Children
      will be identified by looking at RMH coding of diagnosis and include children aged between 4
      years and 18 years old (school age).
