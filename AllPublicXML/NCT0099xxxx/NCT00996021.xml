  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, partial-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, cross-over trial
      investigating the effect of GSK1349572 on cardiac repolarization as compared to placebo in
      healthy adult males and females. Approximately 42 subjects will be enrolled in this study and
      will be admitted to the clinic for three separate dosing sessions. Subjects will receive
      single dose administrations of placebo, a supratherapeutic dose of GSK1349572 (250 mg), and
      moxifloxacin (400 mg) in random sequence. Safety of subjects will be monitored by clinical
      observation, measures of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and clinical laboratory measurements.

    <description>This is a three way crossover study with 3 periods. Subjects will receive a single dose of either GSK1349572 250 mg suspension, placebo suspension or moxifloxacin 400 mg tablet in each of the three periods. The order in which the treatments are given will be randomized. There is a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 10-14 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
