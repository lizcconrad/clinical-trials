    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to determine noninvasively whether detection of coronary
      stenosis and plaque by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with acute chest
      pain suspected of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enhances triage, reduces cost and is cost
      effective. Among the 5.6 million patients with ACP presenting annually in emergency
      departments (ED) in the United States, a subgroup of two million patients is hospitalized
      despite normal initial cardiac biomarker tests and electrocardiogram (ECG). This subgroup is
      at low (20%) risk for ACS during the index hospitalization. Most (80-94%) patients with a
      diagnosis of ACS have a significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis ( &gt;50% luminal
      narrowing). However, in -10% of patients non-stenotic coronary plaque triggers events, i.e.
      vasospasms, leading to myocardial ischemia. Since the absence of plaque excludes a coronary
      cause of chest pain, these patients could in theory be discharged earlier reducing
      unnecessary hospital admissions. Recent publications demonstrate high sensitivity and
      specificity of MDCT for the detection of significant coronary stenosis compared with coronary
      angiography and the detection of coronary plaque as validated with intravascular ultrasound.
      Using 64- slice MDCT we propose to study 400 patients with ACP, negative initial cardiac
      biomarkers and non-diagnostic ECG. We will analyze MDCT images for the presence of
      significant coronary artery stenosis and plaque and correlate the data with the clinical
      diagnosis of ACS (AHA guidelines) during the index hospitalization to determine the
      sensitivity and specificity. MDCT data, risk factors, and the results of standard diagnostic
      tests available at the time of MDCT will be used to generate a multivariate prediction
      function and derive a clinical decision rule. Based on this decision rule we will compare the
      diagnostic accuracies and cost effectiveness of competing strategies. We hypothesize that an
      MDCT- based diagnostic strategy will reduce the time to diagnosis of ACS, number of
      hospitalizations, and absolute cost of management of patients with acute chest pain compared
      to standard clinical care and is cost effective.
