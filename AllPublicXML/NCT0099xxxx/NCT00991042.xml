      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  evaluate if there is an association between elevated levels of cytokines and chronic
           pain due to herniated disk disease

        -  measured cytokines levels in chronic low back pain and in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      23 patients with at least three months of back pain due to herniated disk disease were
      selected Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized
      tomography (CT) imaging of the spine for all patients. In addition, pain severity had to be ³
      5 points on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst
      imaginable pain).

      The exclusion criteria were defined as one or more of the following: psychiatric disorders,
      systemic or inflammatory disease, history of allergy, presence of motor deficits, history of
      blood dyscrasia, pregnancy, active infection, tumor, use of analgesic drugs in the week
      before or inability to come to the hospital for evaluation.
