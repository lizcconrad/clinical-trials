  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending
      multiple dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered EDP-322 in healthy adult volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Fifty-two subjects were enrolled into 6 cohorts. Six subjects of each cohort were randomized
      to received EDP-322 and 2 subjects of each cohort received placebo. Each cohort received the
      study drug once daily (QD) for 7 days under fed conditions. Multiple oral doses of EDP 322
      ranging from 200 to 800 mg were safe and generally well tolerated by the healthy male and
      female subjects in this study.
