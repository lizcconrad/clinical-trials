      RATIONALE: Gathering information about how often kidney dysfunction occurs in children and
      young adults receiving methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors learn
      more about the disease and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at kidney dysfunction in children and young adults
      who have received low-dose or intermediate-dose methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the incidence of renal dysfunction in children and young adults being treated
           for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with low- to intermediate-dose methotrexate.

      OUTLINE: Medical charts are reviewed to obtain the following information: gender, age,
      diagnosis, regimen, day of therapy, renal function, creatinine level, mucositis, skin
      sloughing, methotrexate level at highest level, and number of days after intravenous
      methotrexate.
