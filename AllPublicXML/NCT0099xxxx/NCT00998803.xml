  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The limited existing
      knowledge about the impact of influenza in immunocompromised patients suggests that they are
      at increased risk of influenza virus acquisition, of developing complications and of
      prolonged illness and viral shedding. However, some other data about the effect of antiviral
      agents on the infection course, and risk of resistance in immunocompromised children are
      lacking. The emergence of the pandemic H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus has generated an
      additional need to study the epidemiology, clinical course and outcome of influenza
      infections in immunocompromised children. This study proposed to conduct a prospective
      observational clinical study to answer these questions.

      This study aims to do the following;

        -  To evaluate the frequency of influenza virus infections due to various subtypes in
           immunocompromised children and young adults at SJCRH

        -  To describe and compare the clinical course and outcome of pandemic H1N1 influenza
           infection with that due to other influenza virus subtypes in immunocompromised children
           and young adults.

        -  To evaluate the duration of influenza virus shedding in immunocompromised children and
           young adults.

        -  To evaluate the immunologic response to natural infection with various subtypes of
           influenza virus including the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.

        -  To evaluate the viral resistance to antiviral agents in relation to antiviral therapy.

        -  To compare accuracy of rapid methods for influenza A subtyping and for determination of
           antiviral resistance.

      -  Nasopharyngeal swab collection is as follows: after tilting the tip of the patient's
           nose upward, a swab is inserted through the nostril along the floor of the nose into the
           nasopharynx. Then, the swab is gently rotated, removed and placed in its receptacle for
           delivery to the laboratory.

        -  Respiratory specimens will be stored at 2-8ºC and processed within 24-48 hours of
           collection. Serum and whole blood for immune assays will be frozen at -20ºC or in liquid
           nitrogen until processed in batched assays.

        -  All blood specimens will be sent to the laboratory for immunologic assays.
