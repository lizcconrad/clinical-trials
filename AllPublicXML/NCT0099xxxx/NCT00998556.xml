  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      bromocriptine for improvement of left ventricular function of women with Peripartum
      cardiomyopathy (PPCM). A Multi center trial in Germany.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a serious life threatening heart disease of unknown
      etiology in previously healthy women. Only a minority of patients recovers completely while
      the majority of PPCM patients develop persistent ventricular dysfunction and may experience
      severe heart failure leading to cardiac transplantation. Thus, these young patients are very
      sick at a time when the newborn would need a healthy mother. Many of PPCM patients need
      lifelong treatment causing a large financial and social burden. Indeed, a better
      understanding of the disease and more efficient therapeutic options are urgently needed. To
      date, no specific therapy is available so that patients are treated by medical
      pharmacotherapy for heart failure.

      Diagnosis of PPCM is usually made at advanced stages of the disease in severely symptomatic
      women but prognosis of affected women is poor with reported mortality rates of 15% and
      recovery in only 23% to 54% of PPCM patients despite optimal medical treatment. Therefore
      strategies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk and novel therapeutic approaches
      are required to improve poor prognosis of affected women.

      The trial would establish a new specific therapeutic regimen for PPCM and the investigators
      can expect that such a novel approach would be rapidly adopted in the clinical management of
      this disease. Since the trial design follows state-of the-art guidelines, the investigators
      assume that bromocriptine would shortly be adopted into clinical guidelines of the German
      Cardiac Society, European Cardiac Society, and the American Heart Association.

    <description>Patients randomized to the study medication have to take bromocriptine orally for the first 14 days at a dose of 5 mg/day (= 2 tablets, 1 in morning, 1 in the evening). From day 15 to day 56 they will take a dose of 2.5 mg (= 1 tablet) orally in the evening. The duration of the intervention is 8 weeks, thereafter the patients continue to be observed in the follow-up part of the study up to month 6. The study medication is taken on top of standard therapy for heart failure. Part of this therapy are ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are potentially harmful for the baby when getting into the breast milk, as bromocriptine stops milk production, no additional drug is needed.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive standard therapy for heart failure. Part of this therapy are ACE inhibitors. Since ACE inhibitors are potentially harmful for the baby when getting into the breast milk, it is necessary to stop lactation in the control group as well.To stop lactation, application of bromocriptine (2.5mg/day) for up to one week.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects in the first 5 months postpartum with new onset of left ventricular
             (LV) dysfunction (LV ejection fraction â‰¤35% as assessed by echocardiography) using the
             internationally accepted criteria for PPCM 1: absence of an identifiable cause of
             heart failure, absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of
             pregnancy and LV systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classical echocardiographic
             criteria.

          -  Age equal or greater 18

          -  Written informed consent of the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Preexisting cardiac disease (except PPCM which had complete resolution in a previous
             pregnancy)

          -  Any preexisting serious conditions

          -  Previous cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  History of alcohol and/or any other drug abuse

          -  Contraindication to the planned therapy (e. g. hypersensitivity to trial medication or
             one of its components)

          -  Concomitant therapy other than specified in the trial protocol such as products for
             treatment of fungal infections, psychotropic drugs, medication with the active
             substances diclofenace, verapamil or doxycycline.

          -  Women with child bearing potency without effective contraception (i. e. implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs or vasectomized partner) during
             the conduct of the trial. Patients using hormonal methods of contraception must be
             informed about possible influences of the study drug on contraception, in addition
             heart failure drugs may interfere with contraception. Patients will be counselled
             about the safest method to be used for contraception.

          -  Expected low compliance (e.g. by travel distance to trial site)

          -  Concomitant participation in other clinical trials
