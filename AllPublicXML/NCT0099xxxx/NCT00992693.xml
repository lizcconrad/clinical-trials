  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of Intravenous (IV) Ribavirin in treating
      patients presenting with a probable or suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever (either
      Crimean Congo or Lassa Fever) at a military medical treatment hospital. All patients will be
      treated with a 10 day course of IV Ribavirin if they meet all the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria.

    <textblock>
      Department of Defense operations have resulted in the deployment of personnel to areas
      endemic for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) or Lassa
      Fever. Unfortunately, beyond supportive care, there is no approved therapy for treating
      either infection. Previous studies with intravenous (IV) Ribavirin have shown IV Ribavirin as
      a promising treatment for both infections. This study will provide experience in U.S.
      Department of Defense associated treatment facilities in the use of IV Ribavirin for the
      experimental treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers primarily among U.S. Service personnel
      deployed to disease-endemic areas.

      The rationale for conducting the study is a) to allow the DoD to gain experience in treating
      VHF b) to offer this experimental but promising therapy to patients with probable or
      suspected VHF c) to collect safety data while obtaining experience using Ribavirin.

             age.

          -  Has a blood sample drawn and a type and cross-match ordered for transfusion.

          -  Agrees to collection of required specimens.

          -  Agrees to report any Adverse Events, Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Agrees to a follow-up visit and to donate blood and urine specimens at day 14 (Â±2
             days) and once between days 28 and 60 after the first dose of IV Ribavirin and to all
             follow-up visits for anemia or other medical conditions as required by the attending
             physician.

          -  Woman of childbearing age must have a pregnancy test performed. If negative, she must
             agree not to become pregnant during treatment and for 7 months after receiving
             Ribavirin. She also must agree to not breast feed during treatment and for 7 months
             after receiving Ribavirin. Two reliable forms of effective contraception must be used
             including one barrier method during treatment and during the 7 month post-treatment
             period. She will be counseled concerning the risks of IV Ribavirin versus no treatment
             if the pregnancy test is positive.

             months after receiving Ribavirin, and take precautions to avoid producing pregnancies

        All subjects will have a history of possible exposure to CCHF, either having:

          -  Worked or slept outdoors in the CCHF endemic area within 2 weeks of illness onset,
             with or without a history of tick-bite or tick exposure, (Endemic area includes, but
             not necessarily limited to: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Iran,
             Iraq, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, the Kosovo region of Serbia,
             Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, the whole of Africa, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
             Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the
             Crimean region of the Ukraine, Rostov-Don and Astrakhan regions of Russia, and the
             Xinjiang [northwestern] region of the People's Republic of China), OR

          -  Handled blood or freshly butchered meat of domestic livestock in CCHF endemic area
             during 2 weeks before the onset of illness, OR

             (suspected or confirmed), including laboratory specimens, OR

          -  Worked with the virus in the laboratory setting and have a clinical syndrome
             consistent with CCHF as defined by:

               -  Acute illness with fever and at least two of these symptoms: myalgia, low back
                  pain, and headache,

               -  And the appearance of three or more of the following five groups of
                  signs/symptoms:

                    -  Hemorrhage (one or more petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, gingival bleeding,

             within 3 weeks of onset of illness, (Endemic area includes, but not necessarily
             limited to: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mali, Central African Republic, and
             Guinea.) or

             criteria of a probable case and the patient has an epidemiological history of
             potential exposure to the bunyavirus or arenavirus (i.e., recent field duty and/or
             other individuals in his troop have CCHF or LF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has known intolerance to Ribavirin.

          -  Is irreversibly ill on presentation, as defined by presence of profound shock (shock
             which does not respond to supportive therapy within 3 hours after admission).

          -  Has hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL that cannot be corrected to 10 g/dL before initiation
             of IV Ribavirin
