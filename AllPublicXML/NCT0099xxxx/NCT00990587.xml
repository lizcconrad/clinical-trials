  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study. Approximately 3-30 patients will be enrolled.
      Patients will receive Oral ciclopirox olamine (aqueous suspension), initial starting dose of
      5 mg/m2/day administered as a single dose daily for 5 days. Three patients will initially be
      treated at each dose level in sequential cohorts. Dose escalation will continue for each
      subsequent cohort based on toxicity and plasma drug concentrations observed during the
      previous cohort. Dose escalation will continue until establishment of the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) has been met.

      Patients who have demonstrated response to treatment, up to 6 total cycles of treatment may
      be administered. If additional cycles are warranted, ciclopirox olamine will be given at the
      same dose and frequency as the patient initially received.

    <description>Patients will take Ciclopirox Olamine at various doses depending on which dose level they come into the study at. Ciclopirox olamine will be administered orally as an aqueous suspension without food. The starting dose will be 5 mg/m2/day administered as a single dose daily for 5 days (one cycle). Once a MTD has been determined, the new patients that enter into the trial will then take it at that level.</description>
