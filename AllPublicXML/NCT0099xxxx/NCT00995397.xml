  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insect bite related symptoms (pruritus and papules) are caused by the release of histamine by
      mast cells in the skin. Topical anti-histaminics can be used to promote relief of these
      symptoms. Dexchlorpheniramine maleate 1% cream is a topical anti-histaminic formulation
      approved by ANVISA in Brazil for the relief of skin irritation and allergies, including the
      ones caused by insect bites. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate non-inferiority
      of a new pharmacological preparation of dexchlorpheniramine maleate (1% lotion) with the
      standard preparation (1% cream) for the relief of insect bite related symptoms and to
      demonstrate the safety of both preparations.
