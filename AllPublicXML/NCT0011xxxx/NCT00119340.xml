      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fludarabine,
      total-body irradiation, and donor stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil and to see how well they work in treating patients with chronic
      myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether increasing the intensity of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen
           comprising fludarabine and total body irradiation allows achievement of a donor T-cell
           chimerism level of &gt; 40% on day 28 post-transplantation in 90% or more of patients with
           chronic myelogenous leukemia undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation and immunosuppression comprising cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

        -  Determine the feasibility of reducing the day 84 graft rejection rate/graft failure to &lt;
           10% in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of maintaining the incidence of grade 4 acute
           graft-versus-host disease at &lt; 10% in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of maintaining the day 200 nonrelapse mortality rate at &lt; 15%
           in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of complete cytogenetic remission in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the probability of actuarial disease-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and fludarabine in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of fludarabine and total-body
      irradiation (TBI).

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2
           OR days -6 to -2. Patients undergo TBI on day 0.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): After the completion of
           TBI, patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 100
           followed by a taper to day 177 in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
           Beginning within 4-6 hours after the completion of PBSCT, patients receive oral
           mycophenolate mofetil 2-3 times daily on days 0-40 followed by a taper to day 96 in the
           absence of GVHD.

      Cohorts of 5-25 patients receive cumulative doses of fludarabine and escalating doses of TBI
      until 2 of 5, 3 of 10-15, 4 of 20, or 5 of 25 patients experience a day 28 post-transplant
      T-cell chimerism level ≤ 40% and/or a day 84 post-transplant graft rejection rate of &gt; 10%.

      After completion of study transplantation, patients are followed 3 times weekly for 3 months,
      at 6, 12, and 18 months, annually for 5 years, and then periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-75 patients will be accrued for this study.
