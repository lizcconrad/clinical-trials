      The purpose of this study is to compare once a week and once every other week darbepoetin
      alfa on the change in hemoglobin levels between the screening/baseline period and the
      evaluation period (weeks 25-30). This study will also assess the change in mean hemoglobin
      over 4 week intervals, instability of hemoglobin concentrations, darbepoetin alfa dosing
      requirements and red blood cell transfusions.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - -Receiving hemodialysis for at least 6 months before screening -
        -Clinically stable as judged by the investigator - Stable IV rHuEPO therapy administered 1,
        2 or 3 times per week for at least 8 weeks before screening (stable is defined as less than
        or equal to 25% change [up or down] in weekly dose and no change in frequency over 8 weeks)
        - Adequate iron stores (serum ferritin greater than or equal to 100Î¼g/L) during the
        screening period - Available for follow up assessments - Before any study specific
        procedure is carried out, the subject, or his/her legally acceptable representative must
        give informed consent for participation in the study Exclusion Criteria: - -Treatment for
        grand mal epilepsy in the last 6 months - Congestive heart failure (New York Heart
        Association [NYHA] class III or IV)- - Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a predialysis
        diastolic blood pressure measurement greater than or equal to 110mmHg during the screening
        period - Clinical evidence of current uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism (e.g., serum
        parathyroid hormone greater than 1500pg/mL) within the past 12 months - Major surgery
        within 3 months before screening (excludes vascular access surgery) - Previously diagnosed
        HIV or chronic hepatitis B infection - Clinical evidence of current malignancy excluding
        basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin - Systemic hematological disease (e.g.,
        sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hematological malignancy); myeloma;
        hemolytic anemia - Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than
        2 times the upper limit of the normal range - RBC transfusion(s) within 12 weeks before
        screening or during the screening/baseline period, or active bleeding - Clinical evidence
        of current systemic infections - Androgen therapy within 12 weeks before screening - No
        prior treatment with darbepoetin alfa - Currently enrolled in, or has not yet completed a
        period of at least 30 days since ending, other investigational device or drug trial(s).
        Subjects receiving other investigational agent(s) may only enter the study after discussion
        and agreement with Amgen - Pregnancy (women of child-bearing potential must be using
        adequate contraception) - Breast feeding - Psychiatric, addictive, or other disorder that
        compromises ability to give truly informed consent or is likely to alter compliance -
        Anticipating or scheduled for a living-related kidney transplant
