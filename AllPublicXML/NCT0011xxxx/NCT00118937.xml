  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ninety percent of patients with type-1-diabetes will develop late-diabetic complications in
      the eyes, kidneys, nervous- or cardiovascular-system. Poor glycaemic control is an important
      risk-factor for development of these late-diabetic complications. The Diabetes Control and
      Complications Trial (DCCT)-study showed, that improved glycaemic control can prevent the
      development and progression of these late-diabetic complications. Until now treatment with
      insulin- and diet-therapy has been the only treatment-modalities available to improve the
      glycaemic control in patients with type-1-diabetes. A substantial number of these patients
      still have long-standing poor glycaemic control despite intensive treatment with insulin- and
      diet-therapy.

      The antidiabetic drug metformin has shown to be able to improve the glycaemic control in
      combination with insulin and furthermore reduce both mortality and the risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease in patients with type-2-diabetes.

      Only few small studies have investigated the effect of treatment with metformin in patients
      with type-1-diabetes. These studies have suggested a positive effect of metformin in these
      patients too.

      Method:

      100 patients with type-1-diabetes with persistent poor glycaemic control i.e. HbA1c &gt; 8.5%
      during the last 12 months are eligible. Patients are treated for one month with placebo.
      Hereafter half of the patients will be treated with metformin and the other half continues
      with placebo for 12 months both as add-on therapy. All patients are continuing ongoing
      treatment with insulin throughout the study. Before and after the start of treatment with
      metformin the effect on glycaemic control and other known risk-factors for development of
      cardiovascular disease i. e. blood-pressure, fasting lipids, urine-albumine-excretion,
      endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, fibrinolysis etc. is assessed.

      This study will show if treatment with metformin can improve the glycaemic control and hereby
      the prognosis of patients with type-1-diabetes with persistent poor glycaemic control despite
      intensive treatment with insulin- and diet-therapy. This group of patients suffers the
      highest risk of developing late-diabetic complications with reduced quality of life and
      life-expectancy as a consequence.
