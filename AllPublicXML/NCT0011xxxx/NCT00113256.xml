      Patients will be treated with gemcitabine and Orathecin (rubitecan) capsules to evaluate the
      current estimate of overall survival as a study endpoint prior to launching the blinded
      randomized phase (versus gemcitabine and placebo) of the study. Toxicity of the drug
      combination will also be evaluated.
