      The purpose of this study is to compare a new higher-dose influenza virus vaccine to the
      standard dose vaccine in elderly adults who can walk. Current influenza vaccines protect
      elderly against viral influenza but not as well as desired. It is expected that the higher
      doses vaccine can be given with little reaction, but this needs to be tested. Up to 410
      people ages 65 years and older will be recruited from the community and from existing
      volunteer populations. Participants will receive either the high or standard dose injected in
      the muscle, remain in the clinic for 20 minutes afterward, and maintain a daily memory aid
      for 7 days. The memory aid will be reviewed by telephone 8-12 days after the injection and
      return to the clinic or contacted by telephone 6 months after the injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a common respiratory infection caused by several related viruses. Epidemics of
      influenza occur each winter and are responsible for an average of about 36,000 deaths each
      year in the United States. Most of these deaths occur among elderly persons and among people
      of all ages who suffer from chronic diseases, particularly of the lungs and the heart.
      Current influenza virus vaccines protect elderly persons against influenza, but not as well
      as desired. One consideration for trying to increase protection is to increase the vaccine
      dose, but there is some concern that increasing the dose may increase reactions to the
      vaccine (such as sore arm, aches, or fever). One of the vaccine manufacturers has prepared an
      experimental influenza virus vaccine with a dose that is higher than the currently used dose.
      A previous study with the same high dose of the vaccine showed that it was well tolerated
      with only increased reactions at the injection site compared to the usual vaccine. Since the
      study, the high-dose vaccine has also been made without preservative (thimerosal) and
      gelatin, which are in the standard vaccine. It is expected that this vaccine can be given
      with little reaction, but this needs to be determined. It also needs to be shown whether such
      a vaccine stimulates higher levels of infection-fighting proteins (or antibodies) in the
      blood than standard doses of influenza vaccine. The purpose of this research is to compare
      reactions and antibody responses following standard flu vaccine to those following the
      experimental vaccine. Up to 410 people ages 65 years and older will be recruited from the
      community and from existing volunteer populations. Participants will receive either the high
      or standard dose injected in the muscle, remain in the clinic for 20 minutes afterward, and
      maintain a daily memory aid for 7 days. The memory aid will be reviewed by telephone 8-12
      days after the injection and return to the clinic or contacted by telephone 6 months after
      the injection. This study is linked to DMID protocol 05-0028.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for study
        participation:

          -  Ambulatory medically stable persons &gt;= 65 years of age on the date of vaccination

          -  Provides written informed consent and will be available for all study visits

          -  Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures

        Subjects will be considered ambulatory if they are not institutionalized, bedridden, or
        homebound. Medically stable subjects may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension,
        diabetes, ischemic heart disease, or hypothyroidism, but their symptoms/signs must be
        controlled with medical therapy. Subjects with acute febrile illnesses [oral temperature
        equal to or exceeding 99.5ºF (37.5ºC)] will be deferred until 3 days after illness
        resolution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria in order to be eligible for
        participation in this study:

          -  Known allergy to eggs or other components of the vaccine (eg, thimerosal);

          -  History of a severe reaction following influenza vaccination, systemic
             hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening
             reaction to a vaccine containing the same substances;

          -  History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome;

          -  Immunosuppression as a result of underlying illness or treatment;

          -  Use of oral steroids, parenteral steroids, or high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt; 800 µg per
             day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within 1 month prior to vaccination;

             months prior to vaccination;

          -  Active neoplastic disease or history of any hematologic malignancy in the past 5 years
             (except localized skin or prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy);

          -  Acute or chronic condition that (in the opinion of the Investigator) would render
             vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation of responses including, but
             not limited to the following: known chronic liver disease, significant renal disease,
             oxygen-dependent chronic lung disease, New York Heart Association Functional Class III
