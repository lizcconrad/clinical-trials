  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two different types of exercise,
      aerobic exercise training (AET) and resistance exercise training (RET), on quality of life
      (QoL) in early stage breast cancer survivors receiving chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that
      both AET and RET would have beneficial effects on QoL.

    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective, three-armed, randomized controlled trial. Participants were
      stratified by site (Edmonton, Ottawa, and Vancouver) and planned chemotherapy protocol
      (taxane-based versus nontaxane-based) and randomly assigned to AET, RET, or usual care (UC)
      in a 1:1:1 ratio using a random-numbers table. Participants assigned to the AET group were
      asked to perform aerobic exercise three times per week on a recumbent or upright cycle
      ergometer, treadmill, or elliptical. Exercise duration began at 15 minutes for weeks 0
      through 2, and then systematically increased by 5 minutes every three weeks thereafter to 45
      minutes for weeks 18 and beyond. Exercise intensity began at 60% of VO2max for weeks 0
      through 2 and then systematically increased by 10% every 6 weeks thereafter to 80% of VO2max
      for weeks 12 and beyond. Warm-up and cool-down periods consisted of 5 minutes of aerobic
      activity at the power output of the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (approximately 50% of
      peak oxygen consumption). Participants assigned to the RET group were asked to perform
      resistance exercise three times per week, which consisted of two sets of 10 repetitions of 9
      different exercises performed at 60-70% of 1-repetition maximum. The specific exercises were:
      leg extension, leg curl, calf raises, chest press, latissimus pulldown, overhead press,
      triceps extension, biceps curls, and modified curl-ups. Resistance was increased by
      approximately 10% or the next weight level when the participant was able to complete 12
      repetitions per set without difficulty.
