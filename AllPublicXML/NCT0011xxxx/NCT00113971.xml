  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate how epratuzumab is processed by the body
      (pharmacokinetics) and whether 2 dose levels of epratuzumab are safe and effective in
      patients with SLE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to provide information on how the body processes epratuzumab and how
      epratuzumab affects the body when epratuzumab is given once weekly for 4 weeks in a row at
      one of 2 different dose levels. Additional information will be obtained related to the
      natural variability of disease activity in SLE patients.
