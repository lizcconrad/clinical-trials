  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite over 50 years of antibiotic use and multiple clinical investigations (&gt;50), no
      definitive studies exist to confirm or refute the use of systemic antibiotics to prevent
      postoperative inflammatory complications after third molar (M3), aka &quot;wisdom teeth&quot; removal.
      Among patients having M3s extracted, does the administration of systemic prophylactic
      antibiotics when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative inflammatory
      complications? The first specific aim of the study is to implement a randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when
      compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative alveolar osteitis (AO) after M3
      extraction. For this proposal, postoperative AO is the primary outcome variable.

      The second specific aim is to implement a pilot study using a randomized, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo,
      decrease the rate of postoperative infection after M3 extraction. For the purposes of this
      proposal, postoperative infection is a secondary outcome variable. Based on sample size
      estimates, we believe it will be necessary to implement a multi-year trial to address the
      second specific aim definitively. As such, we will use the experience and preliminary results
      derived from this clinical trial to develop and implement a future large scale clinical
      trial.

      The third specific aim is to identify risk factors associated with postoperative inflammatory
      complications in order to develop a model to predict if the prophylactic administration of
      antibiotics will prevent the postoperative inflammatory complications of alveolar osteitis
      and infection following the removal of M3's.

      The long-term goal of this project is to provide compelling clinical evidence to support
      recommendations regarding the use of systemic antibiotics in this setting and alter clinical
      practice based on the results of a well-done, definitive clinical investigation.

    <textblock>
      The management of impacted M3s is a high volume procedure. In the United States, the cost of
      M3 removal has been estimated to be over 2 billion dollars, not including costs for consults,
      x-rays, medications, surgical center charges, or over 5 million surgical extractions and
      treatment of postoperative inflammatory complications (Flick. 1999). Practices associated
      with M3 removal can have a significant impact on large numbers of patients, providers, and
      payers. There is currently no consensus on the use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to
      decrease the risk of inflammatory complications following M3 removal.The most common
      post-operative inflammatory complications following M3 extraction are alveolar osteitis (AO)
      and wound infection (Larsen, 1992; Piecuch et al., 1995; Sekar et al., 2001). AO, aka &quot;dry
      socket,&quot; is a wound-healing problem characterized by severe, unremitting pain. The reported
      frequency of AO is 6-68%. Bacterial colonization stimulates plasmin production and
      fibrinolysis with dissolution of the extraction site clot . More than 45% of patients who
      sustain AO require 4 or 5 more postoperative appointments for resolution of symptoms (Larsen,
      1992; Andra et al., 1990). Given its common occurrence, identifying treatments, i.e. systemic
      antibiotics, to decrease the rate of AO following M3 extraction would be an important
      contribution to enhancing patient outcomes. The second common postoperative inflammatory
      condition following M3 extraction is wound infection. The reported frequency of postoperative
      infection ranges from 1.2 - 27%, with most studies reporting a frequency of &lt;10%. Because
      wound infections are bacterial, it is hypothesized that using systemic antibiotics will
      reduce the rate of postoperative wound infections. There are, however, no definitive
      prospective studies that support or refute the necessity of systemic antibiotics in the
      prevention of postoperative inflammatory complications of AO or infection.

      All studies published to date addressing the role of systemic antibiotics and M3 removal have
      one or more major methodological flaws in study design characterized as :1) no or ambiguous
      definition of the outcome variable, 2) inadequate sample size, 3) non-uniformity of protocol
      design, 4) lack of randomization techniques and 5) poor-follow-up monitoring. Clearly, there
      is a need for a definitive, rigorous, well-designed placebo-controlled randomized clinical
      trial to ascertain the efficacy of systemic antibiotics in preventing postoperative
      inflammatory complications after M3 removal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demographics: While all ages are eligible for study enrollment, as a practical matter,
             most patients having M3s removed are usually &gt; 13-14 years of age.

          -  Gender: Males and females will be offered to participate in this study.

          -  Race: All races and ethnicities are eligible for study enrollment.

          -  Clinical status: at least one impacted mandibular third molar ( M3 ) must be scheduled
             for extraction.

          -  Anesthesia: Patient request that the procedure be executed using intravenous sedation
             or general anesthesia. Intravenous sedation will be accomplished with use of an IV
             placed in the antecubital fossa of each patient

          -  Health status: Healthy patients or patients with mild systemic disease, i.e. ASA
             status &lt; 3, are eligible for study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing infection: Infection is characterised as having an area with frank
             purulence and/or cellulitis characterized by erythema, induration and inability to
             open the mouth wide enough to provide access to the airway.

          -  Pre-existing Systemic Illness: as evidenced by severe dry mouth, patients who have
             undergone radiotherapy for oral cancer, patients that are immunocompromised, patients
             that require antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis, as well as, patients who are
             taking antimicrobials for other systemic diseases, i.e., uncontrolled diabetes., ASA
             status &gt; 2.

          -  Allergic Reactions to Medications: Patients who are allergic to Penicillin and
             Clindamycin will be excluded from the study.

          -  Anesthesia: Patient request that the operation be performed with local anesthesia
             without intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.

          -  Pregnancy: Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for study enrollment. If after
             consultation with the obstetrician, there is no contraindication to removing the
             impacted teeth with sedation or contraindication to receiving the test medications
             (penicillin or clindamycin) and the patient wants to pursue treatment, she would be
             considered eligible for study enrollment.
