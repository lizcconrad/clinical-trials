  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different dosing methods of azathioprine (IMURAN) in participants
      with Crohn's disease who are currently taking steroids (e.g. prednisone or budesonide)or who
      have just started steroids. The study can be up to 54 weeks long. All participants enrolled
      will receive active drug. Participants will take doses either based upon weight or based on
      the patient's ability to breakdown the drug (monitored by 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN)
      metabolite levels in the blood). All patients enrolled in the study will receive active study
      drug.

      This multi-center, double blind (patients and doctors do not know treatment group
      assignment), randomized (patients are put in 1 of 2 groups) clinical trial which will compare
      two 52-week-long azathioprine(AZA) dosing methods.

      The patients enrolled will all be taking steroids (prednisone or budesonide)or have just been
      prescribed a steroid. The patients will be either in remission on steroids, but cannot taper
      off without a flare, patients who are on steroids and are still having Crohn's symptoms, or
      patients who need to start taking steroids.

      After a two week screening period, patients fitting enrollment criteria will be begin taking
      study drug. Patients will begin to taper steroids per a set schedule, and taper off steroids
      completely by week 13. Patients who need to go back on steroids because of returned symptoms
      are allowed to, per a set schedule in the protocol. Patients will have monthly visits that
      include physical exams, blood tests and a quality of life questionnaire. Patients will be
      required to keep a diary of abdominal pain, liquid or soft stools and general well being.

      After 6 months, only patients in remission (patients not on steroids, and not having active
      symptoms) will be allowed to continue for last 6 months of the study. Study visits during the
      last 6 months will be every 2 months, and include physical exams and blood tests, and a
      quality of life questionnaire.

      Patients in the study may receive dose changes, and this will require additional blood tests
      for safety.
