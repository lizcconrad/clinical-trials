  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of providing supplements containing
      alternative combinations of micronutrients during pregnancy on birth weight and other infant
      and maternal health and nutritional outcomes in a rural area of Nepal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal micronutrient deficiencies are common in the developing world and may influence
      intrauterine growth and fetal and neonatal health and survival. Currently, policies for
      antenatal supplementation beyond iron-folic acid are not in place in these settings. And yet,
      the efficacy of such supplementation strategies has not been well established. Specifically,
      it is not clear if multiple micronutrient combinations will enhance fetal growth and newborn
      health and survival compared to single or smaller combinations of micronutrients. Also, while
      birth weight may serve as a proxy measure of newborn health, infant morbidity and mortality
      needs direct examination.

      Comparisons: Pregnant women received daily folic acid, folic acid plus iron, folic acid plus
      iron plus zinc, or a multiple micronutrient supplement containing 11 other nutrients all with
      vitamin A compared to a control group that received only vitamin A.
