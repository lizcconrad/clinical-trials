  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying eflornithine and sulindac to see how well they
      work compared to a placebo in preventing colorectal cancer in patients with colon polyps.
      Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming
      back. The use of eflornithine and sulindac may prevent colorectal cancer. It is not yet known
      whether eflornithine and sulindac are more effective than a placebo in preventing colorectal
      cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the rate of new adenomatous polyp formation in patients with a history of
      adenomatous polyps of the colon treated with eflornithine and sulindac vs placebo.

      II. Correlate the effects of eflornithine and sulindac on polyamine and prostaglandin content
      in the flat mucosa with the rate of new adenoma formation in these patients.

      III. Compare the rate of side effects in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center and aspirin use (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral double placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Patients who are more than 70%
      compliant by pill measurement or self reporting are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral double placebo once daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral eflornithine (DFMO) and oral sulindac once daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues for 36 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      the development of an invasive malignancy.

    <description>The low is defined as the ratios that are below the median spermidine-to-spermine ratio in the analysis cohort. The high is defined as the ratios that are above the median spermidine-to-spermine ratio in the analysis cohort.
In the finalized datasaet, the total number of adnoma detected in the placebo group is 55. The descrepancy in the total number of adnoma detected in placebo group between Outcome Measure 1 and this oucome is due to the revolution of the datatset.

In the finalized datasaet, the total number of adnoma detected in the placebo group is 55. The descrepancy in the total number of adnoma detected in placebo group between Outcome Measure 1 and this oucome is due to the revolution of the datatset.

        <description>Spermine responder was defined as (tissue spermine value at baseline - tissue spermine value at the end of the study)/(tissue spermine value at baseline) ≥ the threshold. Spermine non-responder was defined as (tissue spermine value at baseline - tissue spermine value at the end of the study)/(tissue spermine value at baseline) &lt; the threshold. The thresholds range from 0.25 to 0.45 with an increment of 0.5. The below data are shown for the threshold of 0.30.
