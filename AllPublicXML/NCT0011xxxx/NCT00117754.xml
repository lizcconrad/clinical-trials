  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp hair follicles, which occurs primarily
      in children. Hair loss, hair breakage, scaling, plus various degrees of erythema, pustules
      and pruritus are the primary clinical signs which can be associated with tinea capitis. The
      infection is caused by a relatively small group of dermatophytes in the genera Trichophyton
      and Microsporum.

      Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative antifungal agent. This study
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in children with tinea capitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having a medical condition that alters the absorption and/or metabolism of
             terbinafine (e.g. liver, renal disease etc.)

             elevation of livery enzymes outside of the normal range corresponding to their age

          -  Patients who have received recent systemic or topical treatment for tinea capitis
             within the specified time periods (e.g. systemic antifungals within 2 months of
             screening visit, topical treatments [e.g. antifungals, corticosteroid preparations,
             zinc pyrithione or selenium sulfide or tar containing products] within 1 week of
             screening).
