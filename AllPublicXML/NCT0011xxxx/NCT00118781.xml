  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess whether
      iseganan, applied topically to the oral cavity, can prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia
      among patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated and survive for up to 14 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized and receive their first dose of Study Drug within 24 hours of
      oral/nasal intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The Study Period will
      begin with the first administration of Study Drug (Study Day 1). Three mL of Study Drug (9 mg
      iseganan or matching placebo) will be applied to all visible surfaces in the oral cavity and
      the oral portion of the endotracheal tube (for non-tracheostomy patients) every 4 hours
      through Study Day 14, or until the diagnosis of microbiologically-confirmed pneumonia (based
      on central laboratory results) or extubation, whichever occurs first.

      All patients will be evaluated for clinically defined pneumonia at least once daily and, if
      diagnosed, blood specimens will be collected and cultured, and a bronchoscopic alveolar
      lavage (BAL) specimen (for intubated patients) or a respiratory secretion specimen (for
      extubated patients) will be obtained PRIOR to initiating or changing any systemic
      antimicrobial therapy.

          -  Orally/nasally intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for &lt;24 hours prior to
             scheduled randomization and administration of the first dose of Study Drug, and in the
             judgment of the attending physician, expected to remain intubated and mechanically
             ventilated for at least 48 hours

          -  Expected to survive for at least 21 days and to remain at the investigational site and
             not transferred to another institution while intubated during the 21-day study period

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent, or if unconscious or have

          -  Patient, patientâ€™s family and/or physician not in favor of aggressive medical
             management or presence of an advanced directive to withhold life-sustaining treatment
