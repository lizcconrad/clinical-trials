  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare how the body reacts to different strengths
      of the new H5N1 flu vaccine. The study will also look at how antibodies are made after a
      subject receives the H5N1 flu vaccine. The vaccine will be given as a shot in the arm.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 different dosages of the vaccine or
      a placebo (dummy) dose of the vaccine. Study procedures will include a physical exam, a urine
      pregnancy test for women, and blood samples. Participants will be asked to complete a diary
      to record temperatures, medications taken, and side effects from the vaccine. Volunteers will
      be involved with study procedures for approximately 7 months. The study will enroll about
      450-470 healthy participants, ages 18-64.

      Approximately 450 healthy adults, 18 to 64 years old, inclusive, will be enrolled into this
      multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial. The
      study will be conducted in 2 stages. During Stage I, 113 subjects who meet the entry criteria
      for the study will be randomized to receive saline placebo, or 7.5, 15, 45, or 90 mcg of the
      influenza A/H5N1 vaccine by intramuscular injection in an approximate 1:2:2:2:2 ratio
      (N=25/vaccine dose group and 13 in the placebo group). Subjects will receive 2 doses
      separated by approximately 28 days. Vaccine administration will be performed by an unblinded
      vaccine administrator, who will not be involved in subsequent assessments. Subjects will be
      observed in the clinic for 15 to 30 minutes after inoculation, and subjects will maintain a
      memory aid to record oral temperature and systemic and local AEs for 7 days after each
      immunization. Subjects will be contacted by telephone on Day 2 after each immunization to
      assess for the occurrence of AEs, and they will return on Day 7 for AE and concomitant
      medication assessment, a targeted physical examination (if indicated), and review of the
      memory aid. Serum for immunogenicity evaluations will be obtained prior to the first
      vaccination (ie, at screening for Stage I and Day 0 for Stage II), prior to the second
      vaccination, at Day 28, and on Days 56 and 208. All available 7-day safety data following the
      first dose of vaccine on the 113 subjects enrolled in Stage I will be reviewed by the Safety
      Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to enrollment of the remaining subjects (Stage II), who will
      be followed according to the same protocol. All available 7-day safety data following the
      second dose of vaccine on the subjects enrolled in Stage I also will be reviewed by the SMC
      prior to administering the second dose of vaccine to the subjects in Stage II. This study is
      linked to DMID protocols 07-0022, 05-0006, 05-0090 and 08-0059.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study: 1.
        Male or nonpregnant female (as indicated by a negative urine pregnancy test immediately
        prior to vaccine administration) between the ages of 18 and 64 years, inclusive. 2. Women
        of childbearing potential who are at risk of becoming pregnant must agree to practice
        adequate contraception (ie, barrier method, abstinence, and licensed hormonal methods) for
        the entire study period. 3. Is in good health, as determined by vital signs (heart rate,
        blood pressure, oral temperature), medical history and a targeted physical examination
        based on medical history. 4. In Stage I subjects, should have normal laboratory values of
        Hgb, WBC, Plt, ALT, and creatinine prior to the first immunization. 5. Able to understand
        and comply with planned study procedures. 6. Provides informed consent prior to any study
        procedures and is available for all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from
        study participation: 1. Has a known allergy to eggs or other components of the vaccine. 2.
        Has a positive urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination (if female of childbearing
        potential) or women who are breastfeeding. 3. Is undergoing immunosuppression as a result
        of an underlying illness or treatment. 4. Has an active neoplastic disease or a history of
        any hematologic malignancy. 5. Is using oral or parenteral steroids, high-dose inhaled
        steroids (&gt;800 µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other
        immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. 6. Has a history of receiving immunoglobulin or other
        blood product within the 3 months prior to enrollment in this study. 7. Has received any
        other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live
        vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study. 8. Has an acute or chronic medical condition
        that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would
        interfere with the evaluation of responses (this includes, but is not limited to: known
        chronic liver disease, significant renal disease, unstable or progressive neurological
        disorders, diabetes mellitus, and transplant recipients). 9. Has a history of severe
        reactions following immunization with contemporary influenza virus vaccines. 10. Has an
        acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than 100.4ºF, within 1 week of
        vaccination. 11. Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood
        product, or medication) within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study, or expects to
        receive an experimental agent during the 7-month study period. 12. Has any condition that
        would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk
        of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.
