      The primary goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of using magnetic resonance
      (MR) imaging guidance in the Magnetic Resonance Therapy (MRT) unit at the Brigham and Women's
      Hospital during the implantation of brachytherapy applicators in patients with gynecologic
      malignancies. Patients with gynecologic malignancies requiring brachytherapy are currently
      treated under either fluoroscopic or CT visualization of the brachytherapy applicator.
      Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown in many studies to provide superior visualization
      of the cervix, vagina and uterus compared to CT. However no prior study has examined the
      feasibility of using real-time magnetic resonance imaging to assist in the guidance of
      gynecologic brachytherapy applicators

      The primary endpoint involves the ability of the MRT guided procedure to protect bladder and
      rectal tissues from inadvertent insertion of the interstitial needles used to deliver
      brachytherapy. MR images obtained on the MRT unit should provide clear delineation of the
      bladder and rectum and allow for greater accuracy and avoidance of these normal tissues upon
      interstitial needle insertion. CT images will be obtained following the insertion of needles
      using the MRT unit. The procedure will be considered a failure if CT imaging identifies the
      insertion of needles into the bladder or rectum that was not detected using MR. Secondary
      endpoints include the ability of MR imaging to accurately reconstruct dosimetric plans and to
      construct dose volume histograms after the implantation of interstitial needles as well as
      the ability of MR imaging to accurately determine tumor, bladder and rectal volumes.
      Secondary endpoints will also include the assessment of acute skin, genitourinary and
      gastrointestinal toxicities as well as an assessment of tumor progression or recurrence
      during a 180 day follow-up period.
