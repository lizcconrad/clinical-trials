    <measure>Mean Percent Days of Subclinical Shedding as Determined by Type-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Assay for HSV-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of subclinical days with HSV-2 shedding was defined for each participant as the percent of subclinical days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected by a positive PCR result, that is, the number of subclinical days with HSV-2 PCR shedding divided by total number of subclinical days with PCR data, multiplied by 100. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or subclinical (no genital lesions). Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Days of Total HSV-2 Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of days with total (clinical and subclinical) HSV-2 shedding was defined as the percent of all days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected. Mean percent of days with total HSV-2 shedding was the statistic used to summarize this endpoint for each treatment group. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (no genital lesions). The total shedding rate was defined for each participant as the percentage of all days (clinical and subclinical) on treatment during which shedding was detected by PCR. Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With no Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with no shedding was defined as the number of participants with no HSV-2 shedding detected by PCR divided by the total number of participants with PCR data. During each 60-day treatment period and during washout, swabs were collected daily from the genital/anal-rectal area for HSV-2 detection by PCR. During an outbreak, lesion swabs were also collected for HSV-2 detection by PCR. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (no genital lesions).</description>

    <measure>Mean Log HSV-2 DNA Copy Number Per Day on Days With Subclinical Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 60 of each treatment period (up to 160 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The subclinical shedding rate was defined for each participant as the total number of subclinical days on treatment during which shedding was detected by PCR. Average log HSV-2 DNA copy number per day on days with subclinical shedding was defined as the daily maximum HSV-2 DNA copy number was log transformed and averaged over all subclinical shedding days. During each 60-day treatment period and during washout, swabs were collected daily from the genital/anal-rectal area for HSV-2 detection by PCR. During an outbreak, lesion swabs were also collected for HSV-2 detection by PCR. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (no genital lesions).</description>

      <recruitment_details>From March-2005 to January-2006, 73 participants from 13 centers in the United States were randomized into the study (36 in VALTREX™-Placebo, and 37 in Placebo-VALTEX treatment sequence). One participant in each treatment sequence did not receive study medication and intent-to-treat exposed (ITTE) population was comprised of 71 participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible male or female immunocompetent participants in general good health were enrolled. Additionally, participants must be Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) seropositive at screening. VALTREX (valacyclovir hydrochloride) is registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants were instructed to take caplets at approximately the same time of day each day, without regard to meals. If a dose was missed, the participants take the dose later that day provided they take it at least 2 hours before their next scheduled dose; otherwise the dose was omitted.</description>

For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or subclinical (no genital lesions). Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Days of Total HSV-2 Shedding</title>
        <description>The percent of days with total (clinical and subclinical) HSV-2 shedding was defined as the percent of all days with PCR data for which HSV-2 shedding was detected. Mean percent of days with total HSV-2 shedding was the statistic used to summarize this endpoint for each treatment group. For each participant, each study day was classified by PCR as 'shedding' or 'no shedding'; additionally each day was classified as 'clinical' (presence of genital lesions) or 'subclinical&quot; (no genital lesions). The total shedding rate was defined for each participant as the percentage of all days (clinical and subclinical) on treatment during which shedding was detected by PCR. Genital/anal-rectal swabs was collected daily during each entire 60-day treatment period of each period and the washout period.</description>
