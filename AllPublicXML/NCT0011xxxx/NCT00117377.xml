      The purpose of this study is to identify how pimecrolimus cream 1% modifies the molecular and
      cellular changes associated with the post-lesional phase of atopic dermatitis (AD). Healthy
      volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis will be studied.

          -  AD affecting both arms and/or legs &gt;10cm2 per target area

          -  Willing to undergo 4 mm serial punch biopsies

          -  Patient history of AD for at least 3 years

        Inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:

          -  Volunteers must be males &gt;20 years of age

          -  Volunteers must be in good health, as determined by past medical history, physical
             examination, and vital signs

        Exclusion Criteria:

             prosthetic constituents

          -  Have concurrent skin disease (e.g. acne) of such severity in the study area that it
             could interfere with the study evaluation

          -  Have previously reported poor or no clinical response to topical tacrolimus ointment

             the study treatment

          -  Present with severe medical condition(s) that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             prohibits participation in the study

          -  Are maintained on emollients that contain supplementary ingredients such as urea,
             alpha or beta-hydroxy acids, fruit acids, vitamins A, D or E

          -  Have received phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB) or systemic therapy (e.g.

             prosthetic constituents e.g. lens implants or hip joints

          -  Volunteers with known serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to anesthetics
             such as lidocaine or mepivacaine

          -  Participation in any clinical trial within one month prior to current trial

          -  History of immunocompromise
