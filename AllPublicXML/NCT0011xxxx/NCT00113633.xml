  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy of a three-part Emergency Department (ED)-based &quot;Asthma
      Belief and Control&quot; intervention on healthcare utilization, asthma controller medication use,
      symptoms, and quality of life during the 6 months following an Emergency Department visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inner-city children are particularly at risk for poor asthma treatment outcomes and
      frequently obtain their asthma care in the ED. Prior studies have had limited success in
      improving primary care follow-up, quality of care, and long-term outcomes after a pediatric
      ED visit for asthma. Prior ED-based interventions have been designed to address barriers to
      follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) such as an inability to obtain a follow-up
      appointment or lack of transportation. Focus groups and surveys of inner-city families have
      found that beliefs about the benefits of follow-up care and the role of preventive asthma
      medications have a strong impact on adherence to therapy.

      This study will develop a brief educational video about the benefits of follow-up asthma care
      using a multi-disciplinary panel of experts at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
      focus groups of parents of children with asthma. This educational video will then be combined
      into an intervention along with symptom screening and a reminder phone call that has been
      demonstrated to improve follow-up rates in a previous study. The combined intervention will
      be tested using a randomized trial design to determine its efficacy on healthcare
      utilization, asthma controller medication use, symptoms, and quality of life during the 6
      months following an ED visit. The research is conducted as part of a research career
      development award.

    <measure>Follow-up with a Primary Care Physician (PCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after Emergency Department visit</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, all subjects will complete the Parental Impressions of the Benefits (pros) and barriers (cons) of Follow-Up Care Scale (24-item instrument designed to measure perceived benefits and barriers to follow-up after an ED visit). Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant after the initial Emergency Department visit. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about the number of asthma-related follow-up visits which have been made to the Primary Care Physician. Information provided by families will be verified by medical record review.</description>

    <description>Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant after the initial Emergency Department visit. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about the number of asthma-related visits which have been made to the Emergency Department.

    <measure>Persistent asthma symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after Emergency Department visit</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, all subjects will complete a screening instrument to assess the symptoms of persistent asthma (including cough, wheeze, shortness of breath). Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant after the initial Emergency Department visit. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about asthma symptoms and information will be compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Controller prescriptions by Primary Care Physician (PCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after Emergency Department visit</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, all subjects will complete a screening interview which will assess asthma history, site of primary care physician and current therapies. Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant after the initial Emergency Department visit. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about the number of asthma controller medication prescriptions made by their Primary Care Physician. Information provided by families will be verified by medical record review.</description>

    <description>At baseline, all subjects will complete a screening interview which will assess asthma history, site of primary care physician and current therapies. Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant after the initial Emergency Department visit. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about current asthma controller controller medication use.</description>

    <description>At baseline, all subjects over the age of 6 will receive a peak expiratory flow meter and instruction as per standard care in the Emergency Department. Follow-up telephone contact will be made by the Primary Investigator or a research assistant. The person making the call will be unaware of the subjects group assignment (control or intervention). Families will be asked about peak expiratory flow meter testing since the initial Emergency Department visit.</description>
