    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to:

        -  Find out if patients receiving BAY43-9006 will live longer without tumor progression
           than those receiving standard therapy with interferon alpha-2a

        -  Find out if a higher dose of BAY43-9006 can inhibit tumor progression in patients who
           progressed during standard dose treatment with BAY43-9006, and for how long these
           patients live without progression

        -  Find out how long patients live without progression who receive BAY43-9006 after failing
           to respond to standard therapy with interferon alpha-2a

        -  Find out in how many percent of patients BAY43-9006 prevents the growth of or shrinks
           kidney tumors and/or their metastases depending on treatment and dosage

        -  Find out if BAY43-9006 has any effect on the quality of life of patients with kidney
           cancer

        -  Find out the level of BAY43-9006 in the blood once per month and any changes in this
           level

        -  Find out whether BAY43-9006 effects are associated with specific biomarkers

             anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed
             to participate. For patients on warfarin, close monitoring of at least weekly

        <description>The FKSI questionnaire comprises 15 questions dispatched within 4 domains (respiratory, pain, general symptoms and overall Quality of Life (QoL)) plus 2 individual items. Each question was answered on a five point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) indicating the severity of symptoms. The total score range was from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating subjects reported fewer kidney cancer related symptoms and concerns.</description>

        <description>Tumor Response (= Best Overall Response) of a subject was defined as the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response (CR), confirmed Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD)) observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR was defined as disappearance of tumor lesions, PR was defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of tumor lesion sizes, SD was defined as steady state of disease, PD was defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of tumor lesions sizes</description>

        <description>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status is a scale that measures how cancer affects the daily life of a patient on an ordinal scale from grade 0 (best) to grade 5 (worst).</description>

        <population>At the time of the analysis, only 95 subjects in Sorafenib 400 mg bid group and 89 in Interferon group were documented by study investigators due to various reasons (drop-out of patients by AEs, death etc.)</population>
