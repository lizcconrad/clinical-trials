      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide and dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Thalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood
      flow to the cancer. Giving arsenic trioxide together with ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and
      thalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving arsenic trioxide together with
      ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and thalidomide work in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with previously untreated high-risk or relapsed
           or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) treated with arsenic trioxide, ascorbic acid,
           dexamethasone, and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients with previously untreated high-risk MM treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours and ascorbic acid
           IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5 in week 1 and then twice weekly in weeks 2-12; oral
           dexamethasone on days 1-4, 11-14, 29-32, 39-42, 57-60, and 67-70 (weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9,
           and 10); and oral thalidomide once daily in weeks 1-12.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients
           receive arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid as in induction therapy; oral dexamethasone
           on days 1-4, 29-32, and 57-60 (weeks 1, 5, and 9); and oral thalidomide once daily in
           weeks 1-12.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of consolidation therapy,
           patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours and ascorbic acid IV over 15-30
           minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment with arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid
           repeats every 90 days (every 12 weeks). Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days
           1-4. Treatment with dexamethasone repeats every 28 days. Patients receive oral
           thalidomide once daily. Maintenance therapy continues in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33-68 patients (15-34 with previously untreated high-risk
      multiple myeloma [MM] and 18-34 with relapsed or refractory MM) will be accrued for this
      study.
