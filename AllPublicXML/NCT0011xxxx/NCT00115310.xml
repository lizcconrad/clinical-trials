      This study is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, controlled multi-center evaluation of the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX-4010 for the treatment of PHN. Eligible subjects
      will have moderate to severe pain from PHN, with average NPRS scores during screening of 3 to
      9 (inclusive). Painful areas of up to 1000 square centimeters will be treated during a single
      treatment administration in this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive active
      NGX-4010 patches or low-concentration control patches that are identical in appearance,
      according to a 1:1 allocation scheme.

      Subjects may be on stable chronic oral pain medication regimens, but currently will not be
      using any topical pain medications on the affected areas. NPRS scores for the average pain in
      the past 24 hours will be recorded daily in the evening, beginning on the day of the
      Screening Visit (usually on Day -14). Subjects will continue to record NPRS scores in a
      take-home diary from the evening on the day of treatment through the evening before the
      Termination Visit at Week 12. Subjects will return for interim follow-up visits at Weeks 4
      and 8 following study treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of PHN, with at least 6 months of pain since shingles vesicle crusting

          -  Average NPRS scores for PHN-associated pain during screening period of 3 to 9

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated

          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21
             days prior to Study Patch Application Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain
             medications at same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout study

          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test, within 7 days of Study Patch Application
             Visit

          -  All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain
             from participating in a conception process during the study (or, in the event of early
             termination from the study, for 30 days following experimental drug exposure)

          -  Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study
             participation.

          -  Subjects must sign an informed consent form for this study approved by the

          -  Hypertension, unless adequately controlled by medication.

          -  Significant pain of an etiology other than PHN. Subjects must not have significant
             ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging PHN-related pain.

             proximity to mucous membranes.

          -  Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral
             nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

          -  Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or OTC capsaicin products), local
             anesthetics, oxycodone hydrochloride, hydrocodone bitartrate or adhesives.

          -  Significant ongoing or untreated abnormalities in cardiac, renal, hepatic, or
             pulmonary function that may interfere either with the ability to complete the study or
             the evaluation of adverse events.
