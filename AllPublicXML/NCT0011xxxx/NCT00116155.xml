  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose finding study of CV787 adenovirus in patients with
      hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Patients will receive treatment intravenously
      at one of up to nine dose levels, each containing three to six patients.
