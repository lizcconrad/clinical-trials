      The purpose of this study is to determine if recipients of non-myeloablative ex-vivo T-cell
      depleted peripheral blood (PBSC) stem cell transplantation using a mismatched related donor
      will have less severe graft versus host disease (GVHD), transplant related mortality, and
      less graft failure compared to alternative haploidentical stem cell transplantation.

    <textblock>
      One major obstacle to further advancement in the role of bone marrow transplant (BMT) in
      hematological malignancies is graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which can best be prevented
      by removing T-cells from the donor stem cell product. However, previous experience with
      T-cell depletion has been associated with an increased rate of engraftment failure and
      leukemic relapse. Another obstacle is that a large fraction of leukemia and lymphomas afflict
      older patients who are more prone to GVHD and have co-morbid conditions that prevent them
      from being a candidate for BMT.

      This trial uses a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide, MEDI-507,
      fludarabine, and thymic irradiation followed by a T-cell depleted PBSC infusion. Cyclosporine
      is used for GVHD prophylaxis, and tapered beginning on day 35. Data from our mouse model and
      previous clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach can induce mixed chimerism
      without GVHD, with the potential for conversion of mixed chimerism to full donor
      hematopoiesis following donor leukocyte infusions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease Status: NHL, HD, MM that are chemorefractory or relapsed; CLL that is Rai
             stage III or IV, or lymphocyte doubling time of 6 months, or stage I/II resistant to &gt;
