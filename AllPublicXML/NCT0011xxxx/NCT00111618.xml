  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm a safe dose of AS1404, to be given with docetaxel,
      and to see whether adding AS1404 and docetaxel together improves the outcome of the
      treatment, when compared to docetaxel alone.

      The overall aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AS1404
      in combination with docetaxel in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

          -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months

          -  Histopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer with no previous

          -  Patients who have not undergone surgical castration must continue treatment with an
             luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. In those patients where, for
             some reason, the LHRH agonist has been discontinued prior to entry on the study, it
             should be reinstituted and disease progression must be documented.

          -  Hematological and biochemical indices at screening within the following ranges:

               -  An absolute neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L;

               -  A platelet count of greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L;

               -  A hemoglobin level of greater than or equal to 10 g/dL.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function, as defined by:

               -  Serum bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  SGOT and/or SGPT less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline
                  phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN;

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 120 micromol/L or creatinine clearance
                  greater than or equal to 60 mL/min.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent and, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, be able to comply with the study assessments and follow-up

          -  Serum testosterone no greater than 50 ng/mL (chemically castrated patients only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Decreasing PSA levels after antiandrogen withdrawal

          -  Previous chemotherapy treatment for prostate cancer

             recovery within two weeks of scheduled baseline visit

             screening

          -  Previous exposure to AS1404 or other vascular targeting agents

          -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias and known QTc prolongation (interval &gt;450
             msec)

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might interfere with the patient's participation in the study

          -  A history of alcoholism; drug addiction; or any psychiatric condition, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would impair the patient's ability to comply with study
             procedures

          -  A history of hypersensitivity to taxanes or other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80

          -  Treatment with the following medications within two weeks of AS1404 administration or
             the expected need for such treatments during the study period:

          -  Concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumor type within five years of
             starting the study, except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases

          -  Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy greater than or equal to National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade II

             opinion of the Investigator, compromises the patient safety during study participation

          -  Participation in any prostate cancer investigational drug study in which the study
             drug has not subsequently obtained a product license

          -  Any other concurrent treatment for prostate cancer (with the exception of palliative
             radiotherapy) other than that specified in the protocol, including the use of herbal
             remedies, (e.g. saw palmetto)
