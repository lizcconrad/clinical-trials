  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is proposed to investigate the association between consumption of black tea and various
      selective fasting blood serum and urine biomarkers in a Mauritian population with ischaemic
      heart diseases. This study, the first of its kind, will provide clinical data on the
      potential prophylactic propensities of Mauritian black tea against cardiovascular disease,
      which remains one of the major health threats to the Mauritian population.

      OBJECTIVES

      Our broad objectives will be to:

        -  Survey and recruit patients with ischaemic heart diseases in a randomized sample
           representative of the Mauritian population (ethnicity, gender, age, social and
           economical status) and record their medical history,

        -  Collect fasting blood serum and urine at baseline and after supplement of control volume
           of tea infusion and water from study group and control group respectively,

        -  Optimize techniques to determine levels of specific biomarkers from above body fluid
           samples,

        -  Investigate existing correlation between tea consumption and risk of cardiovascular
           diseases in Mauritian population

      Our specific objectives will be to:

        -  Select a randomised group of the Mauritian population, with ischaemic heart disease, who
           has been referred to the Cardiac Centre, Pamplemousses for Angiography and a group of
           people showing no risk of cardiovascular diseases

        -  Inform the people about the motives of the study and seek consent from those willing to
           participate in the study,

        -  Evaluate the levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL,
           triglycerides, homocysteine, atrial natriuretic peptides, brain natriuretic peptides,
           8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, isoprostanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, products of protein
           damage, uric acid and glycosylated haemoglobin) from 8-10 hr fasting blood serum and
           urine at baseline from all participants

        -  Supply the study group with a control volume of tea infusion and the control group with
           the same amount of water for a defined period of time followed by a two week wash out
           period with water.

        -  Study biomarkers as above from 8-10 hr fasting blood serum and urine in two week
           intervals during the supplement regime

        -  Investigate the existing correlation between tea consumption and levels of biomarkers of
           cardiovascular diseases in a Mauritian sample population.
