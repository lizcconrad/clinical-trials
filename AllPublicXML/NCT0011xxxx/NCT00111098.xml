    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to test a novel dosing paradigm that would facilitate the
      treatment of anemia in CKD patients not on dialysis. Anemic patients who have achieved and
      maintained target hemoglobin (Hb) on every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing of darbepoetin alfa will have
      the dosing interval extended to once monthly (QM) dosing. Extending the dosing interval for
      darbepoetin alfa to QM represents a major potential benefit to both patients with CKD and
      their caregivers.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of CKD and not expected to initiate dialysis for the
        duration of the study - Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): greater than or equal
        to 15 mL/min and less than or equal to 60 mL/min measured by the following modified
        Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation 9, 10 : eGFR = 186 x [serum
        creatinine]-1.154 x [Age]-0.203 x [0.742 if subject is female] x [1.212 if subject is
        black] - Clinically stable, in the judgment of the investigator - Mean Hb greater than or
        equal to 11.0 g/dL to less than or equal to 13.0 g/dL (mean of 2 values drawn at least 3
        days apart during the screening period) - Transferrin saturation (Tsat) greater than or
        equal to 15.0% - Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels above the lower limit of the normal
        range - Receiving stable Q2W subcutaneous (SC) doses of AranespÂ® (darbepoetin alfa). A
        stable dose is defined as less than or equal to 25% change in dose over the 6-week period
        immediately prior to enrollment and with no missed doses in this period Exclusion Criteria:
        - Prior recipient or scheduled to receive a kidney transplant - Diastolic blood pressure
        (BP) greater than 110 mm Hg or systolic BP greater than 180 mm Hg during screening - Acute
        myocardial ischemia - Hospitalization for congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction
        within 12 weeks before enrollment - Parathyroid hormone level greater than 1500 pg/mL -
        Major surgery within 12 weeks before enrollment (excluding vascular access surgery) -
        Currently receiving antibiotic therapy for systemic infection - Known positive HIV antibody
        or positive hepatitis B surface antigen - Clinical evidence of current malignancy and/or
        receiving systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy with the exception of basal cell or squamous
        cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - Red blood cell (RBC)
        transfusions within 8 weeks before enrollment - Androgen therapy within 8 weeks before
        enrollment - Systemic hematologic disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic
        syndromes, hematologic malignancy; myeloma; hemolytic anemia) - Any disorder that may
        impact (in the judgment of the investigator) the ability to give informed consent for
        participation in this study - Pregnant or breast-feeding women - All subjects must practice
        adequate contraception (in the judgment of the investigator) throughout this trial -
        Treatment with an investigational agent or device within 30 days before enrollment or
        scheduled to receive an investigational agent other than those specified by this protocol
        during the course of this study
