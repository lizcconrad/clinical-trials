      The purpose of this study is to examine whether vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol)
      supplementation will reduce the progression of early atherosclerosis in healthy individuals
      over 40 years of age with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than or
      equal to 130mg/dL.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that vitamin E supplementation of 400 IU/day exerts
      positive arterial wall effects by reducing progression of early atherosclerosis in healthy
      individuals 40 years old or older without clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Ultrasonography will be used to measure the rate of change of the distal common carotid
      artery (CCA) far wall intima-media thickness (IMT). The beneficial effects of vitamin E
      supplementation are expected to occur with or without a change in LDL-C levels.

      A total of 353 men and women will be recruited for the three-year trial. Participants will be
      randomized into a treatment group to receive either vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol) 400
      IU/day or a placebo. The ultrasound measurement of CCA IMT will be repeated every six months
      for two years.
