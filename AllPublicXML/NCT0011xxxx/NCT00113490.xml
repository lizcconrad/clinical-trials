  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect on immune reactivity to
      motavizumab (MEDI-524) of monthly intramuscular (IM) doses of motavizumab (MEDI-524)
      administered for a second season in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind study in which motavizumab (MEDI-524) or
      palivizumab was administered to children who previously participated in MI-CP104. Children
      who received at least 3 doses of motavizumab in MI-CP104 were eligible for enrollment.
      Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive motavizumab or palivizumab at 15 mg/kg by IM
      injection every 30 days for a total of 4-5 injections during the 2004-05 RSV season
      subsequent to the season in which they were participants of MI-CP104. All subjects were
      evaluated prior to and 30 minutes after each injection of study drug with 2 follow-up
      evaluations, one at 30 days and the other at 90-120 days after the last dose.
