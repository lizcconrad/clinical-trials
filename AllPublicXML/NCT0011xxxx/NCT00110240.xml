    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the United States. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to acarbose
      in lowering overall blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not been
      previously treated with drug therapy to lower their blood sugar.
