      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of escitalopram in treating
      self-injurious skin picking.

      Purpose: Self-injurious skin picking is a problem documented to occur in 2 % of dermatology
      patients (Gupta, Gupta and Haberman, 1986) , and approximately 4% of the general population
      (Keuthen et al., 2000). It is widely under recognized, with medical sequelae that can include
      scarring, infections, lesions, and potentially life-threatening outcomes (O'Sullivan et al.,
      1999). In a prior study, fluoxetine was shown to be superior to placebo in treating
      self-injurious skin picking in a modest-sized double blind trial (Simeon et al., 1997).
      Similarly, open-label trials of other SSRIs, including sertraline (Kalivas, Kalivas and
      Gilman, 1996) and fluvoxamine (Arnold et al., 1999) resulted in reductions in skin-picking
      behavior. Escitalopram is a new SSRI that may have superior efficacy for the treatment of
      major depression and fewer side effects than other SSRIs. This study aims to assess the
      efficacy of escitalopram in patients who suffer from self-injurious skin-picking.

      Comparisons: Subjects' initial scores on the CGI, HAM-D, SPTS, SPS, SPIS, BDI, BAI, QLESQ, &amp;
      BDDQ will be compared to subjects' final scores.
