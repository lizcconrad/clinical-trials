      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving trastuzumab together with
      docetaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with docetaxel
      and carboplatin works in treating women with stage II, stage III, or inflammatory breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of trastuzumab (Herceptin^®), docetaxel, and
           carboplatin, as measured by tumor response rate, in women with previously untreated
           HER2/neu-positive stage IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC or inflammatory breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy of this regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Course 1 (days 1-28): Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over 30-90 minutes
           on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30-60
           minutes on day 8.

        -  Course 2-6: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 during
           courses 2-5 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during course 6. Patients also receive
           docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for 5 additional courses (6 courses total) in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Three weeks after completion of course 6, patients undergo restaging. Patients with local
      operable disease undergo modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary node
      dissection followed by radiotherapy. Patients also receive trastuzumab IV once every 3 weeks
      for up to 52 weeks of total treatment (including the 6 courses of trastuzumab, docetaxel, and
      carboplatin) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do
      not have local operable disease continue to receive trastuzumab as above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-43 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>A total of six cycles of TCH [(Taxotere® (75 mg/m2) + Carboplatin (AUC = 6) + Herceptin® (2 mg/kg weekly after a 4 mg/kg load on Day 1)] will be administered every 3 weeks.Three weeks after receiving the sixth cycle of TCH, all patients will be restaged.
Those determined to have localized and operable disease (as determined by surgical consultation) will undergo a modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary node dissection. After recovery from surgery, the patients will receive whole breast or chest wall irradiation (as determined by radiologist) with concurrent Herceptin® (6 mg/kg). Following radiation, patients will continue Herceptin® (6 mg/kg) every 3 weeks until they have been on study for a total of 52 weeks.
If patients are staged and are negative they will continue Herceptin® (6 mg/kg)every 3 weeks until they have been on study for a total of 52 weeks.</description>

Those determined to have localized and operable disease will undergo a modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary node dissection. After recovery from surgery, the patients will receive whole breast or chest wall irradiation (as determined by radiologist) with concurrent Herceptin® (6 mg/kg). Following radiation, patients will continue Herceptin® (6 mg/kg) every 3 weeks until they have been on study for a total of 52 weeks.
If patients are staged and are negative they will continue Herceptin® (6 mg/kg)every 3 weeks until they have been on study for a total of 52 weeks.</description>
