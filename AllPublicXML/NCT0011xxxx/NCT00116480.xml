  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading cause of maternal mortality, despite treatment
      with conventional methods. Uncontrolled reports and three small randomised controlled trials
      have suggested that misoprostol may have an additive effect to routine treatment, and there
      is a serious danger that this method will be used widely without research to document the
      effectiveness or risks of this method. In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), we propose
      to test whether 600 Î¼g of sublingually administered misoprostol in women requiring additional
      uterotonics after delivery, and after routine syntocinon to all women during or after
      delivery, has additional effects above the additional conventional uterotonics in reducing
      PPH. Women with measured blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mls in 4 Karachi hospitals
      who give consent will be given locally routine treatment for PPH. In addition, they will be
      enrolled by drawing the next of a series of randomised treatment packs containing misoprostol
      or placebo. The primary outcome measure will be blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mls
      after enrolment.
