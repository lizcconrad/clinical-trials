    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to expand the data describing the safety profile of FluMist in
      the indicated populations (5-8, 9-17, and 18-49 years of age) and to assess the safety of
      annual revaccination in those who received FluMist in 2 or more consecutive years.

      The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of FluMist vaccination by
      comparing the rates of medically attended events (MAEs) (including serious adverse events
      [SAEs], anaphylaxis, urticaria, asthma, wheezing, pre-specified grouped diagnoses, and rare
      events potentially related to wild-type influenza) in FluMist recipients to rates in multiple
      non-randomized control groups.

    <measure>Rates of Medically Attended Events (MAEs) Associated With a Significant Increased Risk in FluMist Recipients Compared to Rates in Within Cohort, Unvaccinated, and TIV Control Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>21 and 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>An MAE was defined as a coded medical diagnosis made by a health care provider and associated with a medical encounter (ie, a visit by a health plan member to a medical clinic or ED, or a hospital admission). Incident rate comparisons of MAEs with an identified increased risk associated with FluMist occurring in the same age group and setting across all three comparison groups, as these events are less likely to be due to chance alone.</description>

          <title>FluMist Recipients</title>
          <description>Subjects who had been immunized with FluMist as part of routine clinical practice at health care centers within the KP Health Care Plan. Subjects from 5-8 years of age may have received 1 or 2 doses of FluMist, while subjects ≥ 9 years of age were expected to receive only 1 dose. FluMist recipients served as their own controls based on the observation time after vaccination. In the primary analyses using within-cohort controls, “risk” periods of Days 0 to 3 and Days 0 to 21 post vaccination were compared to “reference” observation time occurring after the respective risk periods, ie, Days 4 to 42 for the risk period of Days 0 to 3 and Days 22 to 42 for the risk period of Days 0 to 21.</description>

Incident rate comparisons of MAEs with an identified increased risk associated with FluMist occurring in the same age group and setting across all three comparison groups, as these events are less likely to be due to chance alone.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had been immunized with FluMist as part of routine clinical practice at health care centers within the Kaiser Permanente Health Care Plan. Subjects from 5-8 years of age may have received 1 or 2 doses of FluMist, while subjects ≥ 9 years of age were expected to receive only 1 dose.</description>

            <description>Non-randomized TIV-vaccinated subjects matched 1:1 with FluMist recipients and were selected from the pool of individuals who received TIV but not FluMist at the Kaiser HMO during the same month that the reference FluMist recipient was vaccinated. Other matching factors included age (within 1 year), gender, prior year health care utilization level (ie, similar number of hospital, ED, and clinic visits), and medical center (only for subjects from Northern California).</description>

          <title>Rates of Asthma and Wheezing Within 21 and 42 Days in FluMist Recipients Compared to Rates in the TIV Control Group</title>
          <description>Incident rate comparisons associated with a significantly decreased risk in FluMist recipients compared to the TIV control group for all ages, 5-8, 9-17, and 18-49 years of age. No asthma and wheezing incidence rate comparisons were significantly increased in FluMist recipients compared to the TIV control group.</description>
          <population>Analyses were performed by period (21 and 42 days), age group (5-8, 9-17, 18-49 years of age), setting (clinic, hospital, or ED), and number of doses (one or two for ages 5-8 years). Significance was observed across all settings, post Dose 1 within 21 days and 42 days (all age groups) and post Dose 2 (PD2) within 42 days (5-8 yrs).</population>
