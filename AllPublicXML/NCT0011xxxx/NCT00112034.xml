    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with
      AVONEX plus low dose oral methotrexate (MTX), every other month courses of intravenous
      methylprednisolone (IVMP), or both in patients with continued disease activity on AVONEX
      monotherapy.
