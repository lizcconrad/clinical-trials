      The purpose of the study is to determine whether oral contraceptives, desmopressin acetate,
      and/or tranexamic acid are effective in the treatment of women with menorrhagia who are
      diagnosed with a bleeding disorder.

      Menorrhagia is a common clinical problem. Morbid events include dysmenorrhea,
      hospitalizations, red blood cell transfusions, and quality of life impairment in terms of
      daily activities, chronic pain, and time lost from work and or school. Up to 60% of women
      with uncontrolled menorrhagia undergo hysterectomy. Up to 20% of women with menorrhagia may
      have undiagnosed von Willebrand disease (vWd), or other bleeding disorders. Prevalence of vWd
      in the general population is estimated at just over 1%. Intuitively, the prevalence of vWd in
      women with menorrhagia is probably higher since platelet plug formation is necessary for
      menstrual hemostasis. Current management of menorrhagia in patients in the United States
      often begins with hormonal therapy. Estrogen and estrogen derivatives in oral contraceptives
      have been shown to increase von Willebrand factor (vWf) levels. Women with menorrhagia who
      have vWd or who are hemophilia A carriers have also been successfully treated with
      desmopressin acetate (DDAVP, Stimate® Nasal Spray). Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron) is utilized
      extensively for menorrhagia in Australia and the United Kingdom. Standard hormonal therapy
      has not been compared with desmopressin or antifibrinolytics for menorrhagia. This study will
      compare treatment options for women with menorrhagia who have a detectable bleeding disorder.
      Investigators will document the effect on quality of life, menstrual flow, and coagulation
      parameters of treatment with oral contraceptive pills, desmopressin, or tranexamic acid.
