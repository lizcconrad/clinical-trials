      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an additional 28 weeks of treatment
      with pegsunercept for subjects who have completed treatment in a previous double-blind study
      (20000201 or 20000198). In addition, this study will evaluate the efficacy and the
      feasibility of subject self-administration on an outpatient basis.
