  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of ICAC-01 is to determine whether an asthma treatment strategy that measures
      exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) to indicate disease progression is more effective in treating
      asthma symptoms when combined with existing asthma treatment guidelines than treatment using
      the guidelines alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, the prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased in many parts
      of the world. The current National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) identifies
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the preferred long-term control therapy for all forms of
      persistent asthma. However, there is still a significant proportion of patients with
      persistent asthma who are not receiving ICS therapy or do not follow their treatment plan.
      Individualized asthma treatment plans are needed. The use of biomarkers, in addition to NAEPP
      guidelines, may help enhance the level of asthma assessment, guide medication regimens, and
      improve overall asthma control. This study will determine whether NAEPP-recommended
      treatment, combined with eNO measurement, is more effective in reducing asthma symptoms than
      NAEPP-recommended treatment alone. ICAC-01 will last 46 weeks and will comprise 8 study
      visits.

      ICAC-01 also includes a mechanistic sub-study (ICAC-02). Its primary objective is to
      determine whether &quot;highly sensitized&quot;, compared to &quot;weakly sensitized&quot; asthmatic subjects
      have more severe asthma, as defined by the levels at randomization to the completion of
      ICAC-01. To address the primary objective of ICAC-02, the study will include all the
      participants enrolled in ICAC-01 with dust mite-, cockroach- and/or alternaria-specific IgE
      levels within certain parameters.
