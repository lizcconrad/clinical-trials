      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Selenium may allow higher doses of irinotecan to be given. Giving irinotecan together with
      selenium may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of selenium when given
      together with irinotecan in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the optimal loading and maintenance doses of selenium necessary to achieve
           selenium concentrations exceeding 15 μM when administered with irinotecan in patients
           with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any observed tumor response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selenium.

      Patients receive a loading dose* of oral selenium twice daily on days -6 to 0. Patients then
      receive oral selenium once daily on days 1-42 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The loading dose is administered prior to course 1 only.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of selenium until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
