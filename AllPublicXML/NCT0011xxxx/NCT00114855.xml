  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine to what degree Hypocol® (Red Yeast Rice) may lower
      low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in a European population. The effect of Red Yeast
      Rice on fasting blood glucose and inflammatory markers will also be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical end-point trials have demonstrated that lowering cholesterol levels with statins
      reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. Subgroup analyses of the large
      clinical studies, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention (WOSCOP) and Cholesterol and
      Recurrent Events (CARE), have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins may extend to
      mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. A variety of mechanisms accounting for these effects
      have been suggested. Among these, the anti-inflammatory activity is particularly attractive
      because inflammation is considered an early step in the development of atherosclerosis. Thus,
      statin therapy has been shown to lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a plasma
      marker of inflammation, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Furthermore, statins may possess
      anti-inflammatory properties by their ability to reduce the number of inflammatory cells in
      atherosclerotic plaques. Red Yeast Rice contains Lovastatin and lowers LDL-cholesterol.
      However, it is not known to what degree Red Yeast Rice may lower LDL-cholesterol in a
      European population. Some reports have suggested an effect of Red Yeast Rice on fasting blood
      glucose by an unknown mechanism.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent prior to enrolment (any study-specific procedures or
             investigations).

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 75 years.

          -  Patients with mild Type IIa, Type IIb or IV hyperlipidaemia (LDL-cholesterol &gt;3.0
             mmol/L&lt; 6.0 mmol/L)

          -  Fasting serum TG level &lt; 4.5 mmol/L

          -  Mildly elevated blood glucose defined as at least one of three of the following
             criteria

               -  HbA1c% &gt;5.5% &lt; 7.5%;

               -  Fasting glucose &gt; 5.5 mmol/L;

               -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable oral antihyperglycemic treatment for more than
                  8 weeks and HbA1c% &lt; 7.5% at the time for inclusion.

          -  If female, be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., post-menopausal (defined as &gt;12
             months since last menstrual period) or surgically sterilised, or using adequate
             barrier contraception if of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking lipid-lowering medication and are not able to complete the 4-week
             wash-out prior to the start of the dietary run-in period.

          -  History of active malignant disease the last 5 years (excluding treated basal cell
             carcinoma).

          -  History of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg). Patients who are
             taking antihypertensive medication will not be excluded provided they are maintained
             at a stable dose for 3 months prior to screening and the stable dose is maintained
             throughout the study.

          -  Have uncontrolled thyroid disease (thyroid dysfunction controlled for at least 6
             months prior to screening is permitted).

          -  Known homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or known Type III
             hyperlipoproteinaemia (familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia).

          -  Patients with active liver disease or hepatic dysfunction as defined by elevations in
             liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma
             glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] or total bilirubin &gt;2 x the

             participation in the study.

          -  Patients who started hormone replacement therapy (HRT) less than 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Currently taking other investigational drugs or have taken part in a clinical trial
             within the previous 30 days prior to screening.

          -  These drugs should not be given during the patient's participation in the study, and

             medication, Cyclosporine A, medical treatment against obesity (i.e., Orlistat,
             Sibutramine), oral anticoagulants. Special attention will be paid to the medications
             that could interfere with the lipid profile (i.e. oral corticosteroids, retinoids,
             thyroid hormones, thiazide derivative, diuretics, beta-blockers, and hormone
             replacement therapies). It is recommended not to modify these medications within 6
             weeks prior to study start and during the course of the trial (unless this is
             medically required). All concomitant medications will be recorded.
