    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the time to hematopoietic response (hemoglobin
      correction to 12 g/dL or a greater than or equal to 2 g/dL increase from baseline) for
      subjects randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa with a front load dosing regimen to those
      receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with a weekly dose regimen during the
      12-week comparative treatment period.
