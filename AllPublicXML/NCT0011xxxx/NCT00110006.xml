      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using
      fludeoxyglucose F 18, may help in learning how well chemotherapy works to kill cancer cells
      and allow doctors to plan better treatment. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done
      before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to
      treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying positron emission tomography using fludeoxyglucose F
      18 to see how well it works in predicting response to treatment in patients who are receiving
      rituximab and combination chemotherapy for newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the positive and negative predictive values of early positron emission
           tomography (PET) scanning using fludeoxyglucose F 18 in terms of the probability of
           patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who
           achieve or do not achieve complete remission, after treatment with 1 course of rituximab
           and combination chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
           prednisone.

        -  Determine event free and overall survival of patients with an early positive and
           negative PET scan treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the predictive value of early PET scan response ratio as a continuous variable
           in terms of response to therapy (assessed at the end of therapy), disease-free survival,
           and overall survival, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate International Prognostic Index score at presentation with early PET scan
           results and overall outcome in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate the degree of neutropenia 7 to 10 days after the first course of treatment
           with rituximab and combination chemotherapy with PET scan response and pre-treatment
           blood CD34-positive cell concentration in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) IV. Beginning 1 hour later, patients undergo
      whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Patients also undergo conventional
      radiographic staging of their disease.

      Patients then receive standard R-CHOP (or an alternative regimen) comprising rituximab IV
      over 3-6 hours, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes, and
      vincristine IV over 5 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 14-21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo repeat ^18FDG-PET scanning between days 7-10 of course 1, between courses 3
      and 4, and then at the completion of R-CHOP. Patients also undergo radiographic restaging of
      their disease between courses 3 and 4 and at the completion of R-CHOP.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-4 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
