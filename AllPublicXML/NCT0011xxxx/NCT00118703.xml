      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of GW685698X 100mcg
      once daily (QD) aqueous nasal spray with vehicle placebo nasal spray in adult and adolescent
      subjects (12 years of age and older) with vasomotor rhinitis (VMR).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS was the sum of the individual symptom scores for rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and post-nasal drip which was scored on a scale of 0-3 (total score 0-9). The severity of symptoms was defined as 0: none-symptom was not present, 1: mild-sign/symptom was clearly present but minimal awareness; easily tolerated, 2: moderate-definite awareness of sign/symptom that was bothersome but tolerable, 3: severe (sign/symptom was hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping. The rTNSS was a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours and was performed in the morning (AM rTNSS) and evening (post meridian [PM] rTNSS). The daily rTNSS was the sum of two assessments. The Baseline daily rTNSS was defined as the average of the daily rTNSS over the 4 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to randomization, including the assessment on the morning of randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated as the on-treatment value minus the Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Morning (AM) Pre-dose Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Scores (iTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The morning pre-dose iTNSS was the sum of the individual symptom score for rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and postnasal drip performed immediately prior to taking the daily dose which were scored on a scale of 0-3 (total score 0-9). The severity of symptoms was defined as 0: none-symptom was not present, 1: mild-sign/symptom was clearly present but minimal awareness; easily tolerated, 2: moderate-definite awareness of sign/symptom that was bothersome but tolerable, 3: severe (sign/symptom was hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping. The Baseline daily iTNSS was defined as the average of the daily iTNSS over the 4 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to randomization, including the assessment on the morning of randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated as the on-treatment value minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Based on Overall Evaluation of Response to Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 (Day 29) or Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated effectiveness of study medication for relieving non-allergic rhinitis symptoms over the entire treatment period. The overall evaluation of response to therapy was based on a 7-point categorical scale (1-7) where the participants rate their perception of the change or lack of change in their VMR symptoms at the end of the study. The 7 categories were: 1: significantly improved, 2: moderately improved, 3: mildly improved, 4: no change, 5: mildly worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: significantly worse. Effectiveness of study medication for relieving VMR symptoms over the entire treatment period.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The actual dose delivered from the product was 27.5 micrograms (µg) /actuation, which is therefore proposed as the label claim rather than 25 µg/actuation. Based on this spray content assessment, the dose examined in this study was actually 110 µg rather than the 100 µg dose indicated in the protocol.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Males and females &gt;=12 years of age, diagnosed with vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) and meeting the symptom requirements entered a 7 to 14 days screening period. Following screening period, participants meeting specified symptom criteria received treatment of either fluticasone furoate or placebo in 1:1 ratio up to 4 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS)</title>
        <description>The TNSS was the sum of the individual symptom scores for rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and post-nasal drip which was scored on a scale of 0-3 (total score 0-9). The severity of symptoms was defined as 0: none-symptom was not present, 1: mild-sign/symptom was clearly present but minimal awareness; easily tolerated, 2: moderate-definite awareness of sign/symptom that was bothersome but tolerable, 3: severe (sign/symptom was hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping. The rTNSS was a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours and was performed in the morning (AM rTNSS) and evening (post meridian [PM] rTNSS). The daily rTNSS was the sum of two assessments. The Baseline daily rTNSS was defined as the average of the daily rTNSS over the 4 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to randomization, including the assessment on the morning of randomization. Change from Baseline was calculated as the on-treatment value minus the Baseline.</description>

        <description>Participants were evaluated effectiveness of study medication for relieving non-allergic rhinitis symptoms over the entire treatment period. The overall evaluation of response to therapy was based on a 7-point categorical scale (1-7) where the participants rate their perception of the change or lack of change in their VMR symptoms at the end of the study. The 7 categories were: 1: significantly improved, 2: moderately improved, 3: mildly improved, 4: no change, 5: mildly worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: significantly worse.
