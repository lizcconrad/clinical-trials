  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical performance in healthy citizens
      aged over 70 years. The main hypothesis was that 6 mg/kg caffeine would improve cycling
      endurance at 65% of expected maximal heart rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine ingestion increases the endurance of young people exercising at 60%-85% of their
      maximal oxygen uptake, and it also seems to improve endurance as measured by repeated
      sub-maximal isometric contraction and decreases the rate of perceived exertion during
      exercise. Although caffeine increases endurance in young people, an increase in endurance may
      be of greater interest in the elderly as the population of older adults with a physically
      active lifestyle is growing rapidly or for increasing endurance fitness through an exercise
      or rehabilitation program. Therefore the main hypothesis was that caffeine would improve
      cycling endurance at 65% of expected maximal heart rate, and the secondary hypotheses were
      that caffeine would improve postural stability, reaction and movement times, isometric arm
      flexion endurance, and walking speed, and would reduce the rate of perceived exertion after 5
      minutes of cycling in healthy elderly citizens.
