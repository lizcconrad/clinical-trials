  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the way by which estrogen improves the appearance
      of sun damaged human skin. Accumulating evidence suggests that estrogen, taken by post
      menopausal women, may cause skin to look younger as a consequence of reduced wrinkles.
      Collagen is the most abundant protein in human skin and gives skin its strength and shape.
      Recent data indicate that short-term topical estrogen (17-beta estradiol) treatment increases
      collagen production in sun damaged skin. This study will compare the molecular and
      microscopic effects from topical 17-beta estradiol (E2) when applied to the skin for a
      short-term duration. It is anticipated that the new knowledge from this study will enable
      development of new ways to improve the function of aged skin.

      The objectives of the study are to determine if topically-applied 17-beta estradiol (E2),
      alone or in combination with clobetasol, will produce histological and molecular effects
      distinguishable from vehicle in human skin. Specifically, the study will focus on regulation
      of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid production and degradation in human skin, by
      steroid hormone receptors that are activated by estrogen or clobetasol. The sites to be
      treated will be buttock, hip, forearm, or facial skin. Subjects will receive between one to
      twelve vehicle (matching solution without any active ingredients), estrogen, and/or
      clobetasol topical applications. Skin biopsies of treated areas will be obtained at baseline
      and at subsequent timepoints. The study will last up to two weeks. Endpoints will include
      protein and mRNA levels of collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, and other components of skin
      connective tissue. In addition, we will perform cDNA microanalysis to determine
      estrogen/clobetasol target genes in human skin. The results from our studies will provide new
      knowledge regarding the molecular basis of skin aging. This new knowledge will enable
      development of new ways to improve the function of aged skin.

          -  Subjects must be in generally good health.

          -  Subjects must be available for follow-up visits to comply with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Not on estrogen replacement therapy within the past 3 months.

          -  No nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs two weeks prior to study entry.
