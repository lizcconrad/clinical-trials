    <description>Cycle 1. Patients are randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either Nexavar (Sorafenib, BAY 43-906; this arm) or matching placebo (see below) for 14 days. Dose range will be depending on hematologic and other toxicity between 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) orally twice bid and 400 mg orally every 2 days. Cycle 2: patients who are eligible undergo nephrectomy. After the post-nephrectomy recovery period, all patients will receive 400 mg of BAY 43-906, twice daily (administered as two 200 mg tablets) in an open-label fashion.Cycle 3+: 400 mg of BAY 43-906, twice daily (administered as two 200 mg tablets) in an open-label fashion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Clinical, radiographic, or pathologic diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma
             (RCC). All renal cell histologies are allowed- Acceptable surgical risk in the
             judgment of the study investigator and consulting urological surgeon

          -  At least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion outside the planned nephrectomy
             specimen

          -  Patients who have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or unexpected surgical bleeding- Patients currently
             receiving treatment with or having a requirement for therapeutic anticoagulation

          -  Prior therapy for RCC. Palliative radiation therapy for painful or unstable bone
             metastases is permitted provided that there is measurable metastatic disease outside
             the radiation field

          -  Known history of HIV infection- Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors,
             unless the patient is &gt; 6 months from definitive therapy, has a CT or MRI scan within
             6 weeks of study entry negative for brain metastases and is clinically stable with
             respect to the tumor at the time of study entry
