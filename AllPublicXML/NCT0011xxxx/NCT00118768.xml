  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is being conducted in treatment-naive patients (no previous antiviral
      therapy for Hepatitis C infection) with genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of valopicitabine alone and together with Pegylated Interferon (a drug
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Hepatitis C infection).
