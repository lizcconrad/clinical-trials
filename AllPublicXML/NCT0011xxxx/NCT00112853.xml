  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib and etoposide in
      treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Tipifarnib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving tipifarnib together
      with etoposide may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of administering a fixed dose
      of R115777 in combination with escalating doses of VP-16 in elderly adults ( = 70 years) with
      newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of R115777 + VP-16 combination, including
      the duration of R115777 administration, for future Phase II trials.

      III. To obtain preliminary descriptive data regarding the effects of R115777 + VP-16 on cell
      cycle progression and apoptosis in AML marrow cells.

      IV. To study mechanisms of leukemia cell resistance to R115777 in combination with etoposide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14 OR 1-21 and oral etoposide once
      daily on days 1-3 and 8-10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) may
      receive up to 5 additional courses of therapy beyond documentation of CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib and etoposide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 14 additional
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
