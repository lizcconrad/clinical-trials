  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of these
      drugs, and whether they can be given safely together.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, there will be two arms (or groups). One arm will receive Velcade, thalidomide,
      and dexamethasone (VTD), and the other arm will receive VTD with Adriamycin.

      This study has the following specific goal:

      To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two treatments in multiple myeloma patients,
      relapsing after at least one course of high-dose treatment and an autologous stem cell
      transplant, or after at least two lines of conventional chemotherapy.

    <intervention_name>Velcade, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone</intervention_name>
    <description>Dosage and Administration Schedule Each cycle will consist of 3 weeks (21 days). AGENT DOSE ROUTE DAYS Velcade 1.0 mg/m2 IV 1, 4, 8, and 11 Thalidomide 100 mg PO Daily, hs Dexamethasone 20 mg PO Days 1, 2, 4,5, 8, 9, 11, 12 Lovenox 40 mg SQ Days 1-14
This 21-day period will be considered one treatment cycle; Cycle 2 would commence on Day 22 (Cycle 2, Day 1). The next cycle of treatment may be delayed up to day 29 due to non-toxicity reasons. Patients may continue to receive treatment every 21 days, provided there is no evidence of disease progression or no unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of eight cycles. At the discretion of the treating physician, patients may be eligible to receive treatment at their local physician after completion of the 1st cycle. These patients will need to return to MIRT prior to every cycle for cycles 2-4, cycles 6 and 8, and final visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsing multiple myeloma (MM)

          -  Patients must have adequate platelet count of &gt; 20,000 x 10^9/L, independent of
             transfusions, unless it is due to massive myeloma infiltration.

          -  Anticipated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Ejection fraction by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan
             performed within 60 days prior to registration; left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF) &gt; 40% by ECHO or MUGA.

          -  Female patients of child bearing age are required to have a negative pregnancy test as
             indicated in thalidomide safety guidelines

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 based on Southwest Oncology Group
             (SWOG) criteria. Patients with a poor performance status (3-4), based solely on bone
             pain, will be eligible.

             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease free for at least three years.

          -  Patients must not have significant co-morbid medical conditions or uncontrolled life
             threatening infection.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test documented within one week of registration. Women and men of
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective
             contraceptive method for the duration of the study treatment.
