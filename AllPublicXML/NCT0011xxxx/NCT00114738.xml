  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of EPOCH-R chemotherapy plus bortezomib for
      treating mantle cell lymphoma, a cancer of white blood cells called lymphocytes. EPOCH-R
      consists of the drugs prednisone, etoposide, doxorubicin and vincristine, with the addition
      of a new drug called rituximab. In a recent study of patients with newly diagnosed mantle
      cell lymphoma, 92 percent had a complete remission of their disease after treatment with
      EPOCH-R. This study will test whether adding bortezomib as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; once
      chemotherapy is finished will lengthen the time before the disease relapses and improve the
      overall cure rate.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with mantle cell lymphoma may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine
      tests, electrocardiogram, MUGA or echocardiogram, imaging studies and biopsy to determine the
      extent of disease, and possible colonoscopy.

      Participants undergo treatment in three parts, as follows:

        -  Part 1: Bortezomib alone: Patients receive 4 doses of bortezomib over 3 weeks. The drug
           is injected into a vein over about 30 seconds.

        -  Part 2: EPOCH-R chemotherapy plus bortezomib: This phase of treatment begins 3 to 4
           weeks after completing Part 1. Treatment is given on an outpatient basis in six 3-week
           cycles, with all drugs administered over the first 5 days of each cycle. Patients take
           prednisone by mouth on days 1 to 5 and etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine as a
           96-hour infusion through a vein over days 1 to 5. The infused drugs are delivered
           through a lightweight, portable infusion pump. Rituximab is given by vein over several
           hours on day 1 immediately before the chemotherapy infusion begins. Bortezomib is given
           by vein over 30 seconds on day 1 before the rituximab and again on day 4.
           Cyclophosphamide is given by vein over about 15 minutes on day 5 immediately after the
           chemotherapy infusion is completed. Patients are taught how to self inject G-CSF, a drug
           that helps boost white cell counts after chemotherapy. They inject the drug under the
           skin (like an insulin shot) for 10 days of each cycle beginning day 6. Patients also
           take an antibiotic to help prevent infection during chemotherapy.

        -  Part 3: Bortezomib alone: After completing EPOCH-R-B therapy, patients are randomly
           assigned to receive or not to receive bortezomib alone. The drug is given in 2 doses
           over 5 days, with a break of 16 days before the next dose. These 3-week cycles continue
           for up to 18 months or until the disease comes back or worsens. Patients who are
           assigned to the group that does not receive bortezomib will be offered the drug if their
           disease relapses.

      During therapy, patients have tests performed on their bone marrow, tumor tissue, blood or
      other fluids to look at different genes and proteins that may be involved in the development
      of their lymphoma or the reaction of the immune system. A tissue biopsy is done before
      treatment begins and a day after treatment starts. Disease progress is followed with CT scans
      and blood tests. When treatment is completed, patients whose cancer has disappeared are
      scheduled for periodic follow-up examinations and tests. Those whose disease remains or
      recurs may be offered participation in another protocol if an appropriate one is available or
      are returned to the care of their local physician.

      Background:

      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) presents a clinical challenge because it is aggressive and
      incurable with chemotherapy. Therefore novel treatment approaches are needed.

      MCL has overexpression of NF-kappa B (NF-kappa B), a transcription factor that affects cell
      growth and survival, and cyclin D1 that affects cell cycle and growth. These proteins appear
      to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCL.

      Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that inhibits NF-kappa B and cyclin D1, has demonstrated
      activity in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.

      Dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R has excellent activity in MCL, with a complete response (CR) rate of
      92%, but patients eventually relapse.

      Objective:

      Determine the PFS and OS of DA-EPOCH-RB followed by bortezomib maintenance versus
      observation.

      Eligibility:

      Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.

      No prior treatment except for local radiation or a short course of steroids for control of
      symptoms,

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years old.

      Adequate major organ function unless impairment is due to lymphoma.

      Study Design:

      To assess the clinical activity and biological effects of bortezomib, patients will initially
      receive one cycle of bortezomib alone with sequential tumor biopsies for microarray analysis.

      All patients will then receive Dose-adjusted (DA)-EPOCH-RB for 6 cycles, and if they have at
      least a PR, this will be followed by randomization to either immediate bortezomib maintenance
      x 18 months, or to observation, followed by bortezomib if progression occurs. This study has
      as a primary goal, to describe progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival of early
      bortezomib maintenance versus observation following induction with bortezomib followed by
      DA-EPOCH-RB. Important secondary goals are to assess response and toxicity to bortezomib
      alone or DA-EPOCH-RB, to evaluate time to progression after receiving bortezomib following
      progression on an observation arm, and to assess the biological effects of bortezomib on
      untreated MCL.
