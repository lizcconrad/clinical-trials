      The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess the anti-cancer activity of weekly
      ridaforolimus administration in participants with taxane-resistant AIPC. Other objectives
      include evaluating experimental parameters that may predict or indicate response to mTOR
      inhibition, such as effects on plasma VEGF, markers of tumoral PI3K/mTOR-pathway activity,
      and proteomic analysis. The inclusion of these evaluations in this trial may provide insight
      into the identification of markers that may be helpful in optimizing ridaforolimus treatment
      and in identifying patients with ridaforolimus-sensitive tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients aged ≥ 18 years with histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          -  Clinically refractory to hormone therapy (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing
             hormone agonist/antagonist).

          -  Presence of metastatic prostate cancer that fulfills at least one evaluation category
             as listed: * Measurable Disease: Lesion(s) that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension with the longest diameter ≥ 20 mm using conventional techniques or ≥ 10
             mm with spiral CT scan (or otherwise at least twice the reconstruction interval for CT
             or MRI scans). *Non-measurable disease: Lesions noted on imaging studies (including
             metastatic bone lesions on bone scan) or other non-measurable lesions as defined by
             the modified RECIST criteria. *Progressive disease following a cytotoxic chemotherapy
             regimen for prostate cancer.

          -  Previous treatment with at least one taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen. Patients
             may have received treatment with not more than 3 additional regimens of cytotoxic
             chemotherapy prior to study entry.

          -  Orchiectomy, or castrate levels of testosterone maintained by LHRH agonist/antagonist
