    <textblock>
      To assess the maximum tolerated dose and overall safety and tolerability of sunitinib
      [SU011248] administered in combination with gefitinib (Iressa) for the treatment of patients
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Phase 1). To assess antitumor activity of the

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Overall Confirmed Objective Disease Response According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter</time_frame>
    <description>Objective disease response = subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A PR was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter</time_frame>
    <description>TTR was defined as the time from date of the first dose of study medication to first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR). For subjects proceeding from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. If lesion assessment data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. TTR was calculated as (first event date minus first dose date +1)/7. TTR was calculated based on the subgroup of subjects with a baseline disease assessment, who had the correct histological cancer type, and had a confirmed objective tumor response. Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter or death due to cancer</time_frame>
    <description>DR was defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. DR was calculated as (the end date for DR minus first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed +1)/7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of subjects with an objective tumor response (CR or PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter</time_frame>
    <description>TTP was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to first documentation of objective tumor progression. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. TTP (in weeks) was calculated as (first event date minus first dose date +1)/7. Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment until death</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from date of the first dose of study medication to date of death due to any cause. OS (in weeks) is calculated as (date of death minus first dose date +1)/7. For subjects not expiring, their survival times were censored at the last date of known contact they were known to be alive. Subjects lacking data beyond the day of first dose had their survival times censored at 1 day. Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter or death</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in weeks) was calculated as (first event date minus first dose date +1)/7. Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>

    <measure>Probability of Survival at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycles 1 to 4, Day 28 of even cycles thereafter up until 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Survival rate was defined as the percentage of subjects alive at 1 year after the date of first administration of study medication. Survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

          <description>OS was defined as the time from date of the first dose of study medication to date of death due to any cause. OS (in weeks) is calculated as (date of death minus first dose date +1)/7. For subjects not expiring, their survival times were censored at the last date of known contact they were known to be alive. Subjects lacking data beyond the day of first dose had their survival times censored at 1 day. Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>

          <description>Change = median VEGFR3 level at each specified time point for subjects with tumor response TTP &gt;= Median and TTP &lt; Median minus median VEGFR3 level at Baseline. A measure of dispersion is not included because the Wilcoxon rank sum test is a non-parametric test that makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data (eg, normality).</description>
          <population>ITT. Number of participants analyzed = number of subjects evaluable for TTP (ie, those who died or had tumor progression) with baseline biomarker values. n=number of subjects with soluble protein biomarkers at baseline and at the specified time point.</population>
