  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Home-based AIDS care program pilot project delivers and monitors antiretroviral (ARV) and
      tuberculosis (TB) medications at the homes of 1,000 people with HIV living in a rural area of
      Uganda. This study is evaluating how well this program reduces illness and prolongs the life
      of participants, changes sexual behavior, influences levels of adherence to medication,
      affects aspects of perceived stigma by participants and their communities, and other
      operational components of the program including cost-effectiveness. This study is evaluating
      the hypothesis that frequent home visits by a trained lay person with a standard
      questionnaire is equivalent in terms of health outcomes to frequent viral load and CD4 cell
      count measurements.

      In Uganda, the high cost and complexity of administering antiretroviral therapy is an
      obstacle to full implementation country-wide. The Home-based AIDS care program (HBAC) pilot
      project was designed to deliver and monitor ARV and tuberculosis (TB) medications at the
      homes of 1,000 people with HIV living in a rural area of Uganda. In addition, the cost and
      complexity of frequent laboratory monitoring of viral load and CD4 cell counts is a major
      impediment to widespread use of ARV therapies in Uganda and other resource-limited settings.
      Nested within the Home-Based AIDS Care (HBAC) project, is a randomized study of strategies
      for monitoring ARV therapy that involves 3 arms: 1) Quarterly CD4 cell counts, viral loads
      and home visits by trained lay persons; 2) Quarterly CD4 cell counts and home visits; and 3)
      Home visits alone.
