    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis
      treated with standard racemic epinephrine therapy via 70:30 helium-oxygen (heliox) driven
      nebulization will have improvements in measurements of airway more rapidly than those treated
      with conventional air-oxygen driven nebulization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any child 2-12 months old seen in the emergency department.

          -  A clinical bronchiolitis score &gt; 3 by modified Wood's Clinical Bronchiolitis Score
             (M-WCBS).

          -  Diagnostic criteria of bronchiolitis includes tachypnea, cough, prolonged expiratory
             phase, wheezing, rales, chest retractions, and hyperinflation of lungs on chest
             radiograph. After consenting a patient to the study, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
             infection will be tested by rapid enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay of nasal
             secretions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No child will be excluded based on race or gender

          -  Patients under the age of 2 months or greater than 12 months

          -  Patients with cyanotic heart disease

          -  Patients with lobar pneumonia, defined by results of chest radiographs.

          -  The presence of interstitial disease or diffuse patchy marking consistent with
             atelectasis on chest radiographs will not exclude patients.

          -  Patients with croup.

          -  Patients with foreign body aspiration.

          -  Patients with history of cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or other chronic
             lung disease.

          -  Patients with liver or renal disease.

          -  Patients with sickle cell anemia.

          -  Patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

          -  Patients who develop supraventricular tachycardia secondary to racemic epinephrine
             administration.

          -  Patients with tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia.

          -  Patients who had received bronchodilators within 2 hours of initiation of the study.

          -  Patients who had received systemic corticosteroids within 72 hours of enrollment

          -  Patients who suffered from persistent airway hyperreactivity in the 3 months before
             the study.

          -  Patients who do not tolerate the nasal cannulae for 45 out of 60 minutes.
