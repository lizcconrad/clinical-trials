    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if human immunoglobulin given by mouth twice a day
      is effective in treating the persistent gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as diarrhea,
      constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating, in children with autism.

      Autistic GI Dysfunction (AGID) is a term that describes a constellation of GI signs and
      symptoms often found in children with autistic disorder, including abdominal pain,
      constipation, chronic diarrhea, alternating constipation and diarrhea, gaseousness, bloating,
      and reflux.

      The objective of this study is to assess the potential efficacy of oral immunoglobulin in
      reducing a wide range of GI symptoms in children and adolescents diagnosed with autistic
      disorder.
