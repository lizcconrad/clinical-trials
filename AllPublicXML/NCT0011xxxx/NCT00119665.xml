    <textblock>
      The researchers propose a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 180
      healthy postmenopausal women experiencing at least 5 hot flashes per day or 35 hot flashes
      per week. Women will be randomized to one of three arms: 4.5 grams/day (dry weight of
      extract) of MF101, 9.0 grams/day (dry weight of extract) of MF101 or placebo for 12 weeks.
