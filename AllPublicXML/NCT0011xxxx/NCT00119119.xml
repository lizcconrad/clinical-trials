  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fibrosis of liver is a complication of chronic hepatitis C. There is actually no
      established treatment for fibrosis of the liver. Pentoxyphilline and tocopherol may have an
      activity on fibrosis. The aim of the study is to analyse the efficacy and the safety of the
      combination with pentoxyphilline and tocopherol (12 months) on liver fibrosis, in patients
      with chronic hepatitis C, who are non-long-term responders, or with intolerance or
      contra-indication to interferon-alfa and ribavirin.

      The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy and the safety of the combination of
      pentoxyphilline (400 mg, twice a day) and tocopherol (500 mg, twice a day), given during 12
      months on the fibrosis related to HCV chronic hepatitis in 100 patients who are non-long-term
      responders, or with contra-indication or intolerance to the current treatment of reference
      (combination with interferon-alfa and ribavirin). It is a therapeutic, national,
      multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. The patients included had
      histological liver injuries with a Metavir score of A 0 to 2, F 2 or 3 and no other etiology
      of liver disease. The primary objective is to analyse the variation of the liver fibrosis
      evaluated by morphometric analysis between the 2 liver biopsies performed at the end of the
      trial and within 3 years before the treatment. The secondary objectives are the variation of
      the Metavir fibrosis and activity scores, of serum markers of fibrosis (hyaluronate, PIIIP,
      TNF-alfa, fibrotest) and ALT between the end and the beginning of the treatment.
