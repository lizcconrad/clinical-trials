  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this line of research are to develop and evaluate innovative treatments
      for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) cigarette smokers and to understand the
      processes related to smoking and relapse in this previously unstudied population of smokers.
      In this study, participants are randomly assigned to one of two Internet-based smoking
      cessation treatments: 1) a self-help intervention tailored LGBT smokers plus social support
      plus email-based counseling, or 2) a standard self-help condition alone, similar to other
      general smoking cessation treatments. Before starting the program, participants will complete
      measures of smoking, nicotine dependence, depression diagnosis, demographics, mood,
      motivation to change, and alcohol use. Smoking status will be determined at 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months following the start of treatment. Data will be analyzed to compare the quit rates of
      the two Internet-based treatment groups. Also, we will complete exploratory analyses to
      determine those variables that best predict quitting for LGBT smokers.
