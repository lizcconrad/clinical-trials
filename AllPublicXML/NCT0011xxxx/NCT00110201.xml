  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the use of nesiritide in thoracic aneurysm repair to
      prevent acute renal failure.

      The study hypothesis: Nesiritide, given prophylactically prior to surgery may prevent acute
      renal failure requiring dialysis and/or decrease mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure is a major and serious complication of more than 200,000 cardiovascular
      surgeries performed on adult Americans annually (www.sts.org). The incidence of acute renal
      failure (ARF) after cardiac surgery (depending on criteria used to define ARF) is 1-5%, in
      the absence of preexisting renal dysfunction. The subset of patients with thoracic aortic
      aneurysm surgery have a higher risk for the development of postoperative ARF (25-40% - ARF
      defined as doubling of serum creatinine; 13% - ARF defined as requirement for dialysis). This
      risk is further increased by various peri-operative factors, especially cardiopulmonary
      bypass time.

      The overall postoperative mortality rate for cardiovascular surgery is 2.2%, but is much
      higher for thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery (8-10% for elective repair, 25-50% for ruptured
      thoracic aorta aneurysm repair). The major risk factor for thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery
      related mortality is post-operative ARF requiring dialysis. When thoracic aortic aneurysm
      surgery is complicated by acute renal failure, the mortality rate worsens to 50%. Thus,
      identifying ways to prevent acute renal failure may have a major impact on the outcome of
      cardiovascular surgery. A retrospective study of the use of nesiritide in cardiovascular
      surgery patients by our group has demonstrated a tendency towards a decreased incidence of
      renal failure and mortality, when the medication is used prophylactically.
