    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the Celacade™ system in
      reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with chronic
      systolic heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence continues to accumulate on the importance of inflammation in the development and
      progression of heart failure (HF). The Celacade™ system may reduce chronic inflammation by
      stimulating the immune system’s physiological anti-inflammatory response. The ACCLAIM study
      is an international, approximately 2,000-patient, Phase III clinical research study designed
      to test the safety and efficacy of the Celacade™ system in reducing the risk of mortality and
      cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with chronic systolic HF.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18 or older.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≦ 30%, measured within the past six months
             (by any technique), unless there was a cardiovascular event that could have modified
             the LVEF during that period (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], myocardial
             infarction [MI]). If the patient was started on a beta-blocker or biventricular pacing
             (cardiac resynchronization therapy, or CRT), the LVEF measurement must have been at
             least three months after starting the therapy.

          -  Hospitalized for heart failure; OR, received intravenous (IV) administration of an
             inotropic agent (therapeutic dose for HF), human B-natriuretic peptide, or IV diuretic
             (minimum 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent) in a clinic, outpatient or emergency
             department within the past 12 months (stable for at least 2 weeks). Exceptions:
             patients in NYHA Class III or IV who have a LVEF of &lt; 25%.

          -  On standard therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF), which must include angiotensin
             converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (unless
             contraindicated or patient is intolerant), with or without other appropriate agents.
             If on a beta-blocker, patient must have been on a beta-blocker for at least three
             months.

          -  No changes in active cardiac medications for heart failure during the two weeks prior
             to randomization.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to comply with the conditions of the protocol.

          -  Presence of a transplanted tissue or organ or left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
             (or the expectation of the same within the next 12 months).

          -  Planned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (AICD) or CRT within the next 12
             months.

          -  Acute MI, or CABG, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AICD, or CRT within the
             past three months.

          -  Need for chronic intermittent inotropic therapy.

          -  Malignancy: evidence of disease within the previous five years. Exceptions: basal cell
             carcinoma, provided that it is neither infiltrating nor sclerosing, and carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix.

          -  Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within the first six months of
             delivery).

          -  Systemic corticosteroids, cytostatics, immunosuppressive drug therapy
             (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), and DNA depleting
             or cytotoxic drugs taken within four weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Pregnancy, or patients of childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive
             methods.

          -  Porphyria.

          -  Allergy to sodium citrate or any “caine” type of local anesthetic.

          -  Previous Celacade™ treatment.

          -  Patient scheduled for hospice care.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would
             interfere with the objectives of the study or that would, in the investigator’s
             opinion, preclude safe completion of the study. Abnormal findings could include: known
             HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic active viral infection (such as
             hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined as patients undergoing treatment
             with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or any severe or acute concomitant
             illness or injury.

          -  Any other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the
             patient could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent
             residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, or a history of
             noncompliance).
