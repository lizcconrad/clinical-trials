  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to look at the ways in which a treatment called INGN241 can kill
      melanoma cells or help the patient's immune system kill melanoma cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INGN 241 is an adenoviral vector carrying the MDA-7 cDNA. MDA-7 is a novel tumor suppressor
      molecule with cytokine properties, recently designated as IL-24. Over expression of MDA-7 in
      melanoma cells in vitro has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce
      apoptosis. Loss of MDA-7 expression in human melanomas has been shown to correlate with
      invasion and metastasis. The INGN 241 gene transfer construct has been previously used in
      human subjects in an ongoing open label Phase I study using intratumoral administration, and
      has been well tolerated to date. The primary objectives of the present study are to determine
      if INGN 241, injected into a melanoma in transit lesion, can induce apoptosis in regional
      uninjected lesions and initiate systemic immune activation. Secondary objectives include
      examination of specific immunity and of clinical response and toxicity.
