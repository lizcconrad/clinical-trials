  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Itopride is a new compound that is already marketed in Japan and in some countries of Eastern
      Europe under the name of Ganaton. It is used to treat symptoms of functional dyspepsia.
      Patients suffering from this condition have difficulties digesting food. They feel full after
      eating a few bites; they feel bloated and their stomachs hurt. The goal of this study is to
      see if itopride helps to relieve the symptoms of functional dyspepsia.

      The study lasts approximately 10 weeks. Patients may either receive the real itopride, or a
      sugar pill called placebo. They have equal chances of receiving either treatment. After
      having completed this study, patients may be eligible to continue treatment for a longer
      period. At that point, all patients receive itopride.

      Patients need to come to the clinic for evaluations 4 times during the trial. Various
      evaluations are done at these visits, such as a physical exam, lab tests, evaluation of the
      heart condition, and questionnaires need to be completed by the patient to see if the drug
      helps them in relieving their symptoms.
