  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if patients treated with the
      combination of Taxane/Carboplatin plus Cetuximab (C/T/C) have a longer progression-free
      survival than patients treated with Taxane/Carboplatin (T/C) alone. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.

    <description>The median number of months to response was calculated for participants whose best response was CR or PR. It was defined as the time from the first dose of study therapy to the first date that criteria for PR or CR (whichever occurred first)were met. Response was assessed by the IRRC, using the modified WHO criteria: CR: disappearance of all index/non-index lesions; PR: &gt;= 50% reduction in the SOPD of index lesions compared with the baseline SOPD, with no evidence of progression.

    <measure>Median Number of Months of Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to death or date of last contact (up to 41 months).</time_frame>

    <description>Symptoms were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire. This 7-item scale has scores ranging from 0 (severely symptomatic in all symptoms assessed) to 28 (symptom-free on all symptoms assessed). Symptom response (improvement) was defined as &gt;= 2-point increase from baseline in score (maintained for 2 consecutive assessments, at least 3 weeks apart). Participants with a baseline score of &gt;= 27 were not evaluable, as it would not have been possible to show an improvement. Participants with no baseline data were also not evaluable.</description>

    <description>Symptoms were assessed using the FACT-LCS questionnaire. This 7-item scale has scores ranging from 0 (severely symptomatic) to 28 (symptom-free). Symptomatic progression was defined as &gt;= 2-point decrease from baseline in score (maintained for 2 consecutive assessments at least 3 weeks apart). Time to symptomatic progression was defined as the time from randomization to date of symptoms worsening. For participants with no symptom progression, the date of the last symptom assessment was used. See also Outcome Measure 15.</description>

    <description>AE=any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of pre-existing medical condition (even if not caused by the study drug). For this study, it was decided that AEs that were categorized under the composite term &quot;infusion reaction&quot; were of particular importance. These AEs were: infusion-related reaction, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, and anaphylactoid reaction regardless of when they occurred. The terms dyspnea, pyrexia and chills were also grouped under infusion reaction, provided the onset date of these toxicities occurred on the first day of study treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had Unscheduled Visits to Physicians, Clinics, Hospitals and Other Unscheduled Major Medicinal Procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each cycle of treatment, at the end of study therapy evaluation and at the first follow-up visit (6 weeks after the end of study therapy evaluation).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to complete log to collect information on unscheduled visits to physicians,clinics,hospitals &amp; other unscheduled major procedures.If asked, participants were to complete and return log to site upon routinely scheduled visits.The purpose of this exploratory analysis was to understand the economical implications as a secondary objective.This was not a pivotal study &amp; therefore not needed to support any arguments with regulatory authorities concerning cost-benefit,hence,it was not necessary to conduct this analysis. There is no intent on conducting this analysis in the future.</description>

            <groups_desc>Confidence intervals were calculated using Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Analysis was a comparison of survival between groups by means of a 2-sided, alpha=0.05 level, log-rank test, stratified by ECOG PS (0/1) and intended on-study taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel). Null hypothesis was that survival was equal in both treatment arms. Power calculations indicated that &gt;= 558 events would lead to at &gt;=75% power at the 5% level for rejecting the null hypothesis, given a true hazard ratio of 0.8.</groups_desc>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement of Symptoms</title>
        <description>Symptoms were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire. This 7-item scale has scores ranging from 0 (severely symptomatic in all symptoms assessed) to 28 (symptom-free on all symptoms assessed). Symptom response (improvement) was defined as &gt;= 2-point increase from baseline in score (maintained for 2 consecutive assessments, at least 3 weeks apart). Participants with a baseline score of &gt;= 27 were not evaluable, as it would not have been possible to show an improvement. Participants with no baseline data were also not evaluable.</description>
