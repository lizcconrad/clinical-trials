    <textblock>
      Specific Aims:

        -  To determine if curcuminoids modulate cellular proliferation as measured by
           proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the colorectal mucosa of subjects with
           previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps.

      Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease cellular proliferation in the colorectal mucosa of subjects
      with previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

        -  To determine if curcuminoids modulate apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL assay, in the
           colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic polyps.

      Hypothesis: Curcuminoids increase apoptosis in colorectal mucosa of subjects with previously
      resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

        -  To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 expression as measured by
           immunohistochemical assays in subjects with previously resected adenomatous colonic
           polyps

      Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease colorectal mucosa COX-2 expression in subjects with
      previously resected sporadic adenomatous colonic polyps.

        -  To determine if curcuminoids modulate COX-2 activity as measured by urinary eicosanoids

      Hypothesis: Curcuminoids decrease concentrations of urinary eicosanoids.
