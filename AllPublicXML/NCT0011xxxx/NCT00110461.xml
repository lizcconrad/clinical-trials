          <description>The CDRS-R is used to diagnose depression and monitor treatment response. The interviewer rates 17 symptom areas (including those that sever as DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of depression), among them suicidal ideation. Most of the 17 symptom areas are rated on a 7-point scale. The Suicide Ideation Score is rated on a 7-point scale, where the minimum score on the scale is 1 (better outcome) and the maximum score is 7 (worse outcome).</description>

          <title>Change in Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) Total Score at Week 4</title>
          <description>Change from baseline to Week 4 in CGAS total score, using the last observation carried forward. Assessments performed at baseline and weekly through the acute phase (Week 4). (Also performed at Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase.)
The CGAS is a 100-point scale measuring psychological, social, and school functioning for children aged 6 to 17 years. Minimum scores ranged from 1-10, representing the need for constant supervision (worse outcome) to maximum scores of 91-100, representing superior functioning (better outcome).</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from baseline, only randomized subjects who had both baseline and at least one post-baseline were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

          <title>Change in General Behavior Inventory Scale (GBI) Total Parent/Guardian Version Mania Score at Week 4</title>
          <description>Change from baseline to Week 4 in GBI Total Parent/Guardian Version Mania score, using LOCF. Assessments performed baseline and weekly through acute phase (Week 4). (Also at Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase.) GBI is self-report inventory with 73 items focused on mood-related behaviors including depressive, hypomanic, and biphasic symptoms. One 20-item subscale was completed by parent/guardian. Symptoms rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never or hardly ever) to 3 (often or almost constantly). Minimum score 0=better outcome, maximum score 60=worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from baseline, only randomized subjects who had both baseline and at least one post-baseline were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

          <description>Change from baseline to Week 4 in CGI-BP severity overall illness score, using the last observation carried forward.
Assessments performed at baseline and weekly through the acute phase (Week 4). (Also performed and at Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase.)
The CGI-BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bipolar disorder. The scale rates the subject’s severity of illness for mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness from 1 (least severe) to 7 (most severe).</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from baseline, only randomized subjects who had both baseline and at least one post-baseline were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

          <description>Change from baseline to Week 30 in GBI Total Parent/Guardian Version Mania score, using LOCF. Assessments performed at baseline and weekly through acute phase(Week 4) and Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase. GBI is a self-report inventory with 73 items focused on mood-related behaviors including depressive, hypomanic, and biphasic symptoms. One 20-item subscale was completed by parent/guardian. Symptoms rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never or hardly ever) to 3 (often or almost constantly). Minimum score 0=better outcome, maximum score 60=worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from baseline, only randomized subjects who had both baseline and at least one post-baseline were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

          <description>Change from baseline to Week 4 in GBI Total Parent/Guardian Version Depression score, using LOCF. Assessments performed at baseline and weekly through the acute phase (Week 4); also Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase. GBI is a self-report inventory with 73 items focused on mood-related behaviors including depressive, hypomanic, and biphasic symptoms. One 20-item subscale was completed by parent/guardian. Symptoms rated on 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never/hardly ever) to 3 (often/almost constantly). Minimum score 0=better outcome, maximum score 60=worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from baseline, only randomized subjects who had both baseline and at least one post-baseline were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

          <description>Change from previous phase to Week 30 in CGI-BP severity overall illness score, using the last observation carried forward.
Assessments performed at baseline and weekly through the acute phase (Week 4) and at Weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 30 through continuation phase.
The CGI-BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bipolar disorder. The scale rates the change from the preceding phase score for mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
          <population>Since the endpoint is change from previous phase, only randomized subjects who had both previous phase and at least one next phase were included in the efficacy analysis. Therefore, number of randomized subjects could be a different number subjects included in the efficacy analysis.</population>
