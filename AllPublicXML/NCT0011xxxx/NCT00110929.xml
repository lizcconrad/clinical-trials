      The purpose of this research is to study the efficacy and safety of AMG 073 in patients with
      kidney failure who are being treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and who also
      have secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT).

        Inclusion Criteria: - Completed one of the qualifying studies (i.e., patient previously
        took part in an Amgen study investigating the drug AMG 073 and its effects on secondary
        hyperparathyroidism [HPT]; in particular parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and phosphorus
        levels in blood associated with kidney failure) - Must agree to use, in the opinion of the
        principal investigator, highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the study
        Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnant or nursing females - Experienced a myocardial infarction
        within 3 months before day 1 - Have an unstable medical condition, defined as having been
        hospitalized, other than for dialysis vascular access revision, within 30 days before day
        1, or otherwise unstable in the judgment of the investigator
