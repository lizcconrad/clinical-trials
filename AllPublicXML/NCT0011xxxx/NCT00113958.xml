    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of a treatment strategy that incorporates
      cinacalcet HCl into the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) to K/DOQI
      recommended targets in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis,
      on bio-intact parathyroid hormone, corrected serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and calcium
      phosphorus product.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Men and women must agree to use highly effective contraceptive
        measures throughout the study - Prescribed hemodialysis for at least 3 months before study
        day 1 - Must be receiving IV vitamin D sterols during the 30 days before day

        1 (greater than 2 µg of paricalcitol, greater than 1 µg of doxercalciferol, or greater than
        0.5 µg of calcitriol per dialysis treatment) - The mean of 2 biPTH determinations obtained
        from the central laboratory must be greater than or equal to 80 pg/mL and less than or
        equal to 160 pg/mL - The mean 2 albumin corrected serum calcium determinations obtained
        from the central laboratory must be greater than or equal to 8.4 mg/dL - The mean of two Ca
        x P calculations, based on corrected serum calcium and serum phosphorus determinations
        obtained from the central laboratory must be greater than 55 mg²/dL Exclusion Criteria: -
        Have an unstable medical condition, defined as having been hospitalized, other than for
        dialysis vascular access revision, within 30 days before day 1, or otherwise unstable in
        the judgment of the investigator - Pregnant or nursing females - Parathyroidectomy in the
        12 weeks before day 1 - Received, within 21 days before day 1 of the dose titration phase,
        therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the enzyme CYP2D6 and have a
        narrow therapeutic index (e.g., flecainide, vinblastine, thioridazine and most tricyclic
        antidepressants). The antidepressant amitriptyline is permitted - Received, within 21 days
        before day 1, therapy with medications that are potent inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole,
        itraconazole and erythromycin) or inducers (e.g., rifampin and St. John's Wort) of the
        enzyme CYP3A4. Phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also potent inducers of this
        enzyme. However, subjects on a stable dose of any of these anti-convulsants at baseline,
        with no evidence of seizure activity in the past 2 months may be eligible for the study -
        Experienced a myocardial infarction within 12 weeks prior to day 1 - Currently enrolled in,
        or have not yet completed at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or
        drug trials, or are receiving other investigational agents (experimental dialysis machines
        are acceptable) - Current gastrointestinal disorder that may be associated with impaired
        absorption of orally administered medications or an inability to swallow tablets -
        Participated in other studies with cinacalcet HCl - Disorder that would interfere with the
        understanding and giving of informed consent or compliance with protocol requirements
