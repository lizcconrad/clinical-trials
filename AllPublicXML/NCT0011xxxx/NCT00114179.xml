      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and gemcitabine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may make tumor cells more sensitive to
      radiation therapy. Bevacizumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to both chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before and after radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and
      bevacizumab together with radiation therapy followed by gemcitabine and bevacizumab works in
      treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare 1-year overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic
      cancer treated with capecitabine, bevacizumab, and radiotherapy followed by maintenance
      therapy comprising gemcitabine and bevacizumab to a historical control.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the frequency of serious unacceptable adverse events in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also
      receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients undergo
      reevaluation 3-4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab.

      Patients with no evidence of disease progression proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients
      with a marked response may undergo surgery at the discretion of the attending surgeon and
      then proceed to maintenance therapy approximately 4-8 weeks later.

      Maintenance therapy: Beginning within 4-7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and
      bevacizumab, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 provided that blood counts have returned to
      normal. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 82 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.
