  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cilengitide may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Giving cilengitide before and after surgery may be an effective treatment for
      glioblastoma multiforme. This phase II trial is studying how well cilengitide works in
      treating patients who are undergoing surgery for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in operative patients with recurrent
      or progressive glioblastoma multiforme treated with cilengitide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups for
      the preoperative treatment component.

      Preoperative Treatment Group I: Patients receive high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days
      -8, -4, and -1.

      Preoperative Treatment Group II: Patients receive low-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days
      -8, -4, and -1.

      Resection: All patients undergo tumor resection on day 0.

      Postoperative Treatment: Beginning within 2 weeks after surgery, all patients receive
      high-dose cilengitide IV over 1 hour twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per preoperative treatment group) will be
      accrued for this study.

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Study closed early due to slow accrual. Molecular analyses evaluating alterations were planned for the study, unfortunately, majority of tumor samples were too small to do analysis and also there were unforeseen freezer issues.</limitations_and_caveats>
