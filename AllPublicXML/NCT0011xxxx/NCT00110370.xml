  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Lispro Mixture Therapy (insulin lispro 50/50 given
      three times daily with meals) to Glargine Basal-Bolus Therapy (insulin glargine daily with
      the addition of insulin lispro given three times daily with meals). The study is also
      comparing two different methods for adjusting the dose of insulin.
