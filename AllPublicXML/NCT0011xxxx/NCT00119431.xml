      A multicentre study to investigate pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of
      nanofiltered Cetor® (called C1-esteraseremmer-N during the development phase) for the
      treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) will be performed. This study KB2003.01 consists of
      three parts, part A pharmacokinetics (phase II), part B treatment of attacks of angioedema
      (phase III) and part C prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor (phase III). Part B + C will provide
      data on the efficacy of C1-esteraseremmer-N.

      The changes in the manufacturing process of C1-esteraseremmer-N, compared to Cetor® (the
      currently marketed C1-inhibitor product), nanofiltration and omission of hepatitis B
      immunoglobulin, most likely will not affect tolerability. The nanofiltration will provide
      more safety regarding viruses.

      In part A, the pharmacokinetics of C1-esteraseremmer-N in patients with hereditary angioedema
      will be compared with the current registered product, Cetor®, in a randomised, blinded
      cross-over design. This study has to provide evidence that changes in the manufacturing
      process have not affected pharmacokinetics. In addition, this study provides data on safety
      of C1-esteraseremmer-N.

      of C1-esteraseremmer-N. Twelve HAE patients without signs of an attack will receive an
      administration of 1,000 U, 1,500 U or 2,000 U of C1-esteraseremmer-N or Cetor® and later on
      the same dose of the other product. Both antigenic and functional C1 inhibitor levels will be
      determined. Laboratory safety parameters and adverse events will be monitored as well
