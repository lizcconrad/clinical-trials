  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well 17-AAG works in treating patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer that did not respond to previous hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as 17-AAG, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with hormone-refractory
      metastatic prostate cancer treated with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall survival and disease-free survival rate in patients treated with
      this drug.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration
      of PSA response and PSA control in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients with measurable disease
      treated with this drug.

      V. Correlate changes in expression levels of interleukin-6, maspin, and NF-kappaB in serum
      and tissue with cancer and treatment-related outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 2-6 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of treatment
      beyond documentation of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.

    <measure>PSA Response as Defined by the Recommendations of the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Normalization: PSA ≤4.0 ng/ml. This must be confirmed by a second PSA value measured when patient returns in 4-6 weeks. This qualifies as a CR response.
&gt;
&gt; 50% decline: A 50% decline in PSA value from baseline which must be confirmed by a second PSA value measured when patient returns in 4-6 weeks later. This qualifies as a PR response.
&gt;
&gt; Progression: A 25% or greater increase over baseline and an increase in the PSA level by at least 5 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second value obtained approximately one week later. In addition, radiographic scans are required to confirm that a disease progression is by PSA only.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Overall Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed response rate was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). A confirmed response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed on subsequent scans at least 4 weeks apart. Confirmed response rate was estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.
The proportion of confirmed responses will be estimated by the number of patients with confirmed responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from registration to documentation of disease progression. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had progressed at the time of their death. In patients who have achieved a PSA response, we will assess the time to PSA progression. If the patient is declared to be a major treatment violation, the patient will be censored on the date the treatment violation was declared to have occurred. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression on day 1 post-registration. The distribution of disease-free survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of PSA Response and PSA Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From PSA response to time of progression, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of this response duration will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. In patients whose PSA has declined from baseline by at least 30 %, &quot;duration of PSA response&quot; will be defined as the time from PSA response to time of progression. If a patient goes on to alternate therapy, they will be censored at the date they end treatment on this study. &quot;Duration of PSA Control&quot; is defined as the time from the date of the first 30% decline in PSA until an inflection point is identified. Inflection point is defined as the time to first consistent PSA increase, the point at which PSA began what becomes a continuous increase
&gt; (retrospectively identified). The inflection point is the point at which disease control could assume to be lost.</description>

        <description>Normalization: PSA ≤4.0 ng/ml. This must be confirmed by a second PSA value measured when patient returns in 4-6 weeks. This qualifies as a CR response. &gt; &gt; 50% decline: A 50% decline in PSA value from baseline which must be confirmed by a second PSA value measured when patient returns in 4-6 weeks later. This qualifies as a PR response. &gt;
&gt; Progression: A 25% or greater increase over baseline and an increase in the PSA level by at least 5 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second value obtained approximately one week later. In addition, radiographic scans are required to confirm that a disease progression is by PSA only.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Overall Responses</title>
        <description>Confirmed response rate was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). A confirmed response is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed on subsequent scans at least 4 weeks apart. Confirmed response rate was estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.
The proportion of confirmed responses will be estimated by the number of patients with confirmed responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

        <title>Disease-free Survival</title>
        <description>Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from registration to documentation of disease progression. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had progressed at the time of their death. In patients who have achieved a PSA response, we will assess the time to PSA progression. If the patient is declared to be a major treatment violation, the patient will be censored on the date the treatment violation was declared to have occurred. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression on day 1 post-registration. The distribution of disease-free survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

        <description>The distribution of this response duration will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. In patients whose PSA has declined from baseline by at least 30 %, “duration of PSA response” will be defined as the time from PSA response to time of progression. If a patient goes on to alternate therapy, they will be censored at the date they end treatment on this study. “Duration of PSA Control” is defined as the time from the date of the first 30% decline in PSA until an inflection point is identified. Inflection point is defined as the time to first consistent PSA increase, the point at which PSA began what becomes a continuous increase
&gt; (retrospectively identified). The inflection point is the point at which disease control could assume to be lost.</description>
