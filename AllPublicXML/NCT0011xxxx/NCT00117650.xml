    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 clinical research study is to examine the safety of an
      experimental gene transfer agent, Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16, and its ability to stimulate the growth of
      new blood vessels from existing blood vessels (a process called angiogenesis) in an attempt
      to improve the flow of blood in the legs of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

      Specifically, this study will enroll patients with severe intermittent claudication (IC)
      which is the stage of PAD in which a patient's walking ability is severely limited, causing
      pain in the legs upon exercise due to inadequate blood flow to the muscles of the lower
      limbs.

      This Phase 2 gene transfer study will look at whether different doses of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 can
      be tolerated safely by direct injection into the leg muscles where the blood flow is not
      sufficient to meet the oxygen demands of the leg muscles. The study will also assess whether
      patients who receive the investigational drug product are able to increase their maximal
      walking time using a standardized treadmill walking test.

      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multi-center, Phase 2 dose-selection study. Seventy-five patients will be enrolled into each
      of 4 study drug groups (3 groups of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 gene transfer and 1 placebo group) for a
      total of 300 patients overall. Three different doses of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 gene transfer will be
      studied. The dose range was previously tested in animals and in the Phase 1 human studies. A
      placebo group is included in the study to compare safety and efficacy of different doses of
      Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 with placebo. Each patient will receive a single set of 20 injections (100 μL
      each) of gene transfer or placebo in one administration to each leg for a total of 40
      injections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 40 to 80 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of PAD, secondary to atherosclerosis, in both lower limbs,
             confirmed by objective evidence: An ankle-brachial index (ABI) of ≤ 0.90 at rest in at
             least 1 lower limb (Note: The index limb must be ≤ 0.90 at rest.); The ABI after
             exercise must be reduced by ≥ 20% from the ABI at rest in the index leg (the most
             symptomatic leg during the treadmill testing). The post-exercise ABI will also be
             performed on the other leg if the resting ABI &gt; 0.90. A patient may be eligible for
             the study with a resting ABI in the non-index limb &gt; 0.90 if: a. The post-exercise ABI
             in the non-index leg is also reduced by greater than or equal to 20% OR; b. A
             medically significant stenosis (defined as ≥ 50%) of a femoropopliteal or
             infrapopliteal artery is present, as documented via an imaging study (such as MR,
             conventional angiography, duplex ultrasound, or CT); If the ABI cannot be measured in
             either leg (due to non-compressible arteries), then a toe-brachial index (TBI) of ≤
             0.70 may be used in its place to confirm PAD.

          -  Symptoms of severe intermittent claudication (IC) in at least 1 lower limb persisting
             for ≥ 6 months

          -  Patients with a peak walking time (PWT) of 1 to 12 minutes (inclusive) using the
             standardized exercise treadmill test at each of the 2 consecutive treadmill tests
             performed at least a week apart during the Screening period.

          -  During Screening, patients must demonstrate consistency of PWTs between 2 standardized
             exercise treadmill tests (Walk 1 and Walk 2) performed at least 1 week apart.

          -  Consistency of the PWT between the 2 visits is achieved if the difference between PWT
             at Walk 1 and Walk 2 is ≤ 25% of the higher of the 2 PWTs ([higher PWT - lower
             PWT]/higher PWT).

          -  If the difference between PWT at Walk 1 and Walk 2 is &gt; 25% of the higher of the 2
             PWTs, a third treadmill test (Walk 3) may be performed at the discretion of the
             Principal Investigator between 7 and 14 days following Walk 2. The variability in PWT
             warranting the performance of Walk 3 must be secondary to circumstances that may
             contribute to the observed variation (e.g., prior exertion, inconsistent timing,
             ingestion of a meal within 4 hours, etc). To qualify for the study, the difference
             between PWT of either Walk 1 or Walk 2 as compared with Walk 3 must be ≤ 25% of the
             higher of the 2 PWTs ([higher PWT - lower PWT]/higher PWT). The decision whether Walk
             1 or Walk 2 will be used for comparison with Walk 3 will be made prospectively and
             reviewed with the Sponsor.

          -  An acceptable mean PWT must be achieved within 4 weeks of treatment administration.

          -  Patients have been considered for other potential treatment options including exercise
             rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and pharmacological therapy prior to Enrollment.

          -  Claudication severity, concomitant medications for the treatment of CAD, PAD, and IC,
             smoking status and exercise habits should be clinically stable for 3 months prior to
             Enrollment.

          -  Patients who are committed to following the protocol requirements as evidenced by
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with either current or any history of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI; that is,
             patients classified as Rutherford Category 4 [ischemic rest pain], Rutherford Category
             5 [non-healing ischemic ulcers and minor tissue loss], or Rutherford Category 6
             [non-healing ischemic ulcers and major tissue loss]).

          -  Patients in whom arterial insufficiency in the lower extremity is the result of acute
             limb ischemia or an immunological or inflammatory non-atherosclerotic disorder (eg,
             thromboangiitis obliterans [Buerger's Disease]) and systemic sclerosis [both limited
             and diffuse forms]).

          -  A PAD-specific surgical revascularization procedure within 6 months of enrollment or a
             PAD-specific percutaneous procedure within 3 months of enrollment, or patients likely
             to require a PAD-specific revascularization procedure within 6 months after
             Enrollment.

          -  Patients with aortoiliac disease that limits inflow in either leg: a. Patients with
             concomitant aortoiliac disease (i.e., patients with a significant component of inflow
             disease in the distal aorta, common or external iliac, or proximal common femoral
             artery) as assessed by an imaging modality (e.g., segmental limb pressures and
             waveform analysis, duplex ultrasound scanning, magnetic resonance angiography, or
             radio-contrast arteriogram) performed within 1 year prior to Enrollment. If subject
             has had a bypass after the imaging study, then documentation of graft patency is
             required within 6 months prior to Enrollment; b. If it is suspected at Screening that
             a patient has aortoiliac disease based on vascular examination, an imaging modality
             (e.g., segmental limb pressures and waveform analysis, duplex ultrasound scanning,
             magnetic resonance angiography, or radio-contrast arteriogram) must be performed to
             rule it out if there is not one available within the times specified above. If there
             is no suspicion of aortoiliac disease in the Principal Investigator's judgment, an
             imaging test at Screening is not required for study purposes.

          -  Patients in whom walking impairment due to pain in the index leg is the result of
             these nonatherosclerotic comorbid conditions: venous claudication, chronic compartment
             syndrome, peripheral nerve pain (e.g., severe peripheral neuropathy),
             pseudoclaudication caused by spinal cord compression, or acute limb ischemia which, in
             the Principal Investigator's judgment are severe enough to confound the assessment of
             the patient's IC.

          -  Conditions other than IC of significant severity that could confound PWT on the
             standardized exercise treadmill test causing premature or inconsistent termination of
             exercise (e.g., angina pectoris, heart failure [New York Heart Association {NYHA}
             Classes III and IV], respiratory disease [e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease], orthopedic disease, neurological disorders, rheumatologic disorders [e.g.,
             severe degenerative joint diseases], dyspnea, fatigue, prior lower limb amputation,
             including amputations proximal to the metatarsal or phalangeal joints).

          -  Presence or history of cancer within 5 years of enrollment or not current with
             recommended screening guidelines for colorectal, lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and
             uterine cancers, with the exception of low grade and fully resolved non-melanoma skin
             malignancy.

          -  Patients with a well-defined clinical or genetic disorder predisposing to malignancy
             should be excluded (e.g., von Hippel Lindau, familial polyposis coli, BRCA1, BRCA2,
             etc).

          -  Patients with baseline funduscopic evidence of active proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy, preproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or wet AMD AND/OR Patients with a
             history of treatment for active proliferative diabetic retinopathy or wet AMD within 5
             years of enrollment.

          -  Diabetes type 1 (juvenile onset)

          -  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (ie, HbA1C &gt;10%) at Screening

          -  Active hepatitis defined as clinically significant increase in liver enzymes (ie, 3
             times the ULN) or other current infectious disease

          -  Patients with symptoms of respiratory infection at time of Screening and/or
             randomization period and/or patients who have been on systemic or oral antibiotics for
             active infection within 2 weeks of study drug administration.

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal hematology (eg, hematocrit &lt; 30%, white
             blood cell count &gt; 14,000), blood chemistry, renal, hepatic, or other laboratory
             parameters that could be the result of an underlying malignancy or systemic infection
             (e.g., serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL), as judged by the investigator.

          -  Patients with the following comorbidities who may not be healthy enough to
             successfully complete all protocol requirements or in whom results may be particularly
             difficult to assess: Concurrent severe congestive heart failure (NYHA Classes III and
             IV); Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, unstable angina (characterized by
             increasingly frequent episodes with modest exertion or at rest, worsening severity,
             and prolonged duration), and/or myocardial infarction within 4 weeks before
             enrollment; Coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention
