    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an experimental HIV
      vaccine. The vaccine will be given with or without IL-12 DNA adjuvant (at three escalating
      doses of 100, 500, and 1,500 mcg respectively), a substance that helps the body respond to a
      vaccine. This study will also determine the safety and tolerability of an experimental HIV
      vaccine boosted with two adjuvants.

    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic is a major global health challenge, causing tremendous human suffering and
      economic loss throughout the world. The need for a safe, effective, and affordable HIV
      preventive vaccine is critical. This study will determine the safety and immunogenicity of an
      experimental HIV vaccine, HIV-1 gag DNA, given with or without an IL-12 adjuvant and boosted
      HIV-1 gag DNA with or without IL-12 DNA adjuvant.

      This study will comprise two parts (Parts A and B). Part A will last 9 months and Part B, 15
      months. Part A will consist of 48 participants enrolled in 4 groups. Group 1 participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive the gag DNA vaccine or placebo. Participants in Groups
      2, 3, and 4 will be randomly assigned to receive the gag DNA vaccine and either 100 mcg, 500
      mcg, or 1,500 mcg IL-12 DNA or placebo. Vaccinations for Groups 1 through 4 will be given
      intramuscularly and will occur at study entry and at Months 1 and 3.

      Part B will consist of 96 participants, enrolled in 3 groups. Participants in Part B will
      receive their first vaccination 2 weeks after Part A participants receive their second
      vaccination. Group 5 participants will receive either the HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine or placebo.
      Group 6 participants will receive either the HIV-1 gag DNA vaccine plus IL-12 DNA or placebo.
      Vaccinations for Groups 5 and 6 will occur at study entry and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9. Group
      7 participants will receive either the gag DNA vaccine plus IL-12 DNA or placebo at study
      entry and at Months 1 and 3. Throughout the study, blood and urine collections will occur,
      physical exams will be conducted, HIV testing and counseling will be offered, and interviews
      and questionnaires will be completed.
