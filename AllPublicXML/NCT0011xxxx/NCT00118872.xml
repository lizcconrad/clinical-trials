  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether lactobacillus GG (LGG), a beneficial bacterium, when given
      in yogurt, will reduce growth faltering in babies living in a poor area of Pakistan who are
      being weaned from breastfeeding.

      Study hypothesis: Use of the probiotic bacteria LGG at the time of weaning will lessen the
      impact of faltering growth in babies living in the slums of Pakistan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Faltering growth due to malnutrition and recurrent diarrhea is a serious public health
      concern in developing nations, particularly among infants who are being weaned from
      breastfeeding. Evidence suggests that the use of the probiotic bacterium LGG reduces the risk
      of diarrhea, shortens episodes of diarrhea, and enhances the immune system. Babies who are
      being weaned from breastfeeding will be given LGG-containing yogurt in this study to
      determine whether LGG will reduce faltering growth caused by diarrhea and malnutrition.

      Infant participants will be enrolled at or within 5 weeks of birth and followed throughout
      the weaning period. During the weaning period, participants will be randomly assigned to
      either receive LGG-containing yogurt or placebo yogurt everyday for 3 months. All
      participants will have height and weight measurements taken at study entry and at Month 3
      (study completion). The number of diarrhea episodes experienced by participants during the
      study will be assessed at study completion to determine participants' health.
