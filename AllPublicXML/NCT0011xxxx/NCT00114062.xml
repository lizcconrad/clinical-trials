  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether denufosol tetrasodium (INS37217)
      Intravitreal Injection is well tolerated and has the potential to treat uveitis associated
      macular edema.

    <textblock>
      Denufosol tetrasodium (INS37217) Intravitreal Injection may provide clinical benefit in
      treatment of uveitis associated macular edema (UME) by reducing retinal thickness as measured
      by OCT and possibly enabling recovery of vision loss associated with UME. Denufosol
      tetrasodium may also reverse the fluid accumulation of UME.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis in at
             least one eye

          -  Have persistent macular edema and uveitis whose conditions are stable

          -  Have no change in medication regimen for at least 3 months prior to randomization if
             currently taking medications such as immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents;
             steroidal or non-steroidal agents (drops, oral or injected)

          -  Have an OCT scan with a qualifying retinal thickness in the study eye

          -  Have evidence of macular edema on OCT scan

          -  Have at lease one eligible eye to be treated in the study based on visual acuity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have proliferative vitreoretinopathy greater than grade B

          -  Have subretinal or vitreous hemorrhage, corneal opacity, or other conditions, which
             limit the view of the retina or obscure FA

          -  Have uncontrollable elevated IOP, advanced, previous filtration surgery, or any
             current evidence of endophthalmitis in the study eye

          -  Have ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound interpretation of study
             results

          -  Have had cataract surgery in the study eye within 3 months, YAG laser capsulotomy
             within the past 1 month, or any other intraocular surgery within the past 90 days

          -  Have pre-operative spherical equivalent refractive error of more than -10 diopters of
             myopia in the study eye

          -  Have had any intravitreal or periocular injection or corticosteroids in the study eye
             during the 3 months prior to screening

          -  Have any ocular implant device for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye

          -  Be taking any excluded medications that could obscure or confound study results
