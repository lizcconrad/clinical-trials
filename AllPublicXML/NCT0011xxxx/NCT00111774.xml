        Inclusion Criteria: Cohort A: - Pathologic diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma fine needle
        aspiration or tissue biopsy - Metastatic colorectal carcinoma - Must have previously failed
        therapy with a fluoropyrimidine and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin; may have received
        both irinotecan and oxaliplatin; chemotherapeutic agents may have been given concurrently
        or sequentially. - May have received prior radiotherapy (target lesions should not have
        been irradiated) - Bidimensionally measurable disease - Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
        available for immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)
        expression (archived tissue is acceptable) - Tumor-expressing EGFr by immunohistochemistry
        (staining must be 2+ or 3+ in greater than or equal to 10% of evaluated tumor cells;
        staining and evaluation to be conducted at a central laboratory) - ECOG score of 0 or 1 -
        Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function Cohort B: - The same inclusion criteria
        from Cohort A will apply to Cohort B, with the exception of the following tumor expressing
        EGFr criterion:

        *Cohort B will include subjects who have IHC staining of 1+ present in greater than 10%
        evaluated tumor cells, OR IHC staining of the sum of 1+, 2+ and 3+ present in greater than
        10% evaluated tumor cells but with the sum of 2+ and 3+ present in less than 10% evaluated
        tumor cells Exclusion Criteria: Cohorts A and B: - Female subject (e.g., of childbearing
        potential, post-menopausal for less than 6 months, not surgically sterilized or not
        abstinent) who is not willing to use an oral or implanted contraceptive, double barrier
        birth control, or an intrauterine device (IUD) during the course of the study and for 6
        months following the last ABX-EGF infusion - Female subject who is breast feeding or who
        has a positive serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first ABX-EGF infusion -
        Male subject who is not willing to use adequate contraception upon enrollment into this
        study and for 1 month following the last ABX-EGF infusion - Untreated brain metastases -
        Use of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days prior to the first dose of
        ABX-EGF - Chemotherapy other than fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan or oxaliplatin for
        colorectal carcinoma. Leucovorin and levamisole are not considered as chemotherapy in this
        exclusion criterion. - Prior EGFr targeting agents - Prior investigational drugs with
        potential antitumor activity (experimental small molecules within 30 days prior to the
        first ABX-EGF infusion, experimental proteins/antibodies within 3 months prior to the first
        ABX-EGF infusion) - If prior history of cancer, other than colorectal carcinoma, basal cell
        carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma in situ, no treatment or active disease within 5 years -
        Myocardial infarction within past year - Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less
        than 45%, as measured by multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan - Known to be HIV positive
        - History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that,
        in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risks associated with study
        participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
        study results - Subject allergic to the ingredients of the study medication or to
        Staphylococcus Protein A - Unwilling or unable to comply with the study requirements
