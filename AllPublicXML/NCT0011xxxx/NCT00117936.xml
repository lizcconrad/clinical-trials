    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          1. Sign an informed consent form.

          2. Age ≥25 and ≤75 years, either gender, and any race.

          3. At least a 3 month history of chronic, stable angina and is relieved by rest and/or
             nitroglycerin.

          4. Documented symptomatic CCS Angina Classification of III to IV despite use of optimal
             medical therapy as noted in Inclusion Criterion 10.

          5. Pattern of CHD (coronary pathology) where percutaneous interventional therapy and/or
             CABG is not recommended by the treating cardiologist. This decision should have a
             documented basis in either complicated vessel physiology and/or lack of suitable
             target vessels for both PTCA and CABG, or past history of complications.

          6. One/two/three vessel disease as evidenced either by an angiographic documentation of
             advanced atherosclerotic narrowing of ≥60% of at least one major epicardial coronary
             artery (right coronary artery [RCA], left circumflex [LCX], or LAD [or any of their
             branches]), or of diffuse type of CHD as evidenced by the appearance on coronary
             angiography of multiple stenoses, multiple atherosclerotic plaques, and/or peripheral
             occlusion(s) of coronary vessel(s) with and without a history of MIs.

          7. demonstrate a radionuclide or angiographically determined left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) ≥30%.

          8. Pre-operative proof of reversible ischemia.

          9. No evidence of proliferative retinopathy or significant non-proliferative retinopathy.

         10. must be on optimal medical therapy for at least 2 months prior to entering the study,
             as documented by a medical history. This will include medical management, and subjects
             must enter the study on at least one of the following medications: beta-blockers,
             calcium entry blockers, ranolizine, or long-acting nitrates.

         11. Exercise duration during the qualifying treadmill tests at Visit 1 and Visit 2 is ≥3
             and ≤9 minutes on a modified Bruce protocol.

         12. Exercise durations for the qualifying treadmill tests at Visits 1 and 2 must satisfy
             at least one of the two following conditions: (a) they differ by less than or equal to
             20% of the longer time; (b) they differ by less than or equal to 60 seconds. Subjects
             whose ETTs at Visits 1 and 2 do not satisfy at least one of these two conditions are
             allowed a third ETT, at the investigator's discretion, from 5 to 7 days after Visit 2.
             If a third ETT is done, then when compared with the second ETT it must satisfy at
             least one of the two conditions above.

         13. For a treadmill test result to support inclusion it must terminate in the presence of
             angina for either of the following reasons: (a) angina becomes too severe to continue
             the test AND there must be a horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment of at
             least 1 mm measured 80 ms from the J point as subsequently established by the
             Biomedical Systems central ECG lab, or (b) angina of any grade AND there must be a
             horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment measured 80 ms from the J point of 2
             mm during exercise. The qualifying time for the treadmill test will then be the time
             to a horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment of 1 mm compared to the
             pre-exercise ST segment as subsequently established by the Biomedical Systems central
             ECG lab.

         14. A forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥30%.

         15. A negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential at Screening.

         16. Female subjects must be post-menopausal or sterilized, or if she is of childbearing
             potential, she is not breast feeding, has no intention to become pregnant during the

             Appendix 13.8).
