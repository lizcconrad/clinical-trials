      This study will evaluate the safety of the Leish-111f + MPL-SE vaccine in adult patients with
      cutaneous leishmaniasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disfiguring infection that can progress to mucosal
      leishmaniasis, a more serious and possibly fatal form of leishmania infection. All available
      medical therapies require weeks of treatment and cause significant toxicity. In Brazil, a
      standard therapy is Glucantime treatment, administered in cycles of 10 consecutive, once
      daily, intramuscular injections (Glucantime 10 mg/kg, maximum of 850 mg), followed by 11
      consecutive days without Glucantime injections (rest days). At the completion of each cycle,
      a study physician examines the patient to determine if a further cycle of Glucantime
      treatment is indicated.

      It appears that Leishmania infections can be eliminated by T helper 1 immune responses. This
      finding argues that a vaccine that augments cutaneous leishmaniasis patients’ T helper 1
      response will eliminate the infection and disease. This study is a phase 1, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled, sequential dose-escalating trial to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of three injections of 5, 10, or 20 μg of Leish-111f protein + 25 μg of MPL-SE
      adjuvant given at 4 week intervals as an adjunct to the standard chemotherapy with Glucantime
      cycles, as described above in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
