  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of atorvastatin (Lipitor) and
      rosuvastatin (Crestor), United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs
      commonly prescribed by doctors to lower cholesterol, on certain functions of platelets (cells
      that cause blood clots), white blood cells (cells that are responsible for inflammation), and
      blood flow regulation by arteries. This is important because we are looking at ways to more
      effectively prevent atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in blood vessels) and heart disease. Many
      studies have demonstrated that these drugs are effective at reducing inflammation and
      stabilizing plaques. We are interested in better understanding the effects of these medicines
      on inflammation (pain and swelling) and the mechanism by which they act.

      Hypothesis: Atorvastatin (40mg) will reduce inflammatory markers and activity more than
      Rosuvastatin (10mg) in spite of equal LDL-C reduction.

      A double-blind controlled trial with two arms will be conducted at Brigham and Womenâ€™s
      Hospital (BWH). We will screen subjects with stable atherosclerosis to complete enrollment of
      40 subjects in the study (see inclusion and exclusion criteria section below). A central
      pharmacist at BWH will randomize the patients to 40mg of atorvastatin (n=20) or 10mg of
      rosuvastatin (n=20) for 28 days. If the patient is already on a statin a two-week washout
      period will be required prior to trial initiation. Our subjects, clinicians, data collectors,
      outcomes assessors and statisticians will be blind with regards to the patient allocation.
      There are a total of 3 visits for each patient: a short screening visit, an initial visit for
      baseline data (90 min.) and a final visit after 28 days. Our participants will be asked to
      take the medication every day at the same time between 9pm and 10pm. Each visit will take
      place between 7am and 9am. Patients will be instructed to fast overnight for a minimum of
      8hrs. They will also be advised not to make any other changes to their current medications
      and lifestyle for 28 days while in the study and to record in a diary any side effects,
      missed doses, or changes in concomitant medication.
