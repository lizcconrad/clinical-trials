      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alemtuzumab when given
      together with fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation followed by cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil in treating patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell transplant
      for hematologic cancer. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, a
      monoclonal antibody, such as alemtuzumab, and radiation therapy before a donor stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. Giving chemotherapy or radiation therapy
      before or after transplant also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's
      bone marrow stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and
      help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which dose of Campath (alemtuzumab) allows related and unrelated human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-II mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with an
      incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) less than 40%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of graft rejection.

      II. Number of days of steroids &gt;= 1mg/kg required before day 100 in each patient.

      III. Incidence of non-relapse mortality.

      IV. Risk/incidence of infections.

      V. Immune reconstitution.

      VI. Risk for disease progression and relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) over 6
      hours once daily on days -6, -5, and -4 OR days -5 and -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV over
      30 minutes on days -4, -3, and -2. Patients also undergo low-dose total-body irradiation
      (TBI) on day 0.

      ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): After completion of TBI,
      patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) or IV every 12 hours on days -3
      to 180 followed by a taper until day 365 in the absence of GVHD. Beginning 4-6 hours after
      completion of allogeneic PBSCT, patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO every 8 hours on
      days 0 to 100 followed by a taper until day 156 in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months, at
      18 months, and then annually for 5 years.

    <description>The outcome of immune reconstitution was not analyzed by the collaborating laboratory because only a small number of patients were only enrolled in Dose Level 1 (no alemtuzumab). The Dose Level 1 patients were going to be the baseline for which to compare the other patients on Dose Level 2 (and 3) who would have received alemtuzumab. The collaborating investigator determined that the study was not worthwhile performing based on this information.</description>

Liver:
Stage 2 - bilirubin (3-5.9mg/100ml) Stage 3 - bilirubin (6-14.9mg/100ml) Stage 4 - bilirubin &gt; 15mg/100ml
Gut:
Diarrhea is graded stage 1 to stage 4 in severity. Nausea and vomiting and/or anorexia caused by GVHD is assigned as stage 1 in severity. The severity of gut involvement is assigned to the most severe involvement noted. Patients with visible bloody diarrhea are at least stage 2 gut and grade 3 overall
Severity of GVHD
Grade III - Stage 2 to 4 gastrointestinal involvement and/or Stage 2 to 4 liver involvement with or without a rash Grade IV - Pattern and severity of GVHD similar to grade 3 with extreme constitutional symptoms or death</description>
