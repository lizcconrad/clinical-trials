  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if transurethral photodynamic therapy with
      lemuteporfin has a therapeutic effect on lower urinary tract symptoms due to an enlarged
      prostate.

      Photodynamic therapy (known as &quot;PDT&quot;) is a treatment that uses light to make a drug work.
      This means the drug is &quot;light-activated&quot;. Light-activated drugs do not work until a certain
      color of light shines on the drug. When the drug and the light combine, they react together
      to destroy tissue.

      This study is investigating PDT with lemuteporfin as a possible treatment for an enlarged
      prostate. PDT with lemuteporfin may destroy overgrown prostate tissue and help urinary
      symptoms go back to normal.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, dose-finding study in
      parallel groups of subjects with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH). All subjects will receive a fixed dose of lemuteporfin injected
      transurethrally into the prostate followed by transurethral application of either one of
      three active light doses or a sham light dose. Subjects will be followed for safety and
      efficacy for a minimum of three months to a maximum of 12 months. The primary study endpoint
      will be the change from baseline in AUA SI score at three months.
