      Expected Enrollment: 40 patients

      Study Start Date: June 2005

      Study Objectives:

        -  To conduct a pilot study to assess the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of
           Kaletra 400/100 mg taken twice a day (bid) in antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve HIV-infected
           patients at Week 48

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at weeks 24 and 48

        -  To determine the proportion of patients with HIV RNA &lt; 50 at weeks 24 and 48

        -  To elucidate the specific adverse event (AE) profile of Kaletra single agent therapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the proportion of patients below the limit of quantification (LOQ) at each
           visit. Patients will be observed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,
           40, 44 and 48.

        -  To determine the time to HIV RNA reaching &lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/mL

        -  To determine the time to virologic failure

        -  To assess change from baseline at each visit for HIV RNA and CD4 count at weeks 4, 8,
           12, 24 and 48.

        -  To assess changes in genotype from baseline to time of confirmed virologic failure (2
           consecutive HIV RNA measurements &gt;400 copies/mL after suppressing to &lt;400 copies/mL) or
           at time of treatment intensification.

        -  To characterize changes in lipid and triglyceride concentrations over time and the
           effect of treatment with appropriate drugs (fibrate or statin, if necessary) on these
           elevations.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subjects through 48 weeks of drug exposure.

        -  To describe virologic response following intensification in Kaletra single agent
           virologic failures

          -  Cognitive ability to understand and provide written informed consent and willingness
             to participate in and comply with the study protocol

          -  PI -naïve or has &lt; 7 days of prior ART with any licensed or investigational compound
             (NOTE: patients must have no prior PI experience)

          -  Patient does not currently have or has not been treated for an active opportunistic
             infection (OI) consistent with CDC definition within 30 days of screening

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: (1)
             Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal) -OR- (2) Child-bearing potential, has a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screen, and agrees to one of the following: Complete
             abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug,
             throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature
             discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug.
             Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she
             must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods listed below:
             *Double barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,
             diaphragm/spermicide); *Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that
             the expected failure rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion);
             *Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient); *Any other methods
             with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate for that method is
             &lt;1% per year.

        NOTE: Data are insufficient to exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with
        drugs, such as hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450
        enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered adequate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or disease according to the
             1993 CDC AIDS surveillance definition (Clinical Category C) that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would preclude the patient from participating in the study.

          -  Patient has an M184V mutation in reverse transcriptase, or mutations at 10, 20, 32,
             46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, or 90;

          -  K65R mutation or 2 or more TAMs at baseline

          -  History of active substance abuse, excluding cannabis, or psychiatric illness that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance with protocol, dosing
             schedule and assessments.

          -  Patient is either pregnant at time of screening evaluation or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to be able to complete the
             48-week dosing period and protocol evaluations and assessments or adhere to the study
             drug regimen.

          -  Patient suffers from a serious medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart
             failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction, which in the opinion of the
             investigator would compromise the safety of the patient

          -  Patient has malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may
             interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.

          -  Patient is undergoing interferon therapy for HCV or anticipates undergoing therapy
             during the course of this trial

          -  HBV coinfection

             dose of study medication: *Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 8.0 g/dL; *Absolute neutrophil
             count &lt; 750 cells/mm3; *Platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/ mm3; *Aminotransferase (AST,

          -  Patient has required treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
             agents within 4 weeks prior to entry, or has an anticipated need for these agents
             within the study period.

          -  Patient requires treatment with immunomodulating agents, such as systemic
             corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferon's within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or
             patients who have received an HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months prior to
             entry. Asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment.

          -  Patient receiving methadone therapy

          -  In addition, patients non-compliant with study medication during 2 - 4 week study
             periods despite adherence counseling will not be retained in the study due to
             increased risk for selective pressure and potential development of protease
             resistance.

          -  Patient requires inhaled or intranasal fluticasone.
