  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a novel taxane analog, TPI 287. TPI 287 is
      synthetically manufactured from naturally occurring taxanes extracted from yew starting
      material. The synthesis involves modification to the taxane side chain to overcome multidrug
      resistance and to achieve mutant tubulin binding. This study will be a multi-center, dose
      escalation, sequential group, phase I study evaluating the intravenous administration of TPI
      287, a novel third generation taxane.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of TPI 287 for
      phase II clinical trials.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To determine the safety of TPI 287

        -  To determine antitumor activity of TPI 287

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of TPI 287

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamic profile of TPI 287

                  eligible for a bone marrow transplant.

          -  Failed at least one previous therapeutic regimen and either no longer are candidates
