  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral illness common in the Northern Hemisphere,
      especially Europe and Asia. TBE infection may lead to central nervous system problems and
      death. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and immune response to a TBE
      vaccine in healthy adults. The vaccine is related to a live attenuated virus developed
      against dengue virus infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TBE is a common illness in Europe and Asia, where it is usually associated with mild illness
      but sometimes leads to long-term symptoms and even death. This study will evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of a live attenuated chimeric virus, LGT(TP21)/DEN4, which is derived from
      the Langat flavivirus and DEN4 dengue virus serotypes.

      Each volunteer will be involved in the study for 180 days. Participants in Cohort 1 will be
      randomly assigned to receive LGT(TP21)/DEN4 or placebo at study entry. Cohort 2 will begin
      only after safety review of all participants in Cohort 1. Participants in Cohort 2 will
      receive a higher dose of LGT(TP21)/DEN4 or placebo.

      After vaccination, participants will be asked to monitor their temperatures every day for 16
      days and on Day 19. Study visits will occur every other day after vaccination until Day 16,
      followed by 5 additional visits at selected days through Day 180. Blood collection and a
      targeted physical exam will occur at each study visit. Some participants will be asked to
      undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
