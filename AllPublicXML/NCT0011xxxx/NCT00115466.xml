    <textblock>
      This comparative, multicentre, randomised clinical trial is designed with two parallel groups
      that will follow a treatment either with an autologous implant of ASCs (Adipose Derived Stem
      Cells) and fibrin glue (tissue adhesive material) or with fibrin glue alone for the
      non-surgical treatment of complex perianal fistula.

      Comparative, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, designed with two parallel groups that
      will follow a treatment either with an autologous implant of ASCs (Adipose Derived Stem
      Cells) and fibrin glue (tissue adhesive material) or with fibrin glue alone for the
      NON-SURGICAL treatment of complex perianal fistula. The closure/healing of the fistula will
      be evaluated periodically, and it will be considered completely closed if there is no
      suppuration from the external orifice and re-epithelialisation can be observed at 8 weeks
      after the administration of the randomised therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both sexes older than 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with a complex perianal fistula pathology which we define as the subjects
             that fulfil some of the following conditions:

               -  No palpation of the fistula tract beneath the perianal skin.

               -  A tract that is parallel to the rectum on exploration with a stylet.

               -  Associated faecal incontinence.

               -  Risk factors of anal incontinence.

               -  At least one previous operation for a fistulous disorder.

               -  Suprasphincteric trajectories

               -  Rectovaginal fistula

               -  Prior diagnosis of Crohn’s disease.

          -  Patients from whom written informed consent has been obtained for them to participate
             in the study prior to performing any procedure described in the study.

          -  Patients that have already been subjected to a colonoscopy within a period of up to 6
             months prior to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that are extremely thin who should not be subjected to liposuction.

          -  Known allergy to local anaesthetics or to bovine proteins

          -  History of neoplasia in the past 5 years.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of active Tuberculosis at the moment of inclusion.

          -  Patients with prior positive markers for any of the following pathogens: Hepatitis B
             and C, HIV-1 or HIV-2.

          -  Any other medical condition that in the judgement of the investigator could interfere
             with their optimal participation in the study or produce a significant risk to the
             patient.

          -  Patients that have participated in another study in the 30 days prior to this one or
             that have planned to participate simultaneously in another study.

          -  Patients that have not given their informed consent to participate in this study.

          -  Psychiatric disorder or other factors that in the judgement of the investigator could
             complicate the participation of the patient in the study.

          -  Breast feeding, gestation or intention to become pregnant up to 6 months after
             finalising their participation in the study, or that are not using adequate methods of
             contraception during the same period.
