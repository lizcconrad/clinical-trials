  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with docetaxel works in
      treating patients with recurrent or persistent uterine cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as gemcitabine and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with recurrent
      or persistent uterine carcinosarcoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-4 years.
