  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of
      Seasonale, an extended-regimen oral contraceptive, on bone mineral density in adolescent
      females who have had their menstrual period but now have secondary amenorrhea and also have
      osteopenia. The duration of the study for each patient will be approximately two years.
