  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new treatment for prostate cancer. We have
      been exploring the use of cytokine (immune stimulating) gene therapy by directly injecting a
      virus which produces a cytokine called interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the prostate gland to
      control tumor growth. We propose to explore the use of adenovirus-mediated human
      interleukin-12 (Ad.hIL-12) in patients with recurrent non-metastatic prostate cancer
      following radiation therapy in a Phase I trial. Participants will be placed in rising dose
      groups with the primary endpoint of learning the maximum dose that can safely be given by
      injection directly into the prostate gland. Toxicity will be determined through physical
      examination, laboratory values, and blood levels of cytokines. Evidence of an immune response
      against prostate proteins will also be monitored. If the treatment works, the cancer will
      shrink or not grow. This will be monitored by prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in the
      blood. However, we do not know if this treatment will be effective. If the PSA continues to
      rise after treatment, participants will be taken off study and offered other treatment. There
      is no compensation for participation in this research study. There will be no charge for the
      treatment with gene therapy or the monitoring associated with this research study. Monitoring
      will occur in a specially designated clinical research center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer have few viable treatment options, both in terms
      of efficacy and morbidity. Local therapies fail even in highly selected patients due to
      locally advanced disease, microscopic metastases, and a worsening of the biology of cancer
      cells. Furthermore, attempts at salvage local treatments have the complications of
      incontinence, impotence and in some cases unremitting penile pain. Pre-clinical studies in a
      mouse model of prostate cancer have noted the potential benefit of adenovirus-mediated gene
      therapy to deliver IL-12 in this clinical scenario. This treatment was able to significantly
      growth suppress the injected tumor to prolong survival and reduce the number of
      pre-established metastases. The mechanisms underlying this activity involved both innate
      immunity (neutrophils and natural killer [NK] cells) and acquired immunity ( T cells) and
      enhanced expression of Fas to further sensitize Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) killing.

      This is a Phase I study. Therefore, the primary objective is finding the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose. Within this realm will be monitoring of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secondary aspects
      will involve correlating important mechanisms identified in the pre-clinical model: induction
      of T cells.
