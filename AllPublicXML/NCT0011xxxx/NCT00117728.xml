  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test if a sequential protease-inhibitor (PI) - / nevirapine (NVP)
      -based regimen is effective for the treatment of HIV-infected children when previous NVP
      exposure has occurred as part of programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The wide use of NVP in pMTCT-prophylaxis may result in resistance to NNRTI and concomitantly
      limits the use of these drugs for the treatment of HIV-infected children. To avoid
      restricting treatment options for children, it is desirable to preserve NVP for both pMTCT
      and first line treatment. This study will therefore test whether resistance-caused treatment
      failures of HIV-infected and previously NVP-exposed children can be avoided if the NVP
      treatment is preceded by an initial PI-based regimen.

      Comparison: HIV-infected children less than 24 months of age, exposed to any pMTCT regimen
      that included NVP and who achieve and maintain viral suppression for at least 3 months with a
      PI-based regimen will be randomized to one of the two groups: (1) to continue on
      PI-containing regimen or (2) to be switched off the PI-containing regimen onto the
      NVP-containing regimen. The study outcome will be proportions in the two groups who have
      complete virologic suppression at 6 months after randomization.
