  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Itopride is a compound already marketed in Japan and in some countries of Eastern Europe
      under the name of Ganaton. It is used to treat symptoms of functional dyspepsia. Patients
      suffering from this condition have difficulties digesting food. Patients feel full after
      eating; they have bloating and have stomach pain. The goal of this study is to see if
      itopride helps to relieve the symptoms of functional dyspepsia on a long-term basis.

      All patients who have completed study ITOFD04-03 will be offered to continue to be treated
      with itopride for a period of up to one year in duration. A target of 300 patients will be
      followed up for 6 months. Of these, a target of 100 patients will be kept on treatment for an
      additional 6 months.

      Patients will need to come to the clinic for evaluations every 8 weeks during the trial.
      Evaluations done at these visits will include: lab tests, evaluation of the heartburn
      condition, and a questionnaire needed to be completed by the patient to see if the drug is
      helpful in relieving their symptoms.
