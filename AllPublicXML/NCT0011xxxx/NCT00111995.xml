      This study is designed to evaluate the hemoglobin response to Aranesp速 (darbepoetin alfa) in
      black subjects (African-Americans) with chronic renal failure (CRF) receiving hemodialysis
      and to examine the safety profile.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of CRF and 3 times weekly prescribed hemodialysis
        treatments for at least 8 weeks before signing informed consent - No planned change in
        dialysis modality or schedule - Black (as indicated on the Chronic Medical Evidence Disease
        Report, CMMS Form 2728) - Hemoglobin 9.5 to 12.5 g/dL on 2 consecutive occasions during the
        screening period (1 week + 2 days apart) and baseline hemoglobin level of 9.5 - 12.5 g/dL
        (defined as the mean of all measurements taken during the screening and baseline periods) -
        Transferrin saturation greater than or equal to 20% but less than or equal to 50% - Stable
        rHuEPO therapy given 3 times per week by intravenous (IV) route of administration for 6
        weeks before randomization (stable is defined as less than or equal to 25% change in
        prescribed dose over 6 weeks, same route of administration, and no more than 1 missed or
        withheld dose during each of the two 3-week periods before randomization) Exclusion
        Criteria: - Scheduled for a living-related or living non-related donor transplant - rHuEPO
        dose greater than 40,000 units weekly - Uncontrolled hypertension (postdialysis diastolic
        blood pressure greater than 105 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg
        on more than 1 occasion as noted in the collected blood pressure measurements during the
        screening/baseline period) - Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
        Class III or IV) - Major surgery (excluding vascular access surgery) within 8 weeks before
        signing informed consent and during screening/baseline - Clinical evidence of active
        inflammatory disease requiring cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, prednisone or other
        immunosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks before signing the informed consent and during
        screening/baseline - Currently (at the signing of the informed consent) receiving
        antibiotics for a systemic infection and during screening/baseline - Known positivity for
        HIV antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen - Grand mal seizures within the last year -
        Clinical evidence of current malignancy (other than non-melanomatous skin malignancy),
        and/or receiving chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy for malignancies within 8 weeks of
        signing the informed consent and during screening/baseline - Active systemic hematologic
        disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hematological malignancy,
        myeloma, hemolytic anemia) within 8 weeks of signing the informed consent and during
        screening/baseline - Clinical evidence of severe hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone
        [PTH] level greater than 1500 pg/mL or biopsy-proven bone marrow fibrosis) at last
        measurement - ALT or AST greater than 2x the upper limit of the normal range - Red blood
        cell transfusions within 8 weeks before signing the informed consent and during
        screening/baseline - Known hypersensitivity to human serum albumin (HSA)
