  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 28-day course of
      aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and lung
      infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CF patients often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The lung
      infections are often caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Treatment with
      antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by
      mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic
      aztreonam and administered TID using the PARI eFlowÂ® electronic nebulizer, in CF patients
      with PA.

      In this study, participant eligibility was assessed at a screening visit 7 to 14 days prior
      to the baseline visit (Day 0). Those participants who continued to meet eligibility criteria
      at Day 0 were randomized and began a 28-day course of blinded study treatment (AZLI TID or
      placebo TID). Participants returned for clinic visits at Day 14, an end of treatment visit at
      Day 28, and a follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 42).

    <measure>Change in CFQ-R Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R was administered at baseline and every visit thereafter. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R respiratory symptoms scale (RSS; range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in FEV1 (L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit. The percent change from baseline in forced expiratory volume (liters) in one second (FEV1) was determined at Day 28.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) Log10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) Per Gram of Sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating AZLI in patients with CF and PA. Participants were enrolled at 53 sites total: 40 in United States, 5 in Canada, 7 in Australia, and 1 in New Zealand. Date of first enrollment was 10 Jun 2005, and date of last participant follow-up was 3 Apr 2007.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Planned study size was 140 participants to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to AZLI or placebo TID, with 166 actually randomized (83 AZLI, 83 placebo). However, two participants did not receive a dose of drug, and one participant randomized to receive AZLI received placebo in error. Thus, 80 participants received AZLI and 84 received placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Disease severity based on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted</title>
          <description>FEV1 percent predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudson equation and based upon participant age, gender, and height. This baseline measure indicates the number of subjects with FEV1 greater than 50% and less than or equal to 50% of the predicted value based on age, gender, and height at screening.</description>

          <description>PA isolates from sputum samples (collected at all visits) were assessed for their susceptibility to aztreonam.
MIC50 = minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 50% of isolates from a particular organism).
MIC90 = minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 90% of isolates from a particular organism).
MIC50 and MIC90 values are single measurements for the entire population and not measured on a per-participant basis.</description>

        <description>Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</description>
