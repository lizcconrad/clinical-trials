      This study will determine whether the herbal product St. John's wort is safe and effective in
      treating generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD).

      Study hypothesis: Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) is more effective in treating GSAD
      than placebo.

      The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has grown dramatically over the last
      decade. Botanical treatments originating from plants have become especially popular for
      treating conditions such as anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that the botanical St.
      John's wort has neurochemical activity similar to that of conventional medications. However,
      research on the safety and effectiveness of St. John's wort is limited. This study will
      determine the safety and effectiveness of St. John's wort in treating GSAD, a serious
      condition characterized by intense fear of various social situations that may cause
      embarrassment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either St. John's wort or placebo daily for
      10 weeks. Self-report scales will be used to assess participants' GSAD symptoms at study
      entry and at study completion. Blood collection will occur at every weekly study visit to
      determine the levels of St. John's wort in the blood.
