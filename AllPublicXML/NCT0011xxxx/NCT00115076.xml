  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our laboratory is studying a skin disease known as psoriasis. The purpose of this protocol is
      to study the action and the effects of Efalizumab, on psoriasis. This medication has been
      studied extensively and has been found to be effective and safe in the treatment of
      psoriasis. The eligible patient will have 10% of his/her body surface area involved with
      psoriasis vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>

      The eligible patient will receive the drug Efalizumab, weekly for 12 weeks, by injection. The
      patient will be seen weekly for 12 weeks and every other week for the 12 weeks of follow up.
      At those visits, the patient can expect that a physical and skin exam will be done. At
      specific weeks, blood work will be drawn, clinical photography taken and a skin biopsy done.
      Two types of skin biopsies will be done after local anesthesia has been administered. One is
      a punch biopsy where a small piece of skin will be taken, the approximate size of a pencil
      eraser. The second type of skin biopsy is shave biopsy, where a postage sized piece of skin
      will be taken.

             Appendix B)

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, candidate for systemic therapy for psoriasis:

               -  Who has not been previously treated (naive to systemic treatment) OR

               -  Who has had prior treatment with systemic therapy for psoriasis (e.g., PUVA,
                  cyclosporine, corticosteroids, methotrexate, oral retinoids, mycophenolate
                  mofetil (MMF), thioguanine, hydroxyurea, sirolimus, azathioprine, 6-MP,

          -  Body weight of &lt;140 kg

          -  18 to 75 years old. As the risk of Efalizumab in childhood is unknown, those &lt; 18years
