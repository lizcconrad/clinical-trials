      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy
      with etanercept and narrow-band (NB) UVB phototherapy for the treatment of psoriasis in a
      pilot study. This is a Phase 4 clinical study being conducted under an Amgen Investigational
      New Drug Application (IND).
