      IMPULSE Dynamics' FIX HF 5 US Study is a prospective, multi-center, study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signals delivered by the
      implantable OPTIMIZER™ System in patients with NYHA class III/IV heart failure. The study
      will involve the recruitment of approximately 420 subjects at a total of up to 50 sites
      nationwide.

      Those subjects who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria based upon baseline test
      results will be randomized to receive the OPTIMIZER™ System or to a control group. All
      subjects randomized will be followed for 1 year and shall receive the same study related
      assessments throughout the course of the study. In addition, all subjects will continue to
      receive optimal medical therapy for the treatment of their heart failure.

      The primary efficacy assessment consists of a change in exercise tolerance measured by
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline and 6 months. Safety variables, such as the rate
      and cause of hospitalizations or death, shall be collected in both groups and shall be
      compared at 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are 18 years of age or older

          -  Subjects who are either male or female

          -  Subjects who have a baseline ejection fraction of 35% or less by echocardiography.

          -  Subjects who have been treated for heart failure for at least 90 days (including
             treatment with a β-blocker for at least 90 days unless the patient is intolerant) and
             are in New York Heart Association functional Class III or IV at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Subjects receiving appropriate, stable medical therapy during the 30 days prior to
             enrollment for treatment of heart failure, consisting of the appropriate doses of
             diuretics, ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and β-blocker. Stable is
             defined as no more than a 100% increase or 50% decrease in dose.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Principle Investigator (based on the current
             guidelines for clinical practice), have a clinical indication for an implanted cardiac
             defibrillator (ICD) and/or pacemaker, must have an existing device or agree to undergo
             implantation of such a device unless the patient refuses to undergo the implantation
             of such device for personal reasons.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to return for all follow-up visits.
