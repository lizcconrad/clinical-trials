      Study TMC114-C214 is a randomized, controlled, open-label trial to compare the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of TMC114 boosted with low dose ritonavir (RTV) versus Kaletra
      (LPV)/RTV in lopinavir-naïve treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients.

      Study TMC114-C214 is a randomized (patients are assigned to different treatment groups based
      on chance), controlled, open-label trial to compare the efficacy (effectiveness), safety and
      tolerability of TMC114 boosted with low dose ritonavir (RTV) versus Kaletra (LPV)/RTV in
      treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients. This research study will look at the safety of
      TMC114 and effectiveness in reducing the amount of HIV(viral load) in the blood. People
      included in this study will have received either Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase
      Inhibitors (NNRTIs) or Protease Inhibitors (PIs) or both. The duration of the study will be
      approximately 106 weeks, which includes a 4 to 6 week screening period, 96-week treatment
      period, and 4-week follow-up period. TMC114 300mg are orange tablets where 2 tablets are
      taken by mouth twice a day with 1 tablet of Ritonavir. Kaletra (LPV/RTV) is either a tablet
      or capsule taken twice a day. The oral capsule contains 133.3 mg LPV, 33.3 mg RTV and the
      film-coated tablet is available for oral administration in a strength of 200 mg of lopinavir
      and 50 mg of ritonavir. Dosing for all medication will occur for 96 weeks and you will be
      randomly assigned to either TMC114 or Kaletra.
