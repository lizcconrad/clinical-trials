    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether vaccination with antigenic peptides induces an
      immune response in the vaccine site sentinel lymph node of patients with microscopically
      detectable lymph node melanoma metastases.

      The study is designed for patients with skin melanoma and lymph node micrometastasis
      previously diagnosed by a sentinel node procedure. As a result of their diagnosis, the
      patients are scheduled for lymph node dissection. Before this is done, patients are
      vaccinated with antigenic peptides. The peptides are mixed with the adjuvant SB AS-2 or
      Montanide and injected in a lower limb not affected by the disease. The skin site of vaccine
      injection is marked with a permanent pen where, two weeks later, patent blue and 99technetium
      is injected. These markers allow one to locate the vaccine site sentinel node (VSSN) which
      will be removed during the lymph node dissection at the diseased limb.

      The aim of the study is to test whether the vaccine has induced an immune response in the
      lymph node that drains the vaccine site.
