    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

             toxicities have resolved

          -  Measurable disease (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
             criteria) defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than or equal to 20 mm with
             conventional techniques, or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with a spiral computed
             tomography (CT) scan

          -  Have melanoma that can be biopsied once before, and at least twice after, MEDI-522
             treatment

          -  Males and females of at least 18 years of age at the time of study entry

          -  Women of reproductive potential (defined as being &lt;1 year post-menopausal) must have a
             negative serum B human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) pregnancy test within 3 days
             prior to study entry; and men and women of reproductive potential must agree to
             practice an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral or implanted
             contraceptives, intrauterine device [IUD], condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical
             cap, abstinence, or sterile sexual partner) at the time informed consent is signed
             (women only) or at the time of the initiation of MEDI-522 (men only), and must agree
             to continue using such precautions while receiving MEDI-522 and for 30 days after the
             final dose of MEDI-522

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks

          -  WBC greater than or equal to 3000/mm(3), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than
             or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3)

          -  Bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL [unless due to Gilbert's syndrome
             (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) in which case the bilirubin should be &lt;= 3.5 mg/dL];
             aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than or equal to 3 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN); serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL;
             hepatic alkaline phosphatase greater than or equal to 3.0 x ULN; prothrombin time (PT)
             or international normalized ratio (INR) within normal range (unless a patient is
             receiving anticoagulation therapy); or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal
             range

          -  Patients who have had prior radiation therapy are eligible, provided that therapy was
             palliative in nature, not in the area where the tumor will be biopsied, and all
             radiation-related toxicities have resolved

          -  Patients who had prior major surgery are eligible if at least 4 weeks have passed
             since their surgery. All surgical wounds must have healed.

          -  All toxicities related to prior adjuvant therapy must have resolved.
