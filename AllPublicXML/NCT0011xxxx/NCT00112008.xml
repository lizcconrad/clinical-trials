  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to test a novel dosing paradigm that would facilitate the
      treatment of anemia in CKD patients not on dialysis. Anemic patients who are not currently
      receiving ESA therapy will be dosed with darbepoetin alfa Q2W for 18 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of CKD and not expected to initiate dialysis for the
        duration of the study - Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): greater than or equal
        to 15 mL/min and less than or equal to 60 mL/min measured by the following modified MDRD
        (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation: eGFR = 186 x [serum creatinine]-1.154 x
        [Age]-0.203 x [0.742 if subject is female] x [1.212 if subject is black] - Clinically
        stable, in the judgment of the investigator - Mean Hb greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL to
        less than or equal to 13.0 g/dL (mean of 2 values drawn at least 3 days apart during the
        screening period) - Transferrin saturation (Tsat) greater than or equal to 15.0% - Serum
        vitamin B12 and folate levels above the lower limit of the normal range - Receiving stable
        Q2W subcutaneous (SC) doses of Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa). A stable dose is defined as
        less than or equal to a 25% change in dose over the 6-week period immediately prior to
        enrollment and with no missed doses in this period Exclusion Criteria: - Prior recipient or
        scheduled to receive a kidney transplant - Diastolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 110
        mm Hg or systolic BP greater than 180 mm Hg during screening - Acute myocardial ischemia -
        Hospitalization for congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within 12 weeks
        before enrollment - Parathyroid hormone level greater than 1500 pg/mL - Major surgery
        within 12 weeks before enrollment (excluding vascular access surgery) - Currently receiving
        antibiotic therapy for systemic infection - Known positive HIV antibody or positive
        hepatitis B surface antigen - Clinical evidence of current malignancy and/or receiving
        systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell
        carcinoma of the skin and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - Red blood cell (RBC)
        transfusions within 8 weeks before enrollment - Androgen therapy within 8 weeks before
        enrollment - Systemic hematologic disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic
        syndromes, hematologic malignancy, myeloma, hemolytic anemia) - Any disorder that may
        impact (in the judgment of the investigator) the ability to give informed consent for
        participation in this study - Pregnant or breast-feeding women - All subjects must practice
        adequate contraception (in the judgment of the investigator) throughout this trial -
        Treatment with an investigational agent or device within 30 days before enrollment or
        scheduled to receive an investigational agent other than those specified by this protocol
        during the course of this study
