  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of etanercept 50 mg twice weekly
      compared to placebo over 12 weeks on the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) in subjects
      with psoriasis. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of etanercept 50 mg
      twice weekly; determine the effect of etanercept 50 mg twice weekly on patient reported
      outcomes (PRO); and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of etanercept 50 mg twice
      weekly.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Active, but clinically stable, plaque psoriasis involving greater
        than or equal to 10% of the body surface area - A minimum PASI score of 10 obtained during
        the screening period Exclusion Criteria: - Active guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular
        psoriasis at the time of the screening visit - Evidence of skin conditions at the time of
        the screening visit (e.g., eczema) that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of
        an investigational product on psoriasis
