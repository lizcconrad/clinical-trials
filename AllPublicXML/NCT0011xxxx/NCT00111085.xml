  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of moderate or severe cerebral vasospasm, as measured by cerebral angiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 14</time_frame>
    <description>If the patient develops clinical or sonographic changes suggestive of vasospasm prior to or after Day 9 ± 2 and until Day 14 post-aneurysm rupture, an angiogram will be performed to confirm the vasospasm. If vasospasm is documented prior to Day 9 ± 2, the Day 9 ± 2 angiogram is no longer required. In the case that a patient only develops clinical symptoms suggestive of vasospasm later than Day 9 ± 2 and up to Day 14, an additional angiogram should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of vasospasm. If the latter shows a higher grade of vasospasm than the previous one, it will be used for comparison to the baseline angiogram for evaluation of the primary endpoint.</description>

             been already performed

          9. Written informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from the patient
             or a legal representative prior to initiation of any study-related procedure and
             enrollment

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with SAH due to other causes (e.g., trauma or rupture of fusiform or mycotic
