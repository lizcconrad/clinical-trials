    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see which of the two most common drugs used to treat
      bronchiolitis works better. A child's participation in this study is expected to last less
      than 4 hours. Approximately 600 patients will be recruited to participate in this study at
      Kern Medical Center (KMC).

      Bronchiolitis is a very common lung infection in babies. There are many drugs used to treat
      this disease but nobody knows which one, if any, works the best. Two of the most commonly
      used drugs are albuterol and epinephrine. These are both drugs given during breathing
      treatments with oxygen and a mask. We are doing this study to see which of these drugs works
      better or if they are both equally good. The study works as follows: after the consent
      process the baby gets three treatments.

        -  Nebulizer 1 (Treatment)

        -  Treatment + 30 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 2

        -  Treatment + 60 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 3

        -  Treatment + 120 minutes (approximately)

      The baby will be reevaluated and either discharged home or revert to standard therapy. If the
      baby is discharged directly from the emergency department (E.D.), we will call you in three
      days time to see how he/she is doing.

      Double blind RCT. Primary outcome measure is admission defined as actual admission or
      discharge with unscheduled return leading to admission within 72 hours. Secondary endpoints
      include change in severity of illness and response of respiratory parameters to treatment.
