    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with liver or renal dysfunction will be treated with rubitecan capsules to
      define the maximum tolerated dose and the dose-limiting toxicity in this patient population,
      and to perform pharmacokinetic studies of rubitecan in this patient population.
