      This study seeks to evaluate and document the processes of outreach consultation through
      joint-clinics via teleconferencing as an intervention for system improvement in care delivery
      and management of diabetes mellitus (DM) at a Community Based Outpatient Center (CBOCs).

      Background:

      Diabetes is a national problem that has reached epidemic proportions, according to the U.S.
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diabetes has particular importance for the
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) because the prevalence among VA patients -- one in six,
      or 16 percent -- is substantially higher than in the general population.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this study was to evaluate and document the processes of outreach
      consultation through the use of joint-clinics via teleconferencing as an intervention for
      system improvement in care delivery and management of diabetes at CBOCs. The intervention
      consisted of a teleconferenced joint-clinic consultation session involving the patient,
      Diabetes Specialist Team, the Primary Care Provider (PCP) and other relevant care team
      members. The impact of the 16-month intervention was assessed based on patients who were
      involved in the telemedicine clinic and those who were referred to a specialist to be seen
      on-site at the Cleveland VAMC.

      Methods:

      Study settings include the CBOCs affiliated with the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical
      Center (VAMC) and involve primary care referrals to see diabetes specialists at the Cleveland
      VAMC. Inclusion criteria patients(N 282)=included: (i) current prescription of insulin or an
      oral hypoglycemic agent; (ii) A1c &gt; 7.0%; or (iii) fasting glucose levels&gt; 130 mg/dl; and
      (iv) referred to see a consultant (beginning three months prior to the active intervention
      phase and continuing through enrollment for the last month of the active intervention phase).
      Patients with either Type l or Type II diabetes will be included. Patients referred will be
      contacted and asked to participate.

          <description>Designated CBOC's were involved in the intervention phase where their DM patients were asked to participate in a telemedicine visit.
The Behavioral: The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire given during this phase along with the Behavioral: Diabetes Empowerment Scale and the Behavioral: CBOC's undergo half-day joint-clinics via teleconference.
The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: A six question likert scale questionnaire regarding the patients treatment satisfaction. The responses range from very dissatisfied to very satisfied.
Diabetes Empowerment Scale: A twenty-eight question likert scale questionnaire regarding the patients attitude towards diabetes. The responses range from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
CBOC's undergo half-day joint-clinics via teleconference: A patient has Diabetes/Endo clinic visit via teleconferencing. A patient is at a CBOC and the Diabetes/Endo physician is at Wade Park.</description>
