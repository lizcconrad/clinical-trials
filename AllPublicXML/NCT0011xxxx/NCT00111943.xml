      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and acceptability of a vaginal
      microbicide in HIV uninfected sexually active women.

      Study hypothesis: The vaginal microbicide 1% tenofovir will be safe and well tolerated in HIV
      uninfected women who are in good general health.

      While the male condom is effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV, its use is
      hampered by deeply rooted cultural and social barriers. About half of all HIV infections
      worldwide occur in women, yet the only available female-controlled method of HIV prevention
      is the female condom. Alternative prevention tools, such as vaginal microbicides, are
      urgently needed to slow the rapid spread of heterosexual HIV infection.

      This study will last 24 weeks, with an additional 10 weeks of follow-up for participants with
      chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      four arms. Arm A participants will insert a vaginal tenofovir 1% gel two hours prior to
      vaginal intercourse for a maximum of two daily applications. Arm B participants will insert a
      vaginal placebo gel two hours prior to vaginal intercourse for a maximum of two daily
      applications. Arm C participants will insert a vaginal tenofovir 1% gel once daily at bedtime
      or during the longest period of daily rest. Arm D participants will insert a vaginal placebo
      gel once daily at bedtime or during the longest period of daily rest.

      A medical and menstrual history update, pregnancy test, HIV and sexually transmitted
      infections (STI) risk reduction counseling, and interview to assess behaviors toward vaginal
      gel use will occur during all study visits. HIV/STI counseling and testing, urinalysis, and
      blood collection will occur at study entry and at Week 24. Pelvic exam with colposcopy and
      vaginal swab collection will occur at study entry and Weeks 4, 12, and 24. For participants
      with chronic HBV, additional blood will be collected to monitor hepatitis B infection at
      study entry and Weeks 12, 24, 28, 32, and 36.
