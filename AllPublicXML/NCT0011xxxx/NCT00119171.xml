      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose regimen of Ispinesib in combination with
      capecitabine in patients with solid tumors. Ispinesib is dosed by 1-hour intravenous infusion
      every 3 weeks and capecitabine is dosed orally, twice a day for 14 days with a 1 week rest
      period. A patient may continue to receive treatment as long as they are benefiting from the
      treatment. Blood samples will be taken at specific times to measure the amount of both drugs
      in your body at specific times after the drug is given. Blood samples will also be taken for
      lab tests such as complete blood counts and clinical chemistries. Physical exams will be
      performed before each treatment with Ispinesib. During the treatment phase, the patients will
      undergo regular assessments for safety and clinical response.
