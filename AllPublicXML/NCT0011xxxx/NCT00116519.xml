      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The safety of the study medication and any side effects that might be associated with
           it;

        -  Whether the study medication can help patients with low levels of 'good' cholesterol
           (HDL-C) and high blood fats or triglycerides (TG);

        -  How much of the study medication should be given to patients;

        -  How the study medication compares to fenofibrate (Lofibra), a drug used for people with
           low levels of HDL-C and high levels of TG.
