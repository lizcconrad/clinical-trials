  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, most patients with advanced colorectal cancer continue to have a
      poor prognosis. 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab is a standard treatment option
      for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin
      are considered traditional chemotherapies that try to stop tumor growth by affecting how they
      divide. Bevacizumab is a therapy to try to block the blood vessels that tumors need to grow.
      It is considered a 'targeted agent'. Erlotinib is another targeted agent, that has been shown
      to be effective in treating lung and other cancers. This trial is assessing the potential
      benefit of adding these second targeted agents to standard treatment.

    <textblock>
      -  Patients receive bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU intravenously. The
           erlotinib is taken orally each day. One cycle of study therapy is 14 days. Cycles may be
           repeated unless there are intolerable side effects or the cancer worsens.

        -  Patients will undergo a tumor measurement evaluation following 3 cycles of study
           therapy, and then every 4 cycles thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients must have histologically or cytologically documented locally
             advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer

          -  No prior chemotherapy treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients
             may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation with radiosensitizing
             chemotherapy. The last course of adjuvant chemotherapy must have concluded &gt; 12 months
             prior to registration. Patients may not have previously received irinotecan,
             oxaliplatin, antiangiogenesis agent, or EGFR inhibitor therapy in either the adjuvant
             or metastatic setting. No concurrent use of additional investigational agents
             (including up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment) is allowed while participating in this
             study.

          -  Palliative radiation for metastatic disease is allowed, however at least 4 weeks must
             elapse from last treatment to first cycle of therapy and patient must have fully
             recovered from side effects of radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease

             from registration. Patients must have fully recovered from the procedure. (Insertion
             of a vascular access device is not considered major or minor surgery).
