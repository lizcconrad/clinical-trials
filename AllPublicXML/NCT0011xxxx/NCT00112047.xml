  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Study GS-01-934 was to assess the efficacy and safety of two simplified
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens in ART-naive, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1
      (HIV-1) infected participants. The primary objective of the study was to assess
      noninferiority of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF)
      in combination with efavirenz (EFV) relative to Combivir (CBV) in combination with EFV in the
      treatment of HIV-1 infected ART-naive participants, determined by the achievement and
      maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; 400 copies/mL (c/mL) through Week 48,
      as defined by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      time-to-loss-of-virologic-response (TLOVR) algorithm.

      This study was originally planned as a 48-week, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter
      study comparing EFV+FTC+TDF (administered as the individual component drugs) versus CBV
      (lamivudine/zidovudine) + EFV to assess the efficacy and safety of both treatments in
      ART-Naive, HIV-1 infected participants. The regimen of CBV (administered twice daily) + EFV
      (administered once daily) served as the active control treatment and was compared with the
      regimen of EFV+FTC+TDF; each component drug in the EFV+FTC+TDF regimen was administered once
      daily.

      Week 48 to Week 96:

      The study was extended and continued to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two regimens
      up to a total treatment duration of 96 weeks. The regimen of EFV+FTC+TDF continued to be
      dosed as the component drugs (EFV + FTC + TDF), once daily, without regard to meals. The
      regimen of CBV+EFV was dosed as 2 pills (CBV, twice daily in the morning without regard to
      meals) + EFV (once daily, without regard to meals).

      Week 96 to Week 144:

      A further study extension changed the 3-pill EFV+FTC+TDF regimen to a 2-pill regimen of EFV +
      Truvada ([TVD]: a fixed-dose combination pill containing FTC/TDF), once daily without regard
      to meals, and continued to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two regimens for a further
      48 weeks up to a total study treatment duration of 144 weeks. The regimen of CBV+EFV
      continued to be dosed as 2 pills (CBV, twice daily in the morning without regard to meals) +
      EFV (once daily, without regard to meals).

      Week 144 to end of study (Week 240):

      A final study extension provided all study participants from both treatment regimens the
      option to switch their respective treatments to the 1-pill regimen of for a further 96 weeks
      up to a total study duration of 240 weeks (5 years) to further assess the efficacy and safety
      of ART regimen simplification. At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48
      weeks (Year 6) or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once
      ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the
      full 288 weeks of the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at 70 study sites in the United States and Europe. The first participant was screened on 29 July 2003; the last participant was randomized on 16 January 2004; the last participant observation for the primary endpoint analysis was 11 February 2005; the last participant last visit for end of study analysis was 10 June 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 517 enrolled participants, 6 received no study drug (the safety analysis set was therefore 511 participants: 257 [efavirenz+emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group] and 254 [efavirenz+combivir group], respectively).</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>EFV+FTC+TDF</title>
          <description>Participants in this group received 3 component drugs: efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg + emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF) 300 mg, each once daily, from the start of the study. At 96 weeks Truvada ([TVD] the fixed-dose combination pill containing FTC/TDF (200 mg/300 mg) replaced FTC + TDF; participants continued to receive EFV as before. Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily could replace EFV in the event of efavirenz-associated central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.
At Week 144 all participants who opted to roll over into the further 96-week study extension received Atripla ([ATR]; the fixed dose combination pill containing EFV/FTC/TDF, 600 mg/200 mg/300 mg) until the end of the study (Week 240). At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48 weeks or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the full 288 weeks of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Loss of Virologic Response (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 c/mL) at Week 48</title>
        <description>TLOVR for participants who achieved a confirmed virologic response was the time to the earliest of: premature study regimen discontinuation or the first of 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL or last HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL followed by loss to follow-up. If the time to HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 c/mL was immediately preceded by missing scheduled visits then the time of virologic failure was replaced by the first such missing visit. Participants who had not achieved a confirmed virologic response before regimen discontinuation were considered “non-responders” on Study Day 1.</description>

At 96 weeks Truvada ([TVD] the fixed-dose combination pill containing FTC/TDF (200 mg/300 mg) replaced FTC + TDF; participants continued to receive EFV as before. Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily could replace EFV in the event of efavirenz-associated central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.
At Week 144 all participants who opted to roll over into the further 96-week study extension received Atripla ([ATR]; the fixed dose combination pill containing EFV/FTC/TDF, 600 mg/200 mg/300 mg) until the end of the study (Week 240). At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48 weeks or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the full 288 weeks of the study.</description>

Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily could replace EFV in the event of efavirenz-associated CNS toxicity.
At Week 144 all participants who opted to roll over into the additional 96-week study extension received ATR until the end of the study (Week 240). At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48 weeks or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the full 288 weeks of the study.</description>

            <description>Participants in this group were originally randomized to receive the 3 component drugs: efavirenz (EFV) + emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF) for 96 weeks, and subsequently received Truvada ([TVD] the fixed-dose combination pill containing FTC/TDF) and EFV until Week 144. Participants then rolled over into the further 96-week study extension and received Atripla ([ATR]; the fixed dose combination pill containing EFV/FTC/TDF) until the end of the study (Week 240). At sites in France, the study was extended by a further 48 weeks (Year 6) or until ATR became commercially available (whichever happened first); once ATR became commercially available in France participants were not required to complete the full 288 weeks of the study.</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (Satisfaction With Current Treatment Regimen to Control HIV): Change From Week 144 to Week 240 in the Category Shift From Atripla Baseline.</title>
        <description>Participants were asked: &quot;In general, how satisfied are you with the ability of your current treatment regimen to control your HIV infection?&quot; Possible responses were on a 4-category scale: &quot;very satisfied&quot;; &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;; &quot;somewhat dissatisfied&quot;; and &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;. For the evaluation of changes in treatment satisfaction from Week 144 (Atripla baseline) to Week 240 (Atripla Week 96) responses were dichotomized into &quot;very satisfied&quot; and &quot;not very satisfied&quot; (&quot;not very satisfied&quot; included &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;; &quot;somewhat dissatisfied&quot;; and &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;).</description>

        <description>The change from Week 144 (Atripla baseline) to Week 240 (Atripla Week 96) in the SF-12v2 Health Survey: Physical Component Summary (PCS). The SF-12v2 includes 8 concepts commonly represented in health surveys: physical functioning, role functioning physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role functioning emotional, and mental health. Results are expressed in terms of 2 composite scores: the PCS and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). PCS and MCS values can range from 0 to 100 and are designed to have a mean value of 50 and SD of 10 (in the general population).</description>
