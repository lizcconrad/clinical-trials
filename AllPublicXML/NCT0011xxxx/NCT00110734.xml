  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is pain associated with laser-assisted tattoo removal. For this reason, some form of
      anesthesia is commonly used to eliminate or minimize the pain. This anesthesia is usually a
      topical local anesthetic cream or ointment spread over the skin. The purpose of this study is
      to further estimate the effectiveness of S-Caine™ Peel (lidocaine 7% and tetracaine 7% cream)
      for treating pain during laser-assisted tattoo removal.
