  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Combretastatin A4 Phosphate (CA4P)
      combined with the chemotherapy drugs, carboplatin and paclitaxel. The full treatment and
      observation time should be about 5 months. During this time the patient should receive 18
      CA4P infusions and 6 carboplatin followed by paclitaxel treatments. Patients will be
      randomized into one of two CA4P dose-level groups in order to recommend a preferred
      dose-level for future studies. At least 2 dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance
      imaging (DCE-MRI) scans will be conducted to monitor the blood flow through the tumor before
      and after treatment with CA4P.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Combretastatin A4 Phosphate
      (CA4P) combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Treatment is for a maximum of 6 consecutive
      21-day cycles. Patients are randomized onto one of two CA4P dosing arms (45 or 63 mg/m2).
      CA4P is administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Carboplatin and paclitaxel (AUC 6 and
      200 mg/m2, respectively) are administered on day 2 of each cycle. At least 2 DCE-MRI scans
      will be performed to evaluate the change in tumor blood flow following treatment with CA4P.

    <description>Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate is administered IV at 45 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 followed by paclitaxel (3 hour infusion at 200 mg/m2) and carboplatin (1 hour infusion at AUC = 6) on Day 2 of each cycle. The treatment cycle is 21 days with a maximum of 21 days. Following cycle 6, subjects that have not progressed may continue on CA4P monotherapy, which will be administered at 45 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 with rest on Day 15, repeated every 21 days until disease progression.</description>
