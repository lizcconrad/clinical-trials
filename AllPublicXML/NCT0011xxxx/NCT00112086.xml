      A feasibility study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval cytoreductive
      surgery (ICS) and postoperative chemotherapy for stage III/IV mullerian carcinomas such as
      ovarian, tubal and peritoneal carcinomas.

      The purposes are to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment starting with NAC and to
      know whether we can accurately diagnose these advanced carcinomas by imaging studies,
      cytologic findings and tumor markers without staging laparotomy or laparoscopy. Fifty-six
      patients with advanced mullerian carcinomas will be recruited to the study. After
      confirmation of diagnosis by laparoscopic inspection and biopsies, patients undergo 4 cycles
      of chemotherapy as NAC followed by ICS and additional 4 cycles of postsurgical chemotherapy.
      The primary endpoint is proportion of clinical complete remission after accomplishment of the
      protocol treatment and the major secondary endpoint is positive predictive value of diagnosis
      before laparoscopy regarding tumor origin, histology and stage. Based on the result of this
      study, we will conduct a phase III study to compare the treatment starting with NAC and
      primary cytoreductive surgery followed by postsurgical chemotherapy.
