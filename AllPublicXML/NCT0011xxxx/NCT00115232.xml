      The purpose of this study is to evaluate levels of inflammatory mediators in children at risk
      for cardiovascular disease due to family history. We are measuring inflammatory markers in
      two groups of children and their parents: children with a family history of early
      atherosclerotic heart disease (cases), and healthy children without such a family history
      (controls). The design is a cross-sectional study, gathering a fasting blood sample and
      clinical and behavioral data on children and a parent.

      Family history is a well known risk factor for early atherosclerosis. Whether inflammation
      plays a role in the increased risk of family history is not known. In this prospective
      single-center study, we are recruiting children with and without a family history of
      premature atherosclerotic disease, defined as occurring &lt; 55 years in males and &lt;65 years in
      females. Children are recruited primarily from a pediatric preventive cardiology clinic at
      Children's Hospital Boston. We measure anthropomorphic characteristics, fasting lipid
      profiles and inflammatory marker levels, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin, and tumor necrosis factor
      alpha receptor 2 (TNFαR2).

      In this sample of high-risk overweight children, Lp(a) and inflammatory markers could reflect
      cardiovascular risk outside lipid profiles.
