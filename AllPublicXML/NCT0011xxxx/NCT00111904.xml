      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well paclitaxel works in treating patients with
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients with
           unresectable locally advanced or metastatic epithelial carcinoma of the pancreas treated
           with paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol^®-PM).

        -  Determine the best overall response rate and duration of response in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical benefit and safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol^®-PM) IV over 3 hours
      on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
