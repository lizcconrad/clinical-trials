  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 different treatment schedules of oral
      Xeloda with intravenous (IV) Eloxatin (oxaliplatin) and IV bevacizumab (Avastin) as a
      first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Patients were randomized to receive either: 1) Xeloda 850 mg/m^2 orally twice a day (po bid)
      on Days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, and Avastin 7.5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each
      3-week cycle; or 2) Xeloda 1500 mg/m^2 po bid on Days 1-7, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1
      and Avastin 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment
      was 1-2 years, and the target sample size was 100-500 individuals.

    <time_frame>Time to disease progression or death (through follow-up phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first occurrence of having documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Progression was based on tumor assessments made by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, for any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Through follow-up phase: Approximate Median of 318 days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was assessed according to RECIST (the best response recorded from the time of randomization to the first CR or PR. The patient's overall best response was complete response (CR), partial response (PR) (CR and PR considered &quot;responders&quot;), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). To be assigned a status of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), changes in tumor measurements were confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Clinical Response (CR or PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to Disease Progression or Death (through follow-up phase): Approximate Median of 302 days</time_frame>
    <description>Among tumor responders (i.e., patients with overall best response of CR or PR), duration of overall response was measured from the time criteria were first met for CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first) to the date of either recurrent/progressive disease was objectively documented or death from any cause.</description>
