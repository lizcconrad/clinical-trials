  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful therapy of both tuberculosis and HIV disease share similar problems: pill burden,
      drug interaction, adherence challenge and toxicity. This study will test the efficacy and
      safety of a once daily antiretroviral regimen in HIV-tuberculosis coinfected patients.

      The proposed research consists of conducting a pilot trial &quot;BKVIR&quot; designed to answer the
      question of whether once daily tenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz triple-agent therapy is
      effective and well tolerated when it must be initiated within three months after initiation
      of a three-agent or four-agent tuberculostatic therapy in antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected
      patients. As the proposed pilot trial comprises the initiation of antiretroviral therapy
      during the three months following the initiation of tuberculostatic therapy, we propose to
      set up systematic, continuous registration of HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of
      tuberculosis in participating centers during the study period in order to evaluate their
      eligibility for inclusion in the pilot trial. The initial declaration phase in the register,
      in addition to facilitating inclusions in the pilot trial, should also allow: 1) a better
      understanding of the reasons for non-inclusion in the trial, allowing the eligibility
      criteria to be adjusted if necessary during the trial; and 2) to describe the antiretroviral
      therapies used during co-infection and their time of initiation in relation to
      tuberculostatic therapy.

      This research is expected to contribute to an updating of the treatment guidelines in the
      context of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. The data collected will constitute a unique
      database on this issue not only in France, but also internationally, which will also be
      useful to optimize management strategies of these two diseases in developing countries.
