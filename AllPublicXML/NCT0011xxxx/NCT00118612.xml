  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats
      the underlying allergic disease. Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to tree pollen (hay fever).

      The purpose of this double-blind Phase IIb study is to assess the tolerability and
      immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and
      alder pollen.
