  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPu-infused
      liatermin (15mg/putamen/day) compared with placebo in subjects with symptomatic,
      levodopa-response Parkinson's disease. This study consisted of a 90-day evaluation period
      followed by implantation of the IPu delivery system and then a 6-month double-blind treatment
      period.
