  <brief_title>DART I - A Phase IV Study of 3 Antiretroviral Medicines in Combination, in HIV Patients Who Have Not Been Previously Treated With Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
  <official_title>Daily Antiretroviral Therapy (DART 1): An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Prospective, Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Didanosine Enteric Coated (Ddl-EC) in Combination With Lamivudine (3TC) and Efavirenz (EFV) Once Daily in Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Naive HIV-Infected Patients</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a therapy with an all once daily regimen of
      efavirenz (EFV), didanosine (ddI)-EC and lamivudine (3TC) leads to improved outcomes, as
      measured by viral load, CD4 counts, adherence, safety, and tolerability.
