  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this study is that nasally administered calcitonin will stabilize
      or improve bone mineral density in young patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
      Patients who participate will receive either calcitonin or placebo and will have their bone
      mineral density measured at the start, at nine months, and at 18 months of study.
      Participants will also receive age appropriate doses of vitamin D and calcium supplements.
      Other serological measures of vitamin D status will be obtained every 3 months during the
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an institutional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to
      compare the efficacy of intranasally administered calcitonin (plus oral supplements of
      age-appropriate doses of calcium and vitamin D) with that of placebo nasal spray (plus oral
      supplements of age-appropriate doses of calcium and vitamin D) in maintaining or improving
      bone mineral density. Study subjects will be 8 to 22 year old patients with the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and low bone mineral
      density defined as DXA z score lower than -1.0 SD. Study end-point will be at 18 months after
      the continuous administration of nasal calcitonin or placebo and supplements as above. Bone
      mineral density will be measured by dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the beginning
      of the study, and then at 9 and 18 months. The study subjects will be evaluated clinically
      and nutritionally at the beginning of the study, as well as every 3 months for the duration
      of the study. Laboratory values relevant to calcium homeostasis and bone turnover will be
      obtained every 3 months.
