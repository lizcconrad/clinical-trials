      The purpose of this study is to determine whether epratuzumab provides effective therapy in
      Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

    <textblock>
      This multi-center, single-arm study of epratuzumab is in patients with Waldenström's
      Macroglobulinemia (WM) who failed chemotherapy. After baseline evaluations, patients receive
      epratuzumab infused over approximately 30-60 minutes at 360 mg/m2, administered once weekly
      for 4 consecutive weeks (days 1, 8, 15, 22). Post-treatment evaluations occur on the day of
      the last infusion, then at 6 and 12 weeks. Patients without progression of disease continue
      long-term follow up until disease progression or for at least 5 years, with evaluations every
      3 months for 2 years, then semi-annually. Otherwise, follow-up is only required until
      resolution of any treatment related abnormalities.
