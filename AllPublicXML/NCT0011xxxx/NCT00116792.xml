  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the combination of the thin-strut MULTI-LINK (i.e. VISION(tm) and/or
      MINI-VISION(tm)) stent and pharmacologic therapy with the oral PPAR-gamma agonist
      rosiglitazone will significantly reduce restenosis after intracoronary stenting in type 2
      diabetic patients. This approach would present a more effective and economical alternative to
      the use of drug-eluting stents to reduce stent restenosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients must be &gt;18 years of age;

          -  Patients must be previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with documented treatment
             with insulin, oral hypoglycemics, or diet controlled by medical history. (Undocumented
             or newly diagnosed diabetics must fulfill the American Diabetes Association
             Criteria-Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of
             Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes Care 2003;26:S5-20)).

          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification
             (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C,
             I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          -  Treatment of lesions in native coronary arteries requiring stenting. A total of two
             separate lesions can be stented, located either in the same vessel (at least 10 mm or
             1 cm apart) or in two separate vessels. Additional stents may be used for procedural
             complications such as dissections.

          -  Patient is willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation;

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent prior to the procedure using a form that
             is approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

          -  Target lesion is ≥2.0 mm to ≤3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate);

          -  Individual lesions are ≤25 mm in length located in a native coronary artery;

          -  Target lesions are de novo lesions in native coronary vessels;

          -  Target lesion stenosis is ≥50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has experienced an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within the
             preceding 24 hours.

          -  Ejection fraction ≤40%; class III-IV CHF

          -  Active liver disease (ALT&gt;2.5 times upper limit of normal)

          -  Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 grade flow);

          -  Impaired renal function (creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL);

          -  Target lesion involves bifurcation including a side branch ≥2.5 mm in diameter (either
             stenosis of both main vessel and major branch or stenosis of just major branch) that
             would require side branch stenting which is likely to occur if side branch is diseased
             and intended to be stented;

          -  Previous brachytherapy of target vessel;

          -  Recipient of heart transplant;

          -  Patient with a life expectancy less than 12 months;

          -  Known allergies to cobalt, chromium, nickel, aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®)

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study;

          -  Any contraindication to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy;
