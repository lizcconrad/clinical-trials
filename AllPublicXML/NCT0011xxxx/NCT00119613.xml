  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing or maintaining hemoglobin
      concentrations with darbepoetin alfa, when administered with platinum-containing chemotherapy
      in subjects with previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
      increases survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven SCLC, extensive-stage

          -  Planned to receive chemotherapy of carboplatin or cisplatin plus etoposide every 3
             weeks for 6 cycles

             13g/dL

          -  Adequate renal, liver and hematopoietic function

          -  Subjects must sign and date a written Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics
             Committee-approved Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known primary hematologic disorder which could cause anemia

          -  Brain metastases that are either symptomatic or treated with medications

          -  Unstable or uncontrolled disease/condition, related to or affecting cardiac function

          -  Other known primary malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of
             curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma in situ cervical
             carcinoma or surgically cured malignancies

          -  Iron deficiency
