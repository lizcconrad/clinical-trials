  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multicenter trial comparing two
      oxaliplatin/Avastin-based treatment sequences as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal
      cancer. The study is designed to compare the efficacy of these two treatment sequences with
      respect to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

    <measure>To compare the efficacy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), of FOLFOX/Avastin followed by FOLFIRI/Avastin versus FOLFOX/Avastin followed by 5-FU/LV/Avastin as first-line therapy for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the tolerability of sequential treatment in subjects and to evaluate the safety of an irinotecan/Avastin-based regimen versus a 5-FU/Avastin regimen for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.</measure>
