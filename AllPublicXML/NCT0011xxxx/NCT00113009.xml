  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which
      subjects with intermittent claudication (IC) will be randomized to receive a single treatment
      of VLTS-934 (84 mL, or a total of 420 mg poloxamer 188) or placebo (84 mL saline)
      administered as 21 intramuscular (IM) injections of 2 mL each, bilaterally into the lower
      extremities during one procedure to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential activity
      of VLTS-934 as compared with a saline placebo.
