      The purpose of this study is to determine if an internet-based intervention will be effective
      in improving the lifestyle and weight of an obese employee population.

      The intervention will last 12 months, and includes a weight tracker, a food intake tracker,
      an activity tracker, a calorie balance tool, an electronic discussion board, and electronic
      greeting cards.

      The study will compare two groups over time, one of which will utilize the electronic tools,
      and one of which will not. The samples will be drawn from the employees of a metro-Milwaukee
      hospital, and will consist of obese (Body Mass Index, or BMI, of 30 or greater) employees
      only.

      The primary outcome will be change in weight over the study time period as measured by the
      BMI. Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, blood pressure, tests of blood
      sugar, cholesterol, presence of depression, lifestyle wellness score, health care costs and
      productivity.
