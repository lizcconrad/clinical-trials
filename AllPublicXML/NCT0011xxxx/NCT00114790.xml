  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an experimental radiation therapy technique which is
      based on the principle of irradiating boron atoms with neutrons. When neutrons have
      relatively low energy, boron atoms that have been targeted to cancerous tissue using a
      suitable boron carrier (an amino acid derivative called BPA, boronophenylalanine) will
      capture the neutrons. As a result from the neutron capture the boron atoms will split into
      two, producing helium and lithium ions. The helium and lithium ions, in turn, have only a
      short pathlength in tissue (about 5 micrometers) and will deposit their cell damaging effect
      mainly within the tumor provided that the boron carrier (BPA) has accumulated in the tumor.
      In practice, the study participants will receive BPA as an approximately 2-hour intravenous
      infusion, following which the tumor is irradiated with low energy (epithermal) neutrons
      obtained from a nuclear reactor at the BNCT facility. BNCT requires careful radiation dose
      planning, but neutron irradiation will last approximately only for one hour. In this study
      BNCT will be repeated, and the 2 treatments will be given 3 to 5 weeks apart. The study
      hypothesis is that head and neck cancers that have recurred following conventional
      radiotherapy might accumulate the boron carrier compound, and might respond to BNCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I to II
      trial to determine the value of BNCT in the treatment of inoperable, irradiated, locally
      advanced cancers of the head and neck region. An attempt to perform 18F-labeled
      boronophenylalanine (18F-BPA) SPECT or PET imaging will be made before BNCT. Patients whose
      tumor uptake is &gt;2.5 times that of the corresponding normal head and neck tissue will be
      enrolled, and treated with a single fraction BPA-based BNCT twice, 3 to 5 weeks apart.
      Another 18F-BPA SPECT or PET study may be performed 1 to 3 months after BNCT to determine the
      SPECT/PET response.

      The neutron irradiation site is the FiR 1 reactor site, located at Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland,
      about 6 kilometers from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, where patient
      evaluation and post-irradiation care will take place.

      Prior to BNCT, BPA is infused as a fructose complex (l-BPA-F) into a peripheral vein over 2
      hours. Blood samples will be taken for monitoring whole blood boron concentration before
      starting the BPA infusion, and thereafter at 20 to 40 minute intervals during the infusion,
      following infusion, and after delivering neutron irradiation. The blood samples will be
      analyzed for blood boron concentration to estimate the average blood boron concentration
      during neutron irradiation.

      All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
