  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Study was designed to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug,
      lapatinib, is in combination with paclitaxel in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      inflammatory breast cancer. Tumor tissue collected pre-treatment, following 14 days of
      treatment and at the time of surgical resection will be examined for pathologic response and
      biologic activity by IHC (immunohistochemistry) within the tumor. Treatment will consist of
      14 days of lapatinib monotherapy followed by 12 weeks of combination therapy with lapatinib
      and paclitaxel. Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels, MUGA/ECHO exams and
      physical exams will be performed throughout the study to monitor safety.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with pathologic complete response rate (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>pCR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an assessment of complete response (CR) following pathologic review of resected tissue. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. Participants in each cohort with unknown or missing response (i.e., those that did not undergo surgery) were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. From an efficacy standpoint, the HER2+ population response was considered to be of special interest.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with pCR that underwent surgical resection</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>pCR for participants that underwent surgical (surg) resection was defined as the percentage of participants within each cohort who achieved an assessment of CR following pathologic review of resected tissue. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. Participants in each cohort that did not undergo surgical resection were excluded from the denominator when calculating the percentage. From an efficacy standpoint, the HER2+ population response was considered to be of special interest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with objective response rate (ORR) at the end of study (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumor [RECIST])</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>ORR at the end of the study was defined as the number of participants within each cohort who had a confirmed CR or partial response (PR) at the end of the study divided by the total number of participants enrolled in each cohort. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum longest diameter. Each participant's response was based on the investigator assessment of best response using RECIST criteria. Participants in each cohort with unknown or missing response was treated as non-responders; i.e. they were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. From an efficacy standpoint, the HER2+ population was considered to be of special interest.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with ORR at the end of study ('Best' of RECIST and Clinically Evaluable Skin Disease Criteria)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>ORR at the end of the study was defined as the number of participants within each cohort who had a confirmed CR or PR at the end of the study divided by the total number of participants enrolled in each cohort. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum longest diameter. The best response of the participant was defined by the 'Best' combined response (RECIST and Clinically Evaluable Skin Disease Criteria) provided there is no evidence of disease progression. Participants in each cohort with unknown or missing response was treated as non-responders; i.e. they were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. From an efficacy standpoint, the HER2+ population was considered to be special interest.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with investigator-Assessed Best Response at the end of monotherapy phase (Day 14) (Clinically Evaluable Skin Disease Criteria)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>ORR at the end of the monotherapy phase was defined as the percentage of participants within each cohort who had a confirmed CR or PR at the end of lapatinib monotherapy (Day 14) divided by the total number of participants enrolled in each cohort. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum longest diameter. Each participant's response was based on the investigator assessment of best response using clinically evaluable skin disease criteria.

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14, surgical resection and post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, resulted in deterioration in left ventricular cardiac function and caused Grade 3 or 4 interstitial pneumonitis.</description>
