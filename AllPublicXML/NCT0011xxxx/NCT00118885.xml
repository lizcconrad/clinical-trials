    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi Chih versus Health Education
      on shingles immunity in older adults as measured by unstimulated and vaccine-stimulated
      responses. The secondary goal of the study is to determine the effects of Tai Chi Chih versus
      Health Education on measures of health functioning, depressive symptoms, and health behaviors
      in the elderly.

    <textblock>
      Shingles, also known as herpes zoster (HZ), is more common in older persons due to the
      weakening of the immune system with advancing age. Psychosocial stresses in the older adult
      also correlate with the decline in immunity. In addition, preliminary data indicate that the
      presence of depressive symptoms in older adults is associated with a decline in the response
      to varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccination. Taken together, the untoward effects of age and
      depressive symptoms on VZV immunity raise the question as to whether a behavioral
      intervention might augment VZV specific immunity in the older adult.

      Preliminary data has shown that administration of a relaxation-response based intervention,
      Tai Chi Chih (TCC), results in improvements in health functioning and VZV immunity in older
      adults as compared to a control group. TCC is a slow moving meditation comprised of twenty
      separate standardized movements for use in elderly populations. By standardization of
      training and practice schedules, TCC offers an important advantage over prior relaxation
      response based therapies. This controlled trial has 3 goals:

        1. determine whether the practice of TCC for 16 weeks influences unstimulated- and
           vaccine-stimulated VZV specific immunity in adults 60 years of age and older;

        2. demonstrate that TCC can produce significant changes in psychological adaptation, health
           behaviors, and health functioning and well-being;

        3. assess whether changes in psychological adaptation, health behaviors, and health
           functioning correlate with changes in VZV immunity following TCC in older adults.
