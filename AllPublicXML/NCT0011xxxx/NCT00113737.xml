      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The research was a treatment-matching study to test whether adding fluoxetine pharmacotherapy
      to behavioral cessation treatment improved the depression-prone smoker's ability to quit. The
      investigators randomized 144 smokers with a prior history of depression and 206 smokers who
      lack such a history to a double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo,
      while they underwent cognitive behavioral treatment to quit smoking. The main study outcome
      was biologically verified abstinence 6 months after treatment. The administration of placebo
      and fluoxetine began 3 weeks before the quit smoke date and continued for 2 months post-quit
      date (totaling 11 weeks on drug/placebo). Cognitive behavioral treatment were weekly before
      quitting and biweekly after quitting. There were monthly follow-up evaluations for six months
      after the quit date. The research tested both the Selective Benefit Hypothesis and the
      Generalized Benefit Hypothesis of fluoxetine's effects. The hypothesis of the mechanism of
      action was that the drug diminished compulsive smoking behavior, obsessional cigarette
      craving, and nicotine withdrawal dysphoria that occurred independently of depressive
      vulnerability.
