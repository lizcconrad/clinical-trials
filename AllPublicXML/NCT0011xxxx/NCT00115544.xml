  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of Stanate (stannsoporfin) in
      infants who are at risk for an exchange transfusion and meet the criteria of the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study evaluated the relationship between Stanate® dose, drug safety, and efficacy
      in a non randomised sequential open label cohort design, in 55 patients. Subjects were term
      and near term infants at medium or high risk of hyperbilirubinemia with TSB levels
      approaching the threshold for exchange transfusion. The first cohort began at a dose of
      stannsoporfin 0.75 mg/kg of birth weight intramuscularly. The dose was then increased to 1.5
      mg/kg for cohort 2, and saline was given (placebo) for cohort 3. Safety evaluations consisted
      of hepatic, renal and hematologic clinical laboratory tests along with serial physical
      examinations. Long term follow up of all patients to age 6 is planned.
