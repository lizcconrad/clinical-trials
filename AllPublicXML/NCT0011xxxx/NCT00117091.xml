    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of subjects in Australian clinical
      practice continuing treatment with Anakinra (Kineret®) at the end of study week 48 in
      subjects with active RA. The continued use of Kineret® will be based on pre-defined response
      assessment criteria for subjects with active RA.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects diagnosed with RA as determined by American College of
        Rheumatology (ACR) criteria with a disease duration of at least 24 weeks prior to
        enrollment - Active RA at screening as defined by EITHER: (1) At least 6 swollen joints
        (using a 66 joint count) and at least 6 tender joints (using a 68 joint count) OR (2) 4
        non-hand joints and at least 1 of the following: *Morning stiffness of at least 45 minutes;
        *CRP greater than 1.5 mg/dL (15.0 mg/L); *ESR greater than 28 mm/h; *DAS28 greater than 3.2
        - Subjects must have failed an adequate trial of at least 3 disease-modifying antirheumatic
        drugs (DMARDS) alone or in combination (one of which must be MTX) and have been on the same
        treatment and doses for 4 weeks prior to enrollment (i.e., an adequate trial is defined as
        12 weeks unless limited by toxicity or intolerance) - Subjects' doses of nonsteroidal
        antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral corticosteroids (less than or equal to 10 mg/day
        of prednisone or equivalent) must have been kept stable for 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Doses of 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent should not be exceeded during the study
        Exclusion Criteria: - ACR functional class IV or ARA anatomical stage IV - Subjects that
        are scheduled for surgery or being evaluated for surgery for hands, wrist and feet -
        Felty's syndrome - Any poorly controlled, clinically significant systemic disease (e.g.,
        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic renal
        failure, liver disease) - Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (e.g., diabetics with HbA1C
        greater than 8%, peripheral neuropathy, renal/retinal involvement, or vascular disorders) -
        Malignancy, other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix
        within the past 5 years - Abnormal chest x-ray that is clinically significant or
        bronchiectasis - Within 12 weeks before date of enrollment any of the following
        occurrences: presence of serious infection (e.g., requiring hospitalization and/or IV
        antibiotics), frequent, acute, or chronic infections - History of chronic infection -
        Recent history (within 24 weeks of enrollment) of drug or alcohol abuse - Known to be
        positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency
        virus - Presence of any condition that may compromise the ability of the subject to give
        informed consent - Planned events (e.g., planned hospitalizations, vacations, etc.) that
        would interfere with the collection of the required assessments and/or may prevent the
        subject from completing the study according to protocol - White cell count less than or
        equal to 3.5 x 10^9/L, a neutrophil count of less than or equal to 2.5 x 10^9/L, or
        platelet count of less than or equal to 125 x 10^9/L at screening - Hemoglobin less than or
        equal to 8.0 g/dL at screening - Elevated AST or ALT greater than or equal to 1.5 x the
        upper limit of normal at screening - Elevated serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5
        x the upper limit of normal at screening - Received intra-articular or systemic
        corticosteroid injections within 4 weeks before enrollment - Subjects who have received
        previous treatment with anti-IL-1ra or anti-TNF therapies (e.g., anakinra, etanercept or
        infliximab) within 4 weeks prior to enrollment - Subjects who are pregnant or
        breast-feeding, or plan to become pregnant during the course of the study - Subject (man or
        woman) is of child bearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive precautions -
        Known allergy to E. coli derived products - Receiving or has received any investigational
        drug within the previous 30 days or within 5 half-lives of any investigational drug,
        whichever is greater (or is currently using an investigational device)
