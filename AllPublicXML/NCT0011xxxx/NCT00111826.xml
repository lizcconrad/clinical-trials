      intermittent claudication.

      SIMPADICO was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled
      553 patients with claudication at 50 sites in Canada and the United States. The mean (±SD)
      patient age was 67±10 years; 72% were males. The duration of claudication was 6.0±6.1 years
      at entry; 91% had a history of smoking and 34% were current smokers; 36.5% had diabetes.
      Resting ABI was 0.59+0.14; baseline ICD was 132±104 and ACD 307±209 meters. Results showed
      that there was no increase in ACD or ICD at 26 weeks with immune modulation therapy (IMT
      using the Celacade™ system, Vasogen Inc.) compared to placebo and no measurable improvement
      in quality of life with IMT compared to placebo. However, there was a significant decrease in
      CRP (high sensitivity assay) in) in the IMT group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion:
      Immune modulation therapy did not improve walking distance in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral arterial disease but the decrease in CRP suggests a biologic effect of IMT and
      will warrant further study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage II) due to peripheral arterial
             disease, which has been stable (both clinically and therapeutically) for 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) in at least one limb ≤ 0.85. For diabetics with
             falsely elevated ABI due to non-compressible tibial arteries, the toe brachial index
             (TBI) will be measured and has to be ≤ 0.7 at rest.

          -  An absolute claudication distance (ACD) of≥ 50 meters confirmed on two consecutive
             visits at least one week apart. The change in ACD between the two consecutive
             assessments (i.e. Visit 0 and 1 or Visit 1 and 2) has to be within ± 20%.

          -  Walking distance must be limited by IC, which will be confirmed by a ≥ 20% decrease in
             ABI in the worse claudicating limb immediately following the screening treadmill
             tests. The worse claudicating limb (or &quot;index leg&quot;) will be defined either as (1) the
             most symptomatic leg or (2) the leg with the lowest resting ABI and documented prior
             to the first (pre-screening) treadmill test. Post-exercise and resting ABIs will be
             compared within the same leg at each screening treadmill test. This criterion will not
             apply to diabetics with non-compressible tibial arteries (i.e. only the resting TBI
             will be measured in these patients).

          -  Age ≥40 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential not using accepted
             contraceptive methods, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history or physical examination
             at the screening assessment that would interfere with the objectives of the study or
             that would, in the investigator's opinion, preclude safe completion of the study.
             Abnormal findings could include: hepatitis, HIV infection, AIDS, other immune
             deficiency syndromes, serious active infections, gastrointestinal tract bleeding or
             any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury.

          -  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) defined as ischemic rest pain, ulcerative lesions or
             gangrene [Rutherford-Becker Classification Grade II-III (corresponding to Fontaine
             stage III-IV)].

          -  Previous endovascular or surgical revascularization within 6 months prior to study
             entry or anticipated during the first 6 months of the study.

          -  Active inflammatory vascular disease (e.g. Buerger's disease).

          -  Major peripheral neuropathies, including severe diabetic neuropathy to the extent that
             it may interfere with the evaluation of claudication.

          -  Any condition that limits walking ability, other than claudication (e.g. arthritis,
             angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], etc.)

          -  Malignancy within five years prior to screening. Basal cell carcinoma, provided that
             it is neither infiltrating nor sclerosing, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix are
             exemptions.

          -  Organ transplant recipients.

          -  Allergy to sodium citrate, or any &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic.

          -  Systemic corticosteroids, antineoplastics and immunosuppressive drug therapy (e.g.
             cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), DNA depleting or
             cytotoxic drugs taken within 4 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Currently taking medications indicated for intermittent claudication (i.e.
             pentoxifylline or cilostazol). To be eligible, patient must not have taken these
             medications for at least 8 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Participation in another study involving an investigational or licensed drug or device
             in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment or during this study.

          -  Previous Celacade™ treatment.

          -  Any other medical, social, or geographical factor, which would make it unlikely that
             the patient will comply with study procedures (e.g. alcohol abuse, lack of permanent
             residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, and a history of
             non-compliance).
