  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a minimally invasive
      surgical procedure in up to 160 implanted female patients in which two adjustable balloons
      (one on each side of the urethra) are implanted to treat urinary stress incontinence.

      The results will be analyzed to demonstrate the effects of the device as well as its
      associated risks. Therapeutic success will be based on whether the patients demonstrate at
      least a one-grade (mean) reduction in the Stamey score at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non randomized clinical trial comparing baseline data to
      the 12 month data. Urodynamic testing, pad weights and a direct visual stress test will be
      used to determine success along with the Stamey score.
