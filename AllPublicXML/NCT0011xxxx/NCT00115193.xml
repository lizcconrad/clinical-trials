  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide data on the safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim when
      administered on the same day versus the next day of chemotherapy, as measured by the duration
      of grade 4 neutropenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase 2 study of pegfilgrastim given either
      the same day as or the day after a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (R-CHOP).

      Chemotherapy was administered every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in subjects with aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; mantle cell or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Subjects were
      administered R-CHOP on day 1 of each cycle. All subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms: arm A subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 1 of each cycle (within 4
      hours of chemotherapy completion); arm B subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day
      2 of each cycle (at least 24 hours after chemotherapy completion). All subjects were
      administered placebo on the day they did not receive pegfilgrastim. A total of 77 subjects
      were enrolled at 24 centers across the US. Protocol treatment duration for subjects was up to
      18 weeks (6 three-week cycles).
