  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intramuscular
      injections (to the buttocks or to the shoulders) of paliperidone palmitate in patients with
      schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, all prior trials involving intramuscular injection of paliperidone palmitate were
      conducted with buttock administration. This is a randomized, multicenter, crossover design
      study in evaluating safety and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate in two different
      injection sites. The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference in safety and
      tolerability between buttock injection compared to shoulder injection at any of the three
      different doses of paliperidone palmitate. The patients will receive intramuscular injections
      of paliperidone palmitate in either their buttocks or in their shoulders
