      The study's primary objective is to determine whether the PRSS improves the optimal timing of
      photocoagulation in diabetic patients in VA. Secondary objectives include assessing if the
      program: (1) leads to improved compliance with retinopathy screening and surveillance visits;
      (2) improves patient and provider satisfaction with VA diabetic eye care; (3) reduces eye
      care visit rates among diabetics receiving eye care at VA; (4) decreases health care resource
      utilization; and (5) improves the cost-effectiveness of eye care for patients with diabetes

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common cause of blindness and much of this blindness is preventable by early
      detection and treatment. Although VA and HEDIS quality criteria now allow some individuals
      with diabetes to have biannual examinations, current diabetes eye care policies continue to
      emphasize routine, annual eye exams for most diabetes patients. Strong evidence suggests that
      the current �one-size fits all� method wastes resources while ignoring an opportunity to
      substantially improve outcomes for high-risk patients.

      Recent research shows that patients referred for screening examinations (i.e., those without
      retinopathy) require different follow-up then those referred for surveillance examinations
      (i.e., those with retinopathy). Using a more targeted, risk-based criteria for scheduling eye
      examinations together with system level interventions designed to assure their application
      may lead to improved healthcare outcomes. Although, the efficacy of such approaches have been
      demonstrated in other systems and organizational research, it has not yet been demonstrated
      for diabetes eye care.

      Therefore, we propose to conduct and evaluate a prototype translational research project
      examining the impact of the Proactive Diabetes Eye Care Program, a coordinated and targeted
      system-level intervention, on: 1) the optimal timing of photocoagulation; 2) the optimal
      timing of eye care visits; 3) patient and provider satisfaction; 4) health care resource use;
      and 5) the overall cost-effectiveness of a targeted eye care program.

      The primary intervention will involve the use of an innovative �Progressive Reminder and
      Scheduling System� in which intensity of the reminders is based on the patient�s degree of
      risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or macular edema. At the intervention
      sites, there will be separate clinics for screening (those whose last examination was normal)
      and surveillance (those with known retinopathy). This two-year prototype translational
      project will have a quasi-experimental design. Six facilities will be recruited: three will
      receive the intervention without the system design components. The control and intervention
      sites will be matched for comparability to baseline screening rates and similar patient
      populations. The intervention will be evaluated using historical controls (pre-post analyses)
      and by comparison to control sites.

      Data will be collected from three sources. We will use the VISTA database to determine
      resource use, patients demographics, co-morbidities and medications. Trained medical
      personnel will conduct chart reviews on a random sample of patients undergoing
      photocoagulation to determine whether it was sub-optimally timed (i.e., the patient already
      had a major retinal hemorrhage or advanced macular edema at the time of the procedure). A
      random sample of patients will be surveyed, at baseline and after 12 months, about non-VA eye
      care services they received and their attitudes and satisfaction toward eye care. We will
      also survey health care providers regarding diabetic eye care services.

      If successful, this program will serve as a model for disseminating diabetes eye care best
      practices throughout the VA system and could provide further information about the best
      approaches to managing other diseases in which patients may benefit from risk stratification
      rather than being treated according to a single standard.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The population for the project will be all diabetic patients treated at the three VAMCs
        selected as intervention sites. Therefore, patient recruitment is not required for
        participation in the initial implementation activities nor in assessing compliance with
        recommendation for eye examination and treatment. Although the scheduling system will be
        redesigned and the clinical guidelines will be used to inform eye care clinical
        decision-making, the final decision about whom should receive diabetes eye care and at what
        interval will continue to be left to the best clinical judgment of the health care
        professionals and their patients at each study site. Nothing in this study will preclude a
        patient and their physician from seeking eye care more frequently or less frequently than
        recommended by the guidelines. In one regard, this study could be thought of as a study of
        usual care under two different management and organizational systems without any direct
        patient-level intervention.

        For data analysis purposes, there will be two sets of inclusion criteria ? EPRP visit
        criteria and diabetes identification criteria. To be included in the primary data analyses
        a patient must meet the criteria of the Office of Quality &amp; Performances quality monitoring
        program. This criteria includes at least one outpatient visit during the current fiscal
        year and at least one outpatient visit in the fiscal year prior to the current year (see
        http://vaww.oqp.med.va.gov/oqp_services/performance_measurement/tech_man.asp). The previous
        and current qualifying visits must be in any one of 8 clinics (Primary Care (301), General
        Medicine (323), Cardiology (303), Endocrinology/Metabolism (305), Diabetes (306),
        Hypertension (309), Pulmonary/Chest (312), or Women's Health (322)) per the West Virginia's
        Peer Review Organization's External Peer Review Program (EPRP) selection criteria. Eligible
        patients would be excluded if they had a life expectancy of 6 months or less (e.g.,
        diagnosis of pancreatic cancer or in hospice). For epidemiological comparability, separate
        cohorts will be constructed for evaluating eye care at the beginning of the study period
        (for the pre-intervention analyses) and at end of the study period (for the
        post-intervention analyses). We will identify diabetics (for analytic purposes) by
        requiring them to meet one of the following criteria in the previous year: 1) one or more
        prescriptions filled for hypoglycemic medications or self-monitoring blood glucose supplies
        (as determined by VISTA records), 2) having a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9 250.x) recorded
        in at least 2 separate outpatient encounters, or 3) having a diagnosis of diabetes recorded
        for one or more inpatient stays.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        None if patient meets inclusion criteria
