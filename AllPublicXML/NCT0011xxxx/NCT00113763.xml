  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that panitumumab, using the proposed regimen, will
      safely increase progression free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who
      have failed available treatment options (i.e., patients who developed progressive disease or
      relapsed while on or after prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy).

    <measure>Progression-free Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to the data cut-off date of 30 June 2005. The median follow-up time was 20.0 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 18.2 weeks in the BSC alone group.</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time from randomization to either death or first observed disease progression, whichever occurred first. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Progressive disease defined as least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the data cut-off date for overall survival of 15 March 2006. The median actual follow-up time was 30 weeks for the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31 weeks for the BSC alone group.</time_frame>

    <measure>Objective Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time was 29.6 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 31.8 weeks in the BSC alone group.</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number of participants with a confirmed complete or partial tumor response, confirmed by a scan no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): disappearance of all target lesions, and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD, with no progressive disease of non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to date of first observed progression of disease or death due to progression of disease (whichever comes first) for those participants with a best response of stable disease. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference the nadir longest diameter since the treatment started, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions.</description>

Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Progressive disease defined as least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <description>Defined as the number of participants with a confirmed complete or partial tumor response, confirmed by a scan no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. Partial Response (PR): disappearance of all target lesions, and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD, with no progressive disease of non-target lesions.</description>

        <description>Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time from randomization to either death or first observed disease progression among participants with wild-type Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Oncogene (KRAS) status. Participants were evaluated for tumor response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) based on the response assessment from a blinded review of radiographic scans by the Independent Review Committee. Progressive disease defined as least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization until the data cutoff of 15 March 2007. The median follow-up time in patients with wild-type KRAS was 36.8 weeks in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 35.7 weeks in the BSC alone group.</time_frame>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
