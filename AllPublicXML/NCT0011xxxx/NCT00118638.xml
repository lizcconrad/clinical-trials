  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa as 500ug once every
      3 weeks to show that the dose and schedule are not inferior to darbepoetin alfa administered
      as 2.25ug/kg once per week in the treatment of anemia in subjects with non-myeloid
      malignancies.
