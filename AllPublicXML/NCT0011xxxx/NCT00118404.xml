      This study determined the effectiveness of continuation phase cognitive therapy versus
      antidepressant medication in preventing relapse of depression in people with recurrent
      depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive therapy (CT) is a short-term talking therapy that focuses on changing negative
      thinking patterns and helping patients develop coping skills to deal with their experiences.
      Evidence suggests that CT is effective in treating a number of psychiatric conditions,
      including anxiety and anger. This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive therapy
      versus antidepressant medication or placebo in preventing relapse of depression in people
      with recurrent depression.

      This study lasted approximately 36 months and comprised three phases. For the first 12 weeks,
      all participants received between 16 and 20 CT sessions. Participants were then randomly
      assigned to receive additional CT sessions, antidepressants, or placebo for an additional 8
      months. Upon completing treatment, participants entered follow-up study visits once every 4
      months for the next 24 months. Clinician-rated scales and questionnaires were used to assess
      depressive symptoms of participants at study start and at the end of each study phase.

LIFE-PSR Scale:

= Mild symptoms
= Considerably less psychopathology than full criteria with no more than moderate impairment
= Does not meet full criteria but has major symptoms of impairment
= Meets criteria without extreme impairment in functioning
= Meets criteria with extreme impairment in functioning
