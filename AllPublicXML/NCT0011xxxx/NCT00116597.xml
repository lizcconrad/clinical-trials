  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess intranodal immunotherapy in locally advanced to
      metastatic melanoma patients (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stages IIb to IV).

      For this, the investigators capitalize on their previous melanoma clinical trial (published
      by Zajac P et al in Human Gene Ther 2003) and take advantage of a proprietary recombinant
      vaccinia virus (replication inactivated) expressing 5 minigenes: 3 melanoma associated
      antigens and 2 costimulatory molecules. Immunization with the recombinant vaccinia virus is
      followed by 3 boosts with soluble, synthetic melanoma associated antigens.

      The patients are immunized intranodally (groin lymph node) under ultrasonographic guidance in
      an outpatient clinic. The protocol foresees 2 cycles of immunotherapy for alternate weeks and
      lasts 15 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The investigators have conducted a phase I/II clinical trial based on the intradermal
      administration to stage III/IV melanoma patients of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding
      tumor associated antigens and costimulatory epitopes for the priming of immune responses,
      followed by boosts with corresponding synthetic peptides (Zajac P et al in Human Gene Ther
      2003). Specific cytotoxic T cells could be induced in a majority of patients following
      priming, but sustained responsiveness could not be maintained by peptide boosting on a long
      term basis. Emerging evidence supports the notion that expansion of specific T cells requires
      trafficking of antigen presenting cells loaded with specific determinants to lymphatic nodes,
      as induced, among others, by pro-inflammatory stimuli. Therefore, we now adopt the intranodal
      injection of the immunogenic formulations. As for the former melanoma active specific
      immunotherapy trial, GM-CSF is used as a supporting cytokine. The epitopes considered are
      expressed, either all or some of them, in over 90% of the melanomas in Western countries;
      namely, we immunize with Mart-1/Melan-A epitope 27-35, Gp-100 epitope 280-288 and tyrosinase
      epitope 1-9. As a consequence, HLA-A2 positivity is mandatory for inclusion in the trial. The
      2 costimulatory molecules expressed by cells infected with our replication-incompetent
      recombinant vaccinia virus are B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86).
