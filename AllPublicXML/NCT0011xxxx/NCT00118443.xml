      This study will determine whether a training program designed to help school staff members
      identify adolescents at risk for suicide will increase the number of students who are
      referred to mental health services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of suicide among adolescents has significantly increased in recent years.
      Psychiatric disorders are often associated with increased suicide risk; therefore, the
      ability to identify adolescents with signs of depression and other psychiatric conditions is
      clear. This study will determine the effectiveness of a suicide prevention training program
      called Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) in increasing the number of potentially suicidal
      adolescents who are referred to mental health services. The training is designed to help
      school staff recognize signs that a student may be suicidal, provide tips on how to question
      students about any suicidal thoughts they may have, and provide techniques to persuade
      students to seek suicide prevention help.

      School staff will be randomly assigned to either receive QPR training for 2 years starting
      immediately or be placed on a waiting list for later training. The rates of referral to the
      school district's prevention/intervention centers will be used to assess the effectiveness of
      QPR training. In addition, the impact of QPR training on school staff members' knowledge and
      attitudes about intervening with at-risk students will be assessed through surveys at four
      time points over the 2-year study duration with a randomly selected portion of staff in the
      32 participating schools. Surveys completed by randomly selected 8th and 10th grade students
      will also be used to determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing suicidal
      thoughts or attempts.

      Study hypothesis: More students in schools that have Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR)-trained
      staff will be referred for a mental health evaluation than in schools without QPR-trained
      staff.
