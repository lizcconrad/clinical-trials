      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as MDX-010, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well MDX-010 works in treating patients with
      stage IV pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine clinical response (partial and complete responses) in patients with
           unresectable stage IV (locally or distantly metastatic) pancreatic adenocarcinoma
           treated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody
           (MDX-010).

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether observed responses correlate with the incidence of autoimmunity in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to status of disease
      (locally vs distantly metastatic).

      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody
      (MDX-010) IV over 90 minutes on days 0, 21, 42, and 63. Treatment repeats every 84 days for
      up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      disease progression after achieving a partial response or complete response receive 2
      additional courses of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42-82 patients (21-41 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-4 years.
