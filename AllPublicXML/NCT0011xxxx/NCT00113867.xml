      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of marked alterations in ovarian steroid
      hormones on cognitive functions in women. Sex hormones and stress hormones of women awaiting
      or undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be compared with levels of women adopting
      children and women on oral contraceptives.

    <textblock>
      Much of our understanding of the effects of ovarian steroid hormones on cognitive functioning
      comes from studies of changes in cognitive function associated with hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women and changes in menstrual cycle phase in premenopausal
      women. If fluctuations in ovarian sex steroid hormone levels across the normal physiological
      range affect cognitive functions in women, then marked alterations in hormone levels should
      have a notable effect on cognitive function.

      Hormonal in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments for female infertility result in dramatic
      fluctuations in estrogen levels. Women awaiting infertility treatment report negative
      emotions, depressed mood, declines in memory and concentration, and higher levels of reported
      stress compared to women who have never experienced infertility.

      Four groups of twenty women each will be recruited for this observational study:

        -  Group 1 - IVF treatment with GnRH-a alone

        -  Group 2 - IVF treatment with GnRH-a plus sex steroid stimulating hormones

        -  Group 3 - ADPT control (women in the process of adopting children)

        -  Group 4 - OC (oral contraceptives) control

      All groups will receive a cognitive/affect assessment twice, with a 3-week interval between
      assessments. Blood and salivary samples will be taken on the two test days to measure ovarian
      sex steroid hormone levels and stress hormone levels. Salivary samples will also be taken on
      a third day in between the two test days. Heart Period Variability (HPV), a measure of
      cardiac functioning, will be measured using electrocardiogram (ECG).
