      Study Aims:

        -  To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of imiquimod versus vehicle used as an
           adjunct to cryotherapy.

        -  To assess and compare the recurrence rate and time to recurrence of the 2 different
           treatment groups.

      Hypothesis: The imiquimod arm will produce a more prolonged clearing of Actinic Keratoses
      (AK) compared to the vehicle arm.
