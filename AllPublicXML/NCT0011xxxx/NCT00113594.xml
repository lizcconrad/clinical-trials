      The purpose of this study is to characterize olanzapine pharmacokinetics: the inter- and
      intra- subject variabilities of olanzapine pharmacokinetics; and the potential influence of
      patient factors such as age, weight, gender, origin, and smoking status on olanzapine
      pharmacokinetics in adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. This study will
      also assess the safety of olanzapine delivered orally.
