  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effectiveness and safety of a new nasal spray for the relief of the
      symptoms of seasonal allergies. The agents being compared are: R926112 (a novel anti-allergy
      medicine), Beconase (beclomethasone dipropionate, an established FDA approved steroid
      treatment), and an inactive placebo. The study hypothesis is that R926112 will be superior to
      placebo at the end of a week of testing and evaluation. The study does not have the power to
      determine how R926112 compares to Beconase.

    <textblock>
      Seven hundred fifty patients with histories of seasonal allergies will be screened in late
      summer and early fall at 25 sites across the U.S. Approximately 375 patients, based on
      severity of symptoms will be randomized among the treatments (150 to R926112, 150 to placebo,
      75 to Beconase). During, and for about 2-3 weeks prior to the study, patients will have to
      abstain from other anti-allergy medications. Patients will fill out diary cards two times per
      day to record their symptoms. The entire study should take between 2-4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must sign a written informed consent form and assent (if applicable) for
             study participation.

          -  Males and females, 12 years of age or older

          -  Subjects must have a history consistent with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) during
             the fall pollen season for at least the previous 2 years.

          -  Subjects must be skin test positive to a relevant fall aeroallergen within the past 12
             months with at least a moderate reaction as defined by at least a 5 mm wheal.

          -  Nasal exam to exclude significant swelling, bleeding, crusting, or polyps

          -  Subjects receiving immunotherapy must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least
             30 days before screening. Adjustments to the regimen following a brief period of
             missed injections or the normal reduction in dose due to a vaccine refill does not
             preclude participation.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative urine tests for pregnancy
             at Visits 1 and 2.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active will be expected to
             use a medically recognized birth control method throughout the study: systemic
             contraceptive (oral, implant, injection, patch), diaphragm with intravaginal
             spermicide, cervical cap, vaginal ring, intrauterine device, or condom with
             spermicide. Females who are not sexually active will be admitted by the discretion of
             the Investigator. Acceptable birth control will be documented in the subjectâ€™s case
             report form.

          -  Subjects must be willing to adhere to dosing schedules, study visits, and study
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant medical conditions (such as hepatic, neurological,
             hematological, renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or other major systemic
             disease), which in the judgment of the Investigator, might interfere with the study,
             require treatment or make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the
             study results difficult.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory results or electrocardiogram (ECG) as
             determined by the investigator

          -  Asthma that requires treatment other than with inhaled, short acting beta agonist
             alone.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or nursing.

          -  Nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps or marked septal
             deviation that significantly interfere with nasal airflow or nasal surgery within the
             past year.

          -  Upper respiratory infection within 3 weeks before the date of Randomization/Visit 2.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the last 30 days before the date of
             Randomization/Visit 2.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse that according to the Investigator could interfere
             with the study.

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study.

          -  Subjects unlikely to comply with study procedures, unable to return for study visits,
             or unlikely to complete the study, or expecting or planning to travel outside the area
             of the prevalent aeroallergen during the study period.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to steroids or to the excipients.

          -  Use of tricyclic antidepressants within the past 30 days prior to date of
             Randomization/Visit 2.

          -  Ocular herpes simplex or cataracts present at the time of Screening Visit.
