    <textblock>
      Some people with nasal allergy symptoms continue to have symptoms even after treatment with a
      nasal steroid spray. The purpose of this study is to see if these patients are helped by
      adding another medication (montelukast) to their treatment compared to placebo (a substance
      that looks like the active medication but does not contain the drug).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians frequently prescribe an oral H1 antihistamine for allergic rhinitis patients with
      residual symptoms after taking an intranasal steroid. Surprisingly, the only studies
      investigating this combination of drugs have failed to show added efficacy of the H1 receptor
      over the intranasal steroids alone. Adding montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, to
      an intranasal steroid has not been studied in a placebo controlled fashion. Wilson and
      colleagues, in an open study of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, showed a benefit of
      adding montelukast.

      The investigators would like to recruit perennially allergic subjects and place them on
      fluticasone for 2 weeks. Those subjects with residual symptoms would then be randomized to
      receive either placebo or montelukast in addition to continuing the fluticasone for an
      additional 2 weeks.

      A positive study would support clinical practice and would serve as a preemptive strike
      against managed care plans that would not allow prescriptions for both drugs.

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of montelukast to treatment of a perennially allergic subject with an intranasal
      steroid is more effective at relieving symptoms than a placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Over 2 Week Randomized Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded the severity of sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and other symptoms (itchy nose/eyes and post-nasal drip) twice a day on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The TNSS was calculated as the sum of all scores for morning and evening recordings with a range of 0 to 24.
The baseline TNSS used in the analysis was the average of the symptom scores from the last 5 days of fluticasone propionate therapy prior to randomized treatment period.
The change from baseline for each subsequent day of treatment was then calculated for each subject. So that each subject only had one observation, the average of these changes was calculated for each subject, and this summary measure was used in the analysis comparing the two treatment groups. We report the median and full range of these average changes for each group.
A negative value indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Over 2 Week Randomized Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Patients recorded the severity of sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and other symptoms (itchy nose/eyes and post-nasal drip) twice a day on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The TNSS was calculated as the sum of all scores for morning and evening recordings with a range of 0 to 24.
The baseline TNSS used in the analysis was the average of the symptom scores from the last 5 days of fluticasone propionate therapy prior to randomized treatment period.
The change from baseline for each subsequent day of treatment was then calculated for each subject. So that each subject only had one observation, the average of these changes was calculated for each subject, and this summary measure was used in the analysis comparing the two treatment groups. We report the median and full range of these average changes for each group.
A negative value indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Runny Nose Symptom Score Over 2 Week Randomized Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Patients recorded the severity of runny nose twice a day on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The runny nose symptom score was calculated as the sum of all scores for morning and evening recordings with a range of 0 to 6.
The baseline symptom score used in the analysis was the average of the symptom scores from the last 5 days of fluticasone propionate therapy prior to randomized treatment period.
The change from baseline for each subsequent day of treatment was then calculated for each subject. So that each subject only had one observation, the average of these changes was calculated for each subject, and this summary measure was used in the analysis comparing the two treatment groups. We report the median and full range of these average changes for each group.
A negative value indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>
