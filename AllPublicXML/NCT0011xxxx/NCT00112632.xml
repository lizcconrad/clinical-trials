      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving imatinib mesylate before surgery may shrink the tumor
      so that it can be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating
      patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine radiographic objective response rates in patients with locally advanced
           gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate.

        -  Determine histological response in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine R0-resectability and organ-preserving resectability in these patients after
           treatment with this drug.

        -  Correlate radiographic imaging and metabolic imaging with histological response in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily for 4-6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-3 weeks after completion of imatinib
      mesylate, patients with responding or stable disease undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks, 6 months, and then at
      1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
