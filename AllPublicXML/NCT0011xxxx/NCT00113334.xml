  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this clinical research study are to see how individuals with advanced head and
      neck cancer respond to treatment with the new drug thrombospondin (ABT-510) and to learn how
      effective it is in destroying cancer cells. The safety of ABT-510 and the effect ABT-510 has
      on cells in the body will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II, single-center, open-label study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and biologic efficacy of ABT-510 (thrombospondin).
      Participants will be patients with incurable head and neck cancer.

      Patients will begin at a fixed dose level of thrombospondin subcutaneously twice daily.
      Cycles of treatment are 28 days (4 weeks). Patients will be treated with thrombospondin until
      progression of tumor or toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that is
             not amenable to curative therapy, including radiation or surgery (including surgery
             following induction chemotherapy or chemo-radiation).

          -  Patient's tumor is biopsy accessible.

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status &gt;/= 70.

          -  Patient has adequate bone marrow function: White blood count (WBC) &gt;/= 3,000
             cells/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500 cells/mm3, platelet count &gt;/=
             100,000 cells/mm3, Hgb &gt;/= 9.0 g/dL.

          -  Patient has adequate liver function: total bilirubin level &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dL, albumin &gt;/=
             2.5 g/dL.

          -  Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be up to 2.5 * upper limit of normal (ULN) if
             alkaline phosphatase is &lt;/= ULN, or alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if
             transaminases are &lt;/= ULN. However, patients who have both transaminase elevation &gt;
             1.5 * ULN and alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 * ULN are not eligible for this study.

          -  Patient has serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Patient has signed a written informed consent.

             events of bleeding.

             for catheter prophylaxis will be permitted; PT/PTT must be within normal limits.

          -  The patient has a history of or currently exhibits central nervous system (CNS)
             metastasis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 28 days of enrollment is
