  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study explored primary and secondary prophylaxis treatment with
      a single, fixed-dose, subcutaneous (SC) injection of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects with
      high-risk breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The primary objective was to
      provide preliminary information on the incidence of protocol defined neutropenic events in
      chemotherapy cycle 1.

        Inclusion Criteria: - High-risk, stage II-III breast cancer suitable for treatment with up
        to 6 cycles of FEC-100 - Chemotherapy - Histologically proven greater than or equal to 1
        axillary nodes positive - Oestrogen receptor negative or positive - Chemotherapy naïve -
        VES 13 (Vulnerable Elders Survey) score less than or equal to 3 - ECOG performance status
        less than or equal to 2 - ANC greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L - Platelets greater
        than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L - Adequate renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.5 x
        upper limit of normal (ULN)) - Before any study specific procedure the subject must give
        written informed consent for participation in the study Exclusion Criteria: - Total serum
        bilirubin greater than ULN according to institutional standard - Clinically significant
        cardiac disease that would preclude the use of epirubicin (e.g., LVEF (left ventricular
        ejection fraction)) less than 45% at rest by MUGA or echocardiogram - Prior bone marrow or
        stem cell transplantation - Any premalignant myeloid condition or any malignancy with
        myeloid characteristics (e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes, acute or chronic myelogenous
        leukaemia) - History of prior malignancy other than breast cancer with the exception of
        curatively treated basal cell carcinoma, in situ cervical carcinoma or surgically cured
        malignancies - Prior radiation therapy - Active infection or administration of systemic
        antibiotics or anti-infectives within 72 hours before start of chemotherapy - Known
        hypersensitivity to E coli-derived products (e.g., Filgrastim, HUMULIN®, Insulin,
        L-Asparaginase, HUMATROPE®, Growth Hormone, INTRON A®) - Previous exposure to pegfilgrastim
        or previous entry into this study - Known HIV infection - Inability to understand the
        nature of the study and provide written informed consent - Subject currently enrolled in
        another investigational device or drug trial(s) or has received other investigational
        agent(s), with the exception of placebo-treated subjects, within the last 30 days -
        Concerns for subject's compliance with the protocol procedures
