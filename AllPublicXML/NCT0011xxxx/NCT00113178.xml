  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of right atrial
      intra-cardiac lesions created by transvenous catheter cryoablation in patients with atrial
      flutter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation of arrhythmias has become an accepted alternative to pharmacologic therapy.
      Cryoablation is a newer alternative to radiofrequency ablations. This study expands the prior
      pilot experience with the CryoCor™ Cardiac Cryoablation System to a larger cohort of patients
      with atrial flutter.
