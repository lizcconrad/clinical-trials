  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining a short course of
           chemotherapy (Fludarabine, Mitoxantrone and Rituximab) followed by Zevalin will be
           effective in treating relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  The secondary purposes of the study are to determine the safety and to evaluate whether
           there is additional benefit from Zevalin therapy following the chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients receive fludarabine (days 1-3), mitoxantrone (day 1), and rituximab (day 1) of
           each 28-day cycle.

        -  Patients undergo a CT scan and bone marrow biopsy after two cycles. Unless the cancer
           has progressed, the patient will then receive Zevalin study treatment.

        -  Blood counts are taken every week for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, a CT scan and bone
           marrow biopsy are performed.

        -  Long-term followup is 4 years. Physical exam and blood work is performed every 3 months
           for the first two years. Following that, physical exams and blood work is every 6 months
           for another two years. CT scans and bone marrow biopsies are every 6 months during this
           4 year followup period.

    <description>After two cycles if there is no disease progression, zevalin treatment will be given. Rituximab will be given followed by an imaging dose of zevalin. Two or three scans will be performed over a week to determine if it is safe to give the full treatment dose of zevalin. The treatment dose is given with the second infusion or rituximab, seven days after the first dose.</description>
