  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal conditions account for the third leading cause of health systems expenditure
      in Australia. Patellofemoral pain syndrome or pain about the knee cap is such a condition
      often treated in primary care. Both the individual and community are affected by this
      condition with an estimated 1 in 4 sufferers having problems and pain up to 20 years after
      first being afflicted. Importantly, it interferes with activities such as walking, jogging,
      gym classes and aerobics, which are often prescribed to prevent serious conditions of the
      heart, diabetes and obesity. Hence, it negatively impacts the health and well being of our
      nation.

      Two popular treatment options that are commonly prescribed for the management of
      patellofemoral pain syndrome are physiotherapy and foot orthotics. To date, there is some
      evidence supporting physiotherapy, especially current best practice methods, such as a
      combined program of therapeutic exercise, manual therapy and kneecap taping. There is a lack
      of evidence for the use of orthotics in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome.

      This project will conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the relative benefits of
      orthotics as the sole treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome and also when combined with
      physiotherapy. Factors associated with predicting the results of orthotic therapy will be
      studied to see if there are any tests that a health care practitioner can perform to provide
      information early on in a consultation regarding possible treatment outcomes. A cost-benefit
      analysis will also be conducted to calculate the relative economic merits of the treatments.

      A tangible outcome of this project will be the development of clinical guidelines for the
      most effective method of treating patellofemoral pain syndrome in primary health care.
