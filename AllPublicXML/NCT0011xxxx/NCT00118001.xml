      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of worry exposure with the effects of
      applied relaxation in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled treatment studies show that there is a lower efficacy of cognitive-behavioral
      treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) than in other anxiety disorders. The best
      effect sizes are found for applied relaxation (Öst), but there are only three treatment
      studies. Another, yet previously not tested in its pure form, approach is &quot;worry-exposure&quot;,
      which aims at confronting the emotionally intensive imaginative contents of worries in GAD.

      Fifty-two randomized patients with GAD as a primary diagnosis will be treated with one of the
      two treatments and will be compared with waiting-list patients. This treatment protocol
      contains 15 sessions (+/-2) and a 6 month and 12 month follow-up.

      The comparisons in this study include: worry exposure versus applied relaxation versus a
      waiting control group.
