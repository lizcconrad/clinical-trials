      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of participation in the Association of
      Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) mailing lists on chronic disease management for cancer
      patients, we are focusing on several priority areas. These include factors that influence the
      use of online interventions over time and the effects of patient-provider interactions on the
      use of eHealth interventions (as well as vice versa). We also are breaking new ground in a
      number of important methodological areas related to online survey research.

      Our specific aims are:

        1. Conduct a qualitative analysis of a 10% sample of messages (approximately 5,200)
           obtained over 5 months from 9 ACOR lists to develop a comprehensive set of potential
           chronic disease management outcomes and a fuller understanding of the issues and themes
           that characterize list participation. The content analysis will identify important
           themes and issues in the messages. These themes and issues will help in survey
           refinement and ground our proposed quantitative survey questionnaire items. Survey
           analyses will also be enriched by the qualitative data. Finally, the qualitative
           analysis will stand as an independent body of work.

        2. Conduct a web-based survey of at least 1,680 new ACOR mailing list patient members and
           approximately 1,680 non-patient subscribers to assess the positive and negative effects
           of participation in ACOR lists at one month and four months after joining the list and
           completing a baseline survey.

        3. Disseminate study findings to ACOR leadership, participants and the larger online
           community.

        4. Develop a plan to convert the findings into training, recommendations, tools and
           policies to improve list processes. We aim to answer real world, practical questions
           using methodology that is at once rigorous, practical and ethical. The components are
           inter-related and complementary.

      Abstract:

      Internet-based health applications can have powerful positive health effects (e.g. IOM, 2002:
      Eng et al., 2000; Gustafson et al., 2000). Research has focused on Internet users as
      consumers of information, not how they interact with one another, providing advice,
      consolation, encouragement and pointers to resources. There has been little evaluation of
      health-related mailing lists, email-based applications that connect millions of people, many
      with chronic diseases, with one another. The Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR)
      has teamed with The University of North Carolina (UNC) to assess the impact of participation
      on patients, survivors and others (including caregivers) in 15 cancer-related mailing lists
      managed by ACOR (www.acor.org). We are conducting a multi-method evaluation with several
      elements. In the qualitative component, we are conducting a content analysis of a subset of
      threaded discussions from archived mailing list pages to identify a comprehensive set of
      themes and key outcomes. This information will provide a richer understanding of mailing list
      processes and also will provide checks and balances on the quantitative survey. We also are
      evaluating the impact of being a subscriber to ACOR mailing lists on a range of outcomes by
      following a cohort of new subscribers for 4 months from sign-up (minimum n=1680). Baseline,
      one and four month web-based surveys (with telephone as an option for those who cannot do web
      surveys) will be administered to consenting subscribers. We also are surveying ongoing
      subscribers who are patients and caregivers (minimum n=1680). We will disseminate findings to
      several key audiences, including listowners and members as well as to a broader audience.

      Project Aims:

        1. Develop a comprehensive set of potential chronic disease management outcomes and a
           fuller understanding of the issues and themes that characterize mailing list
           participation.

        2. Assess the effects of participation in ACOR mailing lists one month and four months
           after joining mailing lists and completing baseline surveys for new subscribers and
           through one-time surveys to ongoing subscribers and caregivers.

        3. Disseminate study findings to ACOR leadership, participants and the larger online
           community.

      Qualitative Component:

      The main goal of the qualitative component is to systematically identify themes about cancer
      disease management and cancer mailing list support group experiences and to use that
      knowledge to develop a more refined understanding of mailing list use. The analyses also
      include:

        -  Participation patterns within and across mailing lists over time;

        -  Mailing list group processes, the nature of online group social support, and the role of
           mailing listowners in providing and helping group members support each other; and

        -  Emergent themes not previously noted in cancer-related stress and online group behavior
           and communication research.

      Eligibility Criteria:

      Eligibility is based on joining one of 15 ACOR mailing lists over a 1 ½ year accrual period.
      We defined eligible persons as:

        -  New patient/survivor subscribers aged 18 and over, have had cancer, and joined a
           participating mailing list within the past 10 days; or

        -  Ongoing patient/survivor subscribers aged 18 and over, have had cancer, and have been a
           member of a participating list for more than 10 days; or

        -  Caregiver subscribers aged 18 and over and care for a cancer patient or survivor in any
           capacity (actively or passively).
