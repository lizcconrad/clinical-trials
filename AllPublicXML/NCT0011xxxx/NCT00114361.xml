  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether in patients with chronic HBeAg-negative
      hepatitis B, PEG-IFN-ribavirin combination therapy for 1 year leads to enhanced response (HBV
      DNA &lt;10E4 copies/ml and normal ALT 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation) in comparison
      with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the introduction of newer drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, there is
      still no optimal treatment. Pegylated interferon alfa has proven sustained efficacy in
      approximately 30-40% of patients with HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.
      It is likely that combination therapy of pegylated interferon alfa with ribavirin in chronic
      hepatitis B is more effective than pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy. In chronic
      hepatitis C, adding ribavirin to pegylated interferon therapy doubled the sustained response
      rate (29% vs. 56%) and has become the standard option of treatment.

      To investigate the effect of the treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin on the
      amount of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, a liver biopsy will be performed within one
      year prior to screening and at the end of follow-up.

      When patients with chronic hepatitis B are treated outside any study with pegylated
      interferon, they visit the outpatient clinic approximately every month for blood samples. So
      in this study the amount of blood samples taken from every patient is not increased as
      compared with treatment outside a study.
