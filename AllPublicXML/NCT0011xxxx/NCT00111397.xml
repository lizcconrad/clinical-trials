    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are ubiquitous organisms that cause isolated pulmonary
      disease in otherwise healthy patients with yet undefined susceptibilities. Patients typically
      present with a history of chronic cough, eventually progressing to hemoptysis, fever, and
      hypoxia. With half or more of all patients failing standard three-drug therapy, this is an
      insidious disease with a poor prognosis. Under the natural history protocol of nontuberculous
      mycobacterial infection (NTM; #01-I-0202), 46 patients with diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease
      are being studied. Numerous studies have suggested that a dysregulation in cytokine
      production may make these patients susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Cytokines are
      particularly important in the activaction of macrophages, which help to clear mycobacterial
      infection. Interferon gamma 1b (Actimmune) and GM-CSF (Leukine) are two cytokine therapies
      that have been approved in the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and
      post-transplantation hematopoietic reconstitution, respectively. A number of in vitro studies
      suggest that either or both of these therapies may help to clear MAC infection. Given the
      poor outcomes of therapy and the persistent, debilitating nature of the disease, new
      therapies are desperately needed, and many are being tried without benefit of scientific
      foundation. Currently, there are no prospective trials that show any effect of these drugs in
      the lung delivered subcutaneously. This protocol proposes to perform a pilot study to
      evaluate the effects, if any, of these macrophage stimulating cytokines in the context of
      ongoing pulmonary MAC infection.

      Aims:

      To determine the local and systemic effect, if any, of adjuvant IFN gamma and GM-CSF in
      pulmonary MAC patients.

      Methods:

      Fifteen patients will be randomized into three treatment groups of five patients each. The
      first group will receive a standard drug regimen, based on the 1997 ATS guidelines. The
      second and third groups, in addition to receiving the standard therapy, will also receive
      three months of (IFN{gamma}) and GM-CSF, respectively. All patients will undergo bronchoscopy
      with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the beginning of the study, after three months, and at
      six months.

      In addition to obtaining traditional subjective and objective clinical measures, both
      proteomic and genomic analysis of the BAL will be performed to determine if cytokine therapy

      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and other pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (P-NTM) are
      ubiquitous organisms that cause isolated pulmonary disease in otherwise healthy patients with
      yet undefined susceptibilities. Patients typically present with a history of chronic cough,
      eventually progressing to hemoptysis, fever, and hypoxia. With half or more of all patients
      failing standard three-drug therapy, this is an insidious disease with a poor prognosis.
      Under the natural history protocol of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM;
      #01-I-0202), 46 patients with diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease, 20 patients with M. abscessus
      disease, and 14 with other types of mycobacteria (M. fortuitum, M. massiliense, M.
      mucogenicum and M. chelonae) are being studied.

      Numerous studies have suggested that a dysregulation in cytokine production may make these
      patients susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Cytokines are particularly important in the
      activation of macrophages, which help to clear mycobacterial infection. Interferon gamma 1b

      proteomic and genomic analysis of the BAL will be performed to determine if cytokine therapy
      effects any detectable change in the lungs, In vitro studies on type II alveolar macrophages
      culled from these patients before and after cytokine therapy will also be performed.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for this protocol, a patient must meet the following five criteria:

        Diagnosed with M. avium complex (MAC) lung disease or other pulmonary mycobacterial
        infection based on the 1997 version of American Thoracic Society (ATS) diagnostic criteria
        and have positive AFB smear or culture for mycobacterial infection at least three months
        prior to the date of enrollment. Patients with only histological evidence of mycobacterial
        infection without positive smear or culture will not qualify for this protocol even if they
        meet the ATS diagnostic criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection.

        A patient must have radiographic evidence on high resolution computerized tomography of
        changes that are consistent with pulmonary mycobacterial infection. These include, but are
        not limited to: multiple small nodules (less than 5 mm), and cylindrical bronchiectasis.

        The patient must be on a treatment regimen based on ATS guidelines that has been stable for
        at least three months. By stable, we mean that the patient has been tolerating the regimen
        without any significant adverse reactions, and that no new agents have been begun in the
        last three months.

        The patient must be female and can be post-menopausal (either through natural menopause or
        surgical removal of her ovaries) or menstruating. If the patient is still menstruating and
        randomized to a study group receiving a cytokine she must agree to monthly pregnancy
        testing, while on study, as well as to utilizing a barrier type of contraception or
        abstinence. She must not be under 40 years of age at the time of enrollment in the study.

        The patient must be enrolled in protocol # 01-I-0202 (&quot;Natural History, Genetics,
        Phenotype, and Treatment of Non-Tuberculoid Mycobacterial Infections&quot;).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with pulmonary MAC disease who do not meet the above entry criteria.

          2. Clinically significant reactive airway disease that does not respond to
             bronchodilators.

        Patients with the following laboratory abnormalities:

          1. creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL

          2. Hemoglobin less than 9 mg/dL

          3. WBC less than 3,000

          4. Platelets less than 150,000

          5. ALT greater than 82 U/L, or AST greater than 78 U/L.

          6. Bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL

          7. Alkaline phosphates greater than 232 U/L

        Patients with a preexisting allergy or history of allergic reactions to study or protocol
        medications. These include, but are not necessarily limited to: IFN-gamma, GM-CSF,
        azithromycin/ clarithromycin, ethambutol, rifampin/ rifabutin, anesthetic agents employed
        in bronchoscopy, or any yeast-derived products.

        Patients who are either currently smoking, or have a previous history of smoking that
        exceeds 20 pack years.

        Patients with prior treatment with either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF within the last three months.

        Patients with known history of cardiac, endocrine, neurologic or other medical conditions
        that the principal investigator deems dangerous or unsuitable for enrollment will be
        excluded.

        Patients who are either pregnant or lactating. Also, menstruating patients who are
        randomized to a study group receiving a cytokine and refuse to use appropriate barrier
        forms of contraception or abstinence during this trial be excluded.

        Patients who, at any time during this trial, have an active lung infection caused by either
        Staphylococcus or a gram negative rod are excluded from this trial until this infection has
        been successfully treated.

        Patients that need to use supplemental oxygen.

        Patients who have a Forced Vital Capacity less than 40% predicted.

        Patients who are unable to walk and participate in the 6MWT.
