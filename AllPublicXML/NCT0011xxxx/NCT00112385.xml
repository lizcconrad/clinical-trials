  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain preliminary data regarding the safety and tolerability
      of etanercept in DM. In addition, we will use the study to assess the variability,
      reliability, and responsiveness of the core set of outcome measures recommended by IMACS. The
      study will be performed under the aegis of the Muscle Study Group (MSG), consisting of
      experienced investigators with an avid interest in myopathies. The ultimate goal of this
      pilot study will be to obtain necessary, prerequisite information important in designing
      future therapeutic trials of etanercept and other agents in patients with DM. The specific
      aims of the study are:

      Aim 1: To preliminarily assess the safety and tolerability of etanercept in patients with DM.

      Aim 2: To assess the safety and tolerability of prednisone in the dosing schedule we propose
      to use.

      Aim 3: To evaluate outcome measures recommended by IMACS and assess their variability,
      reliability, and responsiveness in order to facilitate the design of future therapeutic
      trials in the inflammatory myopathies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis (DM) is one of the major subtypes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.
      Prednisone is the initial treatment of choice in most patients with DM. However, because of
      the high rate of patients with disabling weakness despite treatment with prednisone, the
      long-term side effects of prednisone, and the many side effects associated with other
      second-line immunosuppressive agents (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine), better treatment
      options are needed. There is evidence that tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) plays a role in
      the pathogenesis of DM. Thus, etanercept, which blocks TNF-a, is a logical drug to assess in
      DM. Etanercept has been associated with a number of side effects including an increased risk
      of infection, inducing other autoimmune diseases, and perhaps cancer. These risks may be
      further enhanced in DM in which the frequency of other autoimmune disorders (e.g., connective
      tissue disease) and malignancy are already increased.

      The goal of this pilot study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of etanercept in
      DM.We will perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of etanercept in 40
      patients with DM randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive etanercept or placebo. All newly
      diagnosed and untreated patients will be started on a standard dose of prednisone and
      tapering schedule. Refractory patients who have been or are currently being treated with
      prednisone, IVIG, or methotrexate can also participate. Subjects will be followed for 1 year
      and we will assess various outcome variables recommended by the The International Myositis
      Assessment Clinical Study Group (IMACS). The primary aim of the study is to preliminarily
      assess the safety and tolerability of etanercept in patients with DM. We hypothesize that
      etanercept will be safe and well tolerated in this population. The second aim is to assess
      the safety and tolerability of prednisone in the dosing schedule we propose to use. We
      hypothesize that most patients will be able to tolerate the reduction of the prednisone
      dosage but most will not be able to be completely weaned off the medication. We believe we
      will find a relationship between prednisone dosage and its related side effects. The third
      aim of the study is to assess the variability, reliability, and responsiveness of the outcome
      measures recommended by IMACS using this pilot study of etanercept as the vehicle. The
      information gained from this study is necessary in order to design larger therapeutic trials
      of etanercept and other drugs in dermatomyositis.

          1. Meet the diagnostic criteria for DM (a-c; a,b,d; or a,c,d)

               1. Subjects must have symmetric proximal greater than distal weakness

               2. Characteristic DM rash consisting of any or all of the following: heliotrope,
                  shawl sign, V-sign, Gottron's sign, Gottron's papules, periungual telangiectasias

               3. Laboratory evidence of myopathy with at least one of the following: an elevated
                  serum CK or aldolase level, myositis-specific antibody, electromyography (EMG)
                  demonstrating myopathic features (e.g., muscle membrane instability, myopathic
                  units, or early recruitment), or an abnormal skeletal muscle MRI showing diffuse
                  or patchy edema within the muscles.

               4. A muscle biopsy will be optional if the patient fulfills criteria a-c. The
                  subject must demonstrate symmetric proximal weakness (criteria a) for entry into
                  the study. If the subject does not have a definite rash (criteria b) or
                  laboratory evidence of a myopathy (criteria c), a muscle biopsy will be required.
                  The muscle biopsy must demonstrate one of the following: perifascicular atrophy,
                  expression of MHC 1 on perifascicular muscle fibers, MAC deposition on small
                  blood vessels, tubuloreticular inclusions in endothelial cells on EM, or MXA
                  expression on muscle fibers of blood vessels

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>153 patients were screened and we enrolled and randomized 16 subjects (F 10, M 6) from until February 2006 to May 2009. Of these, 5 were new DM patients and 11 were refractory dermatomyositis patients.
Etanercept: 11 subjects (New 3, Refractory 8) Placebo: 5 subjects (New 2, Refractory 3)</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Most patient were initially ineligible because they were not new dermatomyositis patients.
Due to slow recruitment, we modified the protocol. We allowed enrollment of refractory dermatomyositis patients receiving prednisone for greater than 2 months. These subjects could also receive second line agents, as long as they were on a stable dose.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Occurrence of at Least One Adverse Event</title>
        <description>Adverse events (AEs) were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE). The grade of &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; matches with the descriptions from the CTCAE dictionary.

        <title>Change in the Average Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) Score From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The Manual Muscle Test (MMT) assesses 26 muscle groups. The muscle strength of each muscle group is graded. The score for each muscle group ranges from 0 (No contraction palpable) to 5 (normal strength). The minimum total MMT score is a 0. The maximum total MMT score is a 130.
The average change in the average Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)from Baseline to Week 52 was calculated. The average score is composed of 26 muscle groups that were tested. The average change was determined by subtracting the Baseline test results from the Week 52 results (Week 52- Baseline).</description>

        <title>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)was completed by subjects to assess the affects of their illness on the ability to function in daily life. The HAQ consists of 8 sections. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do).The 8 scores of the 8 sections are summed and divided by 8. A higher score indicates more impairment.
The average change was determined by subtracting the Baseline test results from the Week 52 results (Week 52- Baseline).
This measure was also collected as part of the study protocol at Week 12, 24, 32 and 40.</description>

        <title>Average Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The subject's systolic blood pressure was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The average value was calculated per treatment group for the Baseline and Week 52 visit based on treatment group. The average change was determined by subtracting the average value Baseline Visit (Week 0) results from the Week 52 results (Week 52- Baseline (Week 0)).
This measure was also collected as part of the study protocol at the Screening visit and Week 4,8,12,16,20,24,32 and 40.</description>

        <title>Frequency of Subjects With Treatment Emergent, Clinically Significant, Abnormal Gamma-glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT) Laboratory Values From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>The site investigators used the reference ranges provided by the lab that completed the testing of the sample to determine if the value was abnormal. If a value was abnormal, the site investigator would determine if the value was clinically significant or not.
A subject was considered to have a treatment emergent, clinically significant GGT value if during the course of the study, they had at least one clinically significant GGT result that was not present at baseline. Subjects had GGT labs drawn at Screening, Baseline (Week0), Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 52.</description>
