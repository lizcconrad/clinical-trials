  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will examine the efficacy of lithium in providing symptomatic relief from the
      withdrawal discomfort experienced by some dependent users of cannabis on cessation of regular
      use. Significant withdrawal may be a barrier to achieving abstinence in some clients and can
      be associated with marked disturbances in mood, sleep, hostility and aggression. Relief from
      such symptoms may be important in helping some clients achieve a period of abstinence and
      facilitate subsequent entry into a relapse prevention program.

      There are currently no accepted pharmacotherapies for the management of cannabis withdrawal.
      A recent study by Cui et al (2001) investigated the effects and mechanism of lithium on
      cannabinoid withdrawal in rats. The researchers found that lithium administration prevented
      the development of withdrawal symptoms, and suggested that increased oxytocin secretion
      resulting from lithium dosing prevented the withdrawal syndrome from occurring. Although
      caution should be exercised in generalising the results of an animal study, preliminary
      results of a small pilot study in humans are consistent with the potential utility of lithium
      in the management of human cannabis withdrawal (Zhang, personal communication). Furthermore,
      human use of lithium is well established and the addition of a readily available drug such as
      lithium carbonate would be a useful clinical tool should it prove efficacious in a series of
      clinical trials.
