      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Botulinum A toxin is effective in the
      treatment of tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis).

    <textblock>
      Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a common cause of chronic elbow pain and wrist
      extensor dysfunction in adults, affecting 1% to 3% of the general population per year.

      There is currently no consensus on its optimal treatment with wide-ranging options available.
      The best available scientific evidence suggests that only topical non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and possibly, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be
      useful for short term pain relief, while corticosteroid injections presented both benefits
      and harms as a short term measure.

      Botulinum toxin has been reported in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis with promising
      results but these studies lack a control group bringing up the question whether recovery was
      a result of intervention or the natural history of the disease.

      Method:

      A twin-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which all
      patients received either a botulinum injection or a placebo saline injection.

      Consecutive patients over 18 years old with tennis elbow referred to the outpatient clinic at
      the investigatorsâ€™ institution will be screened for this study. Eligible patients will be
      invited to participate in the study.
