  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin and irinotecan together with
      bevacizumab works in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of small
      cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving cisplatin and irinotecan
      together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer
      treated with cisplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab who live longer than 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate of patients treated with cisplatin, irinotecan and
      bevacizumab.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin, irinotecan and
      bevacizumab.

      III. To determine the association between VEGF/KDR complex expression and VEGF plasma levels
      and tumor response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
