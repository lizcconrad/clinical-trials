      This is a 1-year follow-up study to evaluate the long-term effects in subjects who completely
      cleared their actinic keratosis (AK) lesions in the 1473-IMIQ study. The 1473-IMIQ study
      evaluated the safety and effectiveness of imiquimod 5% cream compared to a placebo cream for
      the treatment of AK.
