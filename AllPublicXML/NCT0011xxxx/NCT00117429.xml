      This study will test the safety and immunogenicity of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine
      candidate in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection successfully treated with HAART. The
      rationale for this study is based on previous scientific experiments, including data
      indicating that this vaccine can elicit strong HIV-1-specific T cell immune responses in
      humans and monkeys and lead to a retardation of HIV-1 disease progression in animal models of
      HIV-1 infection.

      The HIV vaccine to be administered during this study consists of three recombinant HIV clade
      B viral antigens: the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and two regulatory proteins, Nef and
      Tat.The antigens are formulated in a proprietary adjuvant, AS02A, comprised of two
      immunostimulants in an oil-in-water emulsion (gp120/NefTat/AS02A). The vaccine and the
      adjuvant are manufactured and provided for the study by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,
      Rixensart, Belgium. The drugs will be given by intramuscular (IM) injection at a standard
      dose of 20 mg together with 0.5 ml of the AS02A adjuvant.

      Twenty HIV-1 infected individuals will be randomly enrolled into three different study
      groups, receiving either the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine (10 individuals), the AS02A adjuvant
      alone (5 individuals) or a placebo (5 individuals). After obtaining informed consent,
      subjects will have a history and physical exam performed and have laboratory tests to confirm
      they meet all inclusion and exclusion entry criteria. Women of childbearing potential will
      have a pregnancy test prior to each injection of the investigational product. Injections with
      vaccine, adjuvant alone, or placebo will then be performed at weeks 0, 4, and 12. Study
      participants will undergo close monitoring after each vaccination. Blood samples will be
      obtained for immunological assays at study baseline (2 times) and weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 24,
      and 48. All patients will maintain their antiretroviral treatment regimen during the entire
      study period.

      DESIGN: This study is a randomized, double blind clinical trial of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A
      vaccine in individuals with well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection who have been
      successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The adjuvanted
      protein vaccine candidate consists of three recombinant viral antigens: the envelope
      glycoprotein gp120 and two regulatory proteins, Nef and Tat. The latter are expressed as one
      recombinant fusion protein, NefTat. The antigens are formulated in the proprietary AS02A
      adjuvant. The goal of this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the
      gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine in HIV-1-infected individuals.

      DURATION: 48 weeks

      SAMPLE SIZE: 20 subjects

      POPULATION: Subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection receiving highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) with HIV RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL on at least two measurements in the
      previous 6 months and a CD4+ T cell count &gt;400 cells/mm3 within 45 days of study entry will
      be eligible for this study.

      REGIMEN: Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive either the vaccine
      (gp120/NefTat/AS02A) (10 individuals), the AS02A adjuvant only (5 individuals) or a placebo
      (5 individuals). Injections will be administered IM at weeks 0, 4, and 12.

      OBJECTIVES: The two primary objectives of this study are:

        -  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine in individuals
           with well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection on HAART; and

        -  to evaluate the cell-mediated immune response (IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cells) to at least
           one vaccinal antigen induced by the vaccine-adjuvant combination in individuals with
           chronic HIV-1 infection on successful HAART, at two weeks after the third vaccination.

      ENDPOINTS: The two co-primary study endpoints will be:

        -  the occurrence, intensity, and relationship of any local and general signs and symptoms
           during a 7-day follow-up period after each vaccination (primary safety endpoint); and

        -  the changes in the frequency of IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cells in response to at least one
           vaccinal antigen (primary immunogenicity endpoint) in the three different patient
           categories, assessed two weeks after the third vaccination.

             following criteria:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dL;

          -  Negative serologic test for antibodies to HCV or negative HCV PCR if anti-HCV
             antibodies are positive.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential must:

               -  Have a negative urine pregnancy test (sensitive to 25 IU HCG) immediately prior
                  to vaccination;

               -  Agree to use an effective method of birth control during the entire study period.
                  Effective methods of birth control include:

                    1. Condoms (male or female) with or without spermicidal agent. Condoms are
                       recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method
                       effective for preventing HIV transmission;

                    2. Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;

                    3. Intrauterine device (IUD). An IUD is an adequate method of birth control,
                       but increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease;

                    4. An FDA-approved oral contraceptive, provided there is no interaction with
                       the woman's current antiretroviral therapy or other medications;

               -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the male
                  subject or his partner must also use contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL within 6 months of screening.

          -  Received antiretroviral therapy within 12 months of known HIV-1 seroconversion.

             F, oral)

          -  History of CD4 count &lt;200 cells/mm3.

          -  Female subject who is pregnant or nursing a child

             vaccine within 14 days prior to study vaccination

             interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Any condition or history of illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives

          -  Subject has a history of anaphylaxis to any vaccine

          -  Subject has a history of allergy to any adjuvant component

          -  Subject is taking any of the following medications: systemic steroids (inhaled or
             nasal steroid therapy is permitted), interleukins, systemic interferons (e.g. local
