      The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of the oral killed
      bivalent cholera vaccine in adult and pediatric volunteers in Eastern Kolkata, West Bengal,
      India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholera remains to be a serious public health problem worldwide. In the mid-1980s following
      technology transfer from Sweden, Vietnamese scientists developed and produced an oral killed
      monovalent cholera vaccine for Vietnam's public health programs. A 2-dose regimen of this
      vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious. Subsequently, a bivalent vaccine was
      developed containing the newly emergent O139 V. cholerae. This vaccine has several advantages
      over the existing Swedish vaccine. It confers protection against the El Tor biotype in
      younger children, is considerably less expensive, does not require a buffer during
      administration and does not require strict cold chain requirements. However, this vaccine is
      not licensed for use in countries other than Vietnam.

      Through IVI, an agreement between VABIOTECH in Hanoi and Shantha Biotechnics PVT, LTD in
      India has been reached that will make the bivalent vaccine available in India. A double-blind
      randomized phase III trial in a cholera-endemic area would be necessary to demonstrate the
      efficacy of this vaccine in other settings. This would pave the way for the introduction of
      the vaccine into the national immunization programme in India and the internationalization of
      this vaccine and licensure in other countries where it is needed. Prior to the phase III
      trial, a phase II study will be performed among adults and children.
