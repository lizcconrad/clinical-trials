  <official_title>Daily Antiretroviral Therapy (DART-II): An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Prospective, Multicenter Clinical Trial To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety fo Stavudine Extended Release (d4T XR) in Combination With Lamivudine (3TC) and Efavirenz (EFV) Once Daily in Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Naive HIV-Infected Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a therapy with an all once daily regimen of
      stavudine extended release (d4T XR), lamivudine (3TC), and efavirenz (EFV) leads to improved
      outcomes, as measured by viral load, CD4 counts, adherence, safety, and tolerability.
