    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS)
      compared to the right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-to-PA) shunt; compare the effect of
      the MBTS to that of the RV-to-PA shunt on the incidence of death or cardiac transplantation
      at 12 months post randomization; and compare the effect of the two shunts on intensive care
      unit (ICU) morbidity, unintended cardiovascular interventional procedures, right ventricular
      function, tricuspid valve regurgitation, pulmonary artery growth, and neurodevelopmental
      outcome.

      BACKGROUND:

      Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and related single right ventricle anomalies are the
      highest risk congenital cardiovascular malformations. Surgical repair begins with the Norwood
      procedure during the newborn period, a stage II procedure at 4 to 6 months of age, and Fontan
      procedure at 18 to 36 months. The Norwood procedure remains one of the highest risk
      procedures in congenital heart surgery. A few small nonrandomized studies of a novel approach
      to the Norwood procedure have reported improved outcomes. This new approach uses a RV-to-PA
      shunt to provide pulmonary blood flow rather than the standard MBTS. This multi-center,
      randomized clinical trial will evaluate early and intermediate-term outcomes for patients
      undergoing a Norwood procedure with either the RV-to-PA shunt or the MBTS.

The critical p-value was 0.044 because four interim analyses were performed. The target trial size was increased from 466 to 554 to account for crossovers.

    <limitations_and_caveats>As in all surgical trials comparing two operations, it was not possible to blind the personnel caring for the subjects to the intervention. However, the components of the primary endpoint, death and transplantation, are discrete objective events.</limitations_and_caveats>
