  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of two different fixed doses of
      pegfilgrastim (6mg and 12mg) and a by-weight dose of filgrastim (5ug/kg/day) for the
      mobilisation and collection of PBPCs for autologous transplantation after chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who are considered to be
        suitable candidates for autologous PBPC transplantation per institution guidelines - ECOG
        0-2 inclusive - ANC greater than 1.5 x 10^9/L; PLT greater than 100 x 10^9/L Exclusion
        Criteria: - More than one line (regimen) of previous chemotherapy treatment and more than 2
        cycles of any premobilisation salvage chemotherapy prior to enrolment. Patients were also
        to be excluded from the study if they had received any salvage chemotherapy containing the
        following agents: procarbazine, nitrogen mustard, nitrosoureas (including BCNU), melphalan
        and fludarabine. - Previous bone marrow or PBPC transplant - Greater than 20% bone marrow
        involvement of the disease at time of screening, as demonstrated by biopsy - Prior total
        nodal irradiation or any radiotherapy in the past 4 weeks - Serum creatinine greater than
        1.5 x upper limit of institutional normal range - Total serum bilirubin greater than 2 x
        upper limit of institutional normal range - Current diagnosis of splenomegaly not related
        to lymphoma - History of prior malignancy, except for lymphoma, curatively treated basal
        cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, in-situ cervical carcinoma or a surgically cured
        malignancy - Any premalignant myeloid condition or any malignancy with myeloid
        characteristics (e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes, acute or chronic myelogenous leukaemia) -
        Significant non-malignant disease, including documented HIV infection, uncontrolled
        hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mmHg), unstable angina, congestive
        heart failure (greater than NY Heart Association Class II), poorly controlled diabetes,
        coronary angioplasty within 6 months, uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac
        arrhythmias, or active hepatitis C - Haematopoietic growth factors administered within 1
        week of study entry. If growth factor support was given during previous chemotherapy
        cycles, WBC less than 15.0 x 10^9/L was required at enrolment - Treatment with Interferon®
        during the last 3 months - Known hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived pharmaceutical
        products (e.g., filgrastim, HUMULIN® insulin, L-asparaginase) - Subject had previously been
        randomised into this study
