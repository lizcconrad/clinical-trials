  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn whether Abatacept can treat and
      prevent lupus flares; specifically, in patients with active lupus flares in at least one of
      three organ systems: skin (discoid lesions); inflammation of the lining of the heart
      (pericarditis), or inflammation of the lining of the lung (pleuritis/pleurisy); or
      inflammation of more than 4 joints (arthritis). All participants will receive prednisone or
      prednisone-equivalent treatment in combination with study medication. The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.

    <description>Total exposure to glucocorticosteroid was measured by the total prednisone or prednisone equivalent AUC. Based on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee, the open-label, long-term extension period was terminated by the sponsor, for failure to meet the primary outcome measure for the double-blind period and because of an increase in SAEs in the abatacept treatment group. As such, these data were not analyzed.</description>

          <title>Abatacept</title>
          <description>Participants were administered intravenous (iv) infusions of abatacept (10 mg/kg) over approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter up to and including Day 337. All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry. Infusions continued every 28 days until abatacept was marketed for SLE or the drug development program discontinued.</description>

          <title>Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology(SLICC/ACC) score</title>
          <description>SLICC/ACR score or damage index is a measure of cumulative damage due to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Damage is defined as non-reversible change (not related to active inflammation) occurring since onset of lupus, ascertained by clinical assessment and present for at least 6 months. A score of 0=no damage, early damage is defined as ≥1. The total maximum score is 48, and increasing score indicates increasing disease severity. 183 participants were randomized, 3 were not treated and 5 were treated but excluded due to site closure. Thus, Abatacept group n=118 and Placebo group n=57.</description>

        <description>SLICC/ACR score or damage index is a measure of cumulative damage due to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

        <description>An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (even if not caused by the study drug). For this study, AEs of special interest were associated with the use of immunomodulatory agents. Number of participants with infections, malignant neoplasms, pre-specified autoimmune disorders, acute infusional AEs and peri-infusional AEs were recorded.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered intravenous (iv) infusions of abatacept (10 mg/kg) over approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter up to and including Day 337. All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry. Infusions continued every 28 days until abatacept was marketed for SLE or the drug development program discontinued.</description>

All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry. Infusions continued every 28 days until abatacept was marketed for SLE or the drug development program discontinued.</description>

All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry.

        <description>Vital signs assessments and physical examination were conducted throughout the study. Vital signs assessments included body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate. The investigator used his/her clinical judgment to decide whether or not abnormalities in vital signs or physical examination were clinically meaningful.</description>
        <time_frame>Events recorded at each participant encounter, from start of study drug therapy up to Day 337, including up to 56 days after the last dose or up to the first dose of open-label, whichever occurred earlier</time_frame>
        <population>All participants given study drug during the double-blind period (&quot;As Treated&quot;). Significant vital signs and physical examination findings are reported in the AE tables.

            <description>Participants were administered intravenous (iv) infusions of abatacept (10 mg/kg) over approximately 30 minutes on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter up to and including Day 337. All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry. Infusions continued every 28 days until abatacept was marketed for SLE or the drug development program discontinued.</description>

All participants received a dose based on screening visit weight. Prednisone or prednisone equivalent was administered at an initial oral dose of 30 mg once daily (OD). A standardized prednisone or prednisone equivalent taper procedure was followed whenever the participant's clinical features qualified for British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; status after Day 29. Participants who completed the double-blind period were eligible for the open-label long-term extension period, where all participants were reallocated to abatacept (regardless of randomized treatment in the double-blind period) according to body weight at study entry. Infusions continued every 28 days until abatacept was marketed for SLE or the drug development program discontinued.</description>
