  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study that will compare two medication adherence strategies
      in adults with moderate or severe persistent asthma as a method for improving or maintaining
      treatment adherence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-income minority adults have excessively high rates of morbidity from asthma. Poor
      medication adherence has been documented in these individuals and contributes to the high
      morbidity level. This study will compare a Problem Solving intervention with an Attention
      Control intervention to improve and sustain asthma self-management in a clinical setting.
      This study will include strategies to address contextual factors related to adherence.
      Participants will be recruited from clinics that serve minority and low-income individuals.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving treatment for asthma at one of the participating clinics

          -  Moderate or severe persistent asthma according to the NHLBI Guidelines

          -  Current use of prescribed inhaled corticosteroids

          -  Evidence of reversible airflow obstruction, as indicated by the following two
             criteria:

               1. FEV1pp AND less than 80% at the time of study entry or within the 3 years prior
                  to study entry

               2. An increase of greater than 15% and 200ml in FEV1 with asthma treatment over the
                  last 3 years (if there is no record of such improvement, participants will be
                  evaluated via spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator at the first study visit.
                  An increase in FEV1 or FVC greater than 12% and 200 ml in FEV1 30 minutes
                  following albuterol administration will represent evidence of reversible airflow
                  obstruction. If a spirometer is not immediately available, participants may be
                  evaluated using a peak flow meter, which reports a PEF. A PEFpp less than 80% and
                  an improvement of at least 60 L per minute after the administration of albuterol
                  will represent evidence of reversible airflow obstruction)

          -  Has a functional telephone or mobile phone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant lung or cardiac disease (other than hypertension)

          -  Psychiatric illness, such as mania or schizophrenia, that may make it impossible to
             understand or carry out the Problem Solving intervention
