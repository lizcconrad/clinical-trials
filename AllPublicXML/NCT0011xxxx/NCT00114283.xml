  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with
      metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (complete
      response [CR] + partial response [PR]) in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head
      and neck following treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Secondary objectives of this study are to estimate time to progression, describe the
      adverse event profile, and to obtain preliminary assessments of changes in pre- versus
      post-treatment measurements for selected biomarkers in tumor cells from these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent
             squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck; these include tumors arising in the oral
             cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, glottis, or ethmoid/maxillary sinus;
             patients with localized disease must have failed primary therapy radiotherapy,
             surgery, and/or chemotherapy); patients with single site or regional recurrence that,
             in view of the Principal Investigator (PI) or treating physician is potentially
             curable by resection or by re-irradiation program, must have declined such therapies

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT)
             scan; one or more sites of metastatic or recurrent disease must be accessible for
             needle biopsy

          -  No more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens; no prior treatment with tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors or antibodies to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGOR) or human

             completed at least 4 weeks prior to treatment with GW572016

          -  Life expectancy of greater than three months

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73
             m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan; note that baseline and on
             treatment scans should be performed using the same modality and preferably at the same
             institution

          -  Eligibility of patients receiving medications or substances known to affect, or with
             the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW572016 will be
             determined following review of their use by the Principal Investigator; patients
             requiring oral anticoagulants (coumadin, warfarin) are eligible provided there is
             increased vigilance with respect to monitoring international normalized ratio (INR);
             if medically appropriate and treatment available, the investigator may also consider
             switching these patients to low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, where an interaction
             with GW572016 is not expected

          -  The effects of GW572016 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Able to retain and absorb medication given by mouth or feeding tube

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment:

               -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
                  nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or

               -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered
                  more than 4 weeks earlier

               -  Patients who have had prior treatment with EGFR targeting therapies

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or receiving concurrent
             anticancer therapy

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to GW572016

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GW572016 is member of the
             4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with GW572016,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with GW572016; human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral
             therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions
             with GW572016; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease resulting in an inability to take
             oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for intravenous (IV)
             alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled
             inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)

          -  Concomitant requirement for medication classified as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
             inducer or inhibitor
