  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)
      will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive imatinib (Gleevec) either for 12 or for
      36 months following surgery. The study participants are required to have a histologically
      verified GIST with a high risk of GIST recurrence despite complete removal of all macroscopic
      GIST tissue at surgery. The high/very high risk of recurrence is defined as one of the
      following: 1) the largest tumor diameter is over 10 cm; 2) the mitosis count is high (over 10
      mitoses per 50 high power microscope fields, HPFs); 3) the largest tumor diameter over 5 cm
      and the mitosis count is over 5/50 HPFs; 4) tumor spillage has taken place into the abdominal
      cavity at the time of surgery or following spontaneous tumor rupture. All study participants
      will receive imatinib 400 mg/day orally, but the duration of imatinib administration will be
      determined randomly (either for 12 or for 36 months). The study participants will be followed
      up using blood tests and computed tomography (or MRI) of the abdomen. The computed tomography
      examinations will be performed at 6 month intervals for a median of 5 years. A total of 280
      patients will be entered into the study. The study hypothesis is that adjuvant imatinib may
      prevent some of the GIST recurrences, and that there may be a difference in the rate of GIST
      recurrence between the two groups.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, prospective, phase III, multicenter study carried out in
      the Nordic countries and in Germany. Following macroscopically complete surgery, the study
      participants will be allocated to receive imatinib either for 12 or for 36 months. At
      randomization, the patients are stratified into 2 strata: 1) local disease (1 GIST tumor); 2)
      intra-abdominal implants or resectable intra-abdominal/hepatic metastases, or intra-abdominal
      spillage is present, or R1 surgery has been carried out (microscopic disease has been left
      behind). The imatinib dose is 400 mg/day administered with food. Imatinib dose adjustments
      are made as per protocol.

      Medical history, current medication, weight, height, and ECOG performance status are recorded
      prior to study entry. Physical examination, blood cell counts, blood biochemistry, pregnancy
      test, chest X-ray or CT, and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are carried out/measured
      prior to study entry. FDG-PET is an optional staging examination. Research serum samples are
      collected for banking prior to initiating imatinib and at 6-month intervals during the study.
      Tumor tissue is reviewed centrally to confirm the histological diagnosis of GIST, and KIT and
      PDGFRA gene mutation analyses will be performed from stored GIST tissue.

      The study participants are monitored during adjuvant treatment and following adjuvant
      treatment. Physical examination, weight and ECOG performance status are assessed at 4- to
      26-week intervals. Adverse events are collected using structured forms at the times of the
      evaluation visits. Blood cell counts and blood biochemistry are measured at 2- to 6-week
      intervals during imatinib therapy, and at 6-month intervals following completion of adjuvant
      therapy. CT or MRI examinations of the abdomen and pelvis are performed at 6-month intervals
      during the study.
