      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Aridol (mannitol) challenge test can
      predict response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in COPD subjects. Subjects will
      undergo an Aridol test and then 3 months of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The
      effect on lung function and quality of life will then be measured and correlated with the
      Aridol test result.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of COPD (history, spirometry, symptoms including chronic cough and/or
             shortness of breath that is worse on exertion and/or excess sputum production)

          -  Aged 45 - 80 years

          -  Have pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt; 1.4 litres and at least 60% of predicted for height,
             age and gender and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% of predicted for height, age and
             gender

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 %

          -  ≥ 10 pack years smoking history

          -  As determined by the investigator, are capable and willing to:

               -  perform all of the techniques necessary to measure lung function;

               -  administer the dry powder mannitol.

          -  Are capable of, and have given informed consent to, participating in this study in
             accordance with local regulations.

          -  The subject must be in stable clinical condition at the time of, and for a period of
             14 days prior to, their recruitment into the study. Stable clinical condition is
             defined as lack of:

               -  change in sputum production (volume, colour, consistency);

               -  increased cough;

               -  worsening dyspnoea;

               -  increased malaise, fatigue or lethargy;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators, site personnel directly affiliated with this study, and their immediate
             families. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, whether
             biologically or legally adopted.

          -  Subjects receiving treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (including combination
             therapies, e.g. Seretide®, Symbicort®) or oral corticosteroids within the last 6
             weeks.

             the study.

          -  Subjects receiving antibiotic treatment for respiratory infection.

          -  Known diagnosis of asthma or allergic rhinitis.

          -  Ocular surgery in the three months prior to enrolment.

          -  Abdominal surgery in the three months prior to enrolment.

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB).

          -  Lung cancer or any other malignancies, which are considered by the investigator as a
             contraindication to participating in the study.

          -  Lung disease other than COPD (e.g. bronchiectasis).

          -  Uncontrolled insulin-dependant or non-insulin dependant diabetes, i.e. &gt;10% HbA1c.

          -  Female subjects of reproductive capability, not using a reliable form of contraception

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent from the subject or subject's authorised
             representative.

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigative drug study parallel to, or
             within 4 weeks of, study entry.

          -  Known intolerance to mannitol.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension - systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 200 mmHg and or diastolic
             BP &gt; 100 mmHg.

          -  Planned pulmonary rehabilitation.

          -  Have had major abdominal, chest or brain surgery in the three months prior to
             enrolment.

          -  Have known cerebral, aortic or abdominal aneurysm.
