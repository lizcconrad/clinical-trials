      SCOT is a clinical research study designed for people with severe forms of scleroderma. SCOT
      stands for Scleroderma: Cyclophosphamide Or Transplantation. The SCOT study will compare the
      potential benefits of stem cell transplant and high-dose monthly cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)
      in the treatment of scleroderma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a serious autoimmune disorder in which a person's own
      immune cells attack organs in the body. SSc affects the skin, joints, lungs, heart,
      intestinal tract, and kidneys, and half of the patients with the most severe organ
      involvement die within 5 years. Treatment for SSc usually includes supportive care or
      immunosuppressive drugs (drugs to suppress the immune system). As the immune cells are
      believed to be causing the disease, researchers are looking for new therapies that either
      slow down or stop this process, while not being too toxic.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of high-dose
      immunosuppressive therapy followed by reinfusion (transplantation) of the participant's own
      autologous (self) peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) compared to treatment with monthly (for
      12 months) intravenous doses of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) therapy for the treatment of
      severe systemic sclerosis (SSc). These treatments are being given in order to determine if
      they will slow down or stop SSc from becoming more severe, and if they can reverse the
      effects of the disease. The researchers are evaluating the effects of the two treatments on
      serious organ damage and survival related to SSc, while also looking at the side effects of
      the two treatments.

      This trial also includes three optional mechanistic sub-studies open to a subset of
      participants enrolled in the SCOT trial:

        1. Pharmacokinetics of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in Patients Receiving Cyclophosphamide for
           the SCOT trial (Originally listed separately as DAIT SCSSc-01-01, NCT00848614). The
           purpose of this study is to determine the plasma concentration and exposure time
           required for cyclophosphamide to produce optimal immunosuppressive activity with minimal
           toxicity in participants with severe systemic sclerosis.

        2. Vascular Progenitor Cells and the Pathogenesis of Systemic Sclerosis(Originally listed
           separately as DAIT SCSSc-01-02, NCT00871221). The purpose of this study is to measure
           and characterize the circulating endothelial progenitor cells from the blood of 30
           participants and also to determine the extent of vascular cell apoptosis and
           proliferation in cutaneous microvasculature in these participants before and after the
           receipt of the two SCOT treatment regimens.

        3. Molecular Analysis of T Cell Immune Recovery for the SCOT Trial(Originally listed
           separately as DAIT SCSSc-01-03, NCT00872508). The purpose of this study is [1] to
           describe the condition of peripheral T cell reactivity and repertoire diversity in SSc
           patients and evaluate evidence for potential defects prior to randomization, [2] to gain
           a better understanding of the impact of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and high-dose
           immunosuppressive therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation on thymopoiesis, and
           [3] to describe the kinetics and breadth of T cell immune recovery in SSc patients
           treated with these interventions.

    <time_frame>54 Months Post-Randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The GRCS is an analytic tool that accounts for multiple disease manifestations simultaneously. It does not measure clinical disease activity or severity but reflects how participants compared to one another based on a hierarchy of ordered outcomes: death, event-free survival (EFS), forced vital capacity (FVC), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Participants alive ranked higher than those who died; those who survived event-free ranked higher than EFS failures. EFS failure included death, respiratory failure (decrease from baseline of &gt;30% in DLCO % predicted or &gt;20% in FVC % predicted ), renal failure (chronic dialysis &gt; 6 month or renal transplant), or cardiac failure (clinical congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%). The lowest 3 GRCS components are ordinal; improvement, stability, or worsening from baseline (±10% change in FVC % predicted, ±0.4 change in HAQ-DI, ±25% change in mRSS).</description>

    <description>Any pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) events that occurred between randomization and Month 54 post-randomization were summarized. Development of PAH occurred if the participant met the following criteria, where the measurement value(s) could not be explained by other causes such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary emboli: 1) a post-baseline peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 55 mmHg by echocardiogram or 2) a mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 30 mmHg at rest measured by right heart catheterization. If the post-baseline peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure was between 40 to 55 mmHg by echocardiogram, a right heart catheterization was done to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. The endpoint was met if the mean pulmonary artery pressure was &gt; 30 mmHg at rest by right heart catheterization. Additionally, any adverse event reported as PAH was included in the analysis.</description>

          <description>Participants were administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and had hematopoietic stem cells removed from their blood. They then underwent high-dose immunosuppressive therapy using a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (800 cGy given over 2 days with lung and kidney shielding limiting exposure to 200cGy), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 days), IV Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days), and equine antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) (15 mg/kg/day for 3 days). Purified autologous stem cell were infused at a dose of &gt;2.5x106 CD34+ cells/kg. After transplantation, participants received additional doses of IV Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days) and ATGAM (15 mg/kg/day for 3 days.)</description>

        <title>Global Rank Composite Score (GRCS) (Month 54, ITT)</title>
        <description>The GRCS is an analytic tool that accounts for multiple disease manifestations simultaneously. It does not measure clinical disease activity or severity but reflects how participants compared to one another based on a hierarchy of ordered outcomes: death, event-free survival (EFS), forced vital capacity (FVC), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Participants alive ranked higher than those who died; those who survived event-free ranked higher than EFS failures. EFS failure included death, respiratory failure (decrease from baseline of &gt;30% in DLCO % predicted or &gt;20% in FVC % predicted ), renal failure (chronic dialysis &gt; 6 month or renal transplant), or cardiac failure (clinical congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%). The lowest 3 GRCS components are ordinal; improvement, stability, or worsening from baseline (±10% change in FVC % predicted, ±0.4 change in HAQ-DI, ±25% change in mRSS).</description>

        <description>The GRCS is an analytic tool that accounts for multiple disease manifestations simultaneously. It does not measure clinical disease activity or severity but reflects how participants compared to one another based on a hierarchy of ordered outcomes: death, event-free survival (EFS), forced vital capacity (FVC), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Participants alive ranked higher than those who died; those who survived event-free ranked higher than EFS failures. EFS failure included death, respiratory failure (decrease from baseline of &gt;30% in DLCO % predicted or &gt;20% in FVC % predicted ), renal failure (chronic dialysis &gt; 6 month or renal transplant), or cardiac failure (clinical congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%). The lowest 3 GRCS components are ordinal; improvement, stability, or worsening from baseline (±10% change in FVC % predicted, ±0.4 change in HAQ-DI, ±25% change in mRSS).</description>

        <title>Event-Free Survival (EFS) (Month 54, PP)</title>
        <description>Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as survival without significant organ damage or death. EFS failure includes any one of the following: death, respiratory failure (decrease from baseline of &gt;30% in DLCO % predicted or &gt;20% in FVC % predicted, documented on at least 2 successive occasions at least 1 month apart), renal failure (requiring chronic dialysis &gt; 6 months or transplantation), or the occurrence of cardiomyopathy (clinical congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%, documented on at least 2 successive occasions at least 1 month apart). EFS failures include participants who failed any component of the EFS definition between randomization and Month 54 post-randomization.</description>
        <time_frame>54 Months Post-Randomization</time_frame>
        <population>Per-protocol (PP). The PP population is defined as those participants who completed the assigned treatment protocol: undergoing autologous CD34-selected hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation in the mHSCT arm, or receiving at least 9 of 12 planned doses in the cyclophosphamide arm.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (ITT)</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-reported questionnaire of functionality that includes questions in 8 domains (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities). The final score ranges from 0 to 3, where a higher HAQ-DI score indicates a worse outcome. Analysis was based on an ordinal response variable, defined as follows: a decrease of &gt;0.4 from baseline in the HAQ-DI score was considered disease improvement, an increase of &gt;0.4 was considered disease worsening, and any change less than 0.4 was considered “no change.” Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) (ITT)</title>
        <description>The SF-36 measures health-related quality of life. It has 36 items and 2 component scores, the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. Each component was transformed into a 0-100 scale (higher numbers indicate greater quality of life) and normalized to have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the 1998 general US population. Analysis was based on ordinal response, defined as follows for each component: a &gt;= 10 point increase indicated disease improvement, a &gt;= 10 point decrease indicated disease worsening, and a change &lt;10 points indicated “no change”. Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Diffusion in Liters of Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) (ITT)</title>
        <description>Diffusion in liters of carbon monoxide (DLCO) is a measure of lung function. Predicted values for DLCO were computed using the Crapo Morris equations and adjusted per the Cotes formula for anemia, if a participant’s hemoglobin was &lt;13 or &gt;17 gm/dL, and altitude (Calgary site only). Analysis was based on an ordinal response variable, defined as follows: an increase from baseline of &gt;15% in DLCO % Predicted indicated disease improvement, a decrease of &gt;15% indicated disease worsening, and a change of &lt;=15% was considered “no change”. Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (ITT)</title>
        <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after a full breath and is a measure of lung function. Predicted FVC was based on institutional standards. Analysis was based on an ordinal response variable, defined as follows: an increase from baseline of &gt;10% in FVC % Predicted indicated disease improvement, a decrease of &gt;10% indicated disease worsening, and a change of &lt;=10% was considered “no change”. Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) (ITT)</title>
        <description>The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) is a measure of skin thickness. Skin thickness in 17 anatomic areas was rated on a 0-3 scale and scores are summed to obtain the mRSS (range from 0 - 51), with higher mRSS scores indicating worse disease activity. Analysis was based on an ordinal response variable, defined as follows: if the baseline mRSS was &lt;=20, a decrease &gt;=5 points from baseline indicated disease improvement and an increase &gt;= 5 points indicated disease worsening; if the baseline mRSS was &gt;20, then a decrease of &gt;25% indicated disease improvement and an increase of &gt;25% indicated disease worsening. Participants who do not meet the disease criteria outlined above were considered “no change”. Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 54 in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) (PP)</title>
        <description>The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) is a measure of skin thickness. Skin thickness in 17 anatomic areas was rated on a 0-3 scale and scores are summed to obtain the mRSS (range from 0 - 51), with higher mRSS scores indicating worse disease activity. Analysis was based on an ordinal response variable, defined as follows: if the baseline mRSS was &lt;=20, a decrease &gt;=5 points from baseline indicated disease improvement and an increase &gt;= 5 points indicated disease worsening; if the baseline mRSS was &gt;20, then a decrease of &gt;25% indicated disease improvement and an increase of &gt;25% indicated disease worsening. Participants who do not meet the disease criteria outlined above were considered “no change”. Data for participants without a Month 54 assessment was imputed using a last observation carried forward approach; improvement/worsening was assessed at each participant's last available study visit that occurred prior to or at Month 54, without confirmation at the next visit.</description>

        <title>New or Worsening Pulmonary Hypertension (ITT)</title>
        <description>Any pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) events that occurred between randomization and Month 54 post-randomization were summarized. Development of PAH occurred if the participant met the following criteria, where the measurement value(s) could not be explained by other causes such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary emboli: 1) a post-baseline peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 55 mmHg by echocardiogram or 2) a mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 30 mmHg at rest measured by right heart catheterization. If the post-baseline peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure was between 40 to 55 mmHg by echocardiogram, a right heart catheterization was done to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. The endpoint was met if the mean pulmonary artery pressure was &gt; 30 mmHg at rest by right heart catheterization. Additionally, any adverse event reported as PAH was included in the analysis.</description>

A hypertensive scleroderma renal crisis occurred if a participant obtained both of the following: New-onset hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;= 90 mmHg, a rise in SBP &gt;= 30 mmHg compared to baseline, or a rise in DBP &gt;= 20 mmHg compared to baseline, and one of the following features: 1) increase of &gt;= 50 % above baseline in serum creatinine, 2) proteinuria (&gt;= 2+ by dipstick confirmed by protein:creatinine ratio &gt; 2.5), 3) hematuria (&gt;= 2+ by dipstick or &gt; 10 RBCs/HPF, without menstruation), 4) thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100,000 plts/mm3), or 5) hemolysis (determined by blood smear or increased reticulocyte count). Additionally, any adverse event reported as a scleroderma renal crisis was included in the analysis.</description>

        <description>Initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Participants were not expected to receive additional disease-modifying therapy for systemic sclerosis (SSc) in the absence of disease progression. In general, this includes the administration of any therapy clearly given for the purpose of treating the underlying SSc. It does not include concomitant treatments permitted in the protocol, such as use of methotrexate (15 g or less), anti-malarials, or minocycline for arthritis only. Systemic corticosteroids given at &gt; 10 mg/day (prednisone or prednisone equivalent), without clearly defined non-SSc indications, and methotrexate given for non-arthritis indications are examples of qualifying DMARDs.</description>

        <title>Time to Absolute Neutrophil Count Engraftment</title>
        <description>Time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) engraftment is defined as the number of days post-transplant until required levels of ANC are attained (for the mHSCT arm only). If engraftment did not occur within 28 days post-transplant, then the variable was set to 28 days. ANC engraftment required an ANC of &gt; 500 cells/microliter, maintained for 3 consecutive days.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and had hematopoietic stem cells removed from their blood. They then underwent high-dose immunosuppressive therapy using a conditioning regimen of total body irradiation (800 cGy given over 2 days with lung and kidney shielding limiting exposure to 200cGy), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 days), IV Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days), and equine antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) (15 mg/kg/day for 3 days). Purified autologous stem cell were infused at a dose of &gt;2.5x106 CD34+ cells/kg. After transplantation, participants received additional doses of IV Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days) and ATGAM (15 mg/kg/day for 3 days.)</description>

      <desc>Adverse events were collected in the safety population, which includes all participants for whom study treatment was initiated. For the mHSCT arm, treatment began with the first dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor for mobilization; for the cyclophosphamide arm, treatment began with the first dose of IV cyclophosphamide. In the mHSCT arm, Grade 4 cytopenias reported in participants that occur between conditioning and Day 28 after infusion of the IP, are not reported as SAEs.</desc>
