  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled, Phase II study is planned to answer
      questions about how the drug, matuzumab (EMD 72000), works and is part of an effort aimed to
      develop better treatment for advanced lung cancer by combining matuzumab, a monoclonal
      antibody, with a chemotherapy treatment, called pemetrexed.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Objective Response Assessed by Independent Review Committee</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to PD or death due to any cause (up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as having a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Response assessment was performed using modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Complete response: disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. PR: greater than (&gt;) 50 percent (%) decrease from baseline in sum of product of diameters of index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to PD or death due to any cause (up to approximately 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from randomization to death (due to any cause). OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to PD or death due to any cause (up to approximately 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD: &gt;25% increase in one or more lesions, or appearance new lesions. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Objective Response Assessed by Independent Review Committee</measure>
    <time_frame>From first documented objective response to PD or death due to any cause (up to approximately 3.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as having a CR or a PR. Response assessment was performed using modified WHO criteria. CR: disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. PR: &gt;50% decrease from baseline in sum of product of diameters of index lesions, without appearance of any new lesion. Duration of objective response was defined as time from first appearance of CR or PR to time of PD (&gt;25% increase in one or more lesions, or appearance new lesions) or death. Duration of objective response was to be assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Cycle 2 in Global Quality of Life (QoL), as Assessed Using Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 2 (Cycle length = 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The LCSS consisted of 9 items: 6 items focused on lung cancer symptoms (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain] and 3 items were global items (symptom distress, interference with activity level, and global QoL). The global QoL item scores are reported here. The total global QoL item score ranged from 0 (worse QoL) to 100 (best QoL).</description>

          <description>The LCSS consisted of 9 items: 6 items focused on lung cancer symptoms (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain] and 3 items were global items (symptom distress, interference with activity level, and global QoL). The global QoL item scores are reported here. The total global QoL item score ranged from 0 (worse QoL) to 100 (best QoL).</description>
