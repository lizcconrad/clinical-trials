      This phase I study will involve escalating doses of CAMPATH until the goal dose for the
      cohort is tolerated. The CAMPATH goal dose will be administered to the patient subcutaneously
      (SQ) 3 times per week for up to 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancy. The anticipated patient
             population are patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma or myeloma

          -  Patients with a history of a hematologic malignancy that has previously been shown by
             flow cytometry or immunophenotyping analysis to express CD52

          -  Any chemotherapy, major surgery or irradiation must have been completed at least four
             (4) weeks before enrollment in this study (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosourea)

          -  Patients have recovered from the acute side effects due to prior therapy

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with CAMPATH

          -  Use of an investigational agent within two (2) weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  History of anaphylaxis following exposure to humanized monoclonal antibodies

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          -  Prior autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplant if within six (6) months of study
             entry

          -  A history or prior allogenic bone marrow transplant or organ transplant

          -  Known, symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement with lymphoma

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection (excluding skin infection, lower urinary tract infection, or oral
             infection), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
