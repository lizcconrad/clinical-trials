  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multi-center study of GM-CT-01 which has been shown to increase the
      anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly
      used in cancer patients. In this Phase II study, patients with colon cancer which has spread,
      despite treatment with approved therapies, will receive GM-CT-01 plus 5-FU in monthly cycles
      for at least 2 cycles or until their disease progresses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that GM-CT-01 in different doses plus 5-FU was well
      tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved
      treatments. The main reason for doing this Phase II study in advanced colorectal cancer
      patients is to verify the safety observations in the early Phase I study and further evaluate
      the efficacy of these drugs' combination to stabilize tumors, preventing further growth and
      potentially shrink tumors.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Has a histologically-proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum

          -  Has documentation of locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer not amenable to
             curative surgery or radiotherapy

          -  Eligible subjects are those whose unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic
             colorectal cancer has progressed during or after receiving treatment with at least
             two, but not more than three, lines of therapy that collectively must have included at
             a minimum all of the following agents: 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, irinotecan, and
             oxaliplatin (unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not able to
             receive irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin due to medical contraindications, in which case
             irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin are not required to have been included in the prior
             lines of therapy). Adjuvant chemotherapy following definitive management of the
             primary lesion in the colon or rectum is allowed and will not be counted as a line of
             therapy.

          -  Has 1 or more measurable lesion(s) (&quot;target lesion[s]&quot;) according to RECIST (Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria.

        The same diagnostic imaging method must be used throughout the study to evaluate the
        lesions; and clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are
        superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).

             in it; to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator; and to participate in, and
             comply with, the requirements of the entire study

          -  A female of childbearing potential must have a negative serum screening test for
             pregnancy and agree to practice abstinence or use an effective method of contraception

          -  Has had all aspects of the protocol explained and written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has central nervous system metastasis
