    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel study was designed to evaluate whether a
      single fixed-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of pegfilgrastim or daily administration
      of Filgrastim for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) support would assist in allowing the
      planned dose-on-time (PDOT) of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone
      (CHOP) chemotherapy with Rituximab every 14 days in subjects with aggressive B-cell
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma by reducing the duration of neutropenia and incidence of febrile
      neutropenia.
