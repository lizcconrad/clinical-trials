  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from Study FE200486 CS06 and FE200486
      CS02 provided further knowledge of the optimal dose regimens for FE200486 (degarelix). Both
      studies were to guide dose selection for phase III. In addition, safety and tolerance data
      were generated.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The time to 90% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline was defined as the median number of days from dosing to the first visit where a 90% reduction in PSA level was reached.</description>

    <measure>Liver Function Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferas levels, and bilirubin levels plus the number of participants who had ALT increases &gt;3x ULN and ALT increases &gt;3x ULN with concurrently increased bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet the following inclusion criteria before entry into the study:

          -  Has given written consent before any study related activity is performed (A study
             related activity is defined as any procedure that would not have been performed during
             the normal management of the patient.)

          -  Is a male patient with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate (all
             stages) in whom endocrine treatment is indicated, except for neoadjuvant hormonal
             therapy. For patients, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increases on two consecutive
             determinations at least 2 weeks apart prior to Visit 1 must be documented.

          -  Is at least 18 years.

          -  Has an ECOG score of 2.

          -  Has a baseline testosterone level within the age specific normal range as measured by
             the central laboratory.

          -  Has a PSA value of 2 ng/mL as measured by the central laboratory.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any patient meeting one or more of the following exclusion criteria will not be entered
        into the study:

          -  Previous or present hormonal management of prostate cancer (surgical castration or
             other hormonal manipulation, e.g. GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, antiandrogens,
             estrogens, PC-Spec) except for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy of &lt; 6 months duration and
             completed &gt; 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Requires hormonal therapy for neoadjuvant purposes.

          -  Is recently (within the last 12 weeks preceding Visit 1) or presently treated with any
             other drug modifying the testosterone level or function.

          -  Is considered to be a candidate for curative therapy, i.e., radical prostatectomy or
             radiotherapy within 6 months after Visit 1.

          -  Has a history of severe asthma requiring daily treatment with inhalation steroids,
             angioedema or anaphylactic reactions.

          -  Has hypersensitivity towards any component of the investigational product.

          -  Has had a cancer disease within the last 10 years except for prostate cancer, and
             surgically removed basocellular or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Has a clinically significant neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
             cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological,
             dermatological or infectious disorder or any other condition, including excessive
             alcohol or drug abuse, which may interfere with trial participation, or which may
             affect the conclusion of the study, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities which, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would interfere with the patient's participation in this study or
             evaluation of study results (liver transaminases must be within normal limits).

          -  Has a mental incapacity or language barrier precluding adequate understanding or
             co-operation.

          -  Has received an investigational drug within the last 12 weeks preceding Visit 1.

          -  Has previously participated in this study.

          <title>Stage of prostate cancer</title>
          <description>Prostate cancer stage was classified to describe the extent of cancer. Localized refers to tumors without involvement of lymph nodes or metastasis. Advanced localized can be larger tumors that may involve the lymph nodes but no metastasis. Metastatic are more advanced cancers that are spreading beyond the original tumor.</description>
