      The primary objective of this current phase I trial is to study the safety and tolerability
      of an orally administered dosage form of ridaforolimus. This will be accomplished by an
      ascending dose study of several dosage regimens in patients with advanced malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of oral anticancer therapy has created a means to reduce dependency on a system
      for treating cancer that relies on hospital-based services to administer treatment. While
      known disadvantages of oral therapies such as potential variable absorption, unpredictable
      bioavailability and sometimes poor patient compliance pose challenges, the use of orally
      administered compounds permits investigation of alternative or varied dose regimens, which
      may ultimately enhance overall patient care.

      Ridaforolimus is currently being studied in phase 1 and phase II clinical trials in patients
      with advanced cancers. Thus far, these trials have demonstrated that ridaforolimus has a
      favorable safety profile and possesses anticancer activity when administered as a 30-minute
      intravenous (IV) infusion daily x 5 every-two-weeks or on a weekly schedule. The primary
      objective of this current phase I trial is to study the safety and tolerability of an orally
      administered dosage form of ridaforolimus. This will be accomplished by an ascending dose
      study of several dosage regimens in patients with advanced malignancies.

          -  Concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than prescribed
