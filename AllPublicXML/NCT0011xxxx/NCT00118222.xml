      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as porfimer sodium, that becomes active
      when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are
      killed. Giving photodynamic therapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying two different light doses of photodynamic
      therapy using porfimer sodium to compare how well they work in treating patients who are
      undergoing surgery for recurrent malignant astrocytoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare survival of patients undergoing surgical resection for recurrent high-grade
           malignant supratentorial astrocytoma treated with intraoperative high vs low light dose
           photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive porfimer sodium IV. One day later, patients undergo craniotomy and tumor
      resection.

        -  Arm I: During surgery, patients receive low light dose photodynamic therapy.

        -  Arm II: During surgery, patients receive high light dose photodynamic therapy. After
           completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 day, 6 weeks, and 3 months and
           then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5
      years.
