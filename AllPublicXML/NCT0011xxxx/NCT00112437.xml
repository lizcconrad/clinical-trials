  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-year base study with a 1-year extension to examine the effects of a new
      experimental medication (odanacatib [MK-0822]) on postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study
      will enroll approximately 375 postmenopausal women, and randomly assign them to 4 different
      doses of odanacatib or to placebo. Measurements performed during the study include: bone
      mineral density scans, spine x-rays, laboratory blood and urine tests, height measurements
      and optional bone biopsies (at the end of 2 years).

      Study Extension:

      Participants who completed 12 months of the base study and 12 months of the first extension
      were invited to continue in three additional extensions: MK0-822-004-10, which extended the
      study to 36 months, MK-0822-004-20 (NCT00112437) which extended the study to 60 months, and
      MK-0822-004-30 (NCT00112437), which extended the study to 120 months.

        -  In the first extension, participants continued to receive the same treatment they
           received in the 12-month base study.

        -  In the second extension, participants were re-randomized to odanacatib 50 mg OW or
           placebo OW for 12 months.

        -  In the third extension, participants who were initially randomized to odanacatib 3 mg or
           placebo OW in the base study received odanacatib 50 mg weekly in Years 4 and 5; all
           other participants remained on the same treatment they were during Year 3.

        -  In the fourth extension, all participants received odanacatib weekly in Years 6-10.

      Study arms for extensions include only odanacatib 50 mg and placebo for the first two
      extensions and odanacatib 50 mg only for the third extension.

      Extension Studies:

      MK-0822-004-10 (NCT00112437) Extension: Participant has participated in and completed 24
      months of treatment in the base study

      MK-0822-004-20 (NCT00112437) Extension: Participant participated in and completed 36 months
      of treatment in base and extension studies.

      MK-0822-004-30 (NCT00112437) Extension: Participant participated in and completed 60 months
      of treatment in the base and extension studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal for 5 or more years, defined as no menses for at least 5 years OR at
             least 5 years status post bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Bone mineral density T-score at the hip or spine of -2.0 or less

          -  Spinal anatomy suitable for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). At the lumbar
             spine, there is no evidence of vertebral fracture in at least 3 vertebrae in the L1 to
             L4 region on baseline spine films. (Significant scoliosis, bony trauma, degenerative
             joint disease, and sequelae of orthopedic procedures that result in anatomy that is
             unsuitable for accurate bone densitometry must be absent from the lumbar spine.)

          -  At least one hip must be evaluable by DXA (e.g., contain no hardware from orthopedic
             procedures)

          -  In a state of general health allowing for successful completion of the trial

          -  Agreement to not use any medications to treat osteoporosis during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior osteoporotic fracture (unless declined treatment with or was
             ineligible for osteoporosis therapy)

          -  Past treatment with osteoporosis medications, steroids, hormone replacement, as well
             as various other medications that affect bone may be exclusionary. (Different
             exclusion criteria apply to each bone active drug. For example, any prior use of
             intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates is not permitted. By contrast, prior use of hormone
             replacement for several years is permitted if it has not occurred within the past 6
             months. Please ask the study doctor for details)

          -  Significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit for the study
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, could complicate interpretation of the study
             results or pose additional risk to the patient (for example, patients who are
             non-ambulatory should be excluded for this reason)

      <recruitment_details>Approximately 375 participants were recruited from June 2005 to December 2005. Investigators used one or more of the following recruitment methods: Investigator Patient/Subject Database or Medical Records, Investigator's Local Recruitment/Advertising, Other Health Professional and, Physician Referral (Primary/Specialist/Family Doctor).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants entered screening followed by a 3-week placebo run-in. All took vitamin D3, 5600 IU once weekly, those with average daily calcium intakes &lt;1000 mg took calcium 500 mg/day as calcium carbonate. Participants were excluded from the active treatment based on predetermined exclusion criteria (Bone Mineral Density and laboratory results).</pre_assignment_details>

        <time_frame>Baseline and 36 months</time_frame>
        <population>This analysis was geometric mean percent change from baseline (which is a back-transformation of a log-transformed fraction from baseline) at Month 36 using a Per-Protocol approach. Participants with important protocol deviations and major protocol violators were excluded from the analyses. The Per-Protocol approach did not estimate missing data.</population>
