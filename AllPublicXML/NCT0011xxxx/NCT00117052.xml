  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the efficacy of cinacalcet when
      co-administered with the first meal after dialysis is comparable (non-inferior) to the
      efficacy of cinacalcet when administered during the dialysis study visit.

        Inclusion Criteria: - CKD patients requiring dialysis (HD, HDF, HF) for at least 1 month
        before enrolment - An iPTH determination within 14 days before randomisation must be
        greater than or equal to 300 pg/mL (biPTH greater than or equal to 150 pg/mL) - A serum
        calcium determination (corrected for calcium) within 14 days before randomisation must be
        greater than or equal to 8.4 mg/dL [2.1 mmol/L] Exclusion Criteria: - Have an unstable
        medical condition, defined as having been hospitalised, other than for dialysis vascular
        access revision, within 30 days before day 1, or otherwise unstable in the judgment of the
        investigator - Are currently breast-feeding - Are performing peritoneal dialysis - Have had
        a parathyroidectomy in the 3 months before day 1 - Have a gastrointestinal disorder that
        may be associated with impaired absorption of orally administered medications or an
        inability to swallow tablets
