  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This drug is being developed to treat a type of brain cancer, glioma. This study was
      developed to evaluate the safety, time to disease progression and survival rates after
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial was designed in two sequences. The first sequence, which is now complete
      to accrual was an open-label, dose escalation, multi-dose study and treated 12 evaluable
      patients with high-grade glioma.

      The second sequence is currently open and accruing eligible subjects with high-grade glioma.
      The trial is an open-label, randomized study and will accrue a total of 54 evaluable
      patients. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 3 or 6 injections of 131-I
      labeled TM-601 (131-I-TM-601), in weekly intervals at the dose determined in the first
      sequence of the trial. Patients will undergo debulking surgery and placement of a ventricular
      access device into the tumor cavity for administration of 131I-TM-601. Patients who
      participated in the first sequence are not eligible to participate in the second sequence of
      the study.

      High-grade gliomas include; glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma
      or gliosarcoma.

      Patients will undergo follow-up clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      assessments, at defined intervals, until 12 months after the first study dose.
