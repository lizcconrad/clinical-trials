      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given
      together with bryostatin 1 in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temsirolimus and bryostatin 1, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of temsirolimus when
      given together with bryostatin 1 in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the extent and duration of inhibition of p70^S6kinase phosphorylation in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells with tumor growth or reduction in these patients.

      II. Correlate the phosphorylation total and phospho-AKT and total and phospho ribosomal S6
      protein (indicators of mTOR activation) with antitumor effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Correlate tumor expression of phospho-ERK1 and -ERK2 with antitumor effects of this
      regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and temsirolimus IV
      over 30 minutes once on days 8, 15, and 22 during course 1. On subsequent courses patients
      receive bryostatin 1 and temsirolimus once on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
