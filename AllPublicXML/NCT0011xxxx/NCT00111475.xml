    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are: to determine a weekly dose that demonstrates a satisfactory
      safety profile and sustains elevated platelet counts within a targeted therapeutic level (a
      doubling of baseline platelet counts and within the range of greater than or equal to 50 x
      10^9/L and less than or equal to 450 x 10^9/L in thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP; to
      assess Amgen megakaryopoiesis protein 2 [AMP2 (AMG 531)] pharmacokinetics (PK) in
      thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of ITP according to American Society of Hematology (ASH)
        guidelines at least 3 months before enrollment - Have completed at least 1 prior treatment
        for ITP - The mean of the 2 platelet counts taken during the screening and pre-treatment
        periods must be: *less than 30 x 10^9/L for those subjects not receiving any ITP therapy,
        with no count greater than 35 x 10^9/L; less than 50 x 10^9/L for those subjects receiving
        a constant dose schedule of corticosteroids, with no count greater than 55 x 10^9/L -
        Hemoglobin greater than 10.0 g/dL - Written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Any
        known history of bone marrow stem cell disorder - Any active malignancy. If prior history
        of cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ, no treatment or
        active disease within 5 years before randomization - Unstable or uncontrolled disease or
        condition related to or impacting cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart
        failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) greater than class II], uncontrolled
        hypertension [diastolic greater than 100 mmHg] or cardiac arrhythmia) - Have 3 or more of
        the following predisposing factors for thromboembolic events: *diabetes; *smoker using oral
        contraceptives; *hypercholesteremia (greater than 240 mg/dL); *treatment for hypertension -
        Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or hepatitis C virus -
        Received any treatment for ITP (except for a constant dose schedule of corticosteroids)
        within 4 weeks before the screening visit - Received IVIg or WinRho within 2 weeks before
        the screening visit - Received hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-11 (NeumegaÂ®)
        within 4 weeks before the screening visit - Past or present participation in any study
        evaluating PEG-rHuMGDF, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO) or related platelet
        product - Received any alkylating agents within 8 weeks before the screening visit or
        anticipated use during the time of the proposed study - Received any monoclonal antibody
        (eg, rituximab) within 16 weeks before the screening visit or anticipated use during the
        time of the proposed study - Less than 4 weeks since receipt of any therapeutic drug or
        device that is not FDA approved for any indication before the screening period - Less than
        2 months since major surgery (including laparoscopic splenectomy) - Pregnant or breast
        feeding - Subjects of reproductive potential who are not using adequate contraceptive
        precautions, in the judgment of the investigator
