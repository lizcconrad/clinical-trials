      This study will evaluate whether therapy that suppresses the immune system given to treat
      inflammatory diseases of the eye is associated with a greater risk of death and of cancer.
      Inflammatory diseases of the eye, including uveitis, scleritis, and mucous membrane
      pemphigoid, are major blinding diseases. For some patients, treatment with corticosteroids is
      not enough to control the diseases. Researchers expect to gain information about whether
      immunosuppressive therapy is suitable for patients and which substances should be avoided.
      Also, the study will evaluate the frequency of short-term complications with
      immunosuppressive therapy as well as benefits that the therapy can bring to treatment of eye
      diseases.

      The medical charts of patients up to age 65 (median age range of 21 to 65) who have had an
      inflammatory, noninfectious eye disease may be examined for this study. A database will be
      constructed through a chart review of patients seen in the uveitis clinic of the National Eye
      Institute since 1977 and three other sites. Patients who are considered exposed to
      immunosuppressive therapies will be compared with two groups: the general U.S. population and
      an internal group of patients with the same inflammatory eye diseases who did not receive
      immunosuppression. Data regarding about 10,000 to 15,000 patients will be collected. Patients
      will not be identified by the chart reviews. The incidence of cancer will be examined as well
      as the outcomes of immosuppressive therapy as measured by control of the eye disease, visual
      sharpness, changes in the use of corticosteroids, and rates of remission-when disease
      symptoms are lessened.

      Also examined will be medical charts of a control group of patients who did not receive
      immunosuppressive therapy for their uveitis. Data on cancer incidence would be more difficult
      to obtain, requiring personal contact with patients. In such situations, patients will be
      contacted by phone or mail, and those providing informed consent will be asked about their
      medical history, including previous occurrence of cancer and other conditions. For patients
      who have died, the researchers will attempt to communicate with the next of kin regarding
      this medical information.

      BACKGROUND:

      Ocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, scleritis, and mucous membrane pemphigoid,
      are major blinding eye diseases. For some patients, corticosteroid therapy is insufficient to
      control ocular inflammatory disease, such that immunosuppressive therapy is required.
      Immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases has most commonly employed antimetabolite, T-cell
      inhibitor, and/or alkylating agent therapies. It has been suggested, based on studies of
      patients with severe systemic immunologic or other systemic diseases, that such treatments
      may result in an increased risk of cancer and other long-term morbidities. In these studies,
      it has been difficult to determine whether the excess risk arose from the underlying systemic
      diseases or the treatment.

      AIMS:

      The Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) Cohort Study will evaluate
      directly whether immunosuppressive therapy for ocular inflammatory diseases is associated
      with an excess risk of mortality and of cancer. The study is expected to generate critical
      information in deciding whether immunosuppressive therapy is warranted for such patients, and
      whether certain immunosuppressive agents should be avoided. In addition, the study will
      evaluate the frequency of short-term complications with such therapy, and the ocular benefits
      of therapy.

      METHODS:

      The SITE Study will have a classic retrospective cohort design. A database will be
      constructed through a chart review of patients seen here in the Uveitis clinic of the NEI
      since 1977 and 3 other sites. Patients exposed to immunosuppressive therapies will be
      compared to two groups: 1) an external standard, the general United States population; and 2)
      an internal comparison group, patients with the same ocular inflammatory diseases who did not
      receive immunosuppression. Approximately 10000-15000 patients will be accrued from four
      centers which pioneered the use of immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases, beginning
      19-29 years ago. Patients who received immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases, and
      patients with the same ocular inflammatory diagnoses who did not, will be identified by the
      chart reviews. Those who subsequently have died will be identified through a search of the
      National Death Index and/or the Social Security Death Index.

      In addition to overall mortality, cause-specific mortality will be evaluated, as obtained
      from death certificate coding. The data collected here at the NIH will be compared to the
      National Death Index separately from the data from the other centers, via a direct query from
      our center. Abstracted data without identifiers other than study number and letter codes that
      could not be used to identify subjects by anyone outside the LI will be sent to the central
      database. The outcomes of mortality, cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence will be
      analyzed using a relative incidence approach. Description of the short-term complications of
      immunosuppression and of the beneficial effects of immunosuppression on eye diseases also
      will be evaluated. This study's chair is John Kempen at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns
      Hopkins School of Medicine. We will be a participating center.
