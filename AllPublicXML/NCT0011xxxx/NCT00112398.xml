    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that advanced interventions as provided by a physician at an accident
      scene will decrease the death rate and the rate of severe disability in survivors of severe
      head injury. Extended interventions by advanced level prehospital providers may include rapid
      sequence intubation (RSI) airway management, blood transfusions, surgical procedures, etc.

      A randomised, controlled trial examining prehospital management of persons with severe blunt
      head injury, in the Sydney region. Treatments examined will be the current system consisting
      principally of paramedic management (standard care) compared with management by a retrieval
      team lead by a consultant anaesthetist, emergency physician or intensive care specialist.
      Patients for inclusion in the study will be identified by a paramedic screening all &quot;000&quot;
      calls to the ambulance service and identifying persons likely to have severe head injury. The
      principal outcome measure will be their degree of disability measured at 6 months post
      injury.
