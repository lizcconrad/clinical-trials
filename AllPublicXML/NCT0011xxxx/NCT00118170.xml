    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib in treating
      patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma with or without impaired liver or kidney function. Sorafenib may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood
      flow to the cancer. Sorafenib may have different effects in patients who have changes in
      their liver or kidney function

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 in patients with hepatic or renal
      dysfunction (part 1 of the study).

      II. To determine a tolerable starting dose of BAY 43-9006 in patients with varying degrees of
      hepatic or renal dysfunction (part 2 of the study).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 9
      treatment cohorts according to hepatic or renal function.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib once on day 1 and then once daily, twice daily, or every
      other day beginning on day 8 and continuing for 3 months. Patients are re-evaluated at 3
      months. Patients with responding disease may continue study treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per treatment cohort) receive escalating doses of sorafenib until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
