    <textblock>
      Thirty patients will be enrolled into this open-label, single-arm trial designed to assess
      the safety and tolerability of oral deferasirox in adult transfusion dependent
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with iron overload. Patients enrolled in this study
      will have low or intermediate (INT-1) risk MDS per International Prognostic Scoring System
      (IPSS) criteria. All patients will initiate treatment with 20mg/kg/day deferasirox.

      Deferasirox will be administered orally once per day for 12 months.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility to determine if they meet all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. The screening period will be up to 4 weeks. Patient's baseline LIC will be
      determined non-invasively by means of MRI R2 analysis. In addition, blood and urine samples
      will be taken for the determination of baseline safety data.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with low or intermediate (INT-1) risk MDS, determined via IPSS
             criteria, with transfusional iron overload. NOTE: Bone marrow morphology and
             cytogenetic studies completed within 3 months prior to screening can be used if the
             patient has been hematologically stable. Every attempt to obtain cytogenetics studies
             should be made; however, if there is culture failure, repeat marrow aspiration will
             not be mandated. In this case, RAEB with less than 11% marrow blasts will be accepted.

          -  Patients can be EITHER naïve to iron chelation OR have had prior treatment with
             deferoxamine (DFO). DFO must be discontinued the day prior to starting deferasirox
             dosing.

          -  Age: greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Serum ferritin:

               -  For entry into the screening period: serum ferritin greater than or equal to 1000
                  µg/mL on at least two occasions, at least two weeks apart, during the prior year.
                  Samples must be obtained in the absence of concomitant infection;

               -  For enrollment into the study: serum ferritin greater than or equal to 1000 µg/mL
                  at screening (via the central lab) obtained in the absence of concomitant
                  infection

          -  A lifetime minimum of 30 previous packed red cell transfusions

             of contraception, or must have undergone clinically documented total hysterectomy
             and/or oophorectomy, or tubal ligation or be postmenopausal (defined by amenorrhea for
             at least 12 months).

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

             two of three samples obtained for screening)

          -  History of HIV positive test result (ELISA or Western blot)

          -  ECOG performance status greater than 2

          -  Uncontrolled systemic hypertension

          -  Unstable cardiac disease not controlled by standard medical therapy

          -  Third degree atrioventricular (AV) block or QT interval prolongation above the normal

          -  History of clinically relevant ocular toxicity related to iron chelation

          -  Systemic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) which would prevent study
             treatment

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Treatment with a systemic investigational drug within the past 4 weeks or a topical

             distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug. The investigator should be guided
             by evidence of any of the following:

               -  inflammatory bowel syndrome, gastritis, ulcers, gastrointestinal or rectal

               -  major gastrointestinal tract surgery, such as gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or
                  bowel resection;

               -  pancreatic injury or pancreatitis or indications of impaired pancreatic
                  function/injury, as indicated by abnormal lipase or amylase;

               -  urinary obstruction or difficulty in voiding.

          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimens or patients who are considered
             potentially unreliable and/or not cooperative
