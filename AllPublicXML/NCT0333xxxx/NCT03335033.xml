  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are trying to determine if the characterization of &quot;vulnerable&quot; carotid
      artery plaques can be accomplished with ultrasound-based methods that look for vessels in the
      plaque and measure the plaque stiffness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a one time Carotid contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS)
      examination that may take 30-60 minutes. Follow up calls will be made to the Participants at
      6, 12 ,24 and 36 months to ask about occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events.

    <description>Subjects will receive a low mechanical index (0.17-0.20) imaging during ultrasound contrast agent intravenous infusion. Real-time cine-loop including longitudinal and transverse images obtained at least 3 seconds before and 5 minutes after the appearance of the contrast effect in the lumen of the carotid artery will be acquired and digitally stored for offline analysis. Also use of a 3D ultrasound transducer to evaluate the feasibility of using US images with contrast to assess the residual diameter of the diseased vessel. Specifically, two 3D acquisitions of each lesion would be obtained after contrast has been injected.</description>

    <intervention_name>Shear Wave Elastography</intervention_name>
    <description>Shear wave elastography will be performed with the General Electric Logiq E9 scanner acquiring images of each plaque in the longitudinal and transverse imaging planes. In each plane 10 measurements will be made and the in-phase/quadrature (IQ) data will be saved for further analysis. The plaque area in the imaging plane will be user-defined to extract the wave velocity values for a ROI analysis.</description>
