  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A goal of infant formula development is to mimic human milk (HM) both in nutrient composition
      as well as physiologic outcomes. investigators have developed an infant formula for term
      infants that more closely resembles the composition of human milk. The purpose of this study
      is to demonstrate that this formulation meets nutritional requirements and supports age
      appropriate growth of healthy term infants.

      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, study of healthy term formula fed (FF)
      infants. FF infants will be randomized to receive either a experimental infant formula,
      formulated for healthy term infants (Formula B) or a commercially available infant formula
      for healthy term infants (Formula A). Infants will consume the formula for a total of
      16-weeks; infant growth, serum markers for inflammation and tolerance to the formulas will be
      assessed throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants will be eligible to participate if they meet all of the following conditions.

               1. Healthy, term (early term/no less than 37 weeks, 0 days through late term/no
                  greater than 41 weeks, 6 days), singleton infant

               4. ≤14 days post-natal age (Date of Birth = Day 0)

               5. Weight for age ≥ 5th and ≤ 95th percentile for age according to sex-specific
                  World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts

               6. Length for age ≥ 5th and ≤ 95th percentile for age according to sex-specific
                  World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts

               7. Head circumference for age ≥ 5th and ≤ 95th percentile for age according to
                  sex-specific World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts

               8. Weight for length for age ≥ 5th and ≤ 95th percentile for age according to

                  potential study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Infants will be ineligible if they have any of the following conditions that are judged by
        a physician to interfere with the infant's normal growth, development, and/or tolerance to
        an infant formula:

          1. Show evidence of anatomic and physiologic defects of the respiratory tract, or other
             congenital defects (as determined by the clinician);

          2. Show evidence of chronic hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, or
             neurological diseases;

          3. Have a maternal history with known adverse effects on the fetus and/or the newborn
             infant, such as diabetes (gestational diabetes is acceptable if infant's birth weight
             is &lt; 4300 g), active tuberculosis, perinatal infection, or substance abuse

          4. Have a family history of cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy

          5. Are an infant from a multiple birth (twin, triplet, etc.) -
