      The aim of this study is to investigate the long term effects of Kinesio taping applied on
      ankle and peroneal muscle in patients with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is defined as a neurological deficit which lasts more than 24 hours caused by focal or
      global cerebral vascular injury such as embolism and hemorrhage (1). Majority of the stroke
      patients are elderly people and 80 % of them are over 65 years (2). Number of stroke incident
      are likely to be increased in the future because of the aging population (3, 4). Although
      stroke patients' mortality rates are significantly reduced by medical developments many of
      them become disabled. Only a small number of the stroke survivors can be independent in their
      daily life activities at the first week of the event and in the long term 25-75 % of them
      require human assistance (5, 6).

      Balance problems and falls are common in stroke patients. Postural swaying can be observed
      two-folds more in stroke patients compared to the healthy population. Weight-bearing
      asymmetry is an important expecting problem in patients with stroke due to the fact that
      60-80% of body weight bears on unaffected side. Furthermore, it can cause a decrease in
      stability limits which are defined as the greatest distance in every direction a person can
      reach out from a midline vertical position without losing balance, stepping, or requiring a
      support (7).

      Maintaining standing balance on two feet can be done effortlessly by healthy individuals.
      However, difficulties are observed in stroke patients. Maintaining standing balance in stroke
      patients is characterized by both weight-bearing asymmetries developed by transposing more
      weight to the unaffected side and also increased spontaneous postural sways in the frontal
      plane. Muscle weakness, asymmetrical muscle tone, sensory deficit and decrease in body
      proprioception result in a reduced postural stability (8-10). It is considered that Kinesio
      tape (KT) stimulates and activates ankle stiffness, postural control mechanisms and improves
      postural stability. Recently, in addition to all other treatment methods KT stands out
      especially with the purpose of increasing awareness and sensory inputs (11). It was reported
      that KT activates and inhibits muscle activity and improves joint stability (12, 13).
      Therefore, it is found that KT can be effective in improving proprioception for increasing
      balance and postural stability (14, 15). Although there are many studies conducted on healthy
      individuals investigating the role of calf muscles in ankle stabilization, there are only a
      limited number of studies conducted on patients who have sensory deficit (16-19). In
      addition, there are few studies investigating the immediate effects of taping in stroke
      patients yet within our knowledge there is not any study that investigating the long term
      effects of KT (20).

      There is a constant requirement for specific data about stroke rehabilitation methods for
      achieving evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      assess the long term effect of KT applied on ankle and peroneal muscle on both dynamic and
      static balance in patients with stroke.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients' information and contact will be obtaioned from neurologist and willing participant's gender, age and stroke onset data will be processed with a random number generator in order to form groups. Patients will divide into two groups as intervention and control with a normal distrubution of gender, age and stroke onset.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Both group will recevie conventional stroke rehabilitation. Intervention group will receive Kinesio taping and control group would not receive a sham taping due to the possible sensory intervention of sham taping eventhough applying it without any stretch.
Outcomes will be recorded by physical therapist using SPSS and groups would not be specified with letter. Statistical analysis will be conducted by another researcher who does not aware of groups given numbers on SPSS.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance evaluation systems test (BESTest)-Change from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BESTest contains 27 question under 6 subsections (biomechanical, stability limits, postural responses, anticipatory postural adjustments, sensory orientation, and dynamic balance during gait) all of which rates between 0 (unable) - 3 (normal function) points (22) was used to assess the dynamic and static balance during the activities. TUG was used to assess balance, mobility and walking ability of the patients before and after the procedure as a part of the BESTest. However, as a strong indicator of functional mobility we decided to analyze TUG results separately from the overall BESTest outcomes. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test (FRT)-Change from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FRT was used to assess the limits of stability by measuring the distance that a patient can reach forward without losing balance. The test was performed while patient standing on both feet next to a wall. A measurement tape fixed to the wall on the level of patients' acromion. Cut of score was taken as 25 cm. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tetrax balance systems-Change from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tetrax balance system which focuses measuring static balance and postural sways with integrated 4 force plates for tracking weight difference on forefoot and hindfoot. Primary principal of this device is to measure the center of mass and postural sways by using 4 force plates. Assessment was performed while patients standing on the force plates eyes facing forward and without touching anything with their hands. Normal values were taken as 1.0 standard deviation below and 1.5 standard deviation above the mean scores. Higher result related to somato-sensory dysfunction. For weight distribution index it is expected to %25 of total body weight recorded on each plate. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.</description>

    <description>Index for measuring both motor and cognitive independency level of patients under total 18 questions. Scores vary from completely independent to completely dependent. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after first application,one week later and 2 weeks later prior to first assessment.</description>
