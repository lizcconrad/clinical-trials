      The purpose of this (Proof of Concept) PoC study is to assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of intra articular (i.a.) LNA043 in regenerating the articular cartilage
      of the knee at the donor sites of the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) procedure,
      with a hyaline tissue, significantly more often than with placebo.

      The purpose of this (Proof of Concept) PoC study is to assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of intra articular (i.a.) LNA043 in regenerating the articular cartilage
      of the knee at the donor sites of the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) procedure,
      with a hyaline tissue, significantly more often than with placebo. The highest single safe
      dose of LNA043 of the First in Human CLNA043X2101 study will be used.

      This is a non-confirmatory, patient and investigator blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group, single dose study in patients with cartilage lesions undergoing autologous
      cartilage implantation (ACI). Approximately 22 patients will be enrolled in the study to
      allow 18 completers. Participants will be treated only on one occasion (Day 1) with a single
      i.a. injection that will be performed under arthroscopic visualization.

      The primary efficacy variable, GAG content change and bi-layer collagen organization in the
      cartilage repair tissue at the donor sites based on 7T MRI at week 4, and key secondary
      endpoints, will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance
      model, including all timepoints, to compare treatment groups.
