  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the principle functionality of the device will be tested in humans for the
      first time. The study will evaluate the extent to which patients with atrophic dry age
      related macular degeneration (AMD) have evoked light perception using the implant.

      In this study subjects are provided with a PRIMA sub-retinal implant in one eye. A camera
      integrated in the external components of the implant captures visual information of the
      environment, this information is processed by a pocket processor and then transmitted via
      projected IR light onto the implant. The implant received the projected IR light and
      stimulates the nerve cells of the retina. Interim analysis will be performed at 6 months
      after implantation.

    <description>The PRIMA Bionic Vision System is a device for treatment of patients who have lost their sight through outer retinal degenerative conditions of the eye such as atrophic dry age related macular degeneration.
The PRIMA System is designed to provide partial restoration of the patient's visual function through electrical stimulation of the retinal neurons by a sub-retinally implanted stimulator that replace part of the degenerate photoreceptors</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is 60 years or older at the date of enrolment;

          -  Has a confirmed diagnosis of advanced dry age related macular degeneration with an
             atrophy size of at least 3 optic disc diameters;

          -  Has best corrected visual acuity of the study eye of logMAR 1.3 (20/400) or worse
             measured by ETDRS;

          -  Has no foveal perception measured by micro-perimetry in the study eye (≤ 4 dB on Opko
             scale or equivalent) ;

          -  Has a study eye that is able to perceive light;

          -  Has useful vision on the non-study eye;

          -  Has a refraction of study eye between -3 and + 4 (limits included) for patient with
             IOL (there is no refraction criteria for patients with natural lens);

          -  Understands and accepts the obligation to present for all schedule follow-up visits.

          -  Patient signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has cataracts that may influence the visual function of the study eye;

          -  Has an aphakic study eye

          -  Had cataract surgery in the last 1 month;

          -  Active sub-macular choroidal neovascularization in the study eye;

          -  Has any disease (other than study allowed diseases) or condition that affects retinal
             function of the study eye (e.g., central retinal artery/vein occlusion, end-stage
             diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, infectious or inflammatory retinal disease,
             severe glaucoma, optic neuropathy, myopic chorio-retinal atrophy etc.);

          -  Has an implanted telescope in one eye;

          -  Has any disease or condition that prevents adequate examination of the study eye
             including, but not limited to, corneal degeneration that cannot be resolved prior to
             implantation. Note, that this criterion is also important for the function of the
             implant;

          -  Has an endothelia cell count of less than 1000 cells/mm² in the study eye;

          -  Suffers from nystagmus;

             informed consent, study requirements or test protocols (e.g., deafness, severe
             multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, severe neuritis, etc);

          -  Has a history of epileptic seizure;

          -  Has another active implanted device (e.g. cochlear implant, pacemaker) that may
             interfere with the device function, or diagnoses requiring such an active implant;

          -  Has active cancer or a history of intraocular, optic nerve or brain cancer and
             metastasis;

          -  Is an immune-suppressed subject (e.g., due to HIV positive diagnosis, etc.);

          -  Is carrier of multi-resistant germs;

          -  Is receiving anticoagulation therapy that cannot be adapted to allow eye surgery;

          -  Is participating in another investigational drug or device study that may interfere
             with the present study;

          -  Patients with recurrent or chronic inflammations or infections are excluded from the
             study. Specifically, patients with the following disorders are excluded:

               -  Common inflammation - severe chronic and consuming diseases that frequently
                  associated with infection (e.g. Crohn disease, Whipple's disease);

               -  Active inflammation in the area of the eye (e.g. herpes of cornea and/or
                  conjunctiva, recurrent blepharoconjunctivitis, hordeolum, chalazion);

          -  Has a severe psychological disorder. When in any doubt, an expert assessment needs to
             be arranged to clarify whether the patient's psychological health is suitable for the
             trial. In any doubts of the subjects psychological status a clinical psychologist,
             psychologist or the community doctor/general practitioner should be involved. The
             patient must have the legal capacity to sign the informed consent;

          -  Has severe renal, cardiac, hepatic etc. organ diseases;
