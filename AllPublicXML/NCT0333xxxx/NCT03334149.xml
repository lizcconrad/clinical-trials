  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raised blood pressure is a common problem in pregnancy. Raised blood pressure and
      pre-eclampsia affect about one in ten women and are a major cause of death and premature
      birth in the United Kingdom and worldwide.

      Many women have expressed an interest in monitoring their own blood pressure in between
      antenatal visits but there has been very little research to guide this. The investigators
      would like to know if the diagnosis and subsequent care of women with raised blood pressure
      can be improved if women were able to monitor their own blood pressure safely at home. This
      work will test whether optimising the diagnosis, monitoring and management of raised BP
      during pregnancy through self-monitoring of BP is effective, acceptable and cost-effective
      compared to usual care.

      The research team have being working with pregnant women, doctors and midwives to develop a
      simple and accurate method of self-monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy.

      This randomised controlled trial will:

        1. Compare self-monitoring with usual care in women at higher risk of hypertension in
           pregnancy and assess if self-monitoring can identify raised blood pressure earlier.

        2. Compare self-monitoring with usual care for women with high blood pressure in pregnancy
           to see if it leads to lower blood pressure.

        3. Assess if self-monitoring is cost-effective.

      Pregnant women who chose to take part in these studies will be randomised to either usual
      care or asked to monitor their own blood pressure during their pregnancy in addition to their
      usual antenatal care.

      BUMP 1 will randomise 2262 women at higher risk of hypertension in pregnancy into usual care
      or self-monitoring.

      BUMP 2 will randomise 512 women with hypertension in pregnancy (including chronic
      hypertension) into usual care or self-monitoring. Women in BUMP 1 will move into BUMP 2 if
      they develop hypertension.

      Women will be recruited at approximately 10 hospitals in England over approximately 18
      months.

      Women will be recruited from 20 weeks (BUMP 1) or early pregnancy(BUMP 2) and followed up
      until 2 months after birth.

    <intervention_model_description>Note Women in BUMP 1 will transfer to BUMP 2 if they develop hypertension. Women in BUMP 2 can be randomised de novo or join from BUMP 1 maintaining their original randomisation. The enrolment number below therefore includes BUMP 1 (2262) plus BUMP 2 (512) but because of the overlap, the total number of women is anticipated to be 2412.</intervention_model_description>
