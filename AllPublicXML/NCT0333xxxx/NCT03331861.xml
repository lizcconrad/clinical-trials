    <textblock>
      Columbia University Medical Center is conducting a pilot clinical research study that will
      assess the use of the medication metformin for heart failure in patients who are not
      diabetic.

      Patients will received either the study drug metformin or placebo for 4 months. During the
      study, the patients will undergo extensive testing that will include symptom assesment,
      exercise capacity, echocardiography and blood tests.
