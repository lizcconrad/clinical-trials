  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed 2-week, double-blind, crossover, proof of concept study aims to measure and
      manipulate core neurochemical (i.e., dysregulated brain GABA/glutamate homeostasis) and
      neurobehavioral (i.e., elevated impulsivity) dysfunctions characteristic of individuals with
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD), using a medication that has been shown
      to increase cortical GABA (i.e., gabapentin) levels in past research, and to evaluate
      medication-related changes in response inhibition (go no-go) and cannabis cue reactivity
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging tasks, as well as cannabis use, mood symptoms
      (including anxiety and sleep), and impulsivity in individuals with CUD+BD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is the Axis I condition most strongly associated with cannabis use
      disorder (CUD); there is a six-fold increase in the prevalence of CUD in individuals with BD
      relative to the general population. Individuals with co-occurring CUD and BD (CUD+BD) have
      substantially worse clinical outcomes than those with either BD or CUD alone. Response to
      mood stabilizing medications appears to be poor, yet little is known about optimal treatment
      for CUD+BD, as there have been no randomized medication trials for CUD+BD to date. Convergent
      evidence supports dysregulated brain Î³-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis as a
      candidate target for pharmacological intervention in CUD+BD. Preclinical and clinical studies
      have demonstrated that CUD and BD are each associated with prefrontal GABA and glutamate
      disturbances and that impulsivity, a core neurobehavioral feature of both CUD and BD and a
      key Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct, is causally related to GABAergic/glutamatergic
      functioning. Gabapentin has been consistently shown in preclinical research to modulate GABA
      and glutamate transmission. In human Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies,
      both acute and chronic gabapentin dosing have been shown to increase brain GABA levels,
      however, few studies have investigated gabapentin effects on glutamate levels. Researchers
      propose that gabapentin may impact clinical outcomes in CUD+BD individuals both directly and
      indirectly through their impact on impulsivity.
