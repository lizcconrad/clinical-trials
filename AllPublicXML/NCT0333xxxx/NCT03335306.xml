    <textblock>
      Background: Different people are classified into different physiological constitution types
      in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory. Two instruments, the Body Constitution
      Questionnaire (BCQ) and the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ), have been
      developed in Taiwan and Mainland China respectively to measure constitution. They were
      adapted and pilot tested in primary care Chinese patients in Hong Kong, which showed
      acceptable validity and reliability. These instruments have potential applications for
      epidemiological studies on body constitution.

      Aim and objectives: The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence and epidemiology of
      body constitution classified by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory in the Chinese
      population in Hong Kong. It would also determine whether the prevalence of constitution types
      change with seasons and whether it is associated with socio-demographic factors, place of
      origin or residence, life style, or quality of life.

      Design and subjects: Two cross-sectional telephone surveys of the Hong Kong (HK) general
      Chinese population, one in Summer and one in Winter, will be carried out. Sample size for
      each survey is 3200 subjects.

      Methods: Residential-telephone-owning households will be contacted through random dialing by
      the Social Science and Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong using the
      Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system that covers 95% households in Hong
      Kong. A member, aged 18 or above, of the contacted household who last had his/her birthday
      will be invited to the study to answer either the BCQ or the CCMQ and a structured
      questionnaire on socio-demographics, place of origin, place of residence, health service
      utilization, life style and quality of life.
