  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the emergence of avian influenza A/H7N9 influenza virus in humans in China in March
      2013, the WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories prepared candidate vaccine viruses and
      reagents for further development and several manufacturers have developed various inactivated
      influenza vaccines with and without adjuvant against A/H7N9 and tested these candidates in
      trials in healthy adults. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity and dose sparing effects of H7N9 influenza antigen produced by Butantan
      Institute in combination with 2 different adjuvants.

          -  Laboratory values at screening equal to or greater than Grade 2 will be considered to
             be exclusionary. Vital signs may be performed up to three times to allow for transient
             conditions to resolve. Screening laboratory values that are out of range, but are
             considered to be due to an acute illness or process may be repeated once. Grade 1
             laboratory values will be reviewed by a licensed study clinician and the clinician
             will determine whether the laboratory abnormality is clinically significant and should
             be considered exclusionary. If determined to be clinically insignificant, the study
             team is not required to follow the laboratory until resolution or the value is
             determined to be clinically stable.
