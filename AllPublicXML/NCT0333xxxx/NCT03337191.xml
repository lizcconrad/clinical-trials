  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal epidural block has been widely used, especially in pediatric surgery, to provide
      intraoperative and postoperative analgesia by affecting the region between T10 and S5
      dermatomes in surgeries below the umbilical level.

      In conventional single-shot caudal block, the needle is inserted through the skin with a
      60-80 degrees angle, until the sacrococcygeal ligament is passed through. Then the angle of
      the needle is decreased to 20-30 degrees and inserted further for an additional 2-3 mm,
      entering into the sacral canal.There is a risk of dural or vascular puncture when the needle
      is passing through sacral canal. Other complications are the soft tissue bulging,
      intraosseous injections and systemic toxicity.

      Many anatomical variations have been reported for sacral hiatus and sacral cornua. Therefore,
      the success rate of the classic caudal epidural anesthesia method in pediatric patients has
      been reported to be about 75%.

      With the usage of ultrasonography in regional anesthesia, many advantages have been reported.
      Ultrasonography is helpful for visualization of the sacral hiatus, sacrococcygeal ligament,
      duramater, epidural space and the distribution of the local anesthetic agent within the
      epidural space. Therefore, this significantly increases the block success.

      The primary aim of this study was compare the success rate of ultrasound guided sacral hiatus
      injection and conventional sacral canal injection. Secondary objectives are; block performing
      time, number of needle puncture, success at first puncture and complication rate.
