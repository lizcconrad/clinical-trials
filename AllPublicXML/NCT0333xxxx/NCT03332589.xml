  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of E6201 for the treatment of CNS metastases in BRAF or MEK-mutated
      metastatic melanoma. A total of up to N=24 subjects with melanoma metastasized to the CNS
      will be included.

      Selected subjects will be: both males and females age ≥18 years; histologically confirmed
      melanoma with BRAF or MEK mutation with CNS metastasis; archived tumor sample from the
      primary, recurrent or metastatic disease with documented BRAF or MEK mutation; recovered from
      all acute toxicities (≥ Grade 1) due to prior therapy; determined to have adequate renal and
      hepatic function, and no known history of significant cardiac disease.
