      The S.P.I.C.E registry is an investigator-initiated prospective multicenter cohort study
      which will be conducted in 35 ICUS in the Paris area.The aim of the study is to determine the
      trajectory of acute stroke patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, focusing on
      functional outcomes at 3 months and 1 year following ICU admission. This project is funded by
      the French Agence Régionale de Santé (ARS).

        The subjects included in this study are major patients, victims of an AVC, having been
        admitted in ICU and having required an invasive artificial ventilation in the aigüe phase
        of their AVC ( 7 days).

        The future of these patients can be marked by a prolonged invasive ventilation of several
        weeks in several months or by a death in ICU or in another department of the hospital of
        short stay, or afterward, in their place of residence or in the various existing structures
        of average and long stay.

        The future can also be a strong support. The patients needing no more invasive ventilation,
        are transferred by the ICU towards another department of care then, in the best case,
        return at home. The routes of care of these patients are varied according to their needs.

          -  Hospitalized in ICU in 7 days before or after the diagnosis of AVC.

          -  Requiring an invasive mechanical ventilation of more than 24 hours during the stay in
             ICU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Source of traumatic AVC

          -  Refusal of the patient, or his reliable person, to participate in the study.
