          4. Non-vasectomized male subjects having a female partner of childbearing potential must
             agree to the use of an effective method of contraception until 90 days after the last
             administration of study drug.

          5. Subjects have to agree not to donate sperm until 90 days after the last administration
             of study drug.

          6. Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             laboratory findings.

          7. Agree to discontinue and refrain from intake of all medications, except occasional
             paracetamol use (maximum dose of 2 g/day and maximum of 10 g/2 weeks), at least 2
             weeks prior to the first study drug administration. In addition, subjects must agree
             to the prohibitions and restrictions for this study.

          8. Subject is a non-smoker, and not using any nicotine containing products. A non-smoker
             is defined as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 1 year prior
             to Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to study drug ingredients or a significant allergic reaction to
             any drug as determined by the investigator, such as anaphylaxis requiring
             hospitalization.

          2. Active infection; a recent serious infection (i.e., requiring injectable antimicrobial
             therapy or hospitalization) within the 8 weeks prior to screening.

          3. Subjects with known clinically relevant immunological disorders.

          4. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions.

          5. Known history or any symptom of clinically significant illness in the 6 months before
             the first study drug administration.

          6. Presence or having sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver, kidney or other conditions
             known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             drugs.

          7. History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence).

          8. Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on ECG regarding either rhythm or
             conduction (e.g., QTcF &gt; 450 ms [millisecond], or a known long QT syndrome). A first
             degree heart block or sinus arrhythmia will not be considered as a significant
             abnormality.

          9. Clinically relevant abnormalities detected on vital signs prior to first dosing.

         10. Significant blood loss (including blood donation [&gt; 500 mL]), or had a transfusion of
             any blood product within 12 weeks prior to the initial study drug administration or
             plan one within 4 weeks after the end of the study.

         11. Treatment with any drug known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major
             organ in the last 3 months preceding the initial study drug administration.

         12. The subject has a history of consuming more than 21 units of alcoholic beverages per
             week or has a history of alcoholism or drug/chemical/substance abuse within past 2
             years prior to screening (Note: one unit = 330 mL of beer, 110 mL of wine or 28 mL of
             spirits).

         13. Consumption of a large quantity of coffee, tea (&gt; 6 cups per day) or equivalent.

         14. Concurrent participation or participation within 90 days prior to the initial study
             drug administration in a drug/device or biologic investigational research study.

         15. Administration of a vaccine within 60 days prior to initial study drug administration.

         16. Administration of any systemic immunosuppressant agent within 6 months prior to
             initial study drug administration.

         17. Administration of any systemic steroid within 2 months prior to initial study drug
             administration.

         18. Administration of an injectable drug within 30 days prior to the initial study drug
             administration.

         20. Any condition or circumstances that in the opinion of the investigator may make a
