  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FLX-787-106 study will determine how well FLX-787-ODT works to reduce fasciculations in
      patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The study will measure how often
      fasciculations occur, and monitor any side effects that might develop while taking the
      investigational product. Participants will be assessed before and after taking a single dose
      of FLX-787-ODT. Approximately 15 people will take part in this study at one center in the
      United States. Participants will be in the study for a single clinic visit and receive a
      telephone call 7 days later to monitor for side effects.
