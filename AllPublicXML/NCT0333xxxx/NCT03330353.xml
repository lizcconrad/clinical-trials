    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to investigate rod, cone and melanopsin driven pupillary
      light response in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), age-matched healthy
      controls and individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases using chromatic pupillometry,
      with special interest in assessing melanopsin-driven post-illumination pupil response (PIPR)
      as an identifier for PSP.

      The study addresses the following hypotheses:

        1. Chromatic pupil responses, including rod/cone-driven rapid phase constriction and
           melanopsin-driven PIPR, are reduced in subjects with PSP compared to age-matched normal
           healthy control subjects,

        2. Pupil parameters of the melanopsin-driven PIPR are abnormal in PSP subjects without
           supranuclear palsy, which is indicative of a subclinical physiological deficit of the
           OPN in the early stages of PSP.

      If these hypotheses are upheld, chromatic pupillometry to measure the PIPR promises to be a
      reliable in vivo, non-invasive, convenient and inexpensive technique to detect asymptomatic
      pupillomotor impairment in advance of diagnostic oculomotor signs and deterioration of
      cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1963, Richardson, Steele and Olszewski published a landmark clinical report on 8 cases of
      supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, nuchal dystonia and dementia and
      established the syndrome of heterogeneous system degeneration as a clinicopathological entity
      now known as PSP. The disease has a characteristic onset in the sixth decade (range 45 to 75
      years) with some combination of impaired balance, abrupt falls, visual disturbances, slurred
      speech, dysphasia and vague changes in personality.

      Slowing of voluntary vertical saccades, either down, up or both are a diagnostic marker of
      PSP and later impairment of voluntary horizontal saccades are characteristic in more than
      half of the cases. However, a proportion of PSP patients do not demonstrate these eye signs
      for a year or more after the onset of the disease.

      This pilot study will use chromatic pupillometry to determine whether such a novel
      methodology may be used as an objective in vivo identifier of PSP. The rationale for the
      study is based in part on:

        1. Clinicopathological correlation between the key clinical signs of a supranuclear gaze
           palsy with pathological verification that the degenerative process affects the pretectum
           and rostral midbrain,

        2. The melanopsin-signaling pathway from ipRGCs (intrinsically photosensitive retinal
           ganglion cells) in the eye projects to the OPN (olivary pretectal nucleus) in the
           midbrain,

        3. Chromatic pupillometry is a non-invasive technique suitable for elderly subjects with or
           without dementia.
