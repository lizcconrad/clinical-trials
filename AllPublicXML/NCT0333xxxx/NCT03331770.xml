    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of a new formulation of latanoprost
      without Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK-free). Patients with open-angle glaucoma who were using
      BAK-containing latanoprost ophthalmic solution for ≥6 months, switched to BAK-free
      latanoprost ophthalmic emulsion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F2alfa analogue that increases the uveoscleral outflow of
      aqueous humor, resulting in a intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Benzalkonium chloride
      (BAK) is usually employed in formulations of prostaglandin analogues due to its dual action
      of preservative and adjuvant in the formulation. However, this preservative has known toxic
      effects on the ocular surface, causing ocular dryness and discomfort on long-term use.
      Benzalkonium Chloride-free (BAK-free)Latanoprost is a new formulation approved for the use in
      patients with primary open angle glaucoma /ocular hypertension. In this study, patients that
      were using BAK-containing latanoprost for ≥6 months, switched to a new formulation of
      BAK-free latanoprost ophthalmic emulsion to evaluate its hypotensive action and quantify the
      changes in ocular surface parameters.
