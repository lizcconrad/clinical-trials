  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare contrast agents, Dotarem or MultiHance. The study
      will test to see how much of these two contrast agents are deposited in the bones or tissues
      of pediatric patients. The patients receiving contrast will then be compared against
      pediatric patients who have not received any contrast prior to cardiac surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When injected into the body, gadolinium contrast medium makes certain tissues, abnormalities
      or disease processes more clearly visible on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and
      therefore gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in medical imaging.
      Recently, new evidence suggests that following GBCA administration, gadolinium can be
      deposited in body tissues even in the presence of normal renal function. Therefore, it is
      essential to ensure that significant accumulation of free Gd3+ is not occurring in the bones
      of children undergoing clinical contrasted MRI scans. This is particularly important for
      those pediatric patients who will undergo multiple repeated MRI exams throughout their
      lifetime and thereby be exposed to a large cumulative dose of gadolinium contrast. As the
      differences in stability between the various GBCAs may be a factor in gadolinium exposure,
      the primary objective of this study is to assess gadolinium deposition in the bones of
      pediatric patients in two patient groups: 1. patients who received IV administration of
      gadolinium contrast agent (Dotarem) and 2. patients who received IV administration of
      gadolinium contrast agent (MultiHance).

      Once acquired the samples will be analyzed at an off-site facility, National Institute of
      Standards and Technology (NIST), using standardized equipment which has been certified for
      measuring gadolinium concentration in contrast agent samples. A signed agreement for the
      transfer of non-proprietary biological material between MUSC and NIST covers the transfer of
      the samples.

    <description>To determine the gadolinium concentration present in sternum and rib bone tissue in 2 groups of pediatric patients requiring cardiac surgery as part of their standard clinical treatment: (1) patients who had undergone the administration of a standard clinical dose of a linear GBCA (0.1 mmol/kg IV MultiHance), and (2) patients who had undergone the administration of a standard clinical dose of a macrocyclic GBCA (0.1 mmol/kg IV Dotarem). As a control, gadolinium concentration present in sternum bone tissue will also be determined in patients who had not been exposed to GBCA administration prior to surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asses the number of exposures to contrast agent as a potential confounder.</measure>
    <time_frame>July 2017 to June 2019</time_frame>
    <description>Number of exposures to contrast agent is a potential confounder. Thus we will perform linear regression, with concentration as the outcome, and both type of contrast agent (i.e. group) and number of doses as independent variables. Although the sample size is small, we may consider evaluating an interaction between type of contrast and number of doses as an exploratory analysis.</description>
