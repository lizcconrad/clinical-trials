      This study determined the glycemic index and glycemic load of six Greek honey varieties

      This randomized, double-blind, cross-over study investigated the glycemic response to six
      Greek honey grades differing in floral source and carbohydrate composition. Isoglucidic test
      meals (50g available carbohydrate) and 50g glucose reference were given to 11 clinically and
      metabolically healthy, fasting individuals (27±7 years; 9 women; BMI 24±4kg/m2), in random
      order. GI was calculated using the FAO/WHO method. Capillary blood glucose samples were
      collected at 0,15,30,45,60,90-and-120min. Salivary insulin samples were collected at
      0,60-and-120min. Subjective appetite ratings (hunger, fullness and desire to eat) were
      assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS, 100mm) at baseline and 120min.

    <masking_description>Participants were assigned to the interventions using a sequence of random numbers extracted from computer software. A researcher not involved with the collection and the analysis of the scientific data, was responsible for the randomization of the volunteers to the intervention days examining the test foods. All test meals (glucose and honeys) were diluted in 300ml water and were served in dark paper cups covered with a lid in order to achieve double blind conditions.</masking_description>
