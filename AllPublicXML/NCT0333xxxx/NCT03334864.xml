      Investigators propose to establish and maintain a cohort of patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer, and to assess the treatment pattern, host genetic, and clinical factors
      which influence the prognosis and survival, as well as the interaction among these factors on
      disease diagnosis and treatment, short and long-term outcomes.
