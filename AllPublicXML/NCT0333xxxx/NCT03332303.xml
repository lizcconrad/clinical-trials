    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group that are identified as Responders at the end of the treatment period evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9. A Responder is defined as a patient with at least a 25% reduction from baseline in the sum of % basal/parabasal + % intermediate cells on vaginal cytology AND vaginal pH &lt; 5.0 with a change from baseline vaginal pH of at least 0.5.</description>

    <measure>The secondary efficacy endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 8 or Study Day 9</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group that are considered a Treatment Success at the end of the treatment period evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9. A &quot;Treatment Success&quot; is defined as a score of 0 or 1 on Day 8 or Day 9 for the symptom identified at baseline as the most bothersome. This evaluation will be based on (one) patient self-assessed symptom of VVA (vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, or vaginal pain associated with sexual activity) on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = none and 3 = severe. Evaluation of vaginal bleeding during sexual activity will be based on a score of 1 (presence) if it is identified by the patient as the most bothersome symptom at baseline and a score of 0 (absent) on Day 8 or Day 9.</description>

                  hysterectomy.

               3. Hysterectomy without oophorectomy if of age that the Investigator believes would
                  have naturally reached 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea if uterus had remained
                  intact.

          3. Patients with a serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level of ≥ 40 mIU/mL at
             Screening.

          4. Have ≤ 5% superficial cells on vaginal smear cytology.

          5. Have a vaginal pH &gt; 5.0.

          6. At least one of the following patient self-assessed moderate to severe symptoms of VVA
             from the following list that is identified by the patient as being the most bothersome
             to her:

               -  Vaginal Dryness

               -  Vaginal and/or Vulvar Irritation/Itching

                    -  Provided that patient is currently sexually active and plans to remain so
                       throughout the study.

          7. Have &quot;Normal&quot; Screening mammogram completed within 9 months before Screening in all
             patients &gt; 40 years old, with no findings that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would indicate any suspicion of breast malignancy.

          8. Normal clinical breast examination at Screening.

          9. Patients with an intact uterus (including patients who underwent a partial
             hysterectomy) must have a documented papanicolaou (PAP) smear conducted within the
             previous 12 months with no findings that the Investigator believes would
             contraindicate the use of topical vaginal estradiol.

         10. Patients with an intact uterus should have vaginal ultrasonography results within 3
             months before Screening to confirm an inactive endometrial lining, defined as
             endometrial thickness &lt; 4 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant history or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder or other medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion

             integrity of the study evaluations.

          2. Any clinically significant laboratory finding that, in the Investigator's opinion
             would contraindicate the use of estradiol or compromise patient safety.

          3. Patients with known concurrent vaginal infections including but not limited to:
             Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea or
