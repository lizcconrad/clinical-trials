  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several projects in high altitude research in environments with a low oxygen partial pressure
      (hypobaric hypoxia) leading to hypoxemia showed, that cerebral perfusion and cerebral
      performance could be improved by adding C02 (cabon dioxide).

      The investigators hypothesize that adding 5% C02 to 02 (Oxygen) also under normobaric
      conditions increases the time until a significant cerebral hyopxia is measured by near
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) compared to the administration of 95% 02.

      lf this hypothesis proves to be true, this approach might be used in situations in which
      individuals are prone to cerebral hypoxia. In bariatric surgery, patients that experience an
      apnea phase are more prone to (cerebral) hypoxia due to the fact, that they have a higher
      body mass index (BMI) leading to a reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), which serves
      as the oxygen reserve in the body.

      On the day of surgery patients will be randomized. After induction of anesthesia and
      endotracheal intubation patients will be managed by the study team to perform the
      intervention and the measurements.

      According to randomization, investigational medical product (IMP) or comparator will be
      administrated by ventilator 1/ventilator 2.

      At time point 1 apnea will be performed by disconnecting the ventilator from the endotracheal
      tube until the NIRS value has dropped by 20% from baseline. After that, re-ventilation will
      be resumed immediately, until parameters have returned to baseline.

      During apnea time NIRS and vital signs will be recorded permanently, blood samples will be
      drawn at definite time points.

      Application of IMP (or comparator) will be performed in this cross-over study design in the
      same manner after the baseline level is reached again.

      At the end of the study procedure, after the baseline level of end-expiratory CO2 is reached
      again, patient will be taken over by the clinical anesthesia team and surgeons.
