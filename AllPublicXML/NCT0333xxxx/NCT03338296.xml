    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female adolescents, age 12 to 17 years (inclusive) at Screening, with
             a body mass index (BMI) that is greater than or equal to the United States-weighted
             mean of the 95th percentile based on age and sex with a body weight greater than 60
             kilograms (kg). Participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may have a
             pre-existing or new diagnosis of T2DM.

        Participants with pre-existing T2DM should have prior documentation consistent with the
        diagnosis and/or be on active pharmacotherapy for T2DM.

        Participants with a new diagnosis of T2DM (ie, diagnosed at Screening) should be based on
        the 2016 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. The diagnostic criteria are met if
        a participant has unequivocal hyperglycemia (random plasma glucose ≥200 milligrams per
        deciliter (mg/dL) (11.1 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]) with classic symptoms of
        hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis) OR any of the following criteria are observed and
        confirmed:

          -  HbA1c ≥6.5%

          -  fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)

          -  2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) by an oral glucose tolerance test
             (OGTT) All T2DM participants must have an HbA1c &lt;10% at Screening. If participants are
             being or need to be treated with antidiabetic agents, the T2DM treatment regimen must
             be stable for at least 3 months before randomization. A single rescreen is allowed
             following stabilization. Stable control refers to minimal dose changes to existing
             medications for glycemic control and no medications being initiated for glycemic
             control in the 3 months before randomization. Minimal changes are defined as a change
             without any change in dose frequency, no add-on or discontinuation of other
             antidiabetic agents and the participant has not been hospitalized due to hypo- or
             hyperglycemic events.

               -  Participants and their families not planning to move away from the area for the
                  duration of the study

               -  Participants able and willing to comply with all aspects of the study, including
                  a standardized, reduced calorie diet and an age appropriate, increased physical
                  activity program

               -  Participants considered in stable health in the opinion of the investigator

               -  Caregivers or guardians meet the following requirements:

                    -  Able and willing to support and supervise study participation in the opinion
                       of the investigator, including consideration of any existing physical,
                       medical, or mental condition that prevents compliance with the protocol

                    -  Able and willing to personally comply with and execute all aspects of the
                       study requirements for the caregivers or guardians

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant new illness within 1 month before randomization that may affect
             the participant's ability to fulfill the study requirements or significantly confound
             the assessments

          -  Participants who cannot swallow investigational products

          -  Participants with T2DM who have hypoglycemia unawareness

          -  Any of the following findings on Screening echocardiography:

               -  Aortic regurgitation mild or greater

               -  Mitral regurgitation moderate or greater

               -  Mitral or aortic valve stenosis greater than mild (ie, aortic stenosis: jet &gt;3.0
                  meters per second [m/s], mean gradient &gt;25 millimeters of mercury [mmHg], and
                  aortic valve area &lt;1.5 centimeters squared [cm^2]; mitral stenosis: mean gradient
                  &gt;5 mmHg and mitral valve area &lt;1.5 cm^2)

               -  Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) &gt;40 mmHg (and/or tricuspid
                  regurgitation [TR] jet velocity &gt;2.9 m/s) In cases where an actual SPAP value is
                  not measurable due to lack of adequate TR jet, the pulmonary flow acceleration
                  time measured at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOTAT) will be used to
                  assess eligibility. Participants with a RVOTAT ≤100 milliseconds (msec) will be
                  excluded, suggesting an elevated mean SPAP; eligibility for the those
                  participants with RVOTAT between 100 and 120 msec will be determined based on
                  combined assessment of the TR jet, septal motion, and right ventricular size.
