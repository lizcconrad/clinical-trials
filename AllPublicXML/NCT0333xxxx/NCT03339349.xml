  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) after orthopedic surgery are as high as 40-60%
      without prophylactic measures. Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, produces an
      anticoagulant effect by binding antithrombin, thereby accelerating antithrombin's
      inactivation of coagulation factor Xa (FXa), thus decreasing the likelihood of clot
      formation. Despite standard dosing enoxaparin prophylaxis, VTE rates in post-operative
      orthopedic trauma patients remain as high as 12.2%.The investigators will examine enoxaparin
      pharmacokinetics and test whether a clinical protocol for real-time enoxaparin dose
      adjustment can favorably alter the proportion of patients with in-range anti-Factor Xa (aFXa)
      levels. Outcomes will include peak and trough steady-state aFXa levels in response to
      standard and escalated doses of enoxaparin and the incidence of venous thromboembolism and
      bleeding events post-surgery. In the trauma and orthopaedic populations, patients with low
      initial aFXa levels are significantly more likely to develop deep venous thrombosis. Thus,
      this study has important implications for appropriate enoxaparin dose magnitude and
      frequency, and may ultimately help to decrease the substantial morbidity and mortality
      associated with post-operative VTE.

    <description>Eligible patients will have steady state peak and trough anti-Xa levels drawn after the third enoxaparin dose. For patients in-range (levels 0.2-0.4 IU/mL), no intervention will be undertaken. For patients out of range, enoxaparin dose will be adjusted according to an established dose adjustment algorithm. Repeat levels will be checked after the third administration of the new dose.</description>
