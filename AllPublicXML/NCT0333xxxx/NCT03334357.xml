      FIT-AGING will determine the effect of different exercise modalities on α-Klotho protein
      (primary outcome) in sedentary healthy adults. FIT-AGING also investigate the physiological
      consequences of activating Klotho gene (secondary outcomes).

      Aims: The plasma Klotho protein concentration (α-Klotho protein), which is considered a
      powerful biomarker of longevity, makes it an attractive target as an anti-aging therapy
      against functional decline, sarcopenic obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases,
      osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Physical exercise and physical fitness, could
      be α-Klotho protein activators through biochemical process. FIT-AGING will determine the
      effect of different exercise modalities on α-Klotho protein (primary outcome) in sedentary
      healthy adults. FIT-AGING also investigate the physiological consequences of activating
      Klotho gene (secondary outcomes).

      Methods: FIT-AGING will recruit 60 sedentary, healthy, adults (50% women) aged 40-65 years.
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a non-exercise group to the usual control
      group (n=15), physical activity recommendation from American College of Sport Medicine, World
      Health Organization and American Heart Association group (n=15), High Intensity Interval
      Training group (n=15)) and Whole-Body Electromyostimulation group (n=15). Laboratory measures
      completed at baseline and 12 weeks later, include α-Klotho protein concentration, physical
      fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength), body composition, resting metabolic
      rate, hearth rate variability (HRV), health blood biomarkers, free-living physical activity,
      sleep habits reaction time, cognitive variables and health-related questionnaires. The
      investigators will also obtain dietary habits data and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

    <arm_group_label>PAR group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The volume in PAR is based on the minimum physical activity recommended (150min/week at moderate intensity).
Intensity selected for PAR aerobic training is 60-65% HRres. Strength intensity selected was 40-50% of 1 RM.
Frequency. PAR group will train 3 days/week, the minimum frequency recommended. Exercises programmed for the aerobic exercise are treadmill, cycle-ergometer and elliptical ergometer in aerobic training part and weight bearing and guided pneumatic machines (involved major upper and lower body muscle group) in resistance training.
Training load variation. We propose a gradual progression to control the exercise dose Training periodization divided in two phases of 5 weeks each one, starting with a familiarization phase (2 weeks).
Training sessions. Sessions start with a dynamic standardized warm up, which include several muscle activation exercises. Aerobic sessions include compensatory exercises. Training session will be ended with a cooling-down protocol</description>

    <arm_group_label>HIIT group.</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The volume in HIIT 40-65 min/week at high intensity. Intensity. Two different protocols: HIIT with long intervals (Type A session), which intensity will be &gt;95% VO2max and HIIT with short intervals (Type B session), &gt;120% VO2max.
Training frequency two times/week. Type of exercise. Type A session are walking in treadmill with personalized slopes. Eight weight-bearing exercises in circuit form, type B session.
Training load variation. Gradual progression to control the exercise dose. Training periodization divided in: familiarization phase, phase I, phase II. Training sessions. Type A: 5 minutes in treadmill at 60% VO2max. After warm-up, participants complete sets corresponding to each training session following the corresponding characteristics. Type B: eight weight-bearing exercises (in circuit form) two times/set with an active rest (walking at 60%VO2max) as many times at as defined. Training session will be ended with a cooling-down protocol</description>

    <arm_group_label>WB-EMS group.</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>WB-EMS training program will be the same than HIIT intervention related to volume, intensity, frequency, type of exercise, training load variation, training periodization and training session. However, electrical impulse will be included in order to assess if WB-EMS training will produce an added effect compared to HIIT.
Electrical parameters:
We will apply a frequency of 15-33 Hz in type A session. And, we will apply a frequency of 35-75 Hz in type B session.
Intensity will be 80-100 mA. Impulse Width adjusted in relation to body segment: thigh zone (400μsec), glute zone (350μsec), abdominal zone (300μsec), dorsal zone (250μsec), cervical (200μsec), chest zone (200μsec) and arm zone (200μsec).
Duty cycle. We have programmed a duty cycle of 50-67% in type B session, but duty cycle in type A session will be 99%.
RPE impulse: the impulse intensity was individually adapted to generate similar values of rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in Borg CR-10 Scale &quot;5&quot; of &quot;9&quot;</description>
