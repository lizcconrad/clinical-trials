  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonspecific neck pain (NSNP) is among the most common problems a physical therapy faces. it
      represents a major social and economic problem to society with high incidence rate between 22
      and 70% of the population and increases with age and female gender. Unknown etiology
      represents 85% percent or more of etiological factors responsible for the NSNP.

      Neck patients have greater postural instability compared to normal subjects signified by the
      increased excursion of the center of gravity (COG).and also increased postural instability
      has a significant correlation with pain and proprioceptive dysfunction.

      So the important question about the precise treatment protocol is almost a subject of debate.
      The use of conventional cervical collar treatment for chronic mechanical neck pain is one of
      the most debating modality. It also highlights the Controversy about the values of this type
      of treatment. It is postulated that this type of treatment is not without critique.

      Although posture has emerged as one of the important etiological factors reported to be
      associated with NSNP. most of the previous bracing concept limited their role to
      immobilization especially in the acute stage to create the best conditions for soft tissue
      healing and relieving pain by lowering the nociceptive physical and mechanical input.
      Moreover, it based on the dated concept when the 3D nature of posture was not incorporated
      into the brace design.

      It is postulated that large deviations from ideal postural alignment especially from the
      trunk which is approximately 60% of body mass have a negative influence on neural, muscular,
      and vascular tissues, resulting in various spinal disorders. Through the years, many studies
      have supported that many of our postural reflexes, such as the vestibulocollic
      reflex,cervicocollic reflex, pelvoocular reflex, vestibular-ocular reflex, cervical-ocular
      reflex and cervical somatosensory input, are housed, or occur, within the head and neck
      region. A correction of altered head posture, therefore, could be commanded to achieve
      optimal full spine postural correction, where the rest of the spine orients itself in a
      top-down fashion.

      And so global posture assessment and correction in view of three-dimensional analysis are
      important aspects that have to be considered in the bracing design if we seek greater and
      longer lasting improved function.

      Regarding the objective postural measurement methods, there are several tools available for
      clinical use. These include simple plumb line measure, photographic techniques, moire
      topography, various computer-assisted methods including electrogoniometers.

      There is evidence that this clinical evaluation is an effective tool, but as beneficial as
      this type of evaluation has proven to be, there are still various shortcomings as the most of
      these methods are not able to measure trunk posture as rotations and translations in six
      degrees of freedom as described by Harrison et al. And so in the current study we will use
      Global Postural System (GPS) which is a novice unique device investigating all postural and
      balance variables at once. GPS is a valid and reliable tool, provides the managing
      physiotherapist with a radiation-free accurate measurement. Moreover, it provides further
      information on trunk balance and other 3D features upon which bracing design can be tailored
      per each patient.

      Numerous studies showed that mirror Image and mirror image in motion exercises which are
      prescribed specifically to help normalize the patient's neuromuscular dysfunction and
      postural deformation through reflecting the patient's posture across different planes are
      more beneficial than a less personalized program. With these consideration in mind, and to
      incorporate the findings of 3D postural assessment into the treatment program, we will design
      an adjustable cervical thoracic Posture corrective Orthotic (TEPCO) which is worn by the
      patient for short time and have the availability to reflect all transitional displacements
      and rotational movements of the head then Ambulatory exercises are performed by using
      treadmill while the patient's reverse posture is held by the TEPCO. Accordingly, the purpose
      of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of ambulatory adjustable cervical
      thoracic orthosis on pain and 3D pasture parameters.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are randomly assigned into two groups of an equal number using the roll of a dice, an experimental group (odd number) and a control group (even number). Random permuted blocks of different sizes will be employed to achieve a balance of the sample sizes between the two groups. A resident who will be blinded to the research protocol and is not otherwise involved in the trial operated the random assignment. A number of patients will be divided into 2 equal groups. The experimental group will receive 3D posture correction protocol through adjustable ambulatory CTCO. The two groups will receive conventional treatment like hot pack, Soft tissue mobilization, Therapeutic Exercise, Manipulation and Home routine program to control pain and eliminate the causal role of pain in changing the posture parameters.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It is performed by using VAS, the patients were asked about the perception of pain using a 10 cm line with 0 (no pain) on one end and 10 (worst pain) on the other end. Patients were asked to place a mark along the line to denote their level of pain.</description>

    <description>The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain The NDI can be scored as a raw score [2]or doubled and expressed as a percent [3]. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.
0 points or 0% means no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.</description>

    <description>Ambulatory a mirror image functional re-training This way of functional training will deliver via the use of adjustable cervicothoracic orthosis with the patient walking at approximately 2-3 miles per hour on a standard, motorized treadmill. The brace will over correct the abnormal posture according to the 3D posture analysis data. To facilitate tissue remodeling by reverse posture training, this called mirror image exercise.then the ambulatory exercises by using treadmill will be performed while the patient's mirror image posture will be held by the adjustable orthosis, ambulatory exercises for 20 minutes by using treadmill Based on Harrison et al and Hawes et al., approach, this program will be repeated 3 Times /week for 10 weeks.</description>
