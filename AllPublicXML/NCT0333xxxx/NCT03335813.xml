  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depending upon the cancer stage, esophageal cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy,
      radiation therapy, or a combination of these modalities. Sometimes in addition to external
      radiation therapy or instead of external radiation therapy, select patients with esophageal
      cancer may benefit from localized radiation to the tumor, called esophageal brachytherapy.
      There are many different radiation techniques and delivery approaches for this type of
      specialized radiation therapy, and the purpose of this document is to provide a written
      summary of an innovative delivery method.

      Primary Objective Pilot study of multichannel endoesophageal brachytherapy applicator to
      determine dose distribution and conformality of a 6 channel balloon repositioning applicator.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        1. To collect data in order to show how the 6-tube endoesophageal brachytherapy technique
           will be an improvement (more conformed dose distribution) over a previously designed
           3-tube endoesophageal brachytherapy technique in patients who are candidates for
           esophageal brachytherapy

        2. To evaluate acute toxicity of novel endoesophageal brachytherapy applicator.

      Study Design

      This innovative study will be an improvement over a previously designed 3-tube endoesophageal
      brachytherapy technique in patients who are candidates for esophageal brachytherapy. The
      brachytherapy planning process will utilize a novel multichannel balloon applicator.

      The initial treatment session will occur after the patient has been found to be eligible, the
      consent form has been completed, and the treatment plan has been created. The patient will
      undergo subsequent weekly treatments for 3 to 6 weeks after the initial treatment.

      The subject will be expected to participate in the trial throughout its entirety. The
      participation period is 6 months of which the patient will be evaluated and seen at months 3
      and 6.
