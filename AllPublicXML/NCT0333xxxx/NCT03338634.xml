  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single, un-replicated visit to the Children's Metabolic Kitchen and Eating Behavior
      Lab designed to gather data on children's responses to images used in MRI studies.
      Additionally, a demographic questionnaire for parents will be piloted.

      The Pilot Test Session will take place in the Children's Metabolic Kitchen and Eating
      Behavior Lab in Chandlee Laboratory.

      Child Procedures: Both Child and parent's current height and weight will be obtained. After
      being seated at a computer, they will complete the Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAMS) and
      a Freddy Fullness pictorial hunger score. Then their ability to discriminate between portion
      sizes will be assessed. They will be shown several pictures of macaroni and cheese on a
      standard white plate with a grey tablecloth background and asked to determine which picture
      had a larger amount of food. Finally, they will view 180 pictures of common foods and
      non-food objects (office supplies). After each picture, children will be instructed to answer
      questions about the image (what is this image, how happy does it make you feel and how
      excited does it make you feel). Children will then score their hunger again with a Freddy
      Fullness pictorial hunger score and take a Post-Scanning Questionnaire.

      Parent Procedures: Parent's current height and weight will be obtained and he/she will
      complete a demographic questionnaire.

    <measure>Pilot Image Description by Children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Once the child is comfortable in our lab and consent has been received, they will be shown a total of 150 - 200 pictures of foods and non-food objects (e.g. office supplies). They will also be shown control images that are blurred or scrambled versions of the test images. After each picture, children will be instructed answer questions about the image (ex. what is this image, how much do you like it, how large is it, etc.)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometric Measures:weight</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The parent and child will be weighed in kg.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometric Measures:height</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The height of the parent and child will be measured in meters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The parent will complete a fill-in the blank and multiple choice demographic questionnaire. No scales are used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freddy Fullness Scale Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The child will complete a pictorial scale of fullness using a Freddy Scale. This is basically a vertical slider scale, with an empty stomach equaling 0 mm and a full stomach being 150 mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CAMS anxiety scale Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The child will complete a CAMS anxiety scale questionnaire before viewing the images. This scale resembles a sliding scale thermometer. When the thermometer is empty, at zero, the child is calm and not nervous or worried. When the thermometer is full, the child is very, very nervous or worried.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Scanning Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>After viewing the images and answering questions, children will be interviewed by the researcher to find out if they liked the procedure and whether or not they would refer their friends (to determine if other children are likely to enjoy the experience). There is no scale, the questions require a verbal answer.</description>
