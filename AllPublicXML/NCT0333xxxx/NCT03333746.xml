  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide and nivolumab work in treating patients
      with multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide and nivolumab may work better in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of nivolumab in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) in
      terms of overall response rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour on days 1 and 14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
