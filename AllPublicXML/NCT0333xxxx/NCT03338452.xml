  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the timeline of changes of body composition, physical and psychological
      performance, and biochemical markers of metabolism and inflammation responses to low energy
      ketogenic diet for loosing weight in obese individuals. The participants will be monitored
      and guided by the interdisciplinary obesity team for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketogenic diets have been shown to be an effective tool to fight obesity with reported good
      adherence due to their ability to suppress the drive to eat. They are also gaining popularity
      in public, despite some concerns regarding the quality and timeline of changes of body
      composition and the effects on health parameters of whole organism.

      For effective weight loss, energy deficit is required. Very low energy (600 - 800 kcal)
      ketogenic diets have been extensively studied.

      The proposed study combines low energy (800 - 1500 kcal) and ketogenic diet intervention. The
      aim of the study is a comprehensive determination of quality of body mass loss, metabolic
      states changes, physical and psychological performance changes, and inflammatory and hormones
      profile changes during and post a 12-week low energy ketogenic diet intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Longitudinal intervention study with repeated measurements. Participants will be subjected to a 12-week low energy ketogenic diet (LEKD) and requested not to change their physical activity levels throughout the study.
The participants will underwent a series of tests and consultations at baseline (prior to the start of the intervention), and after 1, 2, 4, 8 , and 12 weeks of LEKD intervention. At the end of each time points, body weight and composition will be measured in the fasting state, food and exercise diaries checked by a dietitian and a kinesiologist and discussed with the participants, psychological and cognitive tests will be performed by a psychologist. At the same time-points, different serum analyses will be performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Low energy ketogenic diet lasting 12 weeks with a previous preparation period including detailed instructions during classes and individual counselling by a dietitian. Participants were provided with a list of suitable foods with very low carbohydrate content. Furthermore, the subjects shared cooking recipes and links to helpful webpages. They were free to follow a KD according to their personal preferences but limit their carbohydrate intake to 5-10 % of total energy from carbohydrates, but derive at least 70 % of total energy from fat.</description>
