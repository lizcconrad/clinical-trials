      The aim of this study is to characterize the interest of concentrations in meconium of drugs
      used for treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent woman as a prognostic factor of time,
      severity and duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). 43 women treated with
      buprenorphine, 49 with methadone, and their newborns, were included. NAS is assessed by
      Lipsitz scale. Buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, methadone, EDDP and morphine are quantified
      in meconium (one collected immediately after birth, another for 24 to 48 h) by a liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, developed and validated for this
      study.
