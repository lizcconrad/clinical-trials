  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if patients hospitalised for medical disease will
      increase their time spent out of bed during hospitalisation through simple feedback about
      physical activities from a mobile device.

      Physical activity is measured by means of a pair of accelerometers embedded in band aids
      placed on the thigh and on the chest. The measurement is continuous and data is uploaded to a
      secure internet-server. Summaries of physical activity (bedrest, sitting, standing, walking)
      is computed and can be displayed on a mobile device (tablet) through a dedicated application.

      The study will be conducted as a controlled cohort study in a large tertiary public hospital
      in Copenhagen, Denmark. Patients admitted to Department of Respiratory Medicine will be
      included and will have their physical activity measured during hospitalisation. Half of the
      cohort will receive visual feedback about the amount of physical activity from a mobile
      device placed on the bed table.

      A total of 108 patients will be included resulting in 6 periods of 18 patients each.

    <intervention_model_description>There will be sequential inclusion to each cohort. Each sequence includes 18 patients (corresponding to the number of beds at the department). Thus the patients hospitalised during the first period will receive feedback (exposed cohort). In the second period the patients will not receive feedback (non-exposed cohort), and so forth. A total of 108 patients will be included resulting in 6 periods of 18 patients each.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants in the exposure cohort will receive usual hospital care and continuous measurement of physical activity by sensors collecting physical activity level during hospitalisation AND a monitor placed at their bedside that displays information about their physical activity level, in terms of time spent bedridden, sitting, standing and walking. This information will be visible to the health personnel, the patients and their relatives.</description>
