  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5-8% of children report severe chronic pain and disability. Although evidence
      supports pain-self management as effective for reducing pain and disability, data show that
      most youth do not have access to this intervention. The investigative team's prior studies
      demonstrate that technology-delivered pain self-management (WebMAP program) can reduce
      barriers to care, is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing pain-related disability
      and improving anxiety and depression in youth with chronic pain. In this trial, the
      investigators propose an implementation project to address critical challenges in nationwide
      dissemination of the WebMAP pain self-management program. Using a hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation trial design, 8 clinics from across the U.S. will participate in
      a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design to sequentially implement
      WebMAP in the clinics following randomized usual care periods. Data will be collected from
      clinic records, web and app administrative tracking, and provider surveys to gather
      information on adoption and implementation following the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) public health impact framework. Individual patient-level
      pain outcomes will be collected from 140 patients to evaluate intervention effectiveness. The
      expected outcome of the project is to yield a strategic approach for a nationwide
      technology-delivered pain self-management intervention for youth with chronic pain that can
      be readily sustained in clinical settings.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will employ a stepped wedge cluster randomized design in which clinic sites are randomized sequentially to initiate the intervention. Prior to initiating patient recruitment, each of the 8 clinics will be randomized to one of two waves in the stepped wedge design. During the non-exposure periods, patients will receive usual care from the clinic.</intervention_model_description>
