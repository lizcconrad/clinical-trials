  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a highly prevalent and debilitating mental disorder, ranked one of the leading
      causes of disability worldwide. Several studies have identified neuropsychological deficits
      in populations of depressed patients affecting domains including attention, memory and
      executive functioning. These deficits often persist even in patients whose depressive
      symptoms have remitted. Cognitive impairment in depression represent a core feature of
      depression, and a valuable target for intervention. Identification of methods that would lead
      to amelioration would be of great clinical interest, and cognitive rehabilitation (CR) could
      be a potential way of achieving this. To date few studies on cognitive rehabilitation in
      depression has been conducted, but the preliminary results are promising. Still the
      demonstration of long-term effects and evidence relating to improved daily life executive
      functioning (i.e., generalization) is lacking. In the present study different group-based
      cognitive rehabilitation interventions will be compared. The aim of the study is to
      investigate if a group-based &quot;brain training&quot; intervention can improve executive function in
      patients with active and remitted depression. Efficacy will be assessed immediately after
      intervention, but also six months after the intervention.
