  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question is whether vesical training and TMAP can be used in isolation without treatment
      of overactive bladder syndrome? ALSO will be evaluated in urinary symptoms, a function of the
      MAP, a quality of life and a satisfaction of the women with the treatment offered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder training includes as resources the educational program, lifestyle modifications, as a
      strategy to suppress urgency and as programmed urges to improve the control of urgency and
      incontinence; increase bladder capacity, and thus prolong the intervals between such as
      urination; giving the patient a confidence in the bladder control. Already, a justification
      for the use of TMAP is a contraction of the pelvic floor muscles (MAP) inhibits detrusor
      contraction, improving the symptoms of detrusor overactivity.

    <description>The patient will be instructed to empty the bladder and place a preweighed absorbent. Afterwards, the patient will be asked to ingest 500 ml of sodium free (water) liquid during the first 15 minutes of the examination. After the rest period of 1 hour, the patient will be guided to walk for 30 minutes, in which she must climb and descend five flights of stairs for ten consecutive times. Next, a sequence of exercises will be performed: coughing vigorously for 10 times, squatting 10 times, jumping in place 10 times, and washing hands in running water for 1 minute. Once the activities are over, the absorbent will be weighed again to check for urinary loss.</description>

The journal shall be held for a consecutive period of 24 hours, for a minimum of three consecutive days.</description>

    <description>The patient will participate in a class in which the physiotherapist will provide the following information: on the anatomy and function of the MAP, using figures; on bladder function; guidelines on the positioning and voiding habits and the definition and main risk factors responsible for urinary incontinence. The bladder training will consist of a program of time micturition to increase bladder capacity and the interval between urinations. Urge suppression strategies will be targeted, and include distraction, relaxation, breathing, and MAP contraction (quick flicks).</description>

    <description>There will be 36 monthly series of home training (totaling at the end of the 3 months of treatment 108 series) performed 3x / week, 3x / day. The training protocol consists of three daily TMAP series. One series consists of 8 maximum voluntary contractions, with maintenance of the contraction of 6 to 10 seconds (type I muscle fibers), with twice the rest time between contractions, followed by three to five rapid contractions (muscle fibers type II ). The protocol will total 24 contractions of MAP per day performed, which will be divided in the morning (8 contractions), late (8 contractions) and night (8 contractions).</description>
