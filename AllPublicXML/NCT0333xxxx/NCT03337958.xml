      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health problem with great morbidity.
      The main therapeutic strategy is inhalers. The objective of this study is to determine the
      efficacy of an educational intervention in the use of inhalers in patients with COPD
      including ventilatory re-education and video recordings of the patients themselves.

      The importance of this pathology lies not only in its high prevalence, which is expected to
      increase due to the aging of society but also in its high mortality. In Europe, it is
      estimated that 50% of adult patients do not use the inhaler correctly. The clinical
      development of COPD includes periods of stability interspersed with symptomatic
      exacerbations, which usually involve hospitalization. During these hospitalizations,
      respiratory symptoms are worsening.Nevertheless, in Europe, it is estimated that 50% of adult
      patients do not use the inhaler correctly. Thus, it is very important the pharmacological
      education in this patients.

In addition, an educational program on the use of inhalers, which included an explanation of the use of inhalers together with a ventilatory re-education program, furthermore, the technique of inhaler use was trained.</description>

    <description>The first day of intervention consisted primarily in ventilatory re-education. During the realization of the technique he was videotaped with a Tablet so that later the patient could be seen and on the video to be able to give him the guidelines for the correction. On the second and third day of the intervention, ventilation re-education was performed and the inhalation technique was subsequently trained.</description>
