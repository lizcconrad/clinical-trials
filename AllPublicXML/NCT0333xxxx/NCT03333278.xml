  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of sepsis is substantial with an estimated 15 to 19 million cases per year
      and the vast majority of these cases occur in low income countries.With more timely diagnosis
      and improvement in supportive care the 28-day mortality from sepsis in high income countries
      has declined to about 25%, however, the mortality from septic shock remains as high as 45%.
      Moreover, the mortality from sepsis and septic shock in low income countries is reported to
      be as high as 60%. New therapeutic approaches to sepsis are required; considering the global
      burden of sepsis these interventions need to be effective, cheap, safe and readily available.

      A large body of experimental data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous
      vitamin C attenuate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduce the endothelial injury
      characteristic of sepsis (thereby reducing endothelial permeability and improving
      microcirculatory flow), augment the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhance
      vasopressor responsiveness.

      Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a feasibility pilot prospective, multi-centre,
      randomised, open-label, trial in 126 ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the
      intravenous administration of high dose Vitamin C (6g/d), Thiamine (400mg/d) and
      Hydrocortisone (200mg/d) leads to a more rapid resolution shock and vasopressor dependence.

      The investigators plan to conduct a feasibility pilot prospective, multi-centre, randomised,
      open-label, trial in ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the intravenous
      administration of high dose Vitamin C (6g/d), Thiamine (400mg/d) and Hydrocortisone (200mg/d)
      for a maximum of ten days leads to a more rapid resolution shock and vasopressor dependence.

      Hypothesis:

      Treatment with a combination of intravenous Vitamin C, Thiamine and Hydrocortisone reduces
      duration of vasopressor (measured by hours alive and vasopressor free) use censored at 7 days
      compared to standard care with Hydrocortisone alone.

      This is a prospective, feasibility, pilot, multi-centre, randomised, open-label controlled
      trial.This study will be performed in seven Victorian ICUs in Australia. Patients admitted to
      any ICU of the participating hospitals with the primary diagnosis of septic shock will be
      screened for inclusion into this study.

      Rationale:

      A large body of experimental data has demonstrated that both corticosteroids and intravenous
      vitamin C attenuate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, reduce the endothelial injury
      characteristic of sepsis (thereby reducing endothelial permeability and improving
      microcirculatory flow), augment the release of endogenous catecholamines and enhance
      vasopressor responsiveness. In animal models these effects have resulted in reduced organ
      injury and increased survival. However, their effect in critically ill humans is unknown.

      Randomisation:

      ICU patients will be enrolled as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after fulfilling
      the criteria for septic shock. Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the
      treatment group, receiving intravenous Vitamin C (1.5g every 6 hours), Thiamine (200mg every
      12 hours) and Hydrocortisone (50mg every 6 hours), or to the control group, receiving
      Hydrocortisone (50mg every 6 hours) alone.

      Treatment allocation will occur using a computerized system and concealed allocation. The
      clinical staff involved in patient care will administer the additional drugs to those
      allocated to the treatment arm of the trial as soon as possible after the identification of
      septic shock and randomization and always no later than 2 hours after randomization.

      Patients readmitted to ICU during the same hospital stay will not receive any further doses
      of study drugs.

      Study Treatment will continue until:

        -  Septic shock resolves

        -  The patient leaves the ICU

        -  Contraindications to Vitamin C, Thiamine or Hydrocortisone therapy arise

        -  Death occurs

        -  A maximum of 10 days of treatment has been administered

        -  Serious adverse events suspected to be secondary to the intervention therapy develop.

      Study Drugs

      This study will be an open label study:

      Intervention group:

        -  1500mg Vitamin C is will be diluted in 100ml of Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) and infused
           over 1 hour. The dosing schedule is 1500mg every 6 hours for the duration of study
           treatment.

        -  200mg Thiamine will be diluted in 100ml of Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl) and infused over 1
           hour. The dosing schedule is 200mg every 12 hours. Patients in the control group of the
           study can receive thiamine if clinically indicated at the discretion of the attending
           ICU staff specialist.

      In both groups (treatment and control), patients will be treated with hydrocortisone 50mg IV
      q 6 hourly for the duration of study treatment. After shock resolution and/or a maximum fo 7
      days Hydrocortisone will be tapered off over 3 days.

      Statistical analysis Assuming a mean (SD) duration of vasopressor dependency of 50 (28)
      hours, the investigators estimated a required sample size of 120 patients (60 per group) to
      identify a clinically relevant decrease of vasopressor dependency and an increase in days
      alive and vasopressor free at 7 days of 25% (20 hours) (i.e. increase from 41 to 55 hours of
      days alive and vasopressor free at day 7) with a power of 90% at an alpha level of 0.05.

      The investigators have chosen this outcome because it has been previously used in ICU studies
      as an appropriate outcome of pilot research in septic shock to indicate resolution of septic
      vasoplegia.

      In this study, it is also directly relevant to the known biology and physiology of the
      intervention applied in the pilot study. Finally, the investigators have chosen a very
      conservative effect size which is about a third of the effect reported in a recent
      comparative trial of this intervention.

      To account for an estimated drop-out rate of approximately 5%, the investigators plan to
      include 126 patients in total (63 patients per group).

      The major ethical issues associated with this study relate involve the recruitment of
      participants who are dependent on medical care and in need of immediate intervention for the
      management of life-threatening haemodynamic instability.

        1. Informed consent from participant or substitute/medical treatment decision maker: Where
           possible, and as authorised by law, which varies between jurisdictions, consent will be
           obtained from the participant himself or from the participant's legal surrogate if the
           patient lacks decision-making capacity.

        2. Consent to continue: Where it is not possible or practicable for the patient or the
           legal surrogate to consider the study and give consent immediately, the patient may be
           enrolled with a waiver of consent (or medical research procedures in an emergency in
           Victoria) and consent obtained from the participant's legal surrogate as soon as
           possible, provided the procedure is in accord with the requirements of the site's Human
           Research Ethics Committee and applicable legislation. When appropriate, the
           participant's legal surrogate, and, in turn, the participant, will be informed of the
           study and will be able to withdraw consent for ongoing participation at any time.

        3. Once subjects are recovered and are able to consider the information sheet, they will be
           offered the opportunity to withdraw from study follow-up.
