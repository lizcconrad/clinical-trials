  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard endoscopic management for anastomotic bile leaks following OLT has been endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with placement of a temporary plastic biliary
      endoprosthesis (stent) across the site of anastomotic leak. While this intervention carries a
      high rate of technical success, clinical success is not universal. An alternative to
      placement of a plastic biliary stent is placement of a fully covered self-expanding metal
      stent (FCSEMS). Whereas a plastic stent functions largely as a wick to siphon bile flow, the
      theoretical advantage of a FCSEMS is that the relatively larger expansile diameter and
      membrane coating provide an actual and effective seal at the site of leak. FCSEMS have been
      used successfully for salvage therapy of anastomotic bile leaks in the post-OLT population
      with no serious stent related adverse events and no cases of unsuccessful FCSEMS removal in
      this population.

      The objective of this study is to prospectively randomize patients found to have anastomotic
      bile leaks following OLT to placement of either a plastic biliary stent or a FCSEMS at
      initial ERCP intervention.
