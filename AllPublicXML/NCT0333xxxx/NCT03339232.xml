  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study is that BCAA supplementation and BCAA supplementation
      plus low-intensity activity will improve muscle mass and HRQOL in cirrhotic patients compared
      to usual care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the impact of including a physical activity program
      and/or a nutritional supplement along with your regular care. The nutritional supplement used
      in this study consists of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs are found in certain
      foods and are readily available as dietary supplements.

      The investigators in this study will look at how the physical activity and nutritional
      supplement program might affect patients' health outcomes, and if this program can maintain
      or even increase muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis.

      Participants will be randomized in three groups:

        1. Standard Care: If the participant is randomized to this group, they will receive the
           same medical care for their cirrhosis as they would if they were not participating in
           the study. The doctor will provide them with some general information about healthy diet
           and exercise. They will also be asked to keep an exercise log of the type of physical
           activity they do on your own.

        2. Nutritional Supplement: BCAAs: If the participant is randomized to this group, they will
           be provided with BCAA powder to take during the 12 weeks of the study. They will be
           asked to take 7 teaspoons per day. They will take 2-3 teaspoons after each meal. The
           doctor will also provide them with some general information about healthy diet and
           exercise, and they will also be asked to keep an exercise log of any physical activity
           they do on your own.

        3. Nutritional Supplement and Supervised Physical Activity: If the participant is
           randomized to this group, they will be provided with BCAA powder and be asked to
           participate in one hour per week of supervised fitness instruction at the Loyola Center
           for Fitness. The fitness instruction will consist of low-impact aerobic exercise such as
           walking or riding an exercise bicycle. They will also be given a list of exercises to
           perform at home at least two times during the week and be asked to keep an exercise log
           of their physical activity. The doctor will provide them with some general information
           about healthy diet and exercise.

    <description>Participants will receive standardized information about a healthy diet, including the potential benefit of small, frequent meals and nighttime snacking . In addition, the treating hepatologist will counsel participants on the benefits of increased physical activity. These recommendations will be provided at the beginning of the study. The usual care arm reflects current clinical practice. Participants will be asked to keep an exercise log detailing type and duration of at home physical activity.</description>

    <description>BCAA powder (Bulk SupplementsÂ®) will be provided as the powder was found to be easier to swallow. Each teaspoon contains 1788 mg of BCAA and participants will take 7 teaspoons (12.5 grams of BCAA) per day divided into three separate servings. Each teaspoon contains L-leucine, isoleucine and valine in a 2:1:1 ratio. BCAA will be provided by the study investigators and half will be provided at baseline study visit and the second half at the week 6 visit. In addition, the treating hepatologist will provide standardized information about the potential benefits of small, frequent meals, nighttime snacking and increased physical activity at the beginning of the study. Participants will be asked to keep an exercise log detailing type and duration of at home physical activity.</description>

    <description>BCAA supplement will be as described for group 2, above. Study coordinators will supervise the physical activity program for study participants at the Loyola Fitness Center. Participants will attend the fitness center one hour each week; the fitness session will consist of low-impact aerobic physical activity, beginning with walking on the indoor track and possibly building to a recumbent exercise bicycle and light resistance training. Participants will be given a list of exercises to perform at home at least two times during the week with a goal of &gt;90 minutes of physical activity per week. Participants will be asked to keep an exercise log detailing type and duration of at home physical activity which they will return during the weekly fitness center sessions. In addition, the treating hepatologist will provide standardized information about the potential benefits of small, frequent meals, nighttime snacking and increased physical activity at the beginning of the study.</description>
