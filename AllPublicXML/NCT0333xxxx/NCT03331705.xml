      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical usability study in
      subjects who are candidates for office diagnostic cystoscopy. The primary objective of this
      initial device assessment is to evaluate the performance of a new cystoscope for direct
      visualization of the urethra and bladder.

      A new cystoscope has been designed for female diagnostic cystoscopy, with a focus on
      promoting patient comfort, tolerability and safety while improving office efficiency. The
      cystoscope, named the Uro-C, is light-weight, ergonomic, handheld, battery-operated portable
      system that integrates a disposable cannula with a reusable handle that contains video
      electronics, is wireless capable, and has a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Cystoscopy
      with the new system is performed in a standard manner to cystoscopy with currently available
      endoscopes, so risks are no different than when currently available endoscopes are used.
