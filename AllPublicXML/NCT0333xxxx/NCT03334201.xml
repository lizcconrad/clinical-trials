  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of developing cardiovascular diseases increases with aging largely due to
      age-related declines in the function of arteries (arterial dysfunction), which are influenced
      by common lifestyle factors such as consumption of a &quot;Western&quot; diet and lack of sufficient
      physical activity; thus, it is important to study how these factors interact to affect artery
      function. This study will determine whether changes to the gut microbiome (the collection of
      bacteria and other &quot;microbes&quot; living in the intestinal tract) with aging, Western diet
      consumption and aerobic exercise influence arterial function, and the biological pathways
      (mechanisms) involved. Specifically, the investigators will perform a randomized,
      single-blind, controlled feeding crossover study design (comparing Western diet to
      non-Western diet consumption) in young and older, exercising and non-exercising healthy
      adults to determine the time course effects (temporal association) of diet on the gut
      microbiome and arterial function. Overall, this research has potential to establish the gut
      microbiome as a possible target for treating/preventing age-related arterial dysfunction and
      reducing the risk of age-associated cardiovascular diseases.

      In order to investigate how age-related changes to the gut microbiome, as modulated by
      Western diet and exercise, influences arterial function in humans, the investigators will
      capitalize on the plasticity of the gut microbiome to dietary perturbations. A randomized,
      single-blind, 2x1-week dietary intervention crossover study (with 3 week washout) will be
      conducted in young (18-29 years) and old (60-79 years), exercising and non-exercising, male
      and female adults from all races and ethnic backgrounds. Testing will take place on the
      University of Colorado Boulder main campus at the Clinical and Translational Research Center
      (CTRC - located in the Wardenburg Health Center). Subjects will undergo telephone and
      in-person CTRC screening, with those eligible assigned to either Group A or Group B using
      block randomization stratified by age and exercise status. Group A will undergo isocaloric WD
      feeding (high fat [40%], high sugar [25%], low fiber [15g], low nutrient) during Phase 1
      (first 1-week treatment period) and non-WD feeding (low-fat [25%], low sugar [15%], high
      fiber [22g], high nutrient) during Phase 2 (second 1-week treatment period). Group B will
      undergo the dietary interventions in the opposite order. Phases 1 and 2 will be separated by
      a 3-week washout period to prevent carry over effects. During each 1-week intervention
      period, fecal swabs will be collected daily to characterize the gut microbiome and vascular
      function, will be measured at baseline and after 2 and 7 days of controlled feeding to gain
      insight into the temporal relation between these outcomes.
