  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with a history of prostate cancer may be in this study. Subjects recommended for a
      prostatectomy or oligometastectomy will undergo PET/CT imaging using a novel radiotracer
      [18F]FTT to evaluate PARP-1 activity in known or suspected sites of primary or metastatic
      disease. Imaging will be compared with pathology results, including additional research
      assays when possible.

    <description>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a family of enzymes involved in base excision repair (the repair of DNA single-strand breaks) and alternative end joining (repair of DNA double-strand breaks). The molecular basis of PARP1 inhibitor function may depend on the dual roles of PARP1 as a modulator of gene transcription in addition to DNA damage repair 3.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Biopsy proven prostate cancer

          -  Must meet one of the following criteria:

               1. At least two tissue cores containing at least 50% tumor (per pathology report) OR

               2. At least one lesion that is 1 cm or greater in size by standard imaging (e.g.
                  ultrasound, MRI, CT). Only one type of imaging is required to show a lesion of 1
                  cm or greater in order for the patient to be eligible to participate in this
                  study.

          -  Recommended for clinically indicated radical prostatectomy or oligometastectomy

          -  Willing to allow use or collection of pathology tissue for the purposes of research
             from either clinical biopsy or surgical procedure (if adequate tissue is available)

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.

          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will
             be approached to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be
             mentally disabled will not be recruited for this study. All subjects must understand
             and be able to give informed consent. We will not be using specific methods to assess
             decisional capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to
             undue influence, as this study offers no compensation. All individuals will be told
             that their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to
             clinical care. This should negate any undue influence or coercion. Women, children,
             fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.
