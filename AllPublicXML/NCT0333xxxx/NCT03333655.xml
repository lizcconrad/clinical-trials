  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify mechanisms associated with acquired immune escape by
      comparing baseline and at-progression tissue samples from participants who derive clinical
      benefit from CPI treatment of metastatic cancer or hematologic malignancies.
