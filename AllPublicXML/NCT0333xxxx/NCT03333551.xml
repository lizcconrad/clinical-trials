  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to assess for relative change in cardiac 18F Florbetapir
      uptake in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis after appropriate chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current research involving [18F]-florbetapir in relationship to cardiac amyloid has taken
      advantage of the ability of the radiopharmaceutical to bind specifically to amyloid fibrils.
      It has previously been established that the degree of radiotracer uptake correlates with the
      density of Beta-amyloid plaque. The ability to quantify this uptake makes [18F]-florbetapir
      imaging a potential tool to evaluate cardiac response in patients undergoing therapy for AL
      amyloidosis. It would provide a much-needed tool to monitor cardiac response to chemotherapy
      to potentially adjust chemotherapy if response was not adequate. It could also provide a tool
      by which investigators would be able to evaluate new therapies designed to decrease the
      burden of formed amyloid fibrils within the heart.
