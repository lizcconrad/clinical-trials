      The expression of GALNT4 in blood with acute coronary syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidences have linked GALNTs to cardiovascular disease or susceptibility to
      CAD.GALNT4, a member of the GalNAc-Ts family,contributes to the initiation of O-linked.
      Polymorphisms in GALNT4 have been linked with incidence of MI in an Irish population,
      probably that O-glycosylation of PSGL-1 by GalNAc-T4 may be important for many P-selectin
      mediated inflammation.However, there is few relevant studies about the expression of GALNT4
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome.This study valuates the expression of GALNT4 in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome.
