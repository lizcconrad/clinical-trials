  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections in the lung are almost impossible to eradicate
      with conventional antibiotics. These patients have few options to treat their lung infection.
      It has been shown that nitric oxide was safe to be inhaled for similar cystic fibrosis
      patients and reduced drug resistant bacteria in the lungs. Further, research indicates that
      clinical isolates of NTM can be eradicated by 160ppm NO exposure in the laboratory petri
      dish. This is not the first time inhaled NO treatment has been used in patients with NTM
      (case studies). This study will provide more data to see if NO therapy can reduce the NTM
      bacterial load in the lungs and help the patients breath better.

      Primary Objective: Assess the safety of inhaled NO (gNO) in adults with NTM

      Safety will be evaluated by unanticipated adverse events in clinical labs (hematology,
      coagulation, and serum chemistries); in vitals; in inspired concentration of NO, O2 and NO2
      delivered to each subject and; in real time methemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels.

      Primary Endpoint:

      Determine the safety of gNO in the NTM population, • as confirmed by no unanticipated adverse
      events

      Secondary safety Endpoint: Determine the efficacy of inhaled NO in adults with NTM.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the change in lung function with spirometry
      (specifically absolute change in FEV1 % predicted) from baseline to Days 5, 12, 19 and 26
      during and after treatment. Because deterioration of lung function is the primary cause of
      death in patients with NTM, absolute change in FEV1 % predicted has been used to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Determine the presence of an efficacy signal of gNO in the NTM
      population,

      Efficacy will be assessed by the antimicrobial effect of inhaled NO on the density of NTM
      species and other microorganisms in sputum. Serial measurements of these microbial colony
      counts in sputum have been previously used as a measure of antimicrobial activity in other
      clinical trials of antibiotics in NTM.

      • as confirmed by an improvement in pre-treatment bacterial colonization and post-treatment
      bacterial colonization on Day 5, 12, 19 and 26.
