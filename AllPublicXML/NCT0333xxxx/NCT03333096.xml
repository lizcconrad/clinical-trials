  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure fitness to drive in patients with a visual and a
      cognitive impairment. To do so, Ocusweep is used in patients with glaucoma and Mild Cognitive
      Impairment. The participants will be divided over four groups; patients with glaucoma,
      patients with cognitive impairment, patients with both and a healthy control group.
      Differences in performance on Ocusweep in the four different groups of participants are
      expected. These effects may be related to fitness to drive, which is why those results will
      be compared to traditional neuropsychological measures of fitness to drive. the hypothesis of
      the current study is that the Ocusweep performance is related to performance on other
      measures of fitness to drive.
