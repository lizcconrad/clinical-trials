      In this trial, the investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of a multispecies probiotic
      consisting of 2 strains of Bifidobacterium (B. bifidum W23, B. lactis W51) and 6 strains of
      Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus W37, L. acidophilus W55, L. paracasei W20, L. plantarum W62, L.
      rhamnosus W71, and L. salivarius W24) in reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea
      in a group of children undergoing antibiotic therapy for common infections.

    <textblock>
      Certain individual probiotic strains have been proven to be effective in reducing the risk of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD). However, the effects of using multispecies probiotics
      remain unclear. The investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of a specific multispecies
      probiotic preparation (Ecologic AAD Kids) in reducing the incidence of AAD in children.

      In this trial, a total of 350 children aged 6 months to 18 years, undergoing antibiotic
      treatment, will be randomly allocated to receive either a multispecies probiotic consisting
      of 2 strains of Bifidobacterium (B. bifidum W23, B. lactis W51) and 6 strains of
      Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus W37, L. acidophilus W55, L. paracasei W20, L. plantarum W62, L.
      rhamnosus W71, and L. salivarius W24) at a total dose of 10^10 colony-forming units daily, or
      a placebo, from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after antibiotic
      cessation. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of AAD, defined as ≥3 loose or
      watery stools (a score of A on the Amsterdam Infant Stool Scale for children younger than 1
      year and a score of 5-7 on the Bristol Stool Form scale for children older than 1 year) in 24
      hours, caused either by Clostridium difficile or of otherwise unexplained aetiology (after
      testing for common diarrhoeal pathogens), occurring during and/or up to 7 days after the end
      of the antibiotic therapy.
