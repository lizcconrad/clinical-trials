  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant micro-organisms in patients with bone and joint
      infection (BJI), the prescription of off-labeled antibiotics seem to be more and more common
      as part of routine care. These new antibiotics are, however, more expensive, and there are no
      precise data in France regarding the volume and cost of such off-label prescriptions in
      hospital, in the post-acute care structures, and in the outpatient setting.

      The objective of this study is to estimate the cost of using these antibiotics over 2 years
      for patients in a reference center for the management of complex bone and joint infection
      (CRIOAc)

    <time_frame>50 days</time_frame>
    <description>The molecule concerned are: daptomycin, ertapenem, linezolid, ceftaroline, tigecycline and / or colimycin.
The characteristics of the patients, the type of bone and joint infection and the prescribing methods (dosage, duration) were collected throughout the care path (hospitalization in surgery and / or medicine at CRIOAc or in peripheral hospitals, in post-acute care structure and in the home).
The duration of dispensation is about 50 days.
Overall costs for off-label prescriptions were estimated taking account of variations in purchase price invoiced to the reference center.</description>
