    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trials studies pembrolizumab and radiation therapy in treating patients
      with intermediate or high-grade soft tissue sarcoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab
      and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete histopathologic necrosis following the combination of
      pembrolizumab and neoadjuvant radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria following the combination of radiation and pembrolizumab.

      II. To confirm the tolerability and safety of the combination of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab
      and radiation in a population with localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) based on Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.03.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily for 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 5 years.
