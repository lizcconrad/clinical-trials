  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 700 new cases of cancer are recorded each year among TYAC aged 15 to 25 years old in
      Rhône-Alpes region (France); more than 200 are treated and supported within the TYAC
      Department of the Institute of Hematology and Oncology Pediatrics (Centre Léon Bérard-Civil
      Hospice of Lyon). These patients survive from their disease in 80% of cases; they have six
      times more likely to develop a risk of second primary cancer (SCP) than their peers. This
      risk of SCP is multifactorial and varies depending on the type of first cancer, treatment
      received and the prevalence of risk factors (smoking, overweight, sedentary lifestyle,
      environmental exposures...). This project aims to implement a clinical program based on
      adapted physical activity (APA) and cancer prevention recommendations for TYAC during the
      active treatment period (4-6 months). The methodology used series of assessments of APA
      sessions and information meetings dedicated to cancer prevention and SCP risk
      recommendations. It mobilizes regularly the health care team of TYAC Department, TYAC
      associations, sports structures and associations involved in cancer prevention at the
      regional level. Assessment of TYAC satisfaction regarding the project, benefits in terms of
      exercise practice, and knowledge improvement on cancer prevention recommendations, are
      assessed throughout the program.
