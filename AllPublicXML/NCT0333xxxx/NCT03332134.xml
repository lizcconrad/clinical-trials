    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test and evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, safety, and
      efficacy of an an intimate partner violence (IPV) intervention in recently-married,
      low-income husband-wife dyads in Pune, India conducted over a six week period.

      Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed through semi-structured interviews with
      participants and staff post-intervention. Safety will be gauged through semi-structured
      interviews with women participants and efficacy will be gauged through change in proximal
      determinants of IPV in this population (i.e. time spent in the relationship, self-esteem,
      resilience, communication and conflict management skills, sexual communication, attitudes
      toward IPV acceptability, and conceptualization of IPV).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (3 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in acknowledgement of behaviors that constitute IPV. This outcome is assessed using an adaptation of the Indian Family Violence and Control Scale, wherein response choices will include &quot;not violence,&quot; &quot;mild violence,&quot; &quot;moderate violence, and &quot;severe violence.&quot; The minimal score will be 12 and the maximum 48, with greater scores being suggestive of the participant having a more comprehensive conceptualization of behaviors constituting IPV.</description>

    <measure>Change in Attitudes toward IPV Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (3 Months)</time_frame>

This outcome is assessed using adapted questions from the National Family Health Survey Attitudes Towards Wife Beating module. It is assessed based on the frequency of affirmative responses to the questions, with more affirmative responses being associated with greater acceptance of IPV.</description>
