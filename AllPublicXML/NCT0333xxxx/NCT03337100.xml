  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of naloxone standing orders, this study will assess if co-dispensing naloxone
      with opioids to patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy changes opioid risk behaviors,
      increases naloxone uptake, and increases knowledge about overdose and naloxone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, pharmacy-based, cluster randomized controlled trial of a naloxone
      co-dispensing program for adults prescribed chronic opioid therapy. Pharmacies (target N=6)
      will be randomized to the order in which they are encouraged to implement a naloxone
      co-dispensing program for patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy. The intent of this
      program is to provide patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy naloxone for potential
      opioid overdose reversal under the terms of a standing order. Participants prescribed chronic
      opioid therapy who use randomized pharmacies will be recruited to receive knowledge and risk
      surveys at baseline and over the follow-up. The primary outcome is opioid risk behaviors
      (target enrollment is 200 patients). Secondary outcomes include knowledge about overdose and
      naloxone, substance use, and pain intensity. Patients who use randomized pharmacies
      (anticipated n=550 patients) will also be followed in the electronic health record for
      secondary outcomes: naloxone dispensings, changes in opioid dose, aberrant urine toxicology
      results, and overdose events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Opioid-Related Risk Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months and 8-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants, risk behavior will be assessed using the Opioid-Related Behaviors in Treatment (ORBIT) scale. The ORBIT is a scale used to identify recent risk behavior among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. Scores on the single scale range from 0-40, with lower values representing less risk behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overdose and Naloxone Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months, and 8-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants, knowledge of overdose and naloxone will be measured using survey items adapted from the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS). The OOKS is a scale measuring knowledge of overdose risks, warning signs, steps to address the overdose and appropriate use of naloxone. The investigators have adapted it to be specific to prescription opioids. The modified-OOKS is scored on a scale of 0-28, with higher values representing greater knowledge about overdose and naloxone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in opioid dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants and participants followed using automated data only, changes in the milligrams morphine equivalent dose will be calculated from pharmacy and insurance claims databases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Drug Use Risk Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months and 8-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants, drug use risk behavior will be assessed using question 2 of the validated National Institutes on Drug Abuse-Modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) scale version 2.0. The investigators added an item about tobacco use from the WHO ASSIST V3.0 to the NIDA-modified ASSIST V2.0 instrument, resulting in a scale of 0-66, with lower values representing less drug use risk behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hazardous Drinking or Alcohol Use Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months and 8-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants, alcohol use risk behavior will be assessed using the validated Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test--Consumption (AUDIT-C) scale. The AUDIT-C is a screener used to identify patients with alcohol use disorders or hazardous drinking behavior. The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his or her safety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months and 8-10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among survey participants, pain intensity will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS Scale v1.0 - Pain Intensity 3a. The PROMIS Pain Intensity instrument is scored on a scale of 3-15. A higher score represents greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Implementation of a naloxone co-dispensing pharmacy program.
The intent of this program is to provide patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy naloxone under the terms of a standing order for potential opioid overdose reversal. Prior to implementing the program, a naloxone standing order will be implemented and pharmacy operational staff will provide training to pharmacy staff about the standing order and a naloxone co-dispensing protocol. Under a co-dispensing protocol, pharmacy staff members will identify opioid prescriptions meeting criteria for co-dispensing, prepare naloxone fills, offer patients naloxone, and provide counseling on its use.</description>
