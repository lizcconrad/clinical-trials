      This study will enroll the subset of infants enrolled in the main study (PreVENT Aim 1;
      401-1000g at birth and/or 22w 0d-28w 6d; enrolled at &lt;1 week postnatal age; eligible for full
      care and surviving beyond 24 hours, with informed consent; and with no major malformations)
      who are receiving oxygen supplementation at 32w and 36w postmenstrual age (PMA), and are not
      judged too unstable by the Attending neonatologist.

      For infants on oxygen supplementation at 32w PMA, the investigators will use data from the 96
      hours of intensive multiparametric physiologic monitoring at 32w PMA. For infants on oxygen
      supplementation at 36w PMA, we will use the 96 hours of intensive multiparametric physiologic
      monitoring at 36w PMA as well as data from the sleep study.

      The first 24 hours of data collection will be the baseline data. Over the next 72 hours, the
      investigators will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross-over manner with the initial
      intervention (cannula or oxygen environment) randomly assigned: Intervention 1 (24-48h of
      data), Intervention 2 (48-72h of data) and Intervention 3 (72-96h of data).

Over the next 72h, we will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross-over manner: Intervention 1 (24-48h of data), Intervention 2 (48-72h), and Intervention 3 (72-96h; same as intervention 1). Initial intervention will be by random assignment (computer-generated). The intervention will be to provide oxygen either by nasal cannula or by servo-controlled oxygen environment, followed by cross-over to other intervention for 24h, and then back to original intervention.</intervention_model_description>
