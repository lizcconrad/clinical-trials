      This phase II trial studies how well fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, total body
      irradiation, and donor stem cell transplant work in treating patients with blood cancer.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation
      before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the
      bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may
      also replace the patient?s immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of relapse at 1 year in patients who receive haploidentical
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after reduced intensity conditioning and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety including development of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and
      death at 100 days post-transplant, as well as other treatment related toxicities including
      chronic GVHD, engraftment rate, non-relapse mortality, progression free survival (PFS) at one
      year, and overall survival (OS) at one year, as compared with historical controls.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlative studies will include chimerism analysis by molecular analysis and evaluation
      of immune reconstitution by cytomegalovirus (CMV) dextramer analysis using flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2
      and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) on days -1 and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days.

               -  Must not be matched at more than 7 of 10 HLA antigens

               -  Recipient should not have HLA antibodies to potential donor; if the recipient
                  does have HLA antibodies to the potential donor, an alternative donor is
                  preferred; however, if there are no suitable alternative donors, the donor to
                  whom the patient has HLA antibodies can be utilized as long as the antibody titer
                  is less than 2000 median fluorescence intensity (MFI); if the titer is &gt; or = to
                  2000 MFI, the recipient must undergo successful antibody desensitization prior to

                  acceptable for this study.

               -  It is preferred that the haploidentical donor must be available to donate on day
                  -1 and day 0, so that fresh product can be processed by the Stem Cell lab and
                  administered to the patient on day 0.. While less preferable, cryopreserved
                  product may be utilized with this product.

             90 days must have elapsed between the start of this reduced intensity conditioning
             regimen and the last transplant if patient had a prior autologous BMT

          -  Participants of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive
             methods (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Participant or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an independent ethics committee/Institutional Review Board approved

             sibling donor availability or 12/12 HLA matched donor availability) due to patient's
             clinical status.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, radiation treatment and/or surgery 2 weeks

             than 2 weeks earlier

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease (for hematologic malignancies)

          -  Child-Pugh class B and C liver failure

          -  Concomitant active malignancy that would be expected to require chemotherapy within 3
             years of transplant (other than non-melanoma skin cancer)

          -  Patients who have received maximally allowed doses (given in 2 Gy fractionations, or
             equivalent) of previous radiation therapy to various organs; patients who previously
             have received a higher than allowed dose of radiation to a small lung, liver and brain
             volume, will be evaluated by the radiation oncologist to determine if the patient is
             eligible for study

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, active serious infection or
             other condition which, in the opinion of treating physician, would make this protocol
             unreasonably hazardous for the patient

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          -  Pregnant or nursing female participants

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician are unlikely to comply with the
             restrictions of allogeneic stem cell transplantation based on formal psychosocial
             screening

          -  Patients with donor specific HLA antibodies with a titer greater than 2000 MFI
             (whether or not they have undergone a desensitization protocol)

          -  Patients who have undergone a prior allogeneic hematopoietic or (other organ)
             transplant

          -  Treating physician considers the potential HLA haploidentical donor to be ineligible
             to receive G-CSF, and/or concern on the part of the treating physician for risk of
             harm to the potential donor with administration of G-CSF, and/or refusal by the
             potential donor (or donor?s guardian) to receive G-CSF

          -  Any condition which in the investigator?s opinion deems the participant an unsuitable
             candidate to receive study drug

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment
