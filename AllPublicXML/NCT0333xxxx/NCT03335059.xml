  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment is efficacious as second-line
      therapy for CIS NMIBC BCG-unresponsive patients with or without papillary NMIBC, through
      examination of the complete response rate (CRR) and disease-free duration for complete
      responders. The study will also explore progression-free survival time, bladder preservation
      rate, and overall survival time.

      The study will address an unmet need to identify a treatment effective in both ablating the
      disease and providing a prolonged disease-free period for patients. Ideally, the treatment
      will delay progression to invasive disease, thus preserving the bladder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with current CIS of the bladder, with or without coexisting papillary Ta/T1
             NMIBC tumor(s), who experienced an occurrence or recurrence of CIS within 18 months of
             their initial BCG treatment and within 6 months of their last BCG treatment, while on
             an adequate BCG regimen. An adequate BCG regimen shall consist of at least 2 courses
             of BCG where the first course (induction) must have included at least 5 of 6 weekly
             treatments and the second course may have included a re-induction (5 of 6 treatments)
             or maintenance, (at least 2 of 3 treatments) administered on a schedule similar to the
             SWOG 8507 study regimen.

          2. All clinical, intra-operative and pathological items for the AUA risk stratification
             must be documented. This includes bladder mapping, according to the instructions
             specified in the protocol. With regard to BCG and/or other NMIBC treatments
             documentation must include:

               1. Date of initial treatment,

               2. Date of last treatment,

               3. The number of courses administered and the number of treatments administered in
                  each course.

          3. Patients with concomitant papillary tumor(s) must have undergone a repeat TUR 2-4
             weeks prior to the first study treatment:

               1. if the previous TUR was incomplete,

               2. if there was no muscle in the specimen after the initial TUR (except in TaLG
                  tumors),

               3. in all T1,

               4. in all HG tumors ≥ 3cm.

          4. CT-IVU or MRI-IVU or IVU/retrograde confirmation of absence of tumor(s) in the upper
             tract, kidney and ureters performed within 6 months before the study treatment
             initiation, in selected cases, as recommended in latest AUA guidelines published prior
             to screening. If IVU/retrograde protocol is not available or contrast allergy/poor
             renal function preclude such imaging, then non-contrast CT or MRI of the
             abdomen/pelvis within the same timeframe will suffice.

          5. Visual inspection to exclude urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the urethra during
             cystoscopy.

          6. Biopsy of the prostatic urethra, prior to enrollment, to exclude UC of the prostatic
             urethra, in male patients with:

               1. tumor of trigone,

               2. tumor of bladder neck, or

               3. abnormal prostatic urethra

               4. prior history of prostatic urethral involvement.

          7. All patients must have urine cytology collected from either voided urine or bladder
             wash within the screening period prior to enrollment. Patients with positive cytology
             must also have selective cytology from the upper tract and prostatic urethral biopsies
             collected within the same period. Patients with a localizing positive upper tract
             cytology are excluded from the study until definitive treatment renders them free of
             disease visually and/or radiographically and cytologically (nephroureterectomy, distal
             ureterectomy or upper tract therapy).

          8. Age ≥ 18 yrs.

          9. No evidence of urothelial cancer in either kidneys or ureters.

         10. Pre-treatment hematology and biochemistry values within the limits:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl (g/100 ml)

               4. ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (x 10^3/mm^3)

               5. Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl

               6. SGOT &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               7. SGPT &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               8. Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 1.5 x ULN

         11. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

         12. A life expectancy at least of the duration of the study.

         13. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-UC tumor of the urinary tract.

         15. Known untreated urethral strictural disease or bladder neck contracture or any other
             condition that may prevent catheterization with a 21F catheter. Patients may undergo
             dilation or urethral incision before entering the study.

         16. Bladder diverticulum with diameter &gt; 1cm, as determined by CT or cystography

         17. UTI at any time within 3 weeks before study treatment initiation.
