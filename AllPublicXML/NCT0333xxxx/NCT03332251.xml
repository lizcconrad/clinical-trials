  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent chronic condition that gradually leads
      to the three dimensional deformity of the spine. Spine curvature increases in youths as
      puberty progresses. Generally, only observation is suggested for adolescents with early
      scoliosis (Cobb's angle ≤ 20°). Rigid brace treatment is too draconian for them due to the
      high corrective force which nearly constrains all movements. Flexible brace treatment is an
      alternative option; however, its efficacy is still controversial. Posture correction girdle
      with a specialized design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and most part of them can
      only provide some improvement for bad postures, such as hunchback. A scientific approach
      should be used to design and develop posture correction girdle as a treatment option for
      adolescents with early scoliosis.

      The design of posture correction girdle will incorporate different mechanisms, such as

        1. compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel

        2. lumbar flexion by using a supporting belt

        3. transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket lining by using the
           principle of the 3-point pressure system

        4. axial rotation or coupled motion by using a system with uneven straps, and

        5. an active mechanism that aims to shift the trunk away from areas of pressure.

    <description>Participants will be invited to undergo a fitting session of posture correction girdle. After the fitting, participants will join a 6-month wear trial of the posture correction girdle. Participants are required to wear the girdle for 8 hours a day and the compliance will be recorded by a logbook daily. Participants will be invited to undergo assessments before the wear trial, after the trial of 3 months, and after the trial of 6 months. The measure outcomes of the assessment include 1) ultrasound scanning image, 2) 3D body scan, 3) electromyography signal, 4) garment pressure, and 5) questionnaire.</description>
