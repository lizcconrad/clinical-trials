  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB074 in treating pain
      experienced by participants with confirmed small fibre neuropathy (SFN) that is idiopathic or
      associated with diabetes mellitus. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the
      effect on worst pain, neuropathic pain quality, sleep interference due to pain, patient
      global impression, use of supplemental pain medication, and SFN symptoms in participants
      treated with BIIB074; to investigate the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 in participants
      with SFN; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB074 in participants with SFN.

    <description>Participants will rate their WDP using an 11-point NRS (0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain) and record their score in an eDiary. Weekly mean WDP scores for Baseline (the 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment in the open-label run-in period) and Week 12 (the 7 days prior to the visit at the end of Week 12) will be derived from the WDP scores and calculated as the mean of the daily scores over the last 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Weekly Mean Sleep Interference Numerical Rating Scale (S-NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their S-NRS using an 11-point NRS (0=pain does not interfere with sleep and 10= pain completely interferes with sleep) and record their score in an eDiary. Weekly mean S-NRS scores for Baseline (the 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment in the open-label run-in period) and Week 12 (the 7 days prior to the visit at the end of Week 12) will be derived from the daily S-NRS scores and calculated as the mean of the daily scores over the last 7 days.</description>

    <description>Participant will use the NPSI questionnaire to rate different symptoms of neuropathic pain. The NPSI includes ten items related to different pain descriptors (e.g. burning and pressure) that are rated on an 11-point NRS (0=no symptoms to 10=worst symptoms imaginable). A score in each dimension and also a total score (from 0-100) is generated using data from the questionnaire.</description>

Mean weekly amount of supplemental pain medication used for neuropathic pain during the double-blind period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a 7-point self-administered scale that depicts changes in a participant's overall status. Participants will rate their change as &quot;1=very much improved,&quot; &quot;2=much improved,&quot; &quot;3=minimally improved,&quot; &quot;4=no change,&quot; &quot;5=minimally worse,&quot; &quot;6=much worse,&quot; or &quot;7=very much worse.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a 7-item self-administered questionnaire that measures how much pain has interfered with daily functioning. Participants will rate the level of pain interference on daily functioning on an 11-point NRS where 0=does not interfere and 10=completely interferes.</description>

          4. Unable or unwilling to comply with the prohibited concomitant medication restrictions,
             including but not limited to CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducers and
