  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (CAP) is one of the most common malignancies in men, both in Western
      countries and developing countries. Radiation therapy (RT) is an important therapeutic
      option. New technologies (3D, IMRT, IGRT, VMAT) have been introduced in the last decades,
      with a progressive improvement of clinical outcome. However, in many countries the only
      treatment option is the traditional 2D technique based on standard simulation. The
      indications for field definition in this treatment are still based on expert's opinions. The
      aim of this analysis is to propose new indications for 2D fields definition based on
      three-dimensional simulation in a population of patients with CAP. Twenty patients with CAP
      consecutively treated with RT in our center were identified. Patients underwent CT-simulation
      in supine position. Pelvic MRI images were fused with CT-simulation images. In this way,
      delineation of the prostate and seminal vesicles was performed on MRI images. Clinical Target
      Volume definition (CTV) was performed according to EORTC guidelines simulating 4 different
      categories: low-risk CAP, intermediate-risk CAP, high-risk CAP without involvement of the
      seminal vesicles, and high-risk CAP with involvement of seminal vesicles. The Planning Target
      Volume (PTV) was defined by adding a margin of 10 mm to the CTV in all directions. For each
      patient, 8 treatment plans were calculated. In particular, for each of the 4 categories of
      risk, 2 treatment plans were calculated by using a cobalt source or 10 MV photons. Treatment
      plans were calculated using the box technique. Progressive optimization was realized with an
      iterative procedure by evaluating the three-dimensional dose distribution. Once the final
      plan was achieved (respecting the PTV constraint: D98 &gt; 95%), distances of the fields edges
      from a set of reference points were measured.
