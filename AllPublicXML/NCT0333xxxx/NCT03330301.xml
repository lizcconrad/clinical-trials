  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common among otherwise healthy pregnant women and may have
      consequences for them as well as the early development and long-term health of their
      children. However, the importance of maternal vitamin D status has not been widely studied.

      The present study is divided into a societal experiment (1) and a case-cohort study (2):

        1. The present study includes an in-depth examination of the influence of exposure to
           vitamin D early in life and during critical periods of growth for development of type 1
           diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, obesity, asthma,
           arthritis, cancer, mental and cognitive disorders, congenital disorders, dental caries
           and bone fractures during child- and adulthood. The study is based on the fact that
           mandatory fortification of margarine with vitamin D, which initiated in 1937, was
           terminated in 1985.

           Apart from determining the influences of exposure prior to conception and during pre-
           and postnatal life, the investigators examined the importance of vitamin D exposure
           during specific seasons and trimesters, by comparing disease incidence among individuals
           born before and after the fortification.

        2. Additionally, a validated method was used to determine neonatal vitamin D status using
           stored dried blood spots (DBS) from individuals who develop the aforementioned disease
           entities as adults and their time and gender-matched controls.

      Unparalleled, the study will help determine the effects of vitamin D exposure during critical
      periods in life. There are a sufficient number of individuals to verify any effects during
      different gestation phases and seasons of the year. The results, which will change our
      current understanding of the significance of vitamin D, will enable new research in related
      fields, including interventional research designed to assess supplementation needs for
      different subgroups of pregnant women. Also, other health outcomes can subsequently be
      studied to generate multiple new interdisciplinary health research opportunities involving
      vitamin D.

    <description>This study is based on a unique Danish social experiment that took place during a well-defined period between 1937 and December 1985, when it was mandatory to fortify all margarine with vitamin D (1.25 Î¼g/100 g). This well-defined vitamin D fortification period makes it possible to investigate the impact of fetal exposure to extra vitamin D from food fortification on the risk of developing diseases later on. This study is possible due not only to the well-defined adjacent time window but also to the complete registration of every citizen via a civil registration number. This number can be linked, on an individual level, to Danish birth, patient and medical registries; social and ethnic registries; and clinical and other large databases

        For the part of the study using vitamin D measurements from DBS:

        The Danish Civil registration system was used to identify all live-born children during
        1981-2002 (n = 1,360,466), and a random subcohort thereof was sampled for 25(OH)D analyses
        to be used across the D-tect studies (n = 3585)
