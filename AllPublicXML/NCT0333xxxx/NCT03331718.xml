  <brief_summary>

      The polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh is a felt-like absorbable suture reinforcing material. The
      pancreatojejunostomy aimed at reducing POPF is not established at present. We devised a new
      method using doubly PGA mesh. This study is a multicenter, randomized phase III trial between
      Japan and Korea to verify the usefulness of this double coating of PGA mesh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatojejunostomy is generally a combination of suture between the pancreatic parenchyma
      and the seromuscular layer of the jejunum, and duct-to-mucosa suture. The clinical study
      about the various kinds of pancreatojejunostomy have been reported for the purpose of
      lowering the frequency of POPF; however, the frequency of more than grade B POPF is still
      around 10 to 20%. In soft pancreas cases with unexpanded pancreatic ducts, the risk is
      further elevated.

      The polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh is a felt-like absorbable suture reinforcing material. It is
      generally used to reinforce sutures of fragile tissues such as the lung, bronchi, liver, and
      gastrointestinal tract, and to reinforce a wide range of tissue defects. Regarding
      pancreatojejunostomy using a PGA mesh, the incidence of POPF formation was decreased in some
      retrospective studies; on the other hand, no significant difference was found in other study.
      As described above, the pancreatojejunostomy aimed at reducing POPF is not established at
      present. We devised a new method using doubly PGA mesh. This study is a multicenter,
      randomized phase III trial between Japan and Korea to verify the usefulness of this double
      coating of PGA mesh.
