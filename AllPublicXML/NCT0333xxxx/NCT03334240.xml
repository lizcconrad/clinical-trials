  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to explore and evaluate the pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of
      the ionic contra-viral therapy CLS003 in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with
      benign and premalignant HPV-induced genital lesions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to explore clinical efficacy and safety/tolerability of ICVT as a
      potential treatment for benign and premalignant HPV-induced genital lesions in
      immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. This includes 3 different patient populations:
      i) immunocompetent patients with anogenital warts (AGWs), ii) immunocompromised patients with
      anogenital warts and iii) immunocompromised patients with vulvar high grade squamous
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL), formerly referred to as usual type vulvar intraepithelial
      neoplasia (uVIN). Since digoxin / furosemide ICVT's mode of action is in part independent of
      the immune system and directly targeted to eradicate the causative HPV, we hypothesize this
      therapy to be of value in this specific group of individuals.
