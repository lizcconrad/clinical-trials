  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A propensity- matched study was conducted to investigate the feasibility and safety of adding
      temozolomide to hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous single arm phase II trial of our institution has shown that HFSRT combined with
      concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of ≥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year
      local control and overall survival rate was better than the results of a retrospective study
      using HFSRT alone in treating BMs of ≥ 3cm in diameter. Thus, we hypothesized that adding TMZ
      to HFSRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared to HFSRT
      alone. Propensity score matching method was adopted to decrease potential bias in this
      retrospective study.
