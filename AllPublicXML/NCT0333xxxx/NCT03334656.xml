  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-based engineered skin substitutes are promising to treat difficult-to-heal acute and
      chronic wounds such as large/deep burns, ulcers resistant to conventional therapies or
      surgical wounds. Cultured autologous epidermal cell-based therapy is used for more than two
      decades as permanent wound coverage for large burns. Although this technique has been shown
      to improve outcomes in patients with large burn injuries, its clinical use is limited by the
      creation of a second wound at the donor site, the three-week delay needed to obtain
      sufficient amounts of cells, and the absence of a dermal component resulting in low graft
      take and wound contraction.

      Concurrently, allogeneic cell-based engineered skin substitutes have been proposed. Where
      they offer off-the-shelf temporary wound coverage acting as biologically active dressings
      releasing growth factors, cytokines and extra cellular matrix components essential for proper
      wound healing, they are susceptible of immune rejection that is their major weakness Fetal
      skin, before the third trimester of gestational age, heals rapidly without scar formation
      conversely to adult skin. Minimal inflammation, specific cytokine and growth factor profiles,
      and faster and organized deposit and turnover of Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) components
      during fetal wound healing have been proposed to explain the absence of scar formation.
      Because of their low immunogenicity, and their unique regeneration properties, fetal skin
      cells represent an attractive alternative to the commonly used autologous and allogenic
      cutaneous grafts.

      The investigators developed a new healing dressing constituted by a collagen sponge seeded
      with a specific ratio of active fetal fibroblasts and keratinocytes producing a variety of
      wound healing growth factors and cytokines which increase the speed of wound healing, induce
      an immunotolerant state, with a low inflammatory reaction.

      This prospective randomized controlled study aims to compare wound healing of CICAFAST versus
      conventional treatment (JELONET®) in the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor site
      at D8. The patient will be his own control.

    <description>It is a cellularized dressing of 100 cm² composed of fetal skin cells associated to a bovine collagen matrix:
Fetal skin cells were obtained from a single fetal skin sample and consist in two clinical grade banks of keratinocytes (reference BKF07 K CB1) and fibroblasts (reference BKF07 WCB F d P3) produced at the UTCG. These two clinical grade cells banks were fully characterized and secure.
The matrix is a customized type I calf collagen produced by the company Symatese. Symatese's collagen is in compliance with the European requirements</description>

    <description>It is a low-adherent, sterile paraffin Tulle Gras dressing made from open weave gauze. The gauze has interlocking threads which minimize fraying when the dressing is cut to shape. JELONET® dressings are non-medicated and are used as a primary wound contact layer with paraffin present to reduce the adherence of the product to the surface of a granulating wound.
JELONET® is a product of Smith-Nephew, it has the CE-mark (n°0086) and the class of this medical device is IIa.
The features of this dressing are: Soft paraffin base, Sterile leno weave presentation, Comprehensive size range.</description>
