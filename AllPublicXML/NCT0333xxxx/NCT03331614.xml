  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an Sequential Contraction Compression
      Device (SCCD) on the symptomatology of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy. Subjects will be divided
      into a control group where they will be monitored while continuing with their current
      treatment regimen and into a treatment group where they will continue with their current
      regimen and have SCCD therapy added. Subjects will be evaluated for Subjective Pain levels,
      quality of life, breakthrough drug use, sleep levels, and objectively with a Quantitative
      Sensory Testing device. The trial duration is 30 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a controlled trial of 30 days duration to evaluate the efficacy of an Sequential
      Contraction Compression Device (SCCD) on the symptomatology of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy.
      Subjects will have to have been on a sustained drug regimen for more than 30 days and have an
      average pain level of 4 on a VAS. Subjects will be divided into a control group where they
      will be monitored while continuing with their current treatment regimen and into a treatment
      group where they will continue with their current regimen and have SCCD therapy added.
      Patients will be asked to use the SCCD device daily on both their legs. Subjects will be
      evaluated for Subjective Pain levels using a Visual Analog Scale, quality of life using
      various questionnaires, breakthrough drug use in a daily log, sleep levels i.e. how many
      consecutive hours of sleep, and objectively with a Quantitative Sensory Testing device.
