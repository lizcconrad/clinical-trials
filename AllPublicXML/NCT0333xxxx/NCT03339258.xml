  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of doxazosin will assess doxazosin's
      effectiveness for PTSD nightmares, subjective sleep quality, and non-nightmare PTSD symptoms
      in adult men and women veterans with full and partial-syndromal PTSD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose trial
      of doxazosin (1-16mg) for PTSD nightmares, sleep disturbance and overall PTSD symptoms. The
      target sample will consist of 60 male and female subjects with chronic PTSD symptoms and
      prominent nightmares randomly assigned to receive doxazosin (n=30) or placebo (n=30).
      Participants will be enrolled at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Following baseline
      consent procedures, eligibility assessments, and 1-week of baseline assessments including
      self-report surveys and actigraphy, all subjects will initiate doxazosin or equivalently
      marked placebo at 1mg at bedtime. Subjects will undergo a 4-week titration phase during which
      doxazosin or placebo may be increased to a maximum dose of 16mg (or equivalently marked
      placebo) at bedtime based on symptoms and tolerability. After the 4-week titration phase,
      subjects will continue at stable dose of study medication for a 4-week stable dose phase.
      Subjects will be asked to complete sleep diaries daily during their participation in the
      study. In the last week of the stable dose phase, participants will undergo an additional
      week of at-home sleep monitoring using actigraphy, complete end of treatment surveys, and
      undergo end-of-treatment clinical assessments and discontinuation of study medication.

    <measure>Change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Distressing Dream Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 9 (end-of-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>For the assessment of nightmares, the CAPS developed for the DSM-IV will be utilized. The CAPS IV's wide use as an outcome measure in clinical research has provided abundant information about its reliability and responsiveness to change with treatment in general and for nightmares specifically. All existing studies of alpha-blockers for PTS nightmares and non-nightmare symptoms have used the CAPS for DSM-IV, and therefore our results will be more comparable to existing studies. The distressing dreams item from the CAPS for DSM-IV also has strong behavioral anchors, providing detail on both the frequency and intensity of nightmares. A CAPS (DSM-IV) distressing dreams item score of &gt;=5, as used in prior research on alpha-blockers, will be a requirement for inclusion. Change in CAPS distressing dream score between baseline and end-of-treatment will be the primary measure of the reduction of nightmare frequency/intensity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 (end-of-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period and acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (testretest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score &gt; 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.</description>

    <time_frame>All subjects will wear the actigraph daily for 7 days at pre-treatment baseline (week 0), 7 days in week 5 of study drug treatment, and at end-of-treatment week 8 prior to drug discontinuation.</time_frame>
    <description>The AMI Octagonal Basic Motionlogger (www.ambulatorymonitoring.com), which is worn on the wrist like a watch, is an advanced actigraph which has sufficient memory to record movements for up to 28 days. As indicated by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Standards of Practice Committee, actigraphy can improve the reliability of self-report estimates of sleep wake timing and may play an important 15 role in the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. It is also appropriate for the assessment of stability of treatment effects, including the assessment of changes in night-to-night variability in various sleep measures. Our lab has used this actigraph extensively, providing support for its usability in research subjects. High resolution data can be down-sampled for actigraphic sleep-wake estimation.</description>

    <description>Doxazosin is FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension and urinary outflow problems associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The immediate-release formulation is approved for use from 1mg up to 16mg. Based on drug company information and Micromedex, the SFVA pharmacy on-line reference resource for drug information, the only contraindication to use of doxazosin is hypersensitivity to doxazosin, its contents, or other quinazolines (e.g. prazosin, terazosin).</description>
