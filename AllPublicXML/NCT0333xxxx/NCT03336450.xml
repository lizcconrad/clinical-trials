    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigational treatment, MHOS/SHP615, is
      safe and effective in children with status epilepticus (SE) (convulsive) in the community
      setting. This study is open-label extension for patients who completed the SHP615-301 study
      and who tolerated and responded to MHOS/SHP615 treatment in the hospital setting.
