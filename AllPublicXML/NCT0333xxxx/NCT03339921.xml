  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the feasibility of a simple outpatient one time injection regimen for the
      treatment of Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (CECS). We think botulinum toxin
      injections will be a potentially cost-effective, low-risk alternative to surgery in reducing
      pain and returning patients to full activity.

      The study will be a prospective cohort pilot study designed to compare Active Duty patients,
      18 years of age or older, with Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (CECS) undergoing two
      different treatment interventions. The first arm will be patients receiving investigational
      botulinum toxin injections. The second arm will be patients who undergo the standard of care
      surgical fasciotomy. Both arms will be evaluated for pain relief with the universal pain
      scale and lower extremity functional index (LEFI) surveys at pre-treatment and again at one,
      three, and six months post-treatment. Clinical data that will be analyzed for research
      purposes in both groups include age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, time to diagnosis,
      minutes of exercise prior to onset of symptoms, minutes of rest before relief of symptoms,
      LEFI and pain on the Universal Pain Assessment Tool.
