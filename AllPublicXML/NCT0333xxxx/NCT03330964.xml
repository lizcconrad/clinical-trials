    <textblock>
      The clinical trail of electroacupuncture combined with oxaliplatin regimen on
      gastrointestinal carcinoma.This trail is randomized controled.Patients are diagnosed
      gastrointestinal cancer based on pathology or cell biology.They are randomized into 2
      groups:both groups receive Oxaliplatin regimen.The treatment group receives
      electroacupuncture in addition to the chemotherapy.The control group only receive the same
      chemotherapy with the treatment group.Both group have the same adjuvant therapy.

      chemotherapy with the treatment group.Both group have the same adjuvant therapy.Mainly to
      study about oxaliplatin into electroacupuncture leads to the influence of the peripheral
      nerve toxicity.Other clinical evaluation includes chemotherapy drug toxicities,quality of
      life(QOL), etc.
