  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia implies that alterations in the dopamine system
      cause functional abnormalities in the brain that may converge to aberrant salience
      attribution and eventually lead to psychosis. Indeed, widespread brain disconnectivity across
      the psychotic spectrum has been revealed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (rs-fMRI). However, the dopaminergic involvement in intrinsic functional connectivity
      (iFC) and its putative relationship to the development of psychotic spectrum disorders
      remains partly unclear - in particular at the low-end of the psychosis continuum. Therefore,
      the investigators examined dopamine-induced changes in striatal iFC and their modulation by
      psychometrically assessed schizotypy. The randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study
      design included 54 healthy, right-handed male participants. Each participant was assessed
      with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and underwent 10 min of rs-fMRI
      scanning. Participants then received either a placebo or 200 mg of L-DOPA, a dopamine
      precursor. The investigators analyzed iFC of six striatal seeds that are known to evoke
      modulation of dopamine-related networks.

      The investigators hypothesized that, within the L-DOPA treatment group, the striatal iFC
      would be disrupted due to increased availability of dopamine. The investigators further
      hypothesized that individuals with high schizotypal scores would show a disruption of
      striatal connectivity, as has been reported with schizophrenia. In addition, the
      investigators hypothesized that the L-DOPA-dependent change in striatal iFC would interact
      with the severity of positive symptoms, as has been found in previous studies in non-clinical
      psychosis. The investigators anticipated this symptom-dependent change, especially in the
      ventral striatal regions, because these are thought to modulate cortico-striatal loops
      associated with cognition and emotion.

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject in the group will participate in two test sessions, separated by at least one week. All sessions will start at 15:30.
In a double-blind within-design procedure, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a cachet of a dual-release formulation of 200 mg levodopa/50 mg benserazide (a peripheral L-dihhydroxyphenylalanine-decarboxylase inhibitor) or a placebo in the first session. In the second session they will receive the other intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>For the randomization of the intervention and placebo the &quot;Research Randomizer&quot; on www.randomizer.org will be used. The randomization will be performed by the Kantonsapotheke in Zurich. The generated list of condition sequences will be stored at there. The list will not be accessible for study members who are associated with the assessment. The Boxes containing the cachets will be labelled with the subject number and A or B for the first or second session, respectively as well as with the ID of the study. The cachets will be prepared and labelled at the Kantonsapotheke in Zurich. DA and placebo will be provided in identical cachets. The blinding will be broken only after a subject has completed both experimental sessions or in case of an acute reaction during the session.</masking_description>
