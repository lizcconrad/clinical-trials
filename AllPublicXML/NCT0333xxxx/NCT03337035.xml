    <textblock>
      Because oral probiotics reported to potentially induce endogenous Oxytocin, and Oxytocin has
      been reported to improve social behaviors, the investigators will conduct a pilot trial to
      compare the effects of probiotics and Oxytocin on social behavioral changes in ASD children.
      Additionally, the investigators will check oxytocin levels, and perform brain fMRI in some
      subjects, in order to determine which treatment is more efficient, sustainable, and
      practical, and whether both treatments in combination are better than either treatment alone.
      If the trial is conclusive, the investigators will conduct a trial in large scale to
      understand more the mechanism of ASD behaviors and corresponding effective interventions.

      This study description is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
      (CONSORT) guidelines that are published for the evaluation of randomized controlled trials.
      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study. Subjects must
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria below. Subjects will be randomized to 2 groups:

      Phase 1: a. oral Vitamin C as placebo, and b. oral probiotics; Phase 2: a. intranasal
      Oxytocin(OXT) + oral Vitamin C placebo, and b. intranasal OXT + oral probiotics The treatment
      will proceed for a total of 24 weeks. In the first phase (12 weeks), all the patients will be
      randomly and proportionally divided into two groups: Group A (30 subjects) receives oral
      probiotics while Group B (30 subjects) receives oral vitamin C as a placebo. In the second
      phase, subjects in Group A and Group B will continue their respective oral probiotics or
      placebo administration as in Phase 1. In addition, both groups will be simultaneously
      administered with intranasal OXT spray. Laboratory tests (3 times total, week 0, week 12,
      week 24) for evaluation of oxytocin levels will be performed prior to treatment and upon
      completion of the first and second phase of therapy. Standardized clinical testing and
      autonomic wristband testing will be performed before and after 12-week randomized treatment
      (twice in total). The biomarkers testing will be done in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
      lab or outsourced to certified labs labeled as research subjects without full identification
      of the subjects. Furthermore, the investigators plan to select up to 10 subjects from each
      group to conduct a series of MRI studies at week 0, week 12 and week 24.
