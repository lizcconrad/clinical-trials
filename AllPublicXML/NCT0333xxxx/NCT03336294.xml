  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      P31 nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN) Spectroscopy (SRM P31) has currently being poorly used
      in the field of sarcopenia.

      The aim of the CAMUS study is to investigate the feasibility a protocol of SRM P31 at rest,
      during and after a standardized physical task. The secondary objective is to compare the
      metabolism of tyhe skeletal muscle tissue assessed by SRM P31 in young and older individuals.
      A pilot study, cross-sectional study will be conducted. Ten healthy sedentary 70+ years males
      and 10 sedentary 25 to 30 years old male will be included.

      Level of physical activity, physical performances, will be assessed at baseline. RMN (T1;
      tractography and SRM P31) will be performed. SRM P31 will be performed at rest, during and
      after an exhausting muscle task at 70% 1-RM. Feasibility will be judged on the rate of
      valuable variables recorded (&gt;90%) inorganic phosphate (iP), phosphocreatine (PCr) and
      isoform of adenosine triphosphate (ATP : alfa, beta, gamma).
