  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is characterized by pain over the greater
      trochanter, which can refer down the lateral aspect of the hip. Historically, conservative
      treatments such as rest/activity modification, anti-inflammatory medication, physiotherapy
      and local corticosteroid injection, are employed as first-line management, with some
      refractory cases requiring surgical intervention.

      Acknowledging the unpredictable response and frequent recurrences associated with traditional
      non operative treatment, the risks and prolonged rehabilitation associated with surgery, and
      the favorable results from prior studies involving radial pressure waves as a treatment for
      GTPS, the aim of this study is to investigate the dose-related effect of focalized shockwave
      treatment at different total energy influx in patients with chronic GTPS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shockwave therapy (SWT) has been used successfully since the late 1980s for the management of
      various musculoskeletal disorders including plantar fasciopathy, achilles tendinopathy,
      shoulder calcific tendinopathy, and lateral epicondylitis. Although there are some negative
      trials, there are now many randomized, double-blinded, clinical trials that support the use
      of SWT for the above conditions. Acknowledging the unpredictable response and frequent
      recurrences associated with traditional non operative treatment, the risks and prolonged
      rehabilitation associated with surgery, the recognition of gluteal tendinopathy as a
      potential source of pain, and the favorable results from prior studies involving radial
      pressure waves as a treatment for GTPS, the aim of this study is to investigate the
      dose-related effect of shockwave treatment at different total energy by adjusting the energy
      flux density (EFD) in patients with chronic GTPS. The shockwave has been widely recognized in
      literature as a biological regulator, currently the biological effects of shockwaves can be
      obtained using lower energy than in the past.

      While the intensity or delivered energy is considered by some researchers to be a key factor
      for successful treatment, in current literature reviews, debate continues over the
      appropriate energy intensity and the total delivered energy that should be applied to the
      tissue.

      Therefore, higher intensity treatments usually require local anesthesia, which is known to
      reduce the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, some animal tests reported that an influx
      of energy of over 0.60 mJ/mm2 can cause permanent damage on the tendon. On the other hand,
      low-intensity energy is safer but has the disadvantage of lower treatment effects.

      The investigators hypothesize that a very low intensity protocol of ESWT has different
      effects on pain and function than a conventional protocol in a patient with GTPS syndrome.

    <masking_description>The participants will be blinded to the type of ESWT treatment and the assessor, data managers, statistician and study monitors will be blinded to the allocation. All participants who receive ESWT treatment will be treated using the same device (Duolith SD1, STORZ Medical, Switzerland) regardless of what group they are included in. The participants will not be able to predict the allocated group based on the appearance of the ESWT treatment. The blinding will be maintained until the data are locked. For blinding evaluation, allocation guessing will be assessed immediately after the final treatment. Practitioners and assessors will be instructed to treat the participants according to predefined standard operating procedures during the trial to maintain blinding.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the estimation of the intensity of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after treatment (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS provides a continuous scale for magnitude estimation and consists of a straight line, the ends of which are defined in terms of the extreme limits of pain experience such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain experienced. This gives the greatest freedom to choose pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. VAS data of this type is recorded as the number of millimeters from the left of the line with the range 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) to evaluate hip disability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The index consists of questions about pain and activities of daily living, referring to the previous week, and assessments of hip function (limping) and range of motion. Score ranges from 100 (no disability) to 0 (maximum disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The LEFS is a self-report questionnaire to measure &quot;patients' initial function, ongoing progress, and outcome about Lower Extremity. Patients will answer the question &quot;Today, do you or would you have any difficulty at all with:&quot; in regards to twenty different everyday activities. The maximum possible score is 80 points, indicating very high function. The minimum possible score is 0 points, indicating very low function.</description>

    <measure>Roles and Maudsley scale (RM) to evaluate patients satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The RM scale is a subjective 4-point patient assessment of pain and limitations of activity. The RM score has been used extensively at centers throughout the world to assess outcome after SWT. On the scale, 1 point indicates an excellent result with the patient having no symptoms. Two points indicate a good result with the patient significantly improved from the pretreatment condition and satisfied with the result. Three points indicate a fair result with the patient somewhat improved from the pretreatment condition and partially satisfied with the treatment outcome. Four points indicate a poor outcome with symptoms identical or worse than the pretreatment condition and dissatisfaction with the treatment result.</description>

    <measure>Likert scale (1-6) to evaluate degree of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Who will report themselves completely recovered or much improved will be counted as successes, and subjects who will report themselves somewhat improved, same, worse, or much worse will be counted as failures.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) to evaluate quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 (T1), 8 (T2), 12 (T3) and 24 (T4) weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D consists of two distinct sections.The first one is a subjective assessment for five dimensions (mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression) and each item provides the option to choose a level of gravity. Each item provides graduated answers from 1 to 3. The Level 1 is no problem, while leveling 3 the extreme limitation. The aggregation of the responses forms a five-digit number that represents the state of health. The three levels of response, for each of the five items, produce up to 243 possible descriptions of the state of health and allow to highlight the presence / absence of any problems and the their intensity.
The second section of the EQ-5D includes a VAS scale, represented graphically from a graduated scale ranging from 0 (worst possible health) at 100 (the best possible state of health) on which the interview indicates his perceived level of health status.</description>
