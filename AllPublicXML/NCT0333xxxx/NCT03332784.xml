  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      TAK-925 when a single dose of TAK-925 is administered to healthy adult participants, healthy
      elderly participants and patients with type 1 narcolepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orexins are neuropeptides that play a role in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. In
      type 1 narcolepsy, there is a loss of orexin producing neurons in the brain. The
      investigational drug, TAK-925, is an orexin 2 receptor agonist that is being tested in
      healthy adult participants, healthy elderly participants and patients with narcolepsy in
      order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single intravenous
      administration.

      The study will enroll approximately 20 healthy participants and 16 healthy elderly
      participants in Part 1 of the study and approximately 20 patients with narcolepsy in Part 2.

      In Part 1, the study consists of 4 cohorts of 8 or 4 participants each. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the following treatment groups
      to receive TAK-925 or placebo:

      - Part 1, Cohort 1; TAK-925 (Dose Level 1, 3, 5), Cohort 2; TAK-925 (Dose Level 2, 4, 6),
      Cohort 3 and 4; TAK-925 (Dose Level 5)

      For Cohort 1-4, healthy adult and elderly participants will be administered TAK-925 or
      placebo once in each cohort or dose level. The dose at the start (Cohort 1 dose level 1) is 7
      mg of TAK-925 and following doses in Cohorts 1-4 will be determined based on available data
      from previous Cohorts/dose levels.

      In Part 2 of the study, the study consists of 3 cohorts of 4 to 12 patients with narcolepsy.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups of Cohort 5-7 and will be
      administered TAK-925 or placebo once in each cohort. The dose of TAK-925 in Cohort 5-7 is TBD
      and will be decided based on available data from Part 1 and previous Cohorts.

      - Part 2, Cohort 5-7

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. Participants will make multiple visits to
      the clinic. Visits in Part 1 will include a screening period (Day -28 to -2), Check-in on Day
      -1, Treatment period (Day 1 and 2), and follow-up visit on Day 7. In Part 2 of the study, the
      visits include a screening period (Day -42 to -2), Check-in on Day -1, Cross-over period (Day
      1 to 4), and follow-up visit on Day 7.
