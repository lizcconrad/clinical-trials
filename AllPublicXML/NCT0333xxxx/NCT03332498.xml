      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability, describe the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or the
      highest protocol-defined dose level in the absence of establishing an MTD) of ibrutinib in
      combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced, refractory colorectal cancers.

    <textblock>
      On this study, one treatment cycle equals 21 days. On the first day of each study treatment
      cycle, 200 milligrams of pembrolizumab will be given through an IV (intravenously) for about
      thirty minutes. In addition, participants will begin taking the ibrutinib capsules every day
      starting on cycle 1, day 1. Participants will have a follow-up visit every 3 weeks, on about
      the first day of each cycle with laboratories drawn to make sure that the study drugs are not
      causing any side effects. In addition, participants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan
      every 6 to 7 weeks to determine whether your cancer is getting better or worse.

    <description>Standard 3+3 Design: The first cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 participants, according to a standard 3+3 design. If 0 out of the first 3 participants in the first cohort experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then dose escalation will continue as planned. If 1 out of the first 3 participants experience a DLT, then the cohort will be expanded to a total of 6 participants, and if no more than 1 out of 6 participants experiences a DLT in a given dose cohort, dose escalation will continue as planned. If ≥ 2 DLTs are observed in the first dose cohort, the principle investigator will discuss with Janssen on how to proceed. The DLT evaluation period will be defined as the time from the first dose of pembrolizumab and ibrutinib to 42 days after the first dose or if a participant experiences a DLT within this time period. A maximum of 2 cohorts is expected, making a total of approximately 12 evaluable participants during the dose escalation phase.</description>
