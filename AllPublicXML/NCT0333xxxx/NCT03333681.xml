      1. Objectives: Evaluation of mesenchymal stem cell therapy effects on cellular immune
           response in refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

        2. Design: This study has been performed as a phase 1 clinical trial.

        3. Setting and conduct: Autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were obtained
           by bone marrow aspiration and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium-Alpha (MEM-alpha) for
           4 weeks in standard clean room and then transfused to RA patients intravenously.

        4. Participant's major eligibility criteria is as follows: Ten refractory rheumatoid
           arthritis patients who show resistance to non biological Disease-modifying antirheumatic
           drugs (DMARDs) after 6 to 12 months have been enrolled in this study.

        5. Intervention: A single dose of intravenous autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal
           stem cells have been administered into patients with resistance to non-biological
           DMARDs.

        6. Main outcome measures (variables): Finding of mesenchymal stem cell therapy effects on
           the cellular immune responses.

    <textblock>
      Refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been
      selected. After signing informed consent form, autologous stem cells were obtained by bone
      marrow aspiration. Isolation and culture (3 to 4 weeks in MEM-alpha medium) of mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs) were performed in accredited good manufacturing practices (GMP) clean room.
      A panel of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers including CD105, CD166, CD44, CD45, CD90,
      and CD34 were checked for making sure about differentiation of cells into MSCs after 3-4
      weeks of cell culture. Viability of MSCs was checked by Trypan blue testing and all of the
      cultivations were negative for bacterial contamination. A single dose of 1000000 to 2000000
      mesenchymal stem cells/kg infused into patients intravenously. To prevent anaphylactic
      reactions, a single intravenous dose of hydrocortison (100 ml) and oral dimenhydrinate (10
      ml) were administered before MSCs infusion into patients. The effects of mesenchymal stem
      cells on the cellular immune responses were studied at 1, 6 and 12 months after infusion.
