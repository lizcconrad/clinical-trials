  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of our study is to investigate whether haemodialysis itself affects the
      efficacy of antiplatelet drugs and the effects of two different types of dialysis membranes
      (polysulfone membranes and polyamide membranes) on antiplatelet efficacy. A total of 60
      patients with ESRD and under dual-antiplatelet treatmen for at least 5 days will be enrolled
      and divided into the Clopidogrel group (clopidogrel 75mg qd;aspirin 100mg qd, n=30) and the
      Ticagrelor group (ticagrelor 90mg bid; aspirin 100mg qd, n=30). All included patients will
      receive haemodialysis by two different types of dialysis membrane.Platelet aggregation of
      venous blood from all patients will be detected by LTA and VerifyNow immediately before and
      after two times of haemodialysis.

        Cardiovascular events account for about 50% of all-cause mortality in patients with
        end-stage renal disease(ESRD), and about 20% of cardiac death events are caused by acute
        coronary syndromes(ACS).Over the past decade, the number of percutaneous coronary
        intervention (PCI) in patients with ESRD has increased by nearly 50%. Aspirin, clopidogrel
        and ticagrelor are the most widely used antiplatelet agents in ACS patients after
        PCI.Little is known about whether hemodialysis can affect the efficacy of antiplatelet
        agents or not.
