  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, affects
      approximately 100,000 peoples in France. It is the leading cause of disability in young
      adults. Tremor is a common symptom (25-58% of patients depending on the series) and can be
      particularly disabling. The drug treatments against tremor are ineffective or insufficient.
      Deep brain stimulation of the Vim (Small nucleus within thalamus) and stereotactic
      radiofrequency thalamotomy have shown their efficacy in this indication. However, in some
      cases these invasive procedures are impossible because of operational risk. Gamma knife
      thalamotomy can be an alternative choice. This procedure, less invasive, mainly because of
      the absence of craniotomy is used by several teams of international reputation for over
      fifteen years, with good to excellent results in essential tremor. The team of Marseille,
      which has an experience of 22 years in Gamma Knife radiosurgery has treated 250 patients with
      severe tremor (essential tremor or Parkinson's disease) by a unilateral thalamotomy with an
      improvement of 70% of functional scores.

      In the literature, no formal studies of the effect of Gamma Knife in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      tremor is reported. There are only a few cases without specific evaluation of the efficacy in
      this disease. Hence the importance of studying in detail the effects of this technique, which
      allows a precise and limited lesion volume. Using an isocenter of 4mm and a dose of 130 Gy
      radiation lesion obtained is limited to a volume of 200 to 500 mm3.

      The aim of this study is to assess through a minimally invasive technique with a
      circumscribed and reproducible lesion volume, the effect of thalamotomy on the particular
      tremor in multiple sclerosis with a prospective evaluation of its effects.

      Patients with MS with a disabling tremor will be included in the study. They will be assessed
      with neurological examination, quality of life scales, neuropsychological assessment,
      functional scores and cerebral MRI.

      This study will demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of Gamma Knife thalamotomy in
      MS patients with severe tremor.
