      Subjects will receive the &quot;Basel phenotyping cocktail&quot; capsule orally with 120-200ml tap
      water in fasted state. After intake peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn.

      12 patients (male and female) with liver cirrhosis for each Child Pugh Category A, B, and C,
      and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects will be included (in total 48
      participants).
