      The purpose of this study is to compare long-acting basal insulin analog LY2963016 to Lantus®
      in insulin naïve adult Chinese participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on 2 or more
      oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs). Participants will continue their OAMs throughout
      the study.
