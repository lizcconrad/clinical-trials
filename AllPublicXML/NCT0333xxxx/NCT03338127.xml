      this study to evaluate the frequency of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients in
      intensive care units.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 20% of hospitalized patients and up to 67% of
      those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), making it among the most common organ
      dysfunctions among the critically ill . Depending on severity, Acute kidney injury (AKI)
      contributes to short-perimortality rates between 40% and 70% , and survivors are at increased
      risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and late death.

      The diagnosis of Acute kidney injury (AKI) is only considered after achieving an adequate
      status of hydration and after excluding urinary obstruction; Acute kidney injury (AKI) is
      defined by the sudden decrease (in 48 h) of renal function, defined by an increase in
      absolute serum creatinine of at least (0.3 mg/dL) or by a percentage increase in serum
      creatinine ≥50% (1.5× baseline value), or by a decrease in the urinary output (documented
      oliguria &lt;0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6hours).

      The purpose of this study was to benchmark the outcomes of acute kidney injury in a
      critically ill surgical patients.We hypothesized that renal dysfunction in this population is
      common and is associated with a significantly higher burden of morbidity, mortality, and
      resource utilization
