  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) remains a leading cause of childhood mortality
      and morbidity. Between 2007 and 2012, Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC), Siem Reap, Cambodia
      documented that S. pneumoniae was responsible for around 10% of bloodstream infections in
      hospitalised children, with a case fatality rate of 15.6%.

      The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), covering between 7 and 13 of the &gt;90
      pneumococcal serotypes, has resulted in significant declines in invasive pneumococcal disease
      (IPD) incidence in countries where they are included in routine childhood immunisation
      schedules. Paediatric radiologic pneumonia incidence is also reduced by PCV, but the impact
      on clinical pneumonia is minimal. The vaccines have had an effect on reducing the burden of
      drug resistant IPD, although this may not be sustained. Given the large number of serotypes
      not included in the current PCV formulations, it is not surprising that initial declines in
      overall IPD incidence have been eroded by, for the time being, small increases in IPD due to
      non-vaccine serotypes. To date most data on this serotype replacement disease has come from
      high-income countries. It less clear how much serotype replacement will occur in low and
      middle income countries, where pre-PCV disease incidence is generally higher and other
      factors, such as unregulated antimicrobial consumption, may play a role in encouraging
      non-vaccine serotype infections.

      Nasopharyngeal colonisation by S. pneumoniae is common in childhood and is an essential
      prerequisite for invasive disease. Surveillance of pneumococcal colonisation can provide
      important data regarding serotype replacement and disease-associated serotypes, and may also
      allow prediction of likely IPD incidence changes post-vaccine introduction. A recent study of
      pneumococcal colonisation in children attending the AHC out-patients has documented an
      overall colonisation prevalence of approximately 65%.

      In January 2015, Cambodia will introduce the 13-valent PCV (PCV13; serotypes covered 1, 3, 4,
      5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 19A, 23F). The vaccine will be rolled out nationally with a
      3+0 dosing schedule (6, 10 and 14 weeks) and no catch up campaign. There is no robust
      national surveillance system in place to monitor the effects of PCV13 introduction.

    <description>Prospective study of children with invasive pneumococcal disease / probable bacterial meningitis (PCV-D)
Clinical procedures
At study enrolment:
Admission clinical findings / laboratory results will be recorded.
A questionnaire will be administered to the parent / guardian or caretaker to assess the child's immunisation status, household structure, environmental exposures, and recent antimicrobial use.
Radiology procedures As part of routine clinical management at AHC, a digital chest radiograph (CXR) may be performed as part of a child's diagnostic work up. CXRs will be read and interpreted primarily by the AHC radiologists. All CXR will subsequently be re-read by two study clinicians and interpreted according to the WHO paediatric radiologic pneumonia criteria.
Laboratory procedures
• Residual routine clinical specimens further analysed as part of the study protocol:
Blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture specimens.
EDTA / serum specimens.
Urine.</description>
