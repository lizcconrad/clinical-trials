  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's the first-in-human study of Recombinant Humanized Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody for
      Injection (B001). The main purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerance of
      B001 for patients with CD20 positive B-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma. It will also explore the
      PK/PD manner and ORR in this study.
