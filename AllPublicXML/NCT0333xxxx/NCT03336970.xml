    <textblock>
      Ninety asymptomatic maxillary anterior teeth with periapical lesions were treated in single
      versus multiple visit root canal treatment. Half of the teeth were randomly assigned to the
      single-visit (SV) group and received an additional final rinse with 2% CHX before obturation.
      The other teeth were treated in multiple visits (MV) with calcium hydroxide dressing. All
      patients were recalled and investigated clinically and radiographically for 24 months.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate postoperative pain and radiographic evidence of
      periapical healing in teeth with apical periodontitis treated in a single visit with an
      additional final irrigation using 2% chlorhexidine and to compare the results with
      conventional multiple-visit root canal treatment (RCT) with an intracanal calcium hydroxide
      dressing as a control group. Ninety asymptomatic maxillary anterior teeth with periapical
      lesions were treated by a single operator using the step-back technique with manual
      instrumentation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
      (EDTA) as irrigants. Half of the teeth were randomly assigned to the single-visit (SV) group
      and received an additional final rinse with 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) before obturation. The
      other teeth were treated in multiple visits (MV), after completion of root canal
      instrumentation calcium hydroxide paste was placed into the root canal and root canal
      obturation was performed in second visit. All patients were recalled and investigated
      clinically and radiographically for 24 months. Postoperative pain at 24-48 hours and changes
      in apical bone density indicating radiographic healing were evaluated statistically using the
      Mann-Whitney U-test followed by the Friedman and the Wilcoxon tests (α=.05).
