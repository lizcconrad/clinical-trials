  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brief Interventions (BI) based on Motivational Interviewing are effective to reduce alcohol
      use. In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that that an open Mindset increases
      the positive effects of BI.

      Patients who are newly admitted to the psychotherapy outpatient clinic are routinely screened
      for risky alcohol use. All patients with risky alcohol use are eligible to the study and all
      receive the WHO's ASSIST-linked BI.

      Participants receive a brief Mindset induction prior to receiving BI. They are are randomly
      assigned to either the induction of an open or a closed Mindset according to Gollwitzer.

      The investigators measure the change in alcohol-related risk perception, treatment motivation
      and real alcohol drinking.

    <description>Psychological Intervention. Participants are asked to work on a brief paper-and-pencil task that has been shown to induce an Implemental Mindset according to the Mindset theory of action phases (Gollwitzer &amp; Keller (2016).

    <intervention_name>Experimental Mindset Induction</intervention_name>
    <description>This induction of a psychological state was extensively studied in cognitive science. Gollwitzer &amp; Keller (2016, p.3): &quot;The deliberative mindset is evoked by asking participants to (a) name an unresolved, important personal problem that is causing rumination but for which they have not made a decision yet and (b) reflect on whether to take action or not. Further, to enhance the depth of reflection, participants are requested to list positive and negative, short- and long-term consequences of both deciding to act and not to act; indicating the probability of the occurrence of each of these consequences is required.
The implemental mindset is evoked by asking participants to think of a personal project for which they have already made the decision to act but did not initiate any action yet. Subsequently, participants are asked to list the steps necessary for successful goal attainment and to plan out in detail when, where, and how they intend to act on each of these steps.&quot;</description>
