  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is common and has substantial impact on patients' psychological
      wellbeing, quality of life and healthcare use. Although cardiac diagnosis is 'ruled out',
      many patients think they have an undetected cardiac disease (i.e. they suffer cardiac
      anxiety) as no other explanation is offered. They therefore avoid activities that they
      believe might be harmful to their heart, leading to greater ill-health, and increased
      healthcare use and societal costs. Targeting cardiac anxiety with psychological interventions
      might break this vicious circle and improve patient outcomes. Patients need to evaluate the
      way they perceive and handle their chest pain, which can be done with cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT).

      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of an
      Internet-delivered CBT (I-CBT) program on psychological distress and other patient-reported
      outcomes in patients with NCCP. A second aim is to explore factors related to implementation
      of I-CBT in clinical care. The study has a randomized controlled design comparing I-CBT with
      Internet-delivered information program. Quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the I-CBT program. Implementation issues will be evaluated from the
      perspectives of patients, healthcare professionals and policymakers using qualitative
      methods.

    <description>Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ) will be used before and after the intervention (5 weeks), and 3, 6, 12 months after the end of the intervention to assess changes related to intervention. The CAQ consists of 18 items and a score range between 0 and 72. The higher scores the greater cardiac anxiety.</description>

This questionnaire comprises 9 items with scores ranging between 0 and 27. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms. A cut-off of 10 demonstrates moderate levels and will be used in this study.</description>

    <description>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used before and after the intervention (5 weeks), and 3, 6, 12 months after the end of the intervention to assess changes related to intervention. The EQ-5D includes five dimensions of Health-related quality of life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels corresponding to: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems/unable. The questionnaire also includes an EQ-VAS, which is a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine).</description>

    <description>The intervention (I-CBT) will consist of 5 weeks of Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy using three main parts. The first is psychoeducation that aims to educate the patients about chest pain and other causes than the cardiac ones. The other part concerns avoidance and exposure. This includes exposing the patients to physical activities that patients perceive as a threat to the heart. The third part contains awareness (mindfulness) training to teach the patients to have contact with the present moment despite chest pain and not trying to avoid it.</description>
