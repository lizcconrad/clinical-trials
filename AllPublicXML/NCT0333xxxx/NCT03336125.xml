  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to investigate whether an intervention program with vitamin D
      supplementation is able to improve the biology of stress resilience as well as subjective
      well-being in individuals with antisocial behavior problems (forensic inpatients).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial looking at the effects of vitamin D supplements on mental
      health in a group of forensic inpatients. More specific the effects of vitamin D will be
      investigated in relation to underlying biological mechanisms associated with resilience
      (e.g., serotonin, cortisol, heart rate variability and executive functioning), but also
      subjective well-being such as sleep quality, emotion-regulation, anxiety, depression and
      self-reported resilience. About 100 participants will be randomized to an intervention group
      (vitamin D) or a control group (placebo). The intervention will last for 3-4 months. Pre-test
      will start in October/November 2017 and post-test in April/May 2018.
