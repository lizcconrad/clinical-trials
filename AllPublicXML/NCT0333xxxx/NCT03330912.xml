    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of seat height on hemiplegic-pattern wheelchair propulsion.
      Each subject will act as their own control and measures will be obtained in a one sixty
      minute session. Five seat heights relative to the subject's leg length will be measured in a
      random order to see the effect on forward and backwards wheelchair propulsion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people who have suffered a stroke require a wheelchair for mobility. Hemiplegia is a
      common result of stroke.Many people with hemiplegia propel themselves using their sound-side
      arms and legs (&quot;hemiplegic-pattern propulsion&quot;) in manual wheelchairs.Often people using this
      pattern are prescribed wheelchairs with a reduced seat height to facilitate foot propulsion.
      Despite the seeming obviousness of the need to lower the seat height for people who use foot
      propulsion,there is little available evidence to help establish optimal wheelchair seat
      height. The study objective is to test the hypothesis that there is an optimum wheelchair
      seat height (expressed as a percentage of the lower leg length) for hemiplegic-pattern
      wheelchair propulsion. The investigators expect that the optimum seat height will be lower
      than that usually used for wheelchairs that are hand-propelled.

      A single-subject design with able-bodied participants will be used to investigate 5
      randomized seat heights. The 5 seat heights will be set relative to the subjects leg length
      at a single 60 minute data collection session All measures will be obtained during one
      session. The optimal seat height will be chosen based on wheelchair propulsion speed, push
      frequency and effectiveness over 10m going forward on smooth surface, and 5m going backwards
      over a soft surface.

    <description>Investigator developed questionnaire asking how difficult it was to perform the propulsion test. The participant will self-report his/her level of difficulty for this skill using a five-point Likert scale (1 =very easy, 2=somewhat easy, 3=neither easy nor difficult, 4= somewhat difficult and 5=very difficult). A single number will be reported.</description>
