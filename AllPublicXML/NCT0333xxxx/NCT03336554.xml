    <textblock>
      hMe-Seal is a low-input whole-genome cell-free 5hmC sequencing method based on selective
      chemical labeling. It uses β-glucosyltransferase (βGT) to selectively label 5hmC with a
      biotin via an azide-modified glucose for pull-down of 5hmC-containing DNA fragments for
      sequencing. After selectively constructing 5hmC library, highthroughput-sequencing will be
      performed on an Illumina Nextseq-500 instrument. By ways of Rawdata processing, differential
      loci between Osteosarcoma group and control group will be detected to indentify specific
      epigenetic biomarkers of Osteosarcoma.

      The investigator want to enroll 100 osteosarcoma participants initially treated in
      Musculoskeletal Tumor Center of Peking University People's Hospital(PKUPH). All those
      participants will follow the chemo-protocol for osteosarcoma in PKUPH.8 ml of peripheral
      blood would be drawed before each cycle of chemotherapy for further analysis. After
      definitive surgery, participants will need to take 8ml of peripheral blood every 2 months for
      6 months. A total of 6 times of blood drawing will need to be done.

      In hMe-Seal approach, peripheral blood is collected into EDTA-coated Vacutainers. Plasma is
      collected from the blood samples after centrifugation at 1 600× g for 10 min at 4 °C and 16
      000× g at 10 min at 4 °C. CfDNA is extracted using the Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit(QIAGEN).
      After that, cfDNA (1-10 ng) is end repaired, 3'-adenylated and ligated to DNA Barcodes using
      KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Ligated DNA is incubated in a solution containing
      HEPES buffer, UDP-6-N3-Glc and βGT . After that, DBCO-PEG4-biotin is directly added to the
      reaction mixture. Next, DNA is purified by Micro Bio-Spin 30 Column (Bio-Rad). The purified
      DNA is incubated with M270 Streptavidin beads (Life Technologies) in specific buffer. The
      beads are subsequently undergone three 5-min washes each with four kinds of different
      buffers. All binding and washing are done at room temperature with gentle rotation. Beads are
      then resuspended in water and amplified with 16 cycles of PCR amplification. The PCR products
      are purified using AMPure XP beads. Pair-end 38bp sequencing is performed on the NextSeq-500
      instrument.

    <description>For osteosarcoma, tumor necrosis rate will be done for every participant. On pathologic examination, the surgical specimens were carefully studied and sectioned. This evaluation included establishing the gross extent of the tumor[26, 27] and noting its soft tissue component and lines of surgical resection[27]. An average of 10-20 histologic specimens were examined in each of the en bloc resections to delineate the extension of osteosarcoma up and down the marrow cavity and to study the effects of chemotherapy on the tumor (viable, partially, largely, or totally necrotic), which were then calculated as tumor necrosis rate as paper described.</description>
