  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate if sensory re-learning in combination with
      task-specific training is more effective than task-specific training alone to improve sensory
      function of the hand, dexterity, the ability to use the hand in daily activities, perceived
      participation and life satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of stroke survivors suffer from sensory impairments of their affected upper
      limb (UL), which can lead to long term problems to use the UL in daily life, such as personal
      care, household- and leisure activities. Few studies have evaluated if sensory re-learning in
      combination with task-specific training can improve the ability to perform daily hand
      activities and perceived participation. Therefore, there is a need for more studies. This is
      a single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms. Thirty persons
      with sensory impairments of the UL after stroke will be recruited and randomized to either
      sensory re-learning in combination with task-specific training or to task-specific training
      only. The training will consist of 2.5 hours of group training per session, 2 times per week
      for 5 weeks. Assessments will be conducted pre- and post-training and at 3 months' after the
      intervention.

      Descriptive statistics (mean (SD) or median (min- max) will be used to characterize the study
      groups. Non-parametric statistics will be used for ordinal data and parametric statistics for
      continues data. To analyze between group differences, the Mann-Whitney test or Independent
      sample t-test will be used and Wilcoxon signed ranks test or paired t-test to analyze within
      group differences. The level of statistical significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Semmes- Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test from baseline to post intervention and from baseline to 3 month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Assess touch detection thresholds of the hand and fingers. The short version with 5 filaments from 0.07 gram to 279 grams will be used. The touch detection thresholds are scored on a 0 to 5-point scale, where 5 represents the thinnest filament and 0 represents the largest filament. Five different positions of the hand are tested: fingertip on digit I, II, V and on the thenar and hypothenar region. Both hands are tested and the total sum score is 25 for each hand.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the ability to identify shapes and textures. Both the affected and non- affected hand are tested and the scores range from 0 to 3 points per hand for each subtest with a maximum score of 6 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fugl- Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) sensory section from baseline to post intervention and from baseline to 3 month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures light touch and proprioception of the upper limb after stroke. The score ranges from 0 to 4 points for each subtest with a maximum score of 8 points per hand.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tactile object identification test from baseline to post intervention and from baseline to 3 month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the ability to identify different objects without vision. Out of 20 objects, 15 are used during the assessment. Within 15 seconds the participant should blind-fold recognize an object. Correct answer yields 2 points, recognition of some feature of the object yields 1 point and incorrect answer 0 points; thus a maximum total sum score of 30 points.</description>

    <description>Measures activity in daily living with a 30-item scale where the participants rate how much (amount of use; AOU) and how well (quality of movement; QOM) they use their affected hand in daily activities. The score ranges from 0 (never use the affected arm for this activity) to 5 (always use the affected arm for this activity) and for QOM from 0 (inability to use the affected arm for this activity) to 5 (ability to use the affected arm for this activity just as well as before the stroke).</description>

This is a client-centered interview based outcome measure, where the participants identify problems in their execution of activities in self-care, productivity and leisure activities. The self-perceived performance and satisfaction of their sensory related problems are rated on a scale ranging from 1 (not able to do respective not satisfied) to 10 (able to do extremely well respective extremely satisfied). Higher ratings indicate better performance and more satisfaction.</description>
