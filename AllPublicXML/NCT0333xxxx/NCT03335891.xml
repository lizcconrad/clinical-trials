      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of core stabilization exercises combined with the
      patient education program (AEP) and breathing exercises in patients with asthma.

      Design: A randomized controlled study Setting: Chest diseases clinic of a university
      hospital. Subjects: The study sample consists of 26-68 years old asthma patients who were
      diagnosed at least 6 month prior to the study.

      Interventions: All subjects were included in the asthma education program (AEP) and both
      groups were trained for diaphragmatic and pursed lip breathing exercises (2times/wk. 6-week
      duration at clinic). The core stabilization program was applied twice a week for a duration
      of 6 weeks in TG.

      Main Measures: Spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure
      (MEP), International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ), Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale(HADS), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire(AQOL), Six-minute walking
      test(6MWT), Prokin PK200, Italy were used to evaluate feasibility of interventions.

      All volunteers received an asthma education program (AEP) and trained for diaphragmatic and
      pursed lip breathing exercises. Additionally, the TG participated in the core stabilization
      exercises program combined with AEP and breathing exercises. Data were collected from all the
      patients at baseline and post interventions (6 week) by the same physiotherapist who also
      supervised the exercise sessions.

      All subjects were included in the asthma education program (AEP). AEP was performed at least
      once for approximately 20 minutes via face to face interviews. Education topics covered
      description of asthma, physiological changes of lungs, risk factors, treatment methods,
      relaxation positions to reduce dyspnea and usage of a specific inhaler. Breathing exercises
      were comprised of instructing breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip
      breathing exercises. Participants attended breathing exercises training for 2 days at the
      clinic under the supervision of a physiotherapist and 3 days at home as a home-exercise
      program. Total duration of breathing exercises lasted for 6 weeks. TG performed core
      stabilization exercises combined with breathing control for 2 days/a week for the duration of
      6 weeks under the supervision of a physiotherapist at the clinic. Basic knowledges on spine,
      muscles of core stabilization and working principle of diaphragm and biofeedback unit (SPB)
      (Chattanooga Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback, USA) were explained before the training. The
      SPB consists of an inflation pump and a cell like sphygmomanometer, which reflects body
      spinal movement in terms of mmHg by changing pressure in air filled cells. The SPB was placed
      under the lumbar 5th vertebra and patients attempted to maintain their core stability
      performing neutral zones at the settled level of 40 mmHg pressure. Furthermore,
      physiotherapist tried to improve thoracolumbar awareness by following changes from SPB and
      volunteers assured a constant lumbar position during upper and lower extremity movements
      combined with diaphragmatic movements. The 6 week exercise protocol emphasized core muscle
      co-contraction in hook-lying position with a flat cushion between two knees to provide
      integration between the pelvic floor muscles and diaphragm. Subsequently, exercises
      progressed as diaphragmatic breathing, flexion of both shoulder with breathing control and
      extending knees bilaterally with breathing control. Moreover, the hold time and the number of
      repetitions were increased from 5 repeats x 1 set to 5 repeats x 4 sets and each session
      lasted 20 minutes.

    <description>Dynamic balance alterations of the subjects were assessed by TechnoBody Prokin PK 200 (PK), Italy dynamic balance instrument. PK is a circular mobile balance assessment platform like conventional rocker board. PK transmits data from platform to the computer with a wireless transmitter and it can detect each single angular movement with a chip inside the platform. Additionally, PK has four different applicators (easy, medium, hard and rectangular) to place under the mobile platform. The bipedal position for 30 seconds with the easy applicator during the dynamic balance test was used. PK is connected to a computer; in this way each single movement is recorded by a computer in real time mode.</description>
