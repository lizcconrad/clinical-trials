      INTRODUCTION: Stress is one of the greatest burdens of our society and often imply
      impairments in cognitive and emotional functions. The investigators hypothesize that changes
      in the brain's dopamine(DA)-based mesocorticolimbic projections in patients with work-related
      stress (adjustment disorder) will manifest in altered glucose metabolism in relation to
      neural activity and altered DA radiotracer binding potential at neurotransmitter and receptor
      level.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects and healthy controls undergo neuropsychiatric tests and PET/MR
      imaging with three tracers: [18F]FDG to measure glucose metabolism as a marker of neural
      activity, [11C]raclopride to investigate the DA binding potential in the striatum, and
      [11C]FLB 457 to study possible impaired mesocortical dopaminergic transmission. To
      demonstrate difference in glucose metabolism ≥2x41 patients/controls are needed.

      OUTCOME: The investigators expect to find that symptoms of cognitive and motivational/reward
      deficits could be attributable to changes in frontal lobe and striatal glucose metabolism in
      &gt;50% of patients and that changes in striatal D2 receptors and impaired mesocortical
      dopaminergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex are contributing factors.

      CONCLUSION: This project aims to generate entirely new and objective evidence of
      stress-induced cerebral illness and provide a basis for in depth research and more rational
      management of this strenuous disorder.

      Recruitment procedure: The department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (DOE) at OUH
      will recruit patients diagnosed according to the ICD10 F43.2x, and exposed to predominant
      psychosocial work stressors. Based on the diagnosis and evaluations the DOE selects the
      relevant patients. At the first visit to the DOE immediately after the diagnostic interview
      the, patients will presented to the option of participating in this project, by qualified
      personnel who have been instructed by the main investigator. At this point the main purpose
      and procedures of the investigation will presented orally and written information is supplied
      for the patients to take home. Shortly after, one or two days, these patients will be
      contacted by phone by a member of staff from the DOE or the main investigator. In this
      conversation the patients will be presented to the details of the project as well as an
      evaluation regarding the suitability to participate concerning the restrictions connected to
      PET-scanning. If interested, the patient will be invited to a personal meeting at OUH, with
      the possibility to bring an assessor. Due to the nature of neurobiology the scans must be
      conducted within a fairly short time period after the initial diagnosis. Hence declaration of
      consent will be presented and signed at the day of the first scan, also ensuring that all
      additional questions can be answered by the main investigator. The scans will be conducted
      within a fortnight after the fists contact.

      Recruitment criteria: The patients are recruited among women aged 34-54 years with an
      educational level corresponding to a bachelor, as these subjects represent the largest
      affected group in the Danish workforce. At the DOE subjects undergo a clinical diagnostic
      interview based on the ICD 10 criteria including screening for stressors in the psychosocial
      work environment and their relationship to disease development, private life strains,
      personal back-ground, mental vulnerability, and competing somatic disease, as well as tests
      for depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Major
      Depression Inventory (MDI). The psychosocial work environ-ment stressors being screened for
      are: quantitative demands, emotional demands, role conflict, role ambiguity, sup-port and
      encouragement, organizational justice, adequate education and training (skill level). The
      experience of stressors is assessed in relation to the most dominant stress models,
      &quot;demand-control-support&quot; (Karasek), &quot;effort and reward imbalance at work&quot; (Siegrist), &quot;Stress
      as Offense two self&quot; (Semmer), and classical stress theory focusing on appraisal / coping
      (Lazarus or Ursin). The DEO evaluates approximately 30 suitable subjects a month and estimate
      20% accept of participating in this project. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described
      in the appendix, which also holds details about the PET/MR studies. In connection with the
      scans, the main investigator will conduct an SCAN-PSE interview for the assessment of mental
      symptoms to determine if the participant's condition has changed since they decided to
      participate in the trial. Healthy controls are recruited at OUH Blood Bank and matched with
      regard to gender, age, educational and occupational background. Further, controls are
      screened for confounding factors in a similar manner as the patient group.
