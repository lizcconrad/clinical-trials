  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avelumab in combination with talazoparib will be investigated in patients with locally
      advanced (primary or recurrent) or metastatic solid tumors, including non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast
      cancer, recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer (UC), and castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against
      programmed death ligand 1 (PD L1). Avelumab selectively binds to PD L1 and competitively
      blocks its interaction with programmed death receptor 1 (PD 1), thereby interfering with this
      key immune checkpoint inhibition pathway. Avelumab is currently being investigated as single
      agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic solid tumors and various hematological malignancies.

      Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose)
      polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which is cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines harboring gene
      mutations that compromise deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, an effect referred to as
      synthetic lethality, and by trapping PARP protein on DNA thereby preventing DNA repair,
      replication, and transcription.

      Avelumab in combination with talazoparib will be investigated in patients with locally
      advanced (primary or recurrent) or metastatic solid tumors, including non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast
      cancer, recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer (UC), and castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
