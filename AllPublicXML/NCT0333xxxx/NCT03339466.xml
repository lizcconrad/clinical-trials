  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have undergone the Fontan procedure are uniquely dependent upon respiratory
      mechanics to support pulmonary blood flow (PBF). The investigators hypothesized that enhanced
      respiratory muscle function via inspiratory muscle training (IMT) would improve performance
      on cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing (CPET).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult Fontan subjects were recruited from 2 academic medical centers. Following
      characterization of pulmonary function and functional class, CPET was performed using
      incremental and constant work rate protocols. Subjects performed 6-8 weeks of IMT using a
      handheld inspiratory loading device (ThresholdÂ®, Philips); both exercise tests were then
      repeated. Patient-centered outcome data were collected before and after IMT (RAND-36
      assessment and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class).
