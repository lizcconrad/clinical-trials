  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the effects of a 6-week
      telerehabilitation on the three domains of the International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability and Health in HIV-infected patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART).

      HIV-infected patients were randomized either into an Endurance and Resistance Training
      Exercise (ERTE) group or a control (CON) group. Telerehabilitation was realized in a public
      fitness center, with online guidance and weekly telephone advice, 3 times per week for 6
      weeks. Feasibility was determined by recruitment rate, retention rate and adverse events.
      Secondary outcomes were impact on body composition, inflammation and coagulation (C-reactive
      protein, D-dimer), physical fitness and quality of life (WHOQOL-HIV).
