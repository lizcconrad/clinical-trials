  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if a commercially available hearing assistance device
      called the PockeTalker has an effect on performance on cognitive (memory and thinking) tests
      among skilled nursing facility residents.

      Investigators are asking residents to perform cognitive tests with and without hearing
      assistance equipment known as PockeTalkers. This study will be conducted at one urban Skilled
      Nursing Facility (SNF) with the goal of understanding the extent to which hearing impairment
      impacts commonly used cognitive impairment measures for clinical assessment. Cognitive
      performance will be measured, cerumen occlusion, and perceived hearing.
