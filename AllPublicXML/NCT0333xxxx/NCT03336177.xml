  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systematic screening for cervical cancer stops in France at 65 years old. The incidence of
      certain types of gynecological neoplasia increases with age (endometrium, vulva). Diagnosis
      delay of 8 months has been described for uterine cancer and longer delays for vulvar cancer.

      The aim of our study is to understand help-seeking behavior and its delay for this type of
      cancer among patients older than 65.

      Our study assess the reasons for which the patient took time to go to the doctor despite of
      their symptoms. We use a qualitative methodology. Our study categorizes lived experiences,
      recorded in semistructured interview transcripts. We use psychodynamic and semiopragmatic
      analyses of the discourse to obtain hypotheses about possible reasons of the delay in the
      help-seeking process.&quot;
