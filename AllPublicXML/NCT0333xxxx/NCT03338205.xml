  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to perform a pilot study assessing the safety and
      utility of intravenous ketamine as an adjuvant therapy in the emergency department setting
      for pediatric patients in acute status asthmaticus who have failed standard emergency
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a cohort of 20 subjects to assess the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of ketamine in status asthmaticus.

      The study will take place at the Augusta University's pediatric emergency department 24 hours
      a day. The attending physician who is clinically treating the patient will identify the
      patient as a potential study candidate (see inclusion criteria). Study team members will then
      be notified and obtain informed consent for potential participants who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Once a patient in the Augusta University Children's Hospital of Georgia Pediatric Emergency
      Department is deemed a potential study subject, informed consent will be obtained by the
      research study team members. The patient and their parents will be provided with all the
      required information about the study including potential risks and benefits associated with
      participation. The information will be presented in a private setting in a language the
      patient understands. The patient and/or their parent/guardian will have opportunities to ask
      questions and will be given enough time to consider participation before providing consent. A
      document will be given to obtain assent/consent that reiterates all the information about the
      study (including reason for the study, risks, benefits, etc.)

      Study team members that will be actively involved in the study will be either pediatric
      emergency medicine faculty or pediatric emergency medicine fellows that are on staff.

      Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will have ketamine 1 mg/kg IV bolus
      administered once informed consent has been obtained.
