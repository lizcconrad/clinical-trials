  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients implanted with Biotronik CRT-D and QP lead equipped with MultiPole pacing
      mode is grouped into which programmed into MultiPole pacing, or conventional bi-ventricular
      pacing mode. They are followed up by seven month post implantation, and predefined cardiac
      functional parameters are collected at each visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will undergo the baseline medical tests to assess the cardiac functions
      (e.g. echo, blood test, and 12-Lead ECG) prior to the implantation of Biotronik CRT-D and QP
      lead featured with MultiPole Pacing parameter. At implantation, LV-LV conduction delays are
      measured in predefined LV pacing and sensing configurations. One month after the successful
      implantation, the patients revisit the investigation site to be adjudicated for programming
      MultiPole pacing or continuing bi-ventricular pacing mode, based on their echo readings by
      then. Patients are subsequently followed up at four and seven month post implantation to
      acquire the LV-LV conduction delays and echo readings, etc. at the time.
