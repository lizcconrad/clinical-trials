      Phase 2c multi-center, open-label, partially randomized clinical trial in DS-TB and DR-TB
      participants.

      All participants in the below arms will have follow-up for a period of 104 weeks (24 months)
      from the start of therapy.

      Participants with Drug Sensitive TB (DS-TB):

      Participants with DS-TB will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. These participants
      will receive either BPaMZ daily for 17 weeks (4 months), or HRZE/HR combination tablets daily
      for 26 weeks (6 months). participants will be stratified for co-infection with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cavitation.

      Participants with Drug Resistant TB (DR-TB):

      Participants with DR-TB will be assigned to receive BPaMZ daily for 26 weeks (6 months).

        If they are entered into the trial due to being sensitive to rifampicin and isoniazid by
        rapid molecular sputum based test, however on receipt of the rifampicin and/or isoniazid
        phenotypic resistance testing in liquid culture this shows they are rifampicin or isoniazid
        resistant, they will be:

          1. Excluded as late exclusions;

          2. Possibly replaced as determined by the Sponsor.

        DR-TB treatment arm participants should be:

        a. Resistant to rifampicin and/or isoniazid. A chest x-ray which in the opinion of the
        investigator is compatible with pulmonary TB.

        Be of non-childbearing potential or using effective methods of birth control, as defined
        below:

        methods and are not planning to conceive throughout treatment and for 12 weeks after the
        last dose of trial medication or discontinuation from trial medication in case of premature
        discontinuation.

        (Note: Hormone-based contraception alone may not be reliable when taking IMP; therefore,
        hormone-based contraceptives alone cannot be used by female participants to prevent
        pregnancy).

        Participants will be excluded from participation if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

             investigator, could compromise the well-being of the participant or prevent, limit or
             confound protocol specified assessments.

          2. Being, or about to be, treated for Malaria.

             testing in liquid culture they are found to be fluoroquinolones resistant, they will
             be excluded as late exclusions;
