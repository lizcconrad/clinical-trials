  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether the spacing of the interrupted cutaneous sutures
      affects surgical wound cosmesis on the trunk and extremities. In other words, the
      investigators would like to determine which of the following yields a more cosmetically
      appealing scar: many closely approximated sutures or fewer, more widely spaced sutures. The
      investigators wish to compare the effects of two versus five millimeter spacing between
      sutures.

    <textblock>
      Sutures are the standard of care in repairing cutaneous wounds. The majority of surgical
      reconstructions following a Mohs micrographic surgery and standard surgical excisions require
      two layers of sutures: a deep (subcutaneous) layer and a top (cutaneous) layer. The deep
      layer dissolves naturally whereas the top layer may necessitate removal if non-absorbable
      sutures are used.

      This study aims to investigate whether the spacing of the interrupted cutaneous sutures
      affects surgical wound cosmesis on the trunk and extremities. In other words, the
      investigators would like to determine which of the following yields a more cosmetically
      appealing scar: many closely approximated sutures or fewer, more widely spaced sutures. The
      investigators wish to compare the effects of two versus five millimeter spacing between
      sutures. It is possible that fewer, more widely spaced sutures may leave more open space in
      the wound, leaving more tension to pull on those few sutures, possibly encouraging the wound
      to dehisce and make it harder to approximate the wound edges yielding a less cosmetically
      appealing scar compared to placing many closely approximated sutures which would decrease the
      tension and likely better approximate the wound edges yielding a more cosmetically appealing
      scar. On the other hand, the investigators may find that suture spacing has no effect on
      wound cosmesis and that placing fewer, more widely spaced sutures is much more time
      efficient. The investigators may also find that the effect of suture spacing on wound
      cosmesis is dependent on wound tension. For example, perhaps the suture pacing would have no
      effect on the cosmesis of a wound under no tension, however, for a wound under high tension,
      it is possible that many closely approximated sutures would yield better cosmetic results for
      the reasons listed above.
