        Both vaccine and placebo recipients in HVTN trials in which HIV infection constitutes an
        endpoint (eg, test-of-concept, phase 2 and 3) who become HIV-1 infected after enrollment in
        the parent study and who meet the inclusion criteria may be offered enrollment in the
        study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for inclusion in
             the study:

               1. Confirmation of HIV-1 infection after enrollment in an HVTN vaccine trial in
                  which HIV-1 infection constituted an endpoint, according to the diagnostic
                  algorithm specified in the parent protocol.

               2. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent to participate in the
                  study.

               3. Ability and willingness to adhere to the on-study follow-up schedule.

               4. Ability and willingness to provide adequate information for locator purposes.

               5. Participants who are currently on ART or who previously received antiretrovirals
                  as part of post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, or previous
                  treatment regimen will be eligible for inclusion in this protocol. Their previous
                  treatment history will be collected. If a participant has been on ART for more
                  than 2 years, please consult with the protocol team leadership prior to
                  enrollment.

               6. For participants initiating ART, agreement of participant and PHCP to initiate
                  potent and durable ART regimens in accordance with local and international
                  guidelines. Examples of potent and durable regimens are provided in Appendix H.
                  Participants who initiate ART not consistent with regimens outlined in Appendix H
                  may enroll with permission of the protocol chair or designee(s).

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who meet the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

               1. Any medical, psychiatric, alcohol/drug dependency or other condition that, in the
                  judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a
                  contraindication to, protocol adherence or a participant's ability to give
                  informed consent.

               2. Participants who meet these additional criteria will be excluded from the study:

          -  Participants undergoing acute therapy for serious medical illnesses (in the opinion of
             the site investigator) within 14 days prior to initiation of ART.

          -  Participants with chronic, acute, or recurrent infections that are serious (in the
             opinion of the site investigator).

          -  Participants who must continue with chronic (maintenance) therapy (e.g., tuberculosis
             [TB], pneumocystis pneumonia [PCP]), must have completed at least 14 days of therapy
             and be clinically stable prior to initiation of ART.

          -  Oral and vaginal candidiasis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, and other minor illnesses,
             as defined by the site investigator, present no restriction to eligibility.

          -  Participants undergoing radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, or receiving an
             immunomodulator within 45 days prior to initiation of ART. (A tapering course of
             corticosteroids as acute therapy for PCP or other conditions is an exception.)
