  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and feasibility of a dyadic-based
      intervention program (DT), delivered through state-of-the art computer tablet technology. A
      novel feature of the investigation is its focus on both the caregiver and the recipient of
      care (person with AD) and the integration of an evidenced-based caregiver intervention and
      evidenced-based cognitive/functional training for the care recipient. The program will be
      tailored for the caregiver and emphasize issues important to caregivers, not only in the
      earlier stages of caregiving, but will also target issues across the caregiving trajectory to
      help prepare the caregiver for changes in their role. Two hundred and forty Hispanic, African
      American and White/Caucasian dyads will be randomized to the DT intervention or Control
      condition. Measures at baseline and the 6 and 12-month follow-ups will include indices of
      care recipient cognitive and functional status, and caregiver outcomes such as; quality of
      life, distress, and caregiving efficacy. Information will also be gathered on ethnic
      differences in response to the intervention and estimates of cost effectiveness of the
      intervention.
