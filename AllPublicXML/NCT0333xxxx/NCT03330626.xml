  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although monitoring fluid balance for continuous renal replacement therapy-treated patients
      is an important issue, most physicians usually use conventional methods such as the
      difference between the amount of intake and output (I &amp; O), which is not objective way.
      Meanwhile, bioimpedance electrical vector analysis presents the patients' fluid status with
      more objective data. Thus, the investigators will investigate the clinical benefit for
      monitoring fluid balance when the investigators use InBody S10, one of representative
      bioimpedance electrical vector analysis, compared with conventional methods among the
      patients who need continuous renal replacement therapy.

      Thus, the investigators will investigate the clinical benefit for monitoring fluid balance by
      using InBody S10 (0, 1, 2-day, and 7-day from CRRT initiation), one of representative
      bioimpedance electrical vector analysis, compared with conventional methods among the
      patients who need continuous renal replacement therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be eligible for INCLUSION in the study if ALL the following criteria are
             met;

               1. The treating clinician believes that the patient requires continuous renal
                  replacement therapy for acute renal failure.

               2. The treating clinicians anticipate treating the patient with continuous renal
                  replacement therapy for at least 72 hours.

               3. Informed consent has been obtained.

               4. The patient fulfills ONE of the following clinical criteria for initiating
                  continuous renal replacement therapy:

                  urine output &lt; 100 ml/6 hr that has been unresponsive to fluid resuscitation
                  measures

                    -  K+&gt; 6.5 mmol/L

                    -  pH &lt; 7.2

                    -  Urea &gt; 25 mmol/L

                    -  Clinically significant organ edema in the setting of acute kidney injury

               5. Patients who are over 5% of fluid overload or their total body water/height^2 â‰¥13
                  L/m^2

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be EXCLUDED from the study if, in the opinion or knowledge of the
             responsible clinician ANY of the following criteria are present:

               1. Patient age is &lt; 18 years

               2. Death is imminent (&lt;24 hours)

               3. There is a strong likelihood that the study treatment will not be continued in
                  accordance with the study protocol.

               4. The patient has been treated with continuous renal replacement therapy or other
                  dialysis previously during the same hospital admission.

               5. The patient has been on maintenance dialysis prior to the current
                  hospitalization.

               6. Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgement, will substantially
                  increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study.
