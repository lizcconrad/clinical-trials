      The aim of the study was to define the possible association between heavy iron level and the
      consequence of pregnancy especially spontaneous abortion and missed abortion. The study
      population will comprised the first-trimester pregnant women in the PUMCH (Peking Union
      Medicine College Hospital) during 2017 October to 2018 November. We categorised the patients
      into two groups, the study group where the patients suffered from spontaneous abortion or
      missed abortion, and the control group where the patients carry the normal live fetal for at
      least 8 weeks and ask for artificial abortion. All the cases included in the study were
      examined with respect to 6 kinds of heavy iron level in venous blood and urine, then
      correlation analysis was applied to define heavy iron level between two groups.
