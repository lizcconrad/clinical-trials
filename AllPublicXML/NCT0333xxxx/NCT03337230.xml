  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it is practical to use social media-based and
      traditional online weight loss intervention components among low socioeconomic status
      participants using the Facebook social media (SM) and Fitbit self-monitoring platforms. Also,
      the study will test the effectiveness of recruiting participants via social media and at
      community events and locations. The results of this study will be used to inform future
      research studies.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of the proposed research are to:

        1. assess the feasibility of social media-based (social support, social competition, and
           social rewards) and traditional online weight loss (education and goal setting)
           intervention components delivered to low-Socioeconomic Status (SES) participants using
           the Facebook SM and Fitbit self-monitoring platforms and

        2. develop and assess methods for recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of low-SES
           participants for a future randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an
           SM-based weight loss intervention. The study team will assess feasibility by conducting
           a 12-week pilot test of traditional and social media-based weight loss intervention
           components followed by qualitative and quantitative assessment with pilot participants.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1- Assess trial feasibility: The study team will assess intervention processes critical
      to the success of a larger efficacy trial during the 12-week pilot including: (1) participant
      recruitment and retention, (2) participant use of intervention components, (3) use of data
      collection strategies and instruments.

      Aim 2 - Assess intervention acceptability: The study team will conduct structured interviews
      and surveys among participants to assess participants' experience during the intervention.
      This study focuses on: (1) intervention design and content, (2) participant use of
      intervention technologies (Facebook and Fitbit), (3) participant concerns about privacy, and
      (4) barriers and facilitators to recruitment, retention, and participation. Findings will be
      used to improve the design of a larger efficacy trial.

      Study Design: This study will employ a one group pre-post design.
