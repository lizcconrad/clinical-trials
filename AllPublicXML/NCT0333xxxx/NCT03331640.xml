    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of second and third line therapies (OFF vs.
      FOLFIRI) in a sequential cross-over design in patients pretreated with
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine first line.

      Secondary objectives are assessment of safety and feasibility of the sequential cross-over
      treatment approach for advanced treatment lines in PDAC. 204 patients will be randomized into
      the treatments arms. Cross-over will take place after progress during second line therapy.
