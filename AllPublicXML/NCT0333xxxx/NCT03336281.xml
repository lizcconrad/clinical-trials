    <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A participant must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

It consists of 12 questions, each answered using a numerical rating scale. Questions related to pain, skin problems, work and/or leisure activities, discomfort, embarrassment and/or shame, social participation, and anger, fear, and uncertainty; and depression are scored from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme), functional capacity and sleep disturbance are scored from 0 (no difficulty) and 10 (extreme difficulty) and coping is scored from 0 (very well) 10 (very poorly).</description>

    <description>The PsAID-12 is a validated, self-administered questionnaire developed by EULAR for use in clinical practice that assesses the impact of PsA on participants' lives. It consists of 12 questions, each answered using a numerical rating scale. Questions related to pain, skin problems, work and/or leisure activities, discomfort, embarrassment and/or shame, social participation, and anger, fear, and uncertainty; and depression are scored from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme), functional capacity and sleep disturbance are scored from 0 (no difficulty) and 10 (extreme difficulty) and coping is scored from 0 (very well) 10 (very poorly).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale (VAS), with 0 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness will be added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom.</description>

        (biological-naïve participants) or a second line (biological-experienced participants) of
        biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD) for PsA / psoriasis (PsO) will be
        observed depending on whether their disease is managed by a dermatologist or by a
        rheumatologist in routine practice.
