  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open and arthroscopic Latarjet procedures are used to treat shoulder instability as primary
      and salvage procedures. During surgery the coracoid process is detached and repositioned to
      the anterior glenoid through a subscapularis split and fixed in place, resulting in an
      enlarged glenoid and therefor articular surface. However, before this is done, the pectorals
      minor, which inserts at the coracoid process, has to be detached and is left without further
      treatment. Moreover, the conjoint tendon, the origin of the short head of the biceps and
      coracobrachialis, is repositioned with the coracoid and therefor distalized and medialized.

      No study currently followed up on the strength of the muscles altered. The aim of this study
      is therefor, to prospectively measure range of motion and strength of the operated shoulder
      at different time points pre- and postoperatively, comparing it with the healthy shoulder in
      each individual.

      Strength, range of motion and stability will be assessed pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 12
      weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post-operatively. Next to standard radiological
      follow up, including X-ray, arthrographic computed tomography as well as arthrographic
      magnetic resonance imaging, specific shoulder scores will be utilised. Strength for general
      shoulder motion as well as specifically for the subscapularis, the pectorals minor, the
      coracobrachialis and the biceps will be measured with a shoulder dynamometer. Data will be
      analysed and published.

    <description>Strength for different muscles involved in shoulder movement is measured pre- and post-operatively for the operated shoulder and the contralateral side. Strength will be measured in Kilogramm with a shoulder dynamometer. Scale range is assumed to be between 0 and 25 kg, higher values postoperatively indicate better outcome. Measurements will be undertaken for the subscapularis in internal rotation at 0 and 90 degrees; for the muscles attached to the conjoint tendon (short head of the biceps and coracobrachialis) in 45 degree shoulder flexion, while resistance will be applied on the flexing forearm. The pectoralis minor measurment will be undertaken through applying pressure against the protracting shoulder. Furthermore, standard strength measurements will be undertaken in 90 degree shoulder flexion and abduction, applying resistance against the hand, and in 0 degree internal as well as external rotation with a flexed elbow.</description>

    <description>After patients, based on the ISI-Score, were assigned to treat their shoulder instability with an arthroscopic Latarjet procedure, they are eligible for this study. Strength of different involved muscles, as well as ROM will be measured before and at several time points after surgery.</description>
