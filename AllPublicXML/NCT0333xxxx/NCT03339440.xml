  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled effectiveness trial to evaluate the
      integrated clinic-community model of child obesity treatment as compared with routine primary
      care.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how different types of physical activity and
      nutrition education and support (in addition to normal clinical care) affect children's
      health. The investigators will be looking at changes in child BMI, physical activity,
      nutrition, and overall health. The investigators also hope to better understand biological
      differences in metabolism and the microbiome (the bacteria that grows normally on and in the
      body) in children with high BMI who are making lifestyle changes.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will use a two-arm, randomized crossover controlled trial to compare routine primary care management of childhood obesity versus a novel clinic/family/community partnership program to treat childhood obesity. This design will allow for a randomized comparison of Group 1 (6-month standard control) to Group 2 (immediate 6-month intervention program) and to Group 3 (delayed crossover intervention on the standard control group). The design will also allow the investigators to observe intervention effects at 3 months in both intervention groups (Groups 2 and 3), and to track Group 2 for 6 additional months after active intervention to assess whether health benefits seen at 6 months were sustained to 12 months.</intervention_model_description>
