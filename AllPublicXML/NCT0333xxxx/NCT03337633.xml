  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High cognitive load activities can influence energy intake from food. It is unknown how
      restaurant menu designs may affect patrons in terms of cognitive demand and subsequent
      ordering of food.Objective: Our objective was to develop and experimentally test menu designs
      that differ in cognitive load to test the subjective and objective stress measures on food
      ordering.

      For the first experiment, a parallel randomized trial of healthy young adults (n= 30) was
      conducted to compare ordering from one of two menu designs (easy - E, hard - H) developed in
      a prior pilot study. In the second experiment, restrained eaters were specifically recruited
      and asked to fast before the experiment to determine the influence of cognitive load of menus
      on energy ordered (n=31). Galvanic skin response was used as an objective proxy for relative
      cognitive load, and questionnaires were used to assess perceptions of the menus. The main
      outcomes were the number of items ordered and total energy of the items ordered (in
      kilocalories).

    <ipd_description>Pending approval by the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Institutional Review Board (IRB), which we have received for other studies and anticipate receiving here, we will prepare transportable de-identified raw databases and codebooks, which will contain the raw data used in any paper we publish from the proposed research. We will publically deposit such raw data for access by others without restriction in a public repository such as ICPSR. For any investigator requesting data we have not yet published, we will be glad to provide de-identified data and codebooks to the investigators provided that the proposed use does not conflict with our intentions for use.</ipd_description>
