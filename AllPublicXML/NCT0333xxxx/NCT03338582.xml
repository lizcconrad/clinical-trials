  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to carry out an observational study of patients implanted with a
      pacemaker using AAI SafeR® mode after a TAVI procedure. This study aims to define the
      persistence or not of high-grade AVB beyond seven days after the procedure, based on the
      analysis of PM memories, and define definitive cardiac pacing indications after TAVI
      procedure.

    <textblock>
      Atrioventricular (A-V) conduction disorders are common after Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation (TAVI) and the average of a pacemaker implantation after TAVI is 15% to 17%.

      The European Society of Cardiology recommends to implant a permanent pacemaker (PM) in case
      of persistant high-grade A-V block (AVB) within 7 days of a TAVI procedure (class I
      recommendation, level of evidence C).

      Some conduction disturbances are transient and might not need a definitive indication for
      pacemaker implantation. A recent study, based on dependency of patients to pacing, estimate
      that in half the patients, conduction disturbances that led to the implantation of a
      pacemaker after TAVI procedure would have disappear 30 days after the procedure.

      Many studies tried to better define the indications of these devices. However, their
      evaluation criteria do not allow to prove these pacemakers were useful, because these studies
      are mainly based on the rate of implantation of pacemakers, or on the percentage of
      ventricular pacing. These studies may overestimate the usefulness of the pacemaker because of
      unnecessary ventricular pacing, or underestimate it in patients with high grade paroxysmal
      AVB, that could have been responsible for syncope or death.

      Today some pacemakers allow a better occurrence of spontaneous A-V conduction and monitor
      precisely the atrioventricular conduction.

      The AAI SafeR® mode from Sorin® allows the pacemaker to switch from a single to a dual
      chamber mode in case of AVB; these switches are stored in the memories of PM as endocardial
      electrogram (EGM) which can be validated afterwards. The use of this algorithm could allow an
      accurate assessment of the persistence of high level conduction disturbances in patients
      implanted with a pacemaker after a TAVI procedure. A study published in late 2014 using this
      tool in monitoring post TAVI conduction disorders on a small number of patients, other
      studies used the same tool in other cardiac pathologies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To look for one or several high level A-V block episodes beyond seven days after a TAVI procedure, by the analysis of the EKG and of the pacemaker memories during the follow-up visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Until the completion of the study (first follow-up visit 1 to 3 months after TAVI, last follow-up visit 1 year after TAVI)</time_frame>
    <description>High level A-V Block in patients after TAVI procedure is defined:
Either by the analysis of the pacemaker memories during the follow-up visits showing the switches from AAI Safe-R to DDD mode after one or more of these three reasons:
a succession of at least 2 consecutive blocked P waves
more than 3 blocked P waves among 12 consecutive cycles
ventricular pause for over 2 seconds with at least one blocked P wave
Either by the presence of a high level AVB on the EKG during the follow-up visit (pacemaker temporally set to DDI 30 bpm mode)
We classify as transitional AVB (D7 persistent, non-persistent beyond 1 month), and permanent AVB (persistent beyond 1 month).</description>

    <measure>To study the influence of certain predefined factors on the risk of high-level A-V block after a TAVI procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of 8 days (from the day before the TAVI procedure to 7 days after TAVI)</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with the secondary objective, we will study the influence of certain predefined factors on the risk of high-level A-V block after a TAVI procedure : preexisting conduction disturbances (complete right bundle branch block, left anterior hemiblock, first degree A-V block), high grade AVB during the TAVI procedure, worsening of conduction disturbances during the procedure or within the next hour (appearance of a left bundle branch block, QRS widening beyond 120ms, prolongation of PR beyond 200ms ), lengthening of the HV interval immediately after the procedure TAVI or later (if an electrophysiological study is performed), implantation of a Medtronic® CoreValve prosthesis (compared to an Edwards® Sapien prosthesis), height of the implantation of the valve, oversizing.</description>
