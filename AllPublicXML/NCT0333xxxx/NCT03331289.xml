      Research Design/Plan: After screening, each subject will receive 1 measurements of EGP with
      prime-continuous Infusion of 3-3H-glucose. After completing the EGP measurement each subject
      will receive a Double Tracer OGTT.

      Methods: Visit 1: Screening. Medical history will be obtained, physical exam performed, and
      pregnancy test performed.

      Visit 2: Endogenous Glucose Production Measurement: The rate of EGP will be measured with
      3-3H-glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive a measurement of endogenous glucose production (EGP) with a
      prime-continuous infusion of 3-3H-glucose. The EGP measurement will be performed in the
      morning after a 10-12 hour overnight fast and will last 8 hours (from 6 AM to 2 PM). After a
      3-hour tracer equilibration period, subjects (20 per group) will receive one of the following
      medications: (i) placebo; (ii) exenatide 5 ug subcutaneously; (iii) dapagliflozin (10 mg);
      and (iv) dapagliflozin 10 mg plus exenatide 5 ug. Following the test medication at 9 AM,
      blood samples will be drawn every 15 minutes for an additional 5 hours and plasma glucose,
      insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and catecholamine concentrations and
      glucose specific activity will be measured.

      Visit 1: Screening. Medical history &amp; physical exam will be performed. Blood will be drawn
      for FPG, routine blood chemistries, CBC, lipid profile, HbA1c, and thyroid function.
      Urinalysis, EKG, albumin/creatinine ratio and pregnancy test will be performed.

      Visit 2: EPG Measurement: The rate of endogenous glucose production will be measured with
      3-3H-glucose infusion. [3-3H]-glucose infusion will be started at 6 AM and continued until
      2:30 PM (5 hours after drug administration). At 6 AM a catheter will be placed into an
      anticubital vein and a prime (40 uCi x FPG/100)- continuous (0.4 uCi) infusion of [3-3H]-
      glucose will be started and continued until 2:30 PM. (5 hours after drug administration).
      Participant's hand will be placed in a box heated to 50-60°C (122-140°F). Baseline blood
      samples will be obtained at-210, -60, -50, -45, -40, -35, -30, -20, -10, and 0 . After 3.5
      hours of tracer equilibration blood samples will be obtained every 10-20 minutes from 9 AM to
      2 PM. Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and
      catecholamine concentrations, and [3-3H]-glucose specific activity will be measured. Urine
      will be collected from 6 to 9 AM and from 9 AM to 2 PM. Urinary volume and glucose
      concentration will be measured and urinary glucose excretion rate calculated. The study will
      end at 2:30 PM.

      Visit 3: Double Tracer Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: Within the week after the measurement of
      EGP, all subjects will have a 5-hour OGTT with measurement of plasma glucose, insulin (I),
      C-peptide (CP), and glucagon concentrations at -180, -6-, -5-, -45, -40, -35, -30, -20, -10,
      0 and every 15-30 minutes thereafter to obtain a measure of overall glucose tolerance,
      insulin secretion (CP0-120/G0-120), insulin sensitivity ([MI]), beta cell function,
      (CP0-120/G0-120 x MI), and suppression of plasma glucagon concentration (64). At 7 AM a
      catheter will be placed into an anticubital vein and a prime (25 uCi x FPG/100)- continuous
      (0.25 uCi) infusion of [3-3H]- glucose will be started and continued until 3 PM. Urinary
      volume and glucose concentration will be measured and urinary glucose excretion rate
      calculated.

      HbA1c will be measured 2x, 1 on the day of the OGTT &amp; 1 on the day of the EGP measurement.
