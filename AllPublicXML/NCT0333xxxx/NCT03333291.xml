  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will characterize the biology of FMT in the context of IBS prior to wider clinical
      application of the method. Given the ethical concerns of unknown and long-term adverse
      effects of FMT therapy, the study will include patients only with moderate to severe
      symptoms. IBS is a heterogenous disorder and it is important to characterize the patients,
      and study as homogeneous patient populations as possible. Therefore the study will only
      include post-infectious IBS patients after the Giardia outbreak.

      Primary aims:

      Detailed characterisation of donor and recipient microbial community composition (by means of
      16S rRNA profiling) and determination of the kinetics of changes following FMT

      Secondary aims:

        -  Determination of interactions of importance to persisting recipient gut microbiota.

        -  Evaluate safety of FMT in an IBS population

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of FMT in relieving symptoms in selected patients with IBS in
           an open pilot trial in order to have the possibility to calculate number of patients
           needed when planning future controlled studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18-and 70 years

          -  IBS-SSS (IBS-Symptom Severity Scale) score &gt;175 (175 - 300 represents moderate, &gt; 300
             represent severe IBS).

          -  All patients are required to have symptoms for at least 12 months, fulfilling the Rome
             III criteria with either diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) or
             alternating constipation and diarrhoea (IBS-A) with bloating or flatulence as
             predominant symptoms. Only IBS considered post-infectious after the Bergen Giardia
             outbreak will be included. The severity of global IBS symptoms has to be either
             moderate (&quot;cannot be ignored but do not influence daily activities&quot;) or severe
             (&quot;influence daily activities&quot;). A decrease of 50 points on the IBS-SSS has been shown
             to correlate with improvement in clinical symptoms. All patients will undergo
             appropriate investigations to exclude organic disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrointestinal malignancy, blood in stool or
             antibiotic use within 1 month prior to FMT, immunocompromised patient defined as
             taking immuno-suppressive medications, history of opportunistic infections within 1
             year prior to FMT, oral thrush, or disseminated lymphadenopathy.

          -  Patients who are scheduled for abdominal surgery, pregnant women or patients taking
             probiotics or taking antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to installation are also
             excluded from the protocol.
