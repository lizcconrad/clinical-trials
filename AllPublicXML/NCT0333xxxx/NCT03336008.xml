  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) 1, 2, 3 and 6 are the most common, autosomal dominantly
      inherited cerebellar degenerations. And in the Chinese population, the most common SCA is
      SCA3 and the frequency of SCA 3 among SCA patients is 72.5%, followed by SCA 2 that the
      frequency is 12% among SCA patients. For SCA 1, the frequency among SCA patients is 7%. Even
      SCAs are rare diseases, a significant amount of Chinese in Hong Kong still suffer from this
      disorders. SCA Association in Hong Kong has 88 members who are suffering from spinocerebellar
      degeneration, many of them have a genetic confirmation. As there are few treatments for SCAs;
      therefore, understanding SCAs clinical manifestation and disease mechanisms are the first
      step towards development of effective treatment. The objective of this study is to develop
      the first SCA registry in Hong Kong with bio-repository bank for clinical and genetic
      information as well as serum and fibroblasts.

      All the members from Hong Kong SCA association will be invited and discuss the study with
      them. After obtaining the informed consent, their genotypes will be determined and collect
      clinical information. Some of the participant will have clear genotyping via Department of
      Health. Participants with a genetic confirmation of SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 12 genes will be
      included in the study. The relatives of genetically confirmed participants, who also had
      ataxic symptoms, might be included in the study without further determination of the
      genotypes.

      Detailed clinical history including age of onset, clinical symptoms will be collected. A
      detailed neurological examination with an emphasis of eye movements (such as pursuit,
      saccadic, and convergence eye movements). We will also perform SARA scale, a validated ataxia
      scale. Timed 25 foot-walk test will be performed.

      Two-year annual follow-up will be arranged for recruited subject for neurological physical
      examination, SARA scale, in order to continue assessment for any progress change in disease
      stage.
