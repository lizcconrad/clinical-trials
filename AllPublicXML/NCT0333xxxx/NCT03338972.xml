    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CAR-T cells in treating
      patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond to
      treatment. T cells are a type of white blood cell and a major component of the immune system.
      T-cells that have been genetically modified in the laboratory express BCMA and may kill
      cancer cells with the protein BCMA on their surface. Giving chemotherapy before BCMA CAR-T
      cells may reduce the amount of disease and to cause a low lymphocyte (white blood cell) count
      in the blood, which may help the infused BCMA CAR-T cells survive and expand.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of adoptive therapy with ex vivo expanded autologous CD8+ plus CD4+
      T cells transduced to express a human BCMA-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for
      patients with relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence and the phenotype of long lived CAR-T
      cells.

      II. To determine the degree to which adoptively transferred T cells traffic to MM cells in
      the BM and function in vivo.

      III. To estimate the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred BCMA-specific
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes (BCMA CAR-T cells).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR-expressing T lymphocytes.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain their immune cells, from which CAR-T cells are
      produced. A few weeks later, patients then receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days
      -4 to -2. Beginning 36-96 hours after chemotherapy, patients receive BCMA-specific
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60, 90, 120, 180, and 365
      days and then up to 15 years.
