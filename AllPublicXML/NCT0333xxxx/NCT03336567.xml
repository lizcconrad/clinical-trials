  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene and cell therapies have a real value potential (example: potential long-term effect,
      curative potential, and single administration) but also drawbacks (example: treatment
      perceived as complex and risky generating fear and anxiety in subjects and their family; high
      cost) that require significant educational efforts and planning for optimal market access. It
      is therefore important to understand subject and physician perceptions of T-Cell Receptor
      (TCR) therapies. The aim of this study is to collect qualitative data from a small but
      diverse sample of oncologists and subjects in the United States to gather qualitative
      evidence for a preliminary understanding about their perceptions of T-cell therapies in the
      treatment of cancer. This cross-sectional study will involve up to 20 adult subjects with
      cancer and up to 20 oncologists/hematologist-oncologists in the United States. Eligible
      subjects will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60-90 minutes.
      Eligible oncologists will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60
      minutes.

      Searching social media is another way of understanding the perceptions of prescribers and
      consumers of CGT, in addition to interviews being conducted under the original protocol. The
      results of a feasibility assessment suggested that it would be helpful to explore social
      media to add to the findings from the interviews. This social media study(SMS) is being
      conducted as a pilot study to hone methods for future explorations of social media. The pilot
      study will investigate and describe initial themes emerging from existing discussions related
      to CGT. Findings from this work will help GlaxoSmithKline to plan future work in the social
      media landscape.
