  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated the effects of fat protein counting (CFP) in addition to carbohydrate
      (CARB) counting for calculating prandial insulin dosage on blood glucose profile in patients
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on basal-bolus insulin therapy.

    <textblock>
      In this single center, crossover, randomized, controlled study, control meal (SM: standard
      meal using carbohydrate counting method) and three test meals (HPM: high protein meal using
      carbohydrate counting method, HPFM-a: high protein-fat meal using carbohydrate counting
      method and HPFM-b: high protein-fat meal using carbohydrate and fat-protein counting method)
      were compared on postprandial early (0-120 minutes), late (120-240 minutes) and total (0-240
      minutes) glucose response.
