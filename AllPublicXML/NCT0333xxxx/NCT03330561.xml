  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi center, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study with expansion cohort is designed
      to determine the MTD, RP2D and dosing schedule of PRS-343 in patients with HER2+ advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate PRS-343 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks
      (Schedule 1) initially. If safety, PK, and PD data suggest a different dosing schedule should
      be evaluated, Schedule 2 or 3 (dosing every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks in a 28-day cycle,
      respectively) may be conducted. Separate MTDs may be determined for each schedule evaluated.
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be reported during the first cycle of each schedule
      (e.g., 21 days after the first dose in Cycle 1 for Schedule 1). Patients will be monitored
      for safety throughout the study. Dosing will continue until criteria for study drug
      discontinuation are met (disease progression or withdrawal from the study).

      Patients with unknown HER2 status will be consented separately in a pre-screening visit in
      order to undergo HER2 testing prior to screening. All patients will be evaluated at screening
      (Day 28 to 1) and baseline (Day 1 predose).

      Once the MTD has been established, an expansion cohort of up to 30 additional patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ solid tumors considered likely to respond to a HER2
      targeted CD137 agonist (e.g. gastric/gastroesophageal/esophageal, breast, bladder) may be
      enrolled. The expansion cohort will be enrolled at the MTD and/or at a lower dose level if
      safety/PD/PK/efficacy data support further evaluation of a lower dose level in order to
      determine the RP2D. The RP2D may be equivalent to or lower than the MTD.

      An End-of-Treatment Visit will be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation.
      Patients will be evaluated 30 days after the End-of-Treatment Visit or prior to starting
      subsequent therapy, if sooner, at the Safety Follow-up Visit to assess any ongoing AEs as
      outlined in the protocol.

      Patients will be assessed for tumor response/progression per RECIST v1.1

             arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease) that in the judgment of the investigator would
             make study participation inappropriate for the patient.

          7. Previously known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); or hepatitis B or
             hepatitis C infection.

             non-melanomatous skin cancer, 2) curatively treated cervical or breast carcinoma in
             situ, or 3) other malignancy with no known active disease present and no treatment
             administered during the last 2 years.
