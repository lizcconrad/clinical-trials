    <textblock>
      An uncontrolled, non-randomized, open-plan, multi-centre study of treatment and therapeutic
      education in endocrinology-diabetes-Nutrition that seeks to assess the interest of an adapted
      physical activity educator for the implementation In place of physical activities in the
      management and prevention of overweight and obesity. The proposed study seeks to promote the
      physical activity (PA) to patients and employees, including the encouragement of physical
      activity in a guided and personalized way, through workshops on working time, and follow-up
      of the evolution of the PA through a Adapted questionnaire.

      The evaluation will be proposed

        -  in the Department of Endocrinology, Metabolic diseases and Nutrition of the Nantes
           University Hospital to all patients participating in &quot;overweight education groups&quot; in
           complete hospitalization or in day hospital

        -  to the employees of the group Fleury-Michon volunteers.

        -  During a recruitment period of 6 months required for the recruitment of 100 patients and
           80 employees;

        -  For a total duration of the research for each 1 year participant. Patients and employees
           will be systematically informed of the project and their consent will be collected by
           oral and plotted in the medical file and in the employee file, kept by the adapted
           physical activity educator.

      For the hospital phase, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their
      physical activity, diet and quality of life prior to hospital care. For an evaluation of the
      chronological evolution of their physical activity, they will be invited to complete the
      global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ 2.0), every 2 months, from their home, via the
      Internet from a secure link (ECRF clinsight) for the duration of the Research is one year. At
      6 months during a telephone contact and at 12 months, during a consultation, the food and
      quality of life questionnaires will also have to be informed. The evolution of weight, body
      mass index (BMI) and metabolic biological factors (fasting blood glucose and lipid balance)
      will also be collected.

      For the enterprise phase, employees will benefit from a life-health awareness program,
      accompanied by an APA educator, they are offered the opportunity to participate in physical
      activity workshops on a regular basis (12 workshops minimum over 6 months), adapted to their
      abilities and personalized. They will be invited to fill, from their home or on the website
      Fleury Michon, via the Internet from a secure link (ECRF clinsight) the same type of
      questionnaire
