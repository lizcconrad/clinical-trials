  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase II single-centered, single group, prospective clinical trial to evaluate
      the safety of HMA-CD20 doses among stable patients with class III/IV according to the NYHA
      classification with HFrEF receiving standard of care therapy. The index qualifying HFrEF must
      have EF &amp;lt; 40% based on echocardiographic or cardiac MRI techniques, heart failure class
      III/IV according to the NYHA classification,aged 40-60 years, being diagnosed less than 12
      months before enrollment of study, following the standard heart failure treatment regimen.

    <description>For this trial, HMA-CD20 will be given as an intravenous infusion of 1000 mg I.V twice in a month separating them by fourteen days starting at the baseline visit. The dose for both HMA-CD20 dosages willbe identical at the screening visit after the participant's eligibility has been established, and it will remain thesame for both infusions. The standard dose for HMA-CD20 is 1,000 mg per intravenous infusion on day 1 and day 15.</description>
