  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is one of the most effective therapies utilized for
      neuroblastoma patients with refractory or relapsed disease. In this pediatric phase 1 trial,
      131I-MIBG will be given in combination with dinutuximab, a chimeric 14.18 monoclonal
      antibody. This study will utilize a traditional Phase I dose escalation 3+3 design to
      determine a recommended phase 2 pediatric dose. An expansion cohort of an additional 6
      patients may then be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is one of the most effective therapies utilized for
      neuroblastoma patients with refractory or relapsed disease. Data from pre-clinical and adult
      studies suggest that radiation can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted
      therapies such as dinutuximab. This first pediatric phase 1 trial of 131I-MIBG in combination
      with dinutuximab aims to determine the recommended phase 2 pediatric dose of these two
      therapies in combination.
