    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of posaconazole
      intravenous solution in Chinese participants at high risk for invasive fungal infections.
      Neutropenic participants undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndromes will be enrolled in the study.
