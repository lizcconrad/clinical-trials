      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of
      PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide in patients with high grade glioma: glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma after progression following standard first line
      therapy (Component 2), by evaluation of toxicity and tolerability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide (Component 2): after the MTD is established for single
      agent PAC-1 in Component 1, a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design starts in
      Component 2, at a PAC-1 dose one level lower than the MTD of PAC-1 established in the single
      agent PAC-1 component (i.e., Component 1) and 150 mg/m2 dose of temozolomide given for the 5
      days starting at day 8 of cycle 1 in cohorts of 3-6 patients. The combination cohort that
      reaches MTD will expanded to at least 9 patients, similar to the PAC-1 alone cohort at MTD.
      For all dose cohorts, pharmacokinetics of PAC-1 will be assessed following doses administered
      on days 1 and 11 of the first cycle. Temozolomide pharmacokinetics will be performed on Day
      11 of the first cycle.

             two weeks prior to registration and have no episode of seizures for at least 14 days

             and are not permissible are in Appendix 6.

         25. Has any clinically significant infection, i.e., any acute viral, bacterial, or fungal
             infection that requires specific treatment (anti-infective treatment has to be

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

         33. Abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) considered by the investigator to be
             clinically significant (such as acute ischemia, left bundle branch block, ventricular
             arrhythmias) or baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (e.g.,

             consent or participating in the trial
