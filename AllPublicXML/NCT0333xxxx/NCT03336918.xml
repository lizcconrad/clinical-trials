  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lithium is highly effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder. This study aims to
      investigate, for the first time, the impact of lithium monotherapy on the structural and
      functional connectivity of the brain using MRI imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The premise of this proposal is that the clinical efficacy of lithium in bipolar disorder,
      and its complex effects on multiple brain physiological functions, may be best deciphered
      using a network properties-metric approach. This approach is critical because it provides
      insight into the function of brain networks (e.g., resilience to disruption, central hubs),
      which is likely to be more closely linked to behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, we will
      conduct an exploratory investigation of the in vivo molecular effects of lithium by measuring
      peripheral gene expression. To bring these together, we will also explore whether connectome
      changes serve as mediator between molecular changes (i.e., gene expression) induced by
      lithium treatment and behavioral changes (e.g., depression, mood stability, suicidality).

    <description>An exploratory investigation of whether lithium-related changes in the functional and structural connectome over time represent a link between shifts in peripheral gene expression and improvement in illness-related measures.Lithium therapy will be associated with changes in gene expression pathways such as the mitochondrial-carnitine shuttle pathway, which in turn will be related to changes in the functional and structural connectome.</description>
