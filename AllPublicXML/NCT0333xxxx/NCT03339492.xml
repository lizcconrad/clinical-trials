  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine, at 12 months post-surgical
      repair of full thickness rotator cuff tears, the safety and efficacy of treating full
      thickness rotator cuff repairs with pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF). The hypothesis
      states that exposure to a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) following surgical repair of a
      full thickness rotator cuff tendon tear reduces tendon re-tear rates. The strength of the
      shoulder muscles and the levels of pain in subjects after surgical repair of their rotator
      cuff adjunctively treated with an active PEMF device will also be measured.

      This Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) describes the prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field
      (PEMF) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to surgical repair of full thickness rotator cuff
      tears.

      Rotator cuff tears are common musculoskeletal injuries which often require surgical
      intervention. Unfortunately, post-repair prognosis is poor, and surgical repairs have been
      reported to fail in up to 94% of cases (Galatz et. al., 2004). Repaired tissue tends to be
      fibrotic, disorganized, and reattaches poorly to the bony insertion. To improve
      tendon-to-bone healing, many non-invasive therapeutic devices have been utilized
      post-operatively including therapeutic ultrasound and shock wave therapy (Lovric et. al.,
      2013; Springer and Badgett, 2015).

      In orthopedics, the use of these non-invasive therapeutic devices has become increasingly
      popular during the post-operative recovery period in an effort to enhance tissue healing.
      These devices are relatively inexpensive and easily obtainable and relatively easy to use,
      and are especially enticing as they can be brought into the patient's home and do not require
      frequent visits to the clinic. Additionally, non-invasive therapeutic devices can be used for
      a variety of applications, including promoting tissue healing prior to surgical intervention
      or in lieu of surgical intervention all together. Although there are numerous advantages to
      using non-invasive therapeutic devices, their efficacy has not yet been maximized.

      Based on the pre-clinical work presented (Tucker et. al., 2016; Huegel et. al., 2017), it is
      believed that pulsed electromagnetic fields may be an effective adjunctive treatment for
      patients who have undergone surgical repair of a torn rotator cuff.
