  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, safety, comparative study of IV administered
      Tc99m-tilmanocept and unfiltered Tc99m sulfur colloid in the detection of and assessment of
      three dimensional tessellation localization to the liver in subjects with and without
      moderate to severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Tc99m-tilmanocept in
      subjects with NASH.
