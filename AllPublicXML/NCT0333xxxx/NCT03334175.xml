  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes is a precursor of type 2 diabetes and an independent risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease, and currently affects one-quarter of the population of the United
      States. Individuals of overweight or obese BMI are at particular high risk for incident
      diabetes. A major modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes is poor dietary quality, and
      improvement of dietary quality can effectively delay and even prevent type 2 diabetes.
      Interventions to improve dietary quality thus far, however, rely on short-term intensive
      clinically designed meals replacing the entire diet which have poor sustainability.
      Persistent improvements to daily dietary patterns are often difficult without directed
      guidance, and overall dietary quality in the United States remains poor. The identification
      of a practical, daily dietary intervention to improve dietary quality and prevent diabetes in
      those at high risk remains unknown. The investigators propose to enroll 40 individuals with
      diagnosed prediabetes into a randomized controlled pilot study and provide a daily walnut
      supplementation intervention to determine feasibility and acceptability of the supplement.
      The investigators will then determine preliminary efficacy on metabolic markers and will
      investigate associations between dietary quality and circulating levels of branched-chain
      amino acids. The goal is to implement a whole-food supplement to improve dietary quality in
      patients with prediabetes as a tool for future type 2 diabetes prevention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female between 18-65 years of age at baseline living in the San Francisco Bay
             area.

          2. BMI&gt;25 m/kg2 (or &gt;23 m/kg2 for individuals of Asian or South Asian ethnicity)

          3. Documentation of prediabetes diagnosis as evidenced by the following criteria:

               1. A fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL, or a HbA1c measurement of 5.7-6.4%, OR a
                  diagnosis of &quot;prediabetes&quot; or &quot;impaired fasting glucose&quot; in the past 6 months,
                  identified through an electronic medical record query from patients at UCSF and
                  through outside recruitment in the surrounding community

               2. We will confirm eligibility of potential participants by repeating fasting
                  capillary blood glucose measurements at the baseline visit to ensure that they
                  have prediabetes

          4. Written informed consent and ability for subject to comply with the requirements of
             the study.
