  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of remote interrogation (readers) of CIEDs
      in evaluation of suspected TIA/stroke patients, HF or those experiencing syncope. This
      approach has the potential to advance the practice of CIED evaluation by staff without
      specialized training in cardiac electrophysiology (non-EP staff). We hypothesize that
      actionable events will be identified with use of CIED readers. These events may include
      identification of atrial fibrillation in TIA/stroke patients, percentage biventricular pacing
      in patients with HF or evaluation of arrhythmic events in syncope patients. We believe that
      non-EP staff will find CIED readers easy or very easy to use and that time from transmission
      to analysis for non-EP trained staff will be low.

      Subjects with CIEDs undergoing evaluation for TIA/stroke, HF or syncope will be reviewed for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. CIED interrogation, demographics and time of interrogation will
      be collected. Review of interrogation and medical record will be done to evaluate for
      actionable events including CIED programming, initiation or change in medications,
      admission/discharge or decision for further testing.
