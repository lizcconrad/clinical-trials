      This crossover designed study evaluates the effects of microcurrent therapy on knee
      osteoarthritis. Ín a previous study patients were randomized into four different groups.
      Group 1 and 2 both received microcurrent therapy, but with different freqency and intensity
      parameters. Group 3 received treatment with the microcurrent treatment apparatus without
      current (sham). group 4 was a control group.

      In the following, present study the controll group as well as the sham group will receive the
      microcurrent therapy (verum).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the previous randomized, controlled pilot study was to evaluate the effect
      of microcurrent therapy on pain and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the
      knee. The secondary objective was to compare the effects of different currents. (group 1 - 4)
      After receiving 10 sessions of microcurrent therapy the statistical calculation showed a
      slightly significant difference in the verum-group A (Parameters Channel A: Channel B,
      Frequency ...) After a wash-out-phase we are now trying to evaluate and possibly confirm the
      positive effect of the previous trial. Therefore the control - and sham group from the
      previous study will now receive microcurrent therapy of apparatus A.

      The whole procedure (Number of session, duration of the treatments, main outcome
      measurements, secondary outcome measurements) of the following study is identical with the
      previous pilot study. Assessments four the group will be at the first day of treatment (T1)
      and at the end of Treatment (T2).

    <description>The microcurrent therapy will be applied with electrodes that are fixed around the knee. The two electrodes of channel A will be placed at the inner and outer side of the knee that is most affected by pain. The two electrodes of channel B will be placed above and below the patella. An apparatus with CE certificate will be used.</description>
