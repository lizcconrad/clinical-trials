  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to elucidate the utility of the immune checkpoint inhibitor
      pembrolizumab in preventing the recurrence of HCC when administered before and after curative
      surgery or ablation.

      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time he or she signs the informed consent
      form until the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days, each subject will
      receive administration of pembrolizumab 200mg IV once only before curative treatment such as
      hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation, and will receive curative treatment after
      administration of pembrolizumab. After curative treatment, each subject will receive
      pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until tumor recurrence,
      occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event, or the 16th treatment with pembrolizumab.( The
      setting of 16 times administration is the period of adjuvant therapy of this trial is 12
      month(=48weeks), administration of pembrolizumab is Q3W, so 16 times administration comes to
      48 weeks.) Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than tumor recurrence will have
      post-treatment follow-up visits for monitoring disease status until tumor recurrence, until
      initiation of non-study cancer treatment, until withdrawal of consent for study
      participation, or until becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed for overall
      survival until death, withdrawal of consent for study participation, or the end of the study,
      whichever comes first. After the end of trial treatment, each subject will be followed for 30
      days for adverse event monitoring. Serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after
      the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new
      anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
