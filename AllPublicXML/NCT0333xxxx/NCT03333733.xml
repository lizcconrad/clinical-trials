  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tackling obesity is a public health priority. Childhood obesity is of particular concern due
      to its impact on physiological and psychological health and likelihood of tracking into
      adulthood, with associated diseases and disorders and financial burden to the NHS. Once
      established, obesity is hard to treat. Therefore, prevention strategies aimed at children are
      essential.

      This study aims to determine the feasibility of undertaking a full trial to evaluate the
      clinical effectiveness of the HENRY (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young)
      programme in preventing childhood obesity. It is a multi-centre, open labelled, two group,
      prospective, cluster randomised, controlled, feasibility study aiming to recruit 120 parents
      from 12 Children's Centres.

      HENRY (Health, Exercise, Nutrition for the Really Young) is an 8 week community based
      intervention delivered in settings such as Children's Centres, aimed at preventing childhood
      obesity by supporting families to make positive lifestyle changes. It is currently widely
      delivered across the UK. Preliminary data indicates that HENRY may be effective at reducing
      childhood obesity and improving family health, although a robust evaluation has not yet been
      conducted. A good deal of public money has already been used to develop and commission HENRY
      and it is essential to demonstrate clear benefits of the programme before further funding.
      This study will determine whether a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of HENRY is
      feasible. 12 Children's Centres will be recruited from two local authorities. From these,
      half will be randomised to deliver HENRY programmes.

      From the participating Children's Centres, 120 parents will be recruited. All participants
      will be asked to meet with a researcher twice in their home, 12 months apart. During the
      visit, parents will complete 4 questionnaires around diet and lifestyle. Height and weight
      measurements will also be taken from the parent (optional) and child (compulsory). The
      decision of whether a RCT is feasible will be based on whether it is possible to recruit
      local authorities, children's centres and parents to take part; ensure staff can be
      adequately trained to deliver programmes within specified timeframes; and whether proposed
      data can be adequately gathered.

    <textblock>
      Background:

      Childhood obesity impacts physiological and psychological health that tracks into adulthood;
      increasing risk of morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. It incurs significant costs on the UK
      economy, with an expected 7-fold increase in related NHS costs by 2020, and forecasted Â£2
      billion annual spend by 2030[3]. Tackling obesity is a key NHS public health priority, with
      government strategies aimed at reversing the trend of rising childhood obesity levels to
      return to those of 2000. Whilst treating obesity remains a priority, there are compelling
      arguments to prevent its onset. Establishing healthy behaviours in early childhood is
      critical for optimum growth and development [4]. Further, poor eating patterns developed
      early can persist and are associated with chronic diseases in adulthood (e.g. cardiovascular
      disease, type-2-diabetes [5]). Once established, obesity is difficult to reverse[6];
      strengthening the case for primary prevention[7]. Early preventive interventions are
      therefore essential to impact the health of our children now and in the future [8].

      Interventions aimed at treating obesity report inconsistent results [9-11, 6, 12, 13], though
      there is agreement that multi-component interventions, especially those engaging parents have
      a greater impact [14, 6]. Proposed research involves an independent evaluation of an existing
      preschool obesity prevention intervention. The HENRY programme was developed in 2007 with
      Department of Health and Department for Education support and is currently delivered across
      the UK by approximately 35 Local Authorities providing ~190 courses/year. Over 10,000
      families have already participated. It is delivered in the community, predominantly by
      Children's Centre staff [15]. HENRY uses a responsive approach to provide practical guidance
      and improve parenting skills, aimed at enhancing family homes and Children's Centre
      environments. These are intervention targets that are consistent with recent literature in
      childhood obesity. Preliminary data indicates that HENRY may be effective at reducing
      childhood obesity and improving family health [15] although evidence to date has not compared
      findings with parents who have not attended HENRY; thus, further robust evaluation using a
      RCT design is needed to confirm its effectiveness. A good deal of public money has already
      been used to develop and commission HENRY and it is essential to demonstrate clear benefits
      of the programme before further funding. Given the uncertainties associated with recruiting
      local authorities, service providers and Children's Centres, it is necessary to conduct
      research in advance of a definitive multi-site trial. The models of commissioning and
      delivering HENRY are complex and vary by location. In some instance, HENRY is commissioned by
      local authorities and delivered by existing Centre staff. In others, Children's Centres are
      tendered to external service providers (e.g. Barnardo's) who are responsible for
      commissioning programmes such as HENRY. This study will assess feasibility of the planned
      recruitment rate at the authority, Centre and parent level and ensure competence of programme
      delivery; in addition to providing vital information for calculation of the sample size for
      the future trial. A future trial will be used to offer commissioners an evidence based
      intervention, tested in Children's Centres in the UK and to provide much needed evidence on
      the effectiveness of early obesity prevention in primary care settings.

      Aim:

      The feasibility study aims to determine the feasibility of undertaking a full trial to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the HENRY programme in preventing childhood obesity.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine whether it is feasible to recruit local authorities/service providers that
           are willing to nominate Children's Centres to be involved in the research (allowing
           randomisation where they would usually select Centres most in need).

        2. To assess the time required to train and certify staff to delivery HENRY programmes in
           order to propose a clear process and timeline for the definitive trial

        3. To determine whether it is possible to recruit parents to the study, who are enrolled to
           attend a HENRY programme; and the practicality of recruiting parents to the study from
           control Centres, where the pathway to recruitment is less defined compared to the HENRY
           Centres.

        4. To explore the current landscape of HENRY commissioning, provision and delivery via
           postal screening questionnaire and qualitative data collection in areas currently
           delivering HENRY

        5. To explore the level of contamination, including the degree to which parents use
           multiple Centres, the amount of contamination through social networks (control and HENRY
           parents sharing knowledge) and the possibility of HENRY trained facilitators sharing
           knowledge within control Centres.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To examine the acceptability and completeness of the proposed methods of data collection
           to ensure they are feasible for the definitive trial.

        2. To gather data to allow estimation of the sample size requirements for the definitive
           trial.

        3. To assess the acceptability of the design for parents, commissioners and Centre staff;
           particularly related to withholding HENRY training in control Centres until the end of
           the study.

        4. To provide evidence that participants fully understand and accept their involvement in
           the study via feedback questionnaire and qualitative assessment.

      4. To determine the practicalities of delivering the required number of HENRY programmes
      within the trial period in regards to programme implementation.

      Progression rules:

        1. Recruitment of local authorities (and their service providers (if applicable)): Green =
           two local authorities within 12 months; Red = Less than two local authorities within 12
           months

        2. Randomisation of Children's Centres: Green = at least 12 Centres randomised within 12
           months; Amber = 9-12 Centres randomised within 12 months; Red = less than 9 randomised
           within 12 months.

        3. Recruitment of parents: Green = an average of at least 4 parents registered per
           programme (or control group equivalent); Amber = 3 parents registered per programme; Red
           = less than 3 parents registered per programme.

      Objectives related to staff training, collection of data and estimating sample size are
      included to support the design of the definitive trial, rather than acting as progression
      criteria.

      Design:

      This is a multi-centre, open labelled, two group, prospective, cluster randomised,
      controlled, feasibility study aiming to recruit 120 parents from 12 Children's Centres.
      Cluster randomisation has been chosen to reduce between-group contamination as HENRY is a
      group-based intervention which aims to provide practical guidance and improve parenting
      skills, intended at enhancing family homes and Children's Centre environments. All parents
      registered from HENRY Centres will receive the intervention and therefore it is not possible
      to use parents as the unit of randomisation. Centres and participants will, of necessity, be
      aware of treatment allocation but collection of outcomes will be performed by researchers
      blind to treatment allocation. Randomisation of Children's Centres will be performed by the
      statistician at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU).

      Within each of the two local authorities, three Centres will be randomised to HENRY and three
      will be randomised to the control arm (training to deliver the HENRY programme in these
      Centres will not occur until the end of the study). Historically, when HENRY is commissioned
      by an area, it is the local authority which determines which Centre's will receive the
      intervention. In areas where HENRY is provided by external partners (e.g. Banardos), this is
      determined by the service provider. To maintain some autonomy by the commissioners, local
      authorities/service providers will be asked to allow randomisation of half of the Centres
      they propose to the intervention and half to the control arm. Additional training will be
      offered to those in the wait list control group after follow-up data have been collected
      (although attendance will not be compulsory).

      Screening of parents will take place at Children's Centres by Centre staff and during
      telephone calls from NatCen (an independent social research agency (http://natcen.ac.uk) that
      have no role in delivery of the intervention). Consent and recruitment will occur in parent's
      homes and will be undertaken by staff from NatCen. Self-report questionnaires at 12 months
      will be collected by NatCen researchers within family homes, or at the Children's Centre if
      preferred by the parent. Engagement with the intervention will be assessed by an independent
      member of the trial team at approximately three and six months. Contamination will be
      assessed using a combination of quantitative (e.g. data on facilitators working in multiple
      Centres) and qualitative (e.g. parent focus groups) measures by mapping intervention
      components against their potential to impact on outcomes.

    <description>HENRY is an 8-week programme delivered in Children's Centres, aiming to provide parents with skills and knowledge to support healthy lifestyles in preschool children and their families. It is currently delivered in ~ 35 local areas across England and Wales by trained health and community practitioners. Training includes:
Centre Level Training: to equip staff with knowledge and skills to promote and provide healthy nutrition within early years settings and support parents to provide healthy family lifestyles and nutrition for their families. The theoretical underpinning combines proven models of behaviour change including the Family Partnership Model, motivational interviewing and solution-focused support.
Practitioner Level Training: to deliver the 8-week HENRY programme, which aims to build parents' skills, knowledge and confidence to change old habits and provide healthier nutrition for their young children.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  SITE level Local authorities (or other associations that commission HENRY in
             Children's Centres), Children's Centres and parents meeting all of the relevant
             inclusion criteria, and none of the relevant exclusion criteria, will be considered
             for participation in the study.

        Local authorities (and service providers if applicable):

          -  Local Authorities must nominate a minimum of 6 Children's Centres and formally agree
             to allow randomisation of the Centres. Where possible, Centres should be in
             geographically separate areas to protect against contamination (judged on a case by
             case basis). Local authorities using external teams outside of the Centre to deliver
             HENRY programmes (e.g. health visitors) will be eligible, in addition to those wishing
             to train internal Centre staff to deliver programmes (the most common model currently
             used).

          -  Included local authorities may be completely new to HENRY (having never trained or
             delivered HENRY) or contain at least 6 Centres that are within HENRY 'naÃ¯ve' clusters.
             Clusters are defined as a number of Children's Centres that are close to each other or
             grouped for management purposes. HENRY naive clusters are:

          -  A group of Centres within a cluster that do not include any Centres that are (a)
             currently delivering HENRY or (b) have been trained to, or delivered HENRY within the
             past 2 years.

        PARENT level The target population for the intervention are parents of preschool children;
        mothers, fathers and carers (e.g. with children living in stable /long-term foster care).

          -  Parents must have at least 1 child aged 6 months - 5 years (18 months-6 years at
             follow-up). If more than one child in the family fulfils eligibility criteria, the
             youngest child (by birth timing if twins) will be considered as the reference child
             (from which data will be collected).

          -  Parents must be willing to attend the programme sessions (intervention Centres) and
             willing to provide data in accordance with the data collection protocol. Parents will
             be provided with full details of the data collection requirements in advance so that
             they can make informed decisions as to whether to participate.

          -  Parents must speak English, unless they wish to bring their own interpreter with them
             (e.g. family member) (the intervention and data collection forms are currently only
             available in English).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - SITE level

               -  Children's Centres that have delivered HENRY programmes within the last 2 years
                  or where staff have received HENRY training within the last 2 years.

        PARENT level

          -  Parents with severe learning difficulties that preclude them taking part in group
             sessions in which they need to be able to read and write, judged on a case by case
             basis with consultation with the HENRY team where appropriate.

          -  Parents whose reference child is tube fed (PEG or nasogastric) or with other known
             clinical conditions likely to affect growth over the period of the trial (e.g. cancer,
             coeliac disease, or renal or cardiac problems). A detailed list of excluded conditions
             will be provided at screening, with any uncertainties resolved via clinical input from
             the HENRY team.

          -  Parents who have attended a HENRY group for a previous child.
