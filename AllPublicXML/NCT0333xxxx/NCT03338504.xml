  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial injury is common in patients without acute coronary syndrome, and therefore
      international guidelines propose a classification of patients with myocardial infarction by
      aetiology. This differentiates between myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1)
      and myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) in other acute illnesses. However,
      these guidelines have not been widely adopted as the diagnostic criteria for type 2
      myocardial infarction are not clearly defined. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction
      have poor long term outcomes, with at least twice the mortality at five years compared to
      those with an index type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite the majority of deaths being
      attributable to non-cardiovascular events, the rate of future type 1 myocardial infarction or
      cardiovascular death is similar regardless of index classification. If this future risk is
      related to the presence of underlying coronary artery disease, then there may be the
      potential to improve outcomes through targeted investigation and secondary prevention. The
      investigators will undertake a systematic evaluation of the mechanism of myocardial injury
      and the role of coronary artery disease in 100 patients with elevated cardiac troponin
      concentrations where the diagnosis is likely to be type 2 myocardial infarction. These
      studies will help improve the assessment of patients with myocardial injury, refine the
      diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction, and aid the design of future
      therapeutic trials.

      The investigators will systematically evaluate the mechanisms of acute myocardial injury in
      unselected patients who present to hospital with an alternative primary illness likely to
      cause myocardial oxygen supply or demand imbalance. All patients will be assessed by a member
      of the study team during their index admission and will undergo a detailed assessment of
      their coronary anatomy with either computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), CT
      calcium scoring and non-invasive fractional flow reserve assessment (CT-FFR) or invasive
      coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and invasive fractional flow
      reserve (FFR). The pattern of myocardial injury and its functional consequence will be
      evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. The investigators will determine the
      kinetics of cardiac troponin release using serial testing at multiple time points throughout
      admission, and quantify other proteins and the expression of long non-coding RNA and
      associated mRNA to identify differences related to the presence of coronary artery disease,
      which may help to identify new biomarkers.

    <description>The investigators will identify consecutive patients with acute myocardial injury (defined as a rise and or fall in cardiac troponin concentration on serial testing, with at least one value &gt;99th centile) where the likely mechanism of injury is thought to be myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance (e.g secondary to hypoxia, hypotension, tachycardia or anaemia). Patients will be identified through screening of cardiac troponin measurements. Patients who meet both the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be approached and those who provide consent will comprise the study population. All patients will have a Cardiac MRI scan, with invasive coronary angiography or CT coronary angiography dependent on baseline fitness. The investigators will record demographic and clinical information from the electronic patient record for patients who meet inclusion criteria but have one or more exclusion criteria.</description>

    <description>Where patients are fit, coronary angiography will be performed via the femoral or radial artery with 6F arterial catheters. In patients with one or more stenoses in a major epicardial vessel, a coronary pressure guidewire (PressureWire™ Aeris™, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) will be used to determine distal coronary pressure and the fractional flow reserve (FFR) calculated at maximal adenosine-induced (intravenous 140 μg/kg/min) hyperaemia. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed in all three coronary vessels using a Dragonfly® coronary imaging catheter (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois) with pullback at 20 mm/s to identify features consistent with vulnerable plaque or recent plaque rupture.(16) If there is evidence of inducible myocardial ischaemia due to coronary artery stenosis, revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered if in the patients best interests.</description>

    <description>CT coronary angiography will be performed using a 128 multidetector row CT. Patients with a heart rate exceeding 65 beats/min will receive oral beta-blockade 1 hour before computed tomography. Additional intravenous beta blockers will be given depending on heart rate at the time of imaging. All patients will receive sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (300 μg) immediately prior to dual cardiac and respiratory-gated computed tomography imaging of the coronary arteries. The investigators will quantify total plaque burden using CT calcium scoring. A bolus of 80-100 mL of contrast will be injected intravenously at 5 mL/s. An assessment of the functional consequences of coronary artery stenosis will be made using the computed tomography fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) technique, using the HeartFlow platform.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cardiac MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) will be performed using a 3T scanner. The MRI scan will consist of localisers, axial and coronal HASTE images, standard breath-held and ECG-gated cine sequences. Short-axis cine images will be obtained for the assessment of left ventricle function and volumes. Left ventricle volumes, mass and ejection fraction will be assessed using dedicated software and values indexed to body surface area. Breath-held, ECG-gated T2 mapping sequences of the myocardium will be performed in the short-axis as a marker of myocardial inflammation. T1-weighted imaging of the coronary arteries will be performed to look for evidence of recent intraplaque thrombus or haemorrhage. The late gadolinium enhancement and T2 mapping techniques will identify regions of new or old myocardial infarction as well as other patterns of injury. Where there are no contraindications, stress MRI will be performed using intravenous Regadenoson.</description>
