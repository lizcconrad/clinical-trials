    <textblock>
      The main part of this trial is a phase II study of vosaroxin with azacitidine in older
      patients with newly diagnosed AML and intermediate or adverse genetic risk or MDS-EB-2. An
      initial safety run-in phase of the study will be performed administering the study drug
      vosaroxin with azacitidine in up to 18 patients. After completion of the run-in phase,
      toxicity and response data will be provided to the external Data and Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) and the Trial Committee by the Coordinating Investigator. The Trial Committee will
      decide on the basis of these data and the recommendation of the DSMB on dose modification and
      the vosaroxin dose for the phase II part of the study, which will include 150 patients in
      total.
