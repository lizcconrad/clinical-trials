      The current study sought to evaluate the clinical relevance of iFR-guided strategy in real
      world clinical practice using unrestricted study population from stable angina to acute
      coronary syndrome including acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Previous
      abundant historical data of FFR-guided strategy will be also included as historical control
      to validate the iFR-guided strategy.

      In this study, we will validate the clinical relevance of instantaneous wave free ratio
      (iFR)-guided strategy in real world clinical practice in Korea. The 1,200 patients who
      underwent iFR measurement will be prospectively enrolled at 5 centers in Republic of Korea.
      In patients who were indicated revascularization after iFR measurement (iFR&lt;0.90), iFR
      pullback system (iFR Scout) and post-revascularization iFR measurement will be routinely
      performed. The primary hypothesis will be tested for non-inferiority of iFR-guided strategy,
      compared with FFR-guided strategy in terms of 2-year clinical outcomes. For the clinical
      outcome data following FFR-guided strategy will be used from the pooled data of the DEFER-DES
      trial, the 3V FFR FRIENDS registry (NCT01621438), and Korean 4-center FFR registry. Using
      those data, 1200 patients will be selected from the pooled data. In addition, routine
      application of iFR Scout and post-revascularization iFR measurement will enable us to
      validate the clinical relevance of iFR-based prediction of acute procedural results and to
      compare FFR-pullback methods.

      Primary Hypothesis: The iFR-guided strategy will be non-inferior regarding patient-oriented
      composite outcomes (a composite of any death, any MI, any revascularization) at 2-year,
      compared with FFR-guided strategy.

      Primary Outcome:

      1] Patient-oriented composite outcome (POCO), defined as a composite of any death, any
      myocardial infarction (MI) or any revascularization at 2-year after index procedure according
      to the ARC consensus [2] Difference between Predicted post-PCI iFR value from iFR Scout and
      Actual post-PCI iFR measurement

      Sample Size 1,200 patients with suspected ischemic heart disease including stable angina, or
      acute coronary syndrome including unstable angina, non ST-segment elevation MI, or ST-segment
      elevation MI with non-culprit stenosis enrolled at 5 centers in Republic of Korea.

           implantation or vessel size≥2.5 mm without definitive previous evidence of myocardial
           ischemia.

           ④ Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment
           alternatives of receiving invasive physiologic evaluation and he/she or his/her legally
