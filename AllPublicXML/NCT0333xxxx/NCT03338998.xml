  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, subject- and investigator-blinded trial of BAF312
      in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients to study efficacy, safety, and tolerability.
      BAF312 is a drug that could potentially limit brain inflammation after ICH, and thereby
      improve neurological outcome for hemorrhagic stroke patients.

      In this study, ICH patients meeting study criteria will be randomized at 1:1 ratio into
      either active or placebo group. The first i.v. treatment must starts within 24 hours of ICH
      event. Participating patients will also be followed up for additional 76 days after treatment
      on neurological and safety conditions in 3 clinic visits.

      BAF312 treatment includes the following identified risks: transient effects on heart rate and
      rhythm (bradyarrhythmia and 2nd degree AV block) at treatment initiation that are completely
      avoided by initial up-titration; liver enzyme elevation; lymphopenia due to lymphocyte
      redistribution (expected effect of BAF312); macular edema; and varicella zoster (VZV)
      infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ICH patients eligible for inclusion in this study must fulfill all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 18 to 80 years (inclusive).

          2. Written informed consent obtained before any study assessment is performed. If the
             patient is not able to give the informed consent personally, consent by a relative or
             legal representative is acceptable.

          3. Spontaneous, supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage in deep brain structures
             (putamen, thalamus, caudate, and associated deep white matter tracts) with a volume ≥
             10 mL but ≤ 30 mL (calculated by the ABC/2 method, after Kothari et al 1996)
             determined by routine clinical MRI or CT.

          4. Patients with the onset of ICH witnessed and/or last seen healthy no longer than 24
             hrs previously.

          5. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) best motor score no less than 6.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        ICH patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in
        this study:

          1. Use of other investigational drugs within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or until the
             expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline (for biologics), whichever is
             longer.

          2. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical
             classes (e.g., fingolimod).

          3. Current use of concomitant medications with potent CYP2C9/3A4 inhibitory or induction
             potential.

          4. Necessity for mechanical ventilation at screening.

          5. Infratentorial (midbrain, pons, medulla, or cerebellum) or superficial cortical
             (lobar) ICH.

          6. Candidates for surgical hematoma evacuation or other urgent surgical intervention
             (i.e., surgical relief of increased intracranial pressure) on initial presentation. If
             during the treatment period surgical hematoma evacuation or surgical intervention to
             lower intracranial pressure becomes indicated, the investigational treatment should be
             stopped.

          7. Patients with intraventricular hematoma extension, with or without hydrocephalus, on
             initial presentation.

          8. Secondary ICH due to:

               -  aneurysm

               -  brain tumor

               -  arteriovenous malformation

               -  thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count of &lt;150,000/µl

               -  known history of coagulopathy

               -  disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

          9. Prior disability due to other disease compromising mRS evaluation, thereby interfering
             with the primary outcome, operationally defined as an estimated mRS score (by history)
             of ≥ 3 before ICH.

         10. Preexisting unstable epilepsy.

         11. Patients with active systemic bacterial, viral or fungal infections.

         12. Concomitant drug-related exclusion criteria:

               -  Intravenous immunoglobulin, immunosuppressive and/or chemotherapeutic
                  medications.

               -  Moderate immunosuppressives (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate) and/or fingolimod
                  within 2 months prior to randomization.

                  history or observed at screening).

               -  PR interval &gt;220 msec. Long QT syndrome or QTcF prolongation &gt;450 msec in males
                  or &gt;470 msec in females on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).

             positive hCG laboratory test.

         16. Patients with any other medically unstable condition or serious laboratory abnormality
