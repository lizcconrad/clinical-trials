  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a needle-free treatment of hypoglycemia with glucagon
      nasal powder (study drug) to a marketed glucagon administered by the intra-muscular (IM)
      route, in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Treatment Success During Controlled Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose up to 30 minutes post each glucagon administration</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as an increase in plasma glucose to greater than or equal to (≥) 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or an increase of ≥20 mg/dL from plasma glucose nadir, without receiving additional actions to increase the plasma glucose concentration. Nadir is defined as the minimum plasma glucose concentration at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female participants with a diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) for at
             least 2 years and receiving daily insulin since the time of diagnosis

          -  Have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value less than or equal to (≤) 10 percent (%)

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling and required infusions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have known allergies to LY900018, related compounds or any components of the
             formulation, or history of significant atopy

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity to glucagon or any related products or severe
             hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema) to any drugs

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study

          -  Have a history of pheochromocytoma (that is, adrenal gland tumor) or insulinoma

          -  Occurrence of an episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring the assistance
             of another person in the 1 month prior to enrolling in the study)

          -  Have a history of epilepsy or seizure disorder

          -  Have a significant history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine (apart from T1DM), hematological, or neurological
             disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination
             of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking the study drug; or of interfering with
             the interpretation of data

          -  Are women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Have, except for the current regimen of insulin therapy and concomitant medication,
             regular use of or intended use of any over-the-counter or prescription medications or
