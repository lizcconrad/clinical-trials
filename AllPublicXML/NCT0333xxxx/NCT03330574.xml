    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the performance of a new diagnostic device in the
      diagnosis and management of glaucoma. We will use this new device (PERG) to evaluate the
      function of the retina in glaucoma patients. This device is safe for the patients.

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. It's an optic neuropathy
      characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells.

      In laboratories, it's possible to measure the electrical activity of retinal ganglion cells
      (RGC). Some researchers found that RGC showed electrical anomalies before dying. This
      decrease of electrical activity can be measured by using pattern electroretinography (PERG).
      Unfortunately, these measures could not be obtained in clinics before this new device.

      For this reason, Diopsys developed a new device that can measure PERG directly in clinics,
      allowing physicians to have these data earlier to help them diagnose pathologies such as
      glaucoma or other ganglion cells abnormalities.

      Currently, it is known that glaucoma is difficult to diagnose in the early stages and it's
      challenging to decide when to start a treatment.

      In this study, our purpose is to use this new device to evaluate its efficacy in the
      diagnosis and management of glaucoma.
