  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with limb amputations experience the sensation of the missing extremity, which is
      sometimes coupled with a persistent and debilitating pain in the missing limb, a condition
      known as phantom limb pain (PLP). This study will test the use of virtual reality (VR)
      training as a possible treatment of PLP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90% of patients with limb amputations experience the persistent sensation of
      the missing extremity, a phenomenon known as phantom limb (PL). Most patients with PL also
      experience a persistent and debilitating pain in the missing limb, a condition known as
      phantom limb pain (PLP).PLP is often attributed to a disruption of the primary sensory-motor
      representation, generating &quot;noise&quot; in the representation of the missing extremity,
      manifesting as pain. If loss of sensory feedback causes degradation of the these cortices,
      interventions that provide visual feedback about the missing extremity might fine-tune the
      primary sensory-motor cortices, thereby reducing pain. Within this framework, the present
      study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) training as a possible treatment of PLP.
      Twenty-five subjects with lower-limb amputation and chronic PLP will undergo a Virtual
      Reality (VR) treatment (17 one-hour sessions) consisting in two phases: a Distraction VR
      phase (5-7 sessions) in which they will explore VR environments using a joystick and a
      Lower-Limb VR treatment phase (10-12 sessions) in which they will participate in a variety of
      games and activities using their VR lower-limbs. A comprehensive battery for the assessment
      of the characteristics, intensity and the daily-life implication of PLP will be presented
      before and after the treatment and in three follow up testing sessions (1,4, 8 weeks).
      Furthermore, pain intensity will be assessed before and after each VR session. A dramatic
      reduction of PLP is expected after the VR treatment and that these beneficial effects remain
      stable in time.

    <time_frame>Pre and post Phase 1; Pre and post Phase 2; at 1, 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a questionnaire which provide a description of the type and location of pain (question 1-2),the pain severity (question 3-6 pain rating scales with 0-10 range - with 10 indicating severe pain), of the current treatment for pain (question 7-8) and the pain interference in daily life (question 9- range from 0 to 10 with a maximum score of 10 indicating severe interference). A decrease (i.e. reduction in the scores) in pain severity and in the pain interference in daily activity is expected as consequence of the virtual reality training.</description>

    <description>The McGill Pain Questionnaire is a questionnaire which provide a description of the type of pain using series of adjectives on of the pain severity, using a visual analogue scale (range of 0-100 range - with 100 indicating severe pain). A decrease in pain severity (decrease in the score in the visual analogue scale) is expected as consequence of the virtual reality training.</description>

    <description>The the Frenchay Activities Index is a 15 items questionnaire, which investigate how often people perform certain daily activity (e.g. preparing meals), using a scale from 0 to 3, with a score of 3 indicating that the activity is performed frequently. An increase in the Frenchay Activities Index is expected as consequence of the virtual reality training.</description>
