    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to study the safety and effectiveness of atezolizumab in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or
      following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving
      platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical
      treatment in common clinical practice settings in Argentina.
