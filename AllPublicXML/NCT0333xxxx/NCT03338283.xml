    <textblock>
      Objectives: Establishing and validating an electrotherapy procedure with interferential
      current (IFC) application using electro-massage on patients who have undergone acromioplasty
      surgery. To evaluate the possible decrease in pain perception and improvement of
      functionality following surgical intervention.

      Design: Randomized, single blind clinical trial. Subjects: 18-patients, aged 18 to 65, with a
      similar distribution of male and female participants Methods: 10-patients will be enrolled in
      the experimental group and 8 patients as the control group. Both groups of patients will
      undergo six physiotherapy sessions (three times a week). The experimental group will undergo
      a treatment consisting of electro-massage with constant voltage (CV) IFC bipolar application,
      4000 Hz carrier current and 100 Hz amplitude modulated frequency (AMF). Two 48 cm2 electrodes
      will be used. Session length with electrotherapy will be approximately ten minutes.

    <description>Electromassage and conservatory treatment. All subjects will be received a conservatory treatment (1h and 40 min) and electro-massage (10min).
The protocol will consist of six sessions, twice a week for three weeks. The duration will be 1 hour and 40 min for the conservatory treatment and 10 min for the electro-massage.</description>

    <description>The control protocol will combine: (a) thermotherapy with infrared application; (b) active, self-assisted and isometric shoulder exercises, including Codman's pendulum exercises; (c) manual therapy, always in a pain-free range of movement; and (d) ultrasound in pulsatile mode over the acromium and scapulohumeral area.</description>

    <description>Electro-massage that will be performed by a specialist physiotherapist with more than 8 years of experience We use ENDOMED 482 (Enraf Nonius, Spain) for the elecro-massage. the current parameters are: frequency shift at 4000 Hz IFC, 100 Hz AMF in CV mode. We will gradually raise the current intensity until reaching a high level, but not so high as to cause pain or discomfort, nor evident muscle contraction, although a gentle vibration is allowed. The electro-massage was performed on the musculature of the shoulder and neck.</description>
