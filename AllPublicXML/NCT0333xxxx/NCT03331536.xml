  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective cohort trial that will help to understand the impact
      of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in pre- and post-menopausal
      female bariatric patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While highly effective both RYGB and SG may lead to increased bone resorption, decreased bone
      mass, and increased risk of some fractures. Very few studies have compared the effects of the
      RYGB and the SG on changes skeletal health and findings have been inconsistent. Furthermore,
      few studies have investigated the short- or long-term consequences of bariatric surgery on
      bone mineral density in pre- and post-menopausal women. To what extent and how bariatric
      surgery impacts the skeleton largely remains undetermined. Because estrogen is protective
      against osteoporosis and fractures, the majority of fractures occur in postmenopausal women.
      It is important that women have higher rates of obesity (38.3%) compared to men (34.3%) and
      that ≥67% of bariatric patients are women. Therefore, women may be at a significantly
      increased risk of developing osteoporosis. These data may help establish clinical guidelines
      to assess, maintain, and promote skeletal health in the preoperative and postoperative care
      of bariatric patients; and it may help to determine the appropriate bariatric procedure for
      women at risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

    <description>Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to assess bone mineral density, BMD (in g/cm2) of the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip, femoral neck, distal radius, sub-total whole body (excluding only the head), and whole body. T scores will be evaluated and Z scores will be evaluated. T-scores between +1 and −1 is considered normal or healthy, T-scores between −1 and −2.5 indicates that you have low bone mass, although not low enough to be diagnosed with osteoporosis, T-scores of −2.5 or lower indicates that you have osteoporosis. For premenopausal women under the age of 50, the Z-score is used for diagnosis. Using the criteria defined by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry: If the Z-score is -2.0 or lower, the result will be below the expected range for age. If the Z score is above -2.0, the result is will be defined as within the expected range for age.</description>
