      The aim of the prospective study is to determine whether combination/ sequential therapy with
      Entecavir, Peginterferon alfa-2b and immunomodulators Granulocyte Macrophage Colony
      Stimulating Factor (GMCSF)+vaccine could induce HBsAg loss in chronic hepatitis B patients
      with maintained Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA suppression on long-term nucleoside or nucleotide
      analogue (NA).

      Patents who were treated with NA at least one year and achieved HBV DNA suppression are
      enrolled in this study, they will receive Entecavir (ETV) for 60 weeks, HBV vaccine
      (60ug/month, every four weeks) for 24 weeks, GMCSF (75 μg/day, first 5 days each month,
      subcutaneous) from baseline to week 16 and from week 60 to week 84, and Y peginterferon
      alfa-2b (180 μg/week, subcutaneous) from week 16 to week 108.
