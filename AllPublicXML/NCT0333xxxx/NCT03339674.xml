  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous research (Odenwald &amp; Semrau, 2012) the investigators know that
      psychoeducation on comorbid mental disorders during residential alcohol detoxification can
      improve subsequent treatment utilization. In this study they will study a hypothesized
      psychological mechanism that contributes to this behavior change.

      The investigators will recruit alcohol dependent patients in residential detox treatment who
      all receive Treatment as Usual. Participants will be randomly assigned to an additional
      psychoeducational group therapy (intervention group) or to an additional neuropsychological
      group training (control group). Measurements will take place on the day before study
      inclusion, one week later and one month after release from index residential treatment.
      Measurements will include alcohol-related risk perception, alcohol use, treatment motivation,
      comorbid psychiatric symptoms and whether the patient has regularly completed treatment and
      whether he/she has been transferred to subsequent treatment. Furthermore, six months after
      release from index treatment information on re-admission to the clinic is assessed from
      patient files.

      The investigators hypothesize that the behavioral effects of psychoeducational group
      intervention will be mediated by adaptive changes of the individual's alcohol-related risk
      perception.
