  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib measured by Independent
      Radiology Committee (IRC)-assessed objective response rate (ORR) in Japanese patients with
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has progressed after prior vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is being tested to
      treat people who have advanced renal cell carcinoma. This study will look at the efficacy of
      cabozantinib.

      The study will enroll approximately 35 patients. Participants will be enrolled in one
      treatment group in non-randomized and opened manner:

      â€¢ Cabozantinib 60 mg

      All participants will be asked to take tablets of cabozantinib at once daily in the fasted
      state throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately at most 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      in treatment period, and posttreatment period including a follow-up assessment after last
      dose of study drug.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years (approximately 2 years after enrollment of the last participant)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the sum of percentage of participants whose best overall response is complete response rate (CR) and partial response rate (PR). Response and progression is evaluated by independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST V1.1 where CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SoD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 years (approximately 2 years after enrollment of the last participant)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as proportion of participants whose best overall response is CR, PR or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1. Response and progression is evaluated by IRC per RECIST V1.1 where CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SoD. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <description>A serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>
