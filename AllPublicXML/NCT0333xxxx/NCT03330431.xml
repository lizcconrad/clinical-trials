  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to determine whether a short video aiming to optimize expectations
      regarding the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) ist able to improve the
      actual effectiveness of PMR in comparison with a neutral (no video) control group.

    <description>Participants are asked to rate how relaxed they feel at the moment at two time points (baseline and after the PMR intervention) on a questionnaire (VAS: item ranges from 0 (not relaxed at all) - 100 (very relaxed). Change scores are calculated (post- minus pre-scores).</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to rate how stressed they feel at the moment at two time points (baseline and after the PMR intervention) on a questionnaire (VAS: item ranges from 0 (not stressed at all) - 100 (very stressed).

    <description>All groups undergo a PMR session, but they differ regarding the treatment before the PMR session. Two groups watch a video before undergoing PMR, the control group reads a text before undergoing PMR.
Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a technique for learning to monitor and control the state of muscular tension. It was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the early 1920s.
The technique involves learning to monitor tension in each specific muscle group in the body by deliberately inducing tension in each group. This tension is then released, with attention paid to the contrast between tension and relaxation.</description>
