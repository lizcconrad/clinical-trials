  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain assessments in non-verbal, critically ill infants represent an important clinical
      challenge. Older children or adults can easily express their pain, but infants lack that
      capability. They frequently experience repetitive acute pain during routine ICU care, but
      their analgesic management flounders on the horns of a dilemma: (a) failure to treat infant
      pain leads to immediate clinical instability and potentially long-term physical, behavioral,
      and cognitive sequelae, vs. (b) strong analgesics may increase risks for medical
      complications and/or impaired brain growth. Bedside nurses currently assess pain using pain
      scores, before taking action to ameliorate pain. Pain scores increase nursing workload and
      provide subjective assessments, rather than objective data for evaluating infant pain.
      Consequently, infants exposed to skin-breaking procedures, surgery, or other painful
      conditions often receive variable and inconsistent pain management in the ICU. The
      investigators aim to develop a multimodal pain assessment system, using sensor fusion and
      novel machine learning algorithms to provide an objective measure of pain that is
      context-dependent and rater-independent. This will enhance the quality of pain management in
      ICUs and allow continuous pain monitoring in real-time.

        We will collect data from 30 study subjects in each of the following age groups:

          -  Preterm infants (34-37 weeks, postnatal age 3-30 days)

          -  Term newborns (37-42 weeks gestation, less than 1 month of age)

          -  Infants from 1-3 months age, and

          -  Older infants from 3-6 months age. A total of 120 subjects will be recruited before
             study closure.
