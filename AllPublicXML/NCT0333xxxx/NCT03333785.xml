  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving Cancer Care Together through eOncoNote is a pragmatic randomized trial involving a
      secure online eConsultation system (referred to as eOncoNote) that will allow primary care
      providers and cancer specialist providers to communicate about their patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this randomized trial are to test an intervention designed to
      improve coordination/continuity of care between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer
      specialist providers (CSPs), and to improve patient experience with regards to patients'
      perceived continuity of care. Participants will be patients at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer
      Centre in any one of three phases of the cancer continuum: diagnosis (colorectal, prostate,
      or lung cancer), active treatment (breast or prostate cancer) or survivorship (breast or
      colorectal cancer). The intervention involves a secure online eConsultation system that will
      allow PCPs and CSPs to communicate about their patient. Patients will be randomly allocated
      to one of two groups: 1) intervention group whereby their PCP and CSP will use a
      cancer-specific modification of the eConsultation system (eOncoNote) in addition to usual
      methods of communication or 2) control group receiving usual care (i.e. usual methods of
      communication such as telephone, fax, mailed consultation letters and progress notes).
      Randomization and outcomes will be at the level of the individual patient. The primary
      outcome is patients' perception of team/cross-boundary continuity. Secondary outcomes include
      measures of patients' anxiety and depression, and patients' experience of the care process.
      Qualitative methods including interviews with patients, PCPs, CSPs, and cancer system
      managers will also be conducted.

    <intervention_model_description>Improving Cancer Care Together through eOncoNote is a concurrent mixed-methods hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study design. Effectiveness of eOncoNote will be assessed by a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with individual patient randomization and outcomes measured at the patient level. Implementation will be assessed using a mixed methods process evaluation involving key stakeholders to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Diagnosis phase: The patient's nurse navigator will initiate an eOncoNote to the patient's PCP, inviting them to send any questions related to the patient's diagnostic process. The nurse navigator will initiate case closure after the diagnostic process has been completed (case will be open up to 4 months).
Treatment phase: The patient's medical or radiation oncologist will initiate an eOncoNote to the patient's PCP inviting them to ask questions related to the patient's cancer treatment and/or request information related to the patient's co-morbidities. The oncologist will initiate case closure after the treatment has been completed.
Survivorship phase: The patient's registered nurse within the Wellness Beyond Cancer Program will send an eOncoNote invitation to the patient's PCP inviting them to ask any questions as the patient transitions back to their care. The nurse will initiate case closure after one year.</description>
