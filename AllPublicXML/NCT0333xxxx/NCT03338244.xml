    <textblock>
      In the event that MORDOR (NCT02047981) established the efficacy of oral azithromycin in
      preventing mortality in 1-59 month children, the contingency study was to treat both arms in
      Niger with oral azithromycin (unmasked) for two more years in Niger only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Establish the effects of longer-term biannual mass azithromycin distribution.

      Establish the efficacy of 3-4 years of mass azithromycin on child mortality compared to 1-2
      years, to address loss (or augmentation) of efficacy with increasing years of distribution.
      For example, initial efficacy may be mitigated by increasing antibiotic resistance.

      The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality in children aged 1-59 months, as determined
      by biannual census. A determination will be made whether there is an increase in mortality in
      communities randomized to stop versus continue mass azithromycin distributions both as
      compared to historical mortality in the placebo arm of MORDOR I and between randomization
      arms at 48 months.
