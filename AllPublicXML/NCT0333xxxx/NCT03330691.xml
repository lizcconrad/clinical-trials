  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and
      some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative
      leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly
      from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express two chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs). One is to recognize CD19 and the other is to recognize CD22, both of which are
      proteins expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.
      The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through recognition of
      CD19 and CD22. This is a phase 1 study designed to determine the safety of the CAR+ T-cells
      and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Disease status

          -  If post allogeneic HCT: Confirmed CD19+CD22+ leukemia recurrence defined as at least
             0.01% disease following allogeneic HCT

          -  If relapse/refractory status with no prior history of allogeneic HCT, one of the
             following:

               -  Second or greater marrow relapse, with or without extramedullary disease

               -  First marrow relapse at end of first month or re-induction with marrow having at
                  least 0.01 % blasts by morphology and/or MPF

               -  Primary refractory as defined as greater than 5% blasts by multi-parameter flow
                  after at least 2 separate induction regimens.

               -  Patient has indication for HCT but has been deemed ineligible, inclusive of
                  persistent MRD

          -  Asymptomatic from CNS involvement, if present, and in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator with a reasonable expectation that disease burden can be controlled in
             the interval between enrollment and T-cell infusion. Subjects with significant
             neurologic deterioration will not be eligible for T-cell infusion until stabilized.

               -  Free from active GVHD and off immunosuppressive GVHD therapy for 4 weeks

               -  Lansky or Karnofsky performance score of at least 50

               -  Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

               -  Recovered from acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and
                  radiotherapy

               -  At least 7 days post last chemotherapy administration (excluding intrathecal
                  maintenance chemotherapy)

               -  Adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requiring systemic corticosteroids (exclusive of physiologic replacement dosing)
             within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Previously received genetically modified cell therapy that is still detectable, or
             virotherapy

          -  Active clinically significant CNS dysfunction

          -  Active malignancy other than CD19+CD22+ leukemia

          -  Active severe infection

          -  Concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would
             prevent the patient from undergoing protocol-specified therapy
