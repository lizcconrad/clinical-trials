  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It remains unclear whether certain disadvantaged subgroups of society may be at heightened
      risk for poor chronic low back pain (cLBP) outcomes. The overall aim of this study is to
      incorporate a socioeconomic framework to characterize racial differences in cLBP severity and
      disability. Further, guided by the theory of fundamental causes, we aim to examine racial and
      socioeconomic status differences in biopsychosocial predictors of cLBP outcomes, particularly
      endogenous pain modulation.

      Experimental session 1

      Resting Blood Pressure and Body Mass Index will be assessed. Participants will complete the
      Rapid Estimation of Adult Literacy Measure-Short Form (REALM-SF) to determine health
      literacy. Participants will complete multiple questionnaires to measure Socioeconomic Status,
      Clinical Pain Assessment and Depression Scale. All participants will undergo quantitative
      sensory testing for assessment of endogenous pain modulation using painful heat, mechanical,
      and cold stimuli in a laboratory session lasting approximately 1 hour.

      Between Experimental Session 1 and Experimental Session 2

      Sleep assessment: Sleep data will be collected by participants in their own homes using
      objective and subjective measures of their sleep. Participant instructions for how to collect
      and record their own sleep data will be provided at the end of study session 1.

      Experimental Session 2

      Experimental session 2 will take place in the CCTS Clinical Research Unit (CRU) All blood
      will be collected as part of a single draw by research nurses. Participants will complete
      multiple questionnaires to measure Clinical Pain Assessment and Coping Strategies.
      Participants will then complete a battery of ecologically valid movement tasks that include:
      1) getting in and out of a bed; 2) sitting in a chair, transitioning to a standing position,
      and then sitting again, and 3) lifting, Performance Battery (SPPB) and the Timed Up and Go
      test (TUG). Blood will be processed and stored and then used to measure Vitamin D, CRP assays
      and Oxytocin. Finally follow up data will be collected by phone once per week for four weeks
      following the completion of study session 2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Pain Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one week.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report a number between 0 - 100 describing the intensity of their low back pain, such that 0 = no pain and 100 = the most intense pain imaginable. Any integer from 0 to 100 can be provided.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain threshold refers to the intensity at which a stimulus is first perceived as painful. Heat stimuli will be delivered using a computer-controlled thermal stimulation system with a 30 millimeter X 30 millimeter probe. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of .5 degrees Celsius/second until the participant responds by pressing a button on a handheld device. For heat pain threshold, participants will be instructed to press the button when the sensation &quot;first becomes painful&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain tolerance refers to the maximum amount of pain produced by a stimulus that a person is able/willing to tolerate. Heat stimuli will again be delivered using the computer-controlled thermal stimulation system. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of .5 degrees Celsius/second until the participant responds by pressing a button on a handheld device. For heat pain tolerance, participants will be instructed to press the button when they are &quot;no longer willing to tolerate&quot; the painful sensation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal summation of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation of pain refers to a form of endogenous pain facilitation characterized by the perception of increased pain despite constant or even reduced peripheral afferent input. Temporal summation is presumed to be the psychophysical manifestation of wind-up. Wind-up is a phenomenon where repetitive stimulation of C primary afferents at rates greater than 0.3 Hertz produces a slowly increasing response of second-order neurons in the spinal cord.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A routinely used quantitative sensory testing protocol for the measurement of endogenous pain inhibition is conditioned pain modulation, which refers to the reduction in pain from one stimulus (the test stimulus) produced by the application of a second pain stimulus at a remote body site (the conditioning stimulus). Conditioned pain modulation is believed to reflect the perceptual manifestation of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, whereby ascending projections from one noxious stimulus activate supraspinal structures that trigger descending inhibitory projections to the dorsal horn.</description>
