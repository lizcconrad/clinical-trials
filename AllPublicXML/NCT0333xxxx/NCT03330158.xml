  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this biomedical research is to evaluate the feasibility of the treatment with
      the new spinal distraction device ASTS in patients aged 4 to 10 years with severe early onset
      scoliosis.

      The hypothesis of this project is that the new fully implantable motorized spinal distraction
      device may provide a correction of scoliosis and progressive elongation ensuring patient
      comfort and minimizing complications.

      The ASTS (for Active Scoliosis Treatment System) growing rod is a new fully implantable
      motorized spinal distraction device which can ensure a correction of scoliosis and
      progressive elongation ensuring patient comfort and minimizing complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a better understanding and technical progress, the evolutionary early scoliosis
      remains a therapeutic challenge. The definition includes idiopathic scoliosis beginning
      before the age of 3 years, congenital scoliosis, neuromuscular and syndromic. Spinal
      deformity is often progressive and may compromise cardiorespiratory function.

      The goal of treatment is to prevent further avoiding spinal fusion in a subject in growth.
      Surgery is indicated in case of failure or cons-indication of conservative treatment (corset
      or plaster). The principle is to position the posterior rods subcutaneous or in muscle
      attached to two ends of the deformation.

      Intraoperative distraction allows correction of the deformity. A new distraction is performed
      every 6 months until skeletal maturity.

      Considerable complication rates are reported (58%), mainly implant infections and
      disassembly, because of the need for multiple reoperations. Motorized implants can
      potentially avoid repeated interventions limiting complications.

      Thus, the central hypothesis of this project is a new fully implantable motorized spinal
      distraction device may provide a correction of scoliosis and progressive elongation ensuring
      patient comfort and minimizing complications.
