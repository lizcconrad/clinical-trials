  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of functional exercise and training
      counseling by kinesiotherapist in addition to the basic exercise program of cycling during
      dialysis on physical performance of dialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study will include 86 dialysis patients. Investigators will first test the strength of lower
      limbs with sit-to-stand test, handgrip strength, flexibility, balance, submaximal aerobic
      capacity, physical characteristics and clinical parameters. After that randomization of
      patients in two groups will be made - one experimental and one active control group. Patients
      who will refuse to exercise will be invited to a non-randomized inactive control group
      (without exercise).

      The experimental group will attend 3 times weekly a guided functional exercise before the
      dialysis procedure for 20 minutes and perform a cycling session during dialysis in the first
      phase of the study, which will last for 8 weeks. During this time experimental group will
      receive exercise counselling; instructions how to practice at home will be given by examples
      and training during functional exercise predialysis sessions.

      In the second phase of the study for additional eight weeks participants will be instructed
      to exercise at home using the skills mastered during the first study phase on non-dialysis
      days, and continue with the program of intradialysis cycling. Investigators will give them
      advice, monitor and motivate them.

      The active control group will perform intradialytic exercise (intradialysis cycling equal to
      cycling program of experimental group) during dialysis procedure for four months.

      The primary end-point of the study is a change in the 10-repetition sit-to-stand test time as
      a measure of strength of lower extremities.

      Exercise program will be run by a kinesiologist. Main hypothesis is that the guided
      functional exercise under the surveillance of a kinesiologist added to intradialysis cycling
      program statistically significantly improves patient's physical performance as compared to
      the program of intradialysis cycling alone.

    <description>Participants in this group will perform 20 minutes of functional training before dialysis (in the first 8 weeks) and intradialysis cycling exercise during dialysis. Participants will also receive exercise counselling; investigators will teach them how to practice at home by practice and examples given during the 20 minutes of functional training pre-dialysis. In the second phase of additional eight weeks participants will perform the functional training at home on non-dialysis days in addition to intradialysis cycling. Kinesiologist will monitor, advice and motivate them.</description>

    <description>First 8 weeks: patients will perform 20 minutes of functional training before their dialysis procedure. The exercise program will be run by kinesiologists, who will also teach patients how to perform exercises on their own at home. During intradialysis cycling 3 times weekly participants will cycle on adapted ergometer. Participants will start with 10 - 15 minutes of cycling and then gradually increase time and intensity up to 45 minutes of duration.
Second phase of 8 weeks: participants will no longer perform functional training before dialysis but will be motivated, monitored and advised to perform functional exercise at home on non-dialysis days for 20-30 minutes and continue with cycling sessions during the dialysis procedures three times weekly.</description>
