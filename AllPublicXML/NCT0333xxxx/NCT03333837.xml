      Dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that impairs a person's ability to perform
      activities of daily living. Changes in mood, gait, and balance are prominent secondary
      symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia that can dramatically decrease quality of life for the
      person with dementia and increase caregiver burden. The overall aim of this study is to
      determine the independent and combined effects of dance movement and social engagement on
      quality of life in people with early-stage dementia, and test the neural mechanisms of these
      effects.

    <textblock>
      Dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that impairs a person's ability to perform
      activities of daily living. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, the most
      common neurodegenerative disease in older adults, and the 6th leading cause of death in the
      US. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (apathy, depression, anxiety) and altered gait and balance are
      prominent secondary symptoms of Alzheimer's disease that increase medical costs and decrease
      quality of life for both the person with dementia and their caregiver.

      In a report from the Secretariat (Executive Board, 134th Session, December 20th, 2013), the
      World Health Organization identified a need to integrate evidence-based palliative care
      services into the continuum of care for serious chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's
      disease. However, two recent NIH workshops identified major gaps in the evidence supporting
      the wider use of non-pharmacologic activities to ameliorate secondary symptoms of chronic
      disease. Arts-based activities were identified as particularly understudied for symptom
      management, given growing evidence that various arts-based activities can improve quality of
      life, relieve symptoms, and reduce reliance on medications. It is important that these
      benefits can be achieved without adding medications. Dance is an arts-based activity that can
      improve quality of life, decrease symptoms of depression, and improve balance in healthy
      older adults, those with Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, dance is a
      non-pharmacological intervention that simultaneously addresses two sets of prominent
      secondary symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: 1) gait and balance and 2) neuropsychiatric
      symptoms. However, the mechanisms through which dance exerts these effects are unknown.

      Pilot data from the investigators' laboratory suggest that participating in a group
      improvisational movement class twice weekly improved balance and connectivity in
      motor-related brain regions, as well as improving mood and connectivity in brain regions
      associated with social engagement. Improvisation is the ability to create new gestures and
      movements spontaneously. Improvisation can be a part of many different art forms. However,
      improvisational movement can also be practiced as a specific dance form. The objective in
      improvisational movement is that choreographed movement is replaced by a cue or prompt that
      allows the possibility for multiple responses. This unique form of dance is especially
      well-suited for people with dementia because it: 1) does not rely heavily on memory of
      repeated movements; 2) can be seamlessly adapted to include sitting, standing, or moving
      around the room; 3) is cognitively challenging; and 4) fosters a social, playful atmosphere.
      Participants seemed to benefit from both the social nature of the class and the movement.
      Therefore, the overall aim of this proposal is to experimentally determine the independent
      and combined effects of dance movement and social engagement on quality of life in people
      with early stage dementia, and test the neural mechanisms of these effects.

      To accomplish this goal, the investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design and randomize 120
      community-dwelling older adults adjudicated as having early-stage dementia of the presumed
      Alzheimer's type to one of four 3-month interventions: 1) Dance Group, 2) Non-group Dance, 3)
      Social Group, or 4) No Contact Control.

      It is not hypothesized that dance affects the underlying disease course, and therefore no
      improvement is expected in cognition.

    <measure>Change in quality of life in participants with dementia using the QOL-AD</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported quality of life in the person with dementia is the primary outcome and will be measured using the QOL-AD . The QOL-AD is validated for use in people with Mini Mental State Exam scores as low as 10.The QOL_AD contains 13 items.Points are assigned to each item as follows: poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, excellent = 4.The total score is the sum of all 13 item (range 13- 52) higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in overall mobility using the Expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB). The SPPB is a brief test of global mobility function with excellent test-retest and inter-examiner reliability; is sensitive to change; is safe, and is a robust predictor of future physical disability and death. To avoid ceiling effects, investigators will use an expanded version (eSPPB) that increases the difficulty of the standing balance task by asking participants to hold postures for 30 instead of 10 seconds, adds a one-leg stand, and adds a narrow walk. The resulting score is normally distributed, continuous, and shows greater sensitivity to change. Dementia patients have lower scores on the SPPB so a favorable outcome for this outcome measure would be a significantly higher score post treatment. The test is 3 sections each on scales of 0-4 with a total score scale of 0-12 with 12 being the best possible outcome.</description>

    <description>The Dance Group will participate in 1-hour group improvisational dance lessons 2x/week for 12 weeks. Improvisational dance classes are grounded in 4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging: non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non-group Dance</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Non-group dance intervention is designed to capture the same dance movement and auditory stimuli as the group class without social interaction. Recordings of the dance instructor teaching a dance class will be played. This will ensure participants hear comparable music and receive comparable verbal auditory cues to prompt dance movements that students in the group class will hear, without interacting with other people. Improvisational dance is particularly suited for this means of delivery because the primary method of instruction is verbal auditory cueing. Participants will be asked to follow the same schedule as participants in the Dance Group arm and complete 2 one-hour dance sessions each week.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Social Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The social group will consist of improvisational party games to foster curiosity and playfulness, use imagery, and encourage non-judgment. Games that may be used include 'Balderdash', 'Wise and Otherwise', 'Charades', 'Pictionary', and 'Tell Me A Story' cards. These games will also use the same core strategies as the dance group. Games will be varied within an hour-long session to incorporate pacing and variability into the social group, akin to the dance group. The social group will occur 2x/week for 1 hour each time and be led by the same instructors who lead the Dance Group, to control for effects of personality of the group leader.</description>

    <description>Active imagination refers to working with imagery and is crucial in improvisatory practice. Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the motor imagination. Variability means the improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. Within an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced. Pacing is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or anticipation to address the motor problem.</description>

    <intervention_name>Non-Group Dance</intervention_name>
    <description>The caregiver will be asked to stay in the area while the subject is dancing. A video camera will be affixed in an upper corner of the room to record individual dance sessions. This recording will yield data that a trained student or staff member can view and code to document movement fidelity (e.g., that the person has responded to the dance prompts and for the purpose of comparing the amount of quality of movements that occur in individual vs. group dance settings). For the first two sessions, study staff would observe the full dance session from outside the room to be sure that instruction was clear and adherence was attained, and that no safety issues arise.</description>
