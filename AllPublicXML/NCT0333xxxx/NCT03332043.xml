  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled clinical pilot trial will evaluate the effects associated with
      in-office use of closed-loop, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology (High-resolution,
      relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring; HIRREM), compared with acoustic
      stimulation not linked to brainwaves (ambient nature sounds), for participants with
      pre-hypertension. Data collection will occur at baseline, and at intervals after completion
      of the intervention. Outcomes include blood pressure, measures of autonomic cardiovascular
      regulation, behavioral symptom outcomes, quality of life, alcohol use, and functional
      performance measures. The primary outcome will be change in blood pressure from baseline to
      4-6 weeks after intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single site, controlled, pilot clinical trial, to evaluate the
      effects of in-office use of a closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neurotechnology
      (High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring; HIRREM), compared
      with acoustic stimulation not linked to brainwaves (ambient nature sounds). Assuming a
      potential drop-out rate of 20%, up to 24 subjects will be enrolled to achieve a goal of
      having at least 20 subjects (10 per group) complete the study, per protocol. Patients who
      have blood pressures between 120-139 mm/Hg systolic, and/or 80-89 mm/Hg diastolic, as
      documented by their health care providers on two separate occasions, and no other exclusions,
      will be randomly assigned to receive either 8-16 sessions of either acoustic stimulation
      linked to brainwave activity (HCC), or acoustic stimulation not linked to brainwave activity
      (NCC), over a maximum of 4 weeks, with both groups continuing their current care throughout.
      There will be pre- and post-intervention data collection to include systolic and diastolic
      BP, and many secondary outcome measures including measures of autonomic cardiovascular
      regulation (continuous recording of BP and HR for calculation of measure of HRV and BRS),
      behavioral symptom outcomes (ISI, PSQI, ESS, CES-D, GAD-7, PCL-C, PSS), quality of life
      measure (QOLS), alcohol use (Audit C), and function performance measures (drop stick reaction
      testing, and grip strength). All measures will be collected at an enrollment visit (V1), and
      the intervention will begin 1-14 days later. BP and HR recordings will also be repeated prior
      to the start of the 7th session. Post-intervention data collections will be obtained at 1-7
      days (V2), 4-6 weeks (V3, primary outcome), and 12-14 weeks (V4) following completion of the
      intervention. The primary outcome will be differential change in the systolic and diastolic
      BP from V1 to V3. Additional follow up (V4) will evaluate durability of effects. Following
      V4, those in the NCC group will be offered the opportunity to cross over to receive a course
      of HCC, and will continue to be followed for data collections at 1-7 days (V5), 4-6 weeks
      (V6), and 12-14 weeks (V7) after completing their crossover HCC sessions. Linear mixed models
      (LMMs) will be used to contrast longitudinal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      between the HCC and NCC groups. Mean contrasts will be used to compare the changes in blood
      pressures between groups from V1 to V3, our primary test of efficacy. Additional mean
      contrasts will be constructed to evaluate the consistency of any benefit of HIRREM through
      subsequent visits beyond V3. Comparisons of changes in all secondary outcomes will be
      assessed in a similar fashion.

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a ten-item psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale, with answers rated from 0-4, also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.</description>

Topics include different components of daily life such as relationships, community engagement, personal fulfillment, and recreation. Each item is scaled from 1 to 7 and a sum score is calculated to represent higher levels of satisfaction in life (range is 16-112).</description>

    <description>The AUDIT-C is a short, 3-item alcohol screening for hazardous drinkers or active alcohol use disorders. This measure consists of 3 questions to assess an individual's alcohol use. Each question has five possible answers ranging from of 0-4 with a total scoring scale of 0-12. A total score of 3 or more in women and a score of four or more in men is suggestive of hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. This form is modified from the longer, 10-item AUDIT instrument.</description>

    <measure>Reaction Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Data used for analysis of secondary outcome is collected at the enrollment visit, 1-7 days after the intervention is completed, 4-6 weeks after the intervention is completed, and 12-14 weeks after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Reaction testing will be evaluated by a drop-stick, clinical reaction time apparatus. It is constructed from a meter stick covered in friction tape with gradations. The modified meter stick is fixed to a weighted rubber cylinder. The apparatus is placed between the thumb and index finger of the subject and released at a random time during a countdown. The subject catches the apparatus and the distance fallen (cm) is converted to reaction. Following two practice trials, subjects perform eight trials, and a mean distance value is used for analysis. This is repeated with a second set of 8 trials later during the enrollment visit, and the mean distance value from the second trial will be used as the baseline value. Use of the average distance from the second set of trials will be used as the baseline value so as to avoid the impact of learning effect for this test.</description>
