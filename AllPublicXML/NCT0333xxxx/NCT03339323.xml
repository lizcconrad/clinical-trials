  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common operations in orthopedics. After
      surgery, the decline of bone mineral density and muscle mass was proved, oral bisphosphonate
      is commonly used to prevent BMD loss in clinic treatment, however, the loss of muscle mass
      can only be maintained with exercise intervention. The goals of TKA rehabilitation should be
      based on control pain, improve ambulation, maximize the range of motion, develop muscle
      strength, and provide emotional support. We planned to find out a potential adjuvant
      effective option in muscle mass for the management of post-TKA. Literature suggested that
      exercise training has been found to have the considerable effect on TKA. However, no suitable
      exercise prescription was established on the scientific basis. The current study aimed to
      find out a potential treatment mode.

      Study Rationale:

      This project will be performed for consecutive three years, the patients with post-TKA
      patients are managed with the treadmill exercise training in the first year. In the second
      year, resistance exercise is prescribed. In the third year, eccentric exercise plus
      resistance training will be arranged in the exercise group. We will analyze the data of the
      three years and cross-comparative analysis. A prescription of exercise training, a period of
      24 weeks each year, 3 times a week, for each 10 minutes warm-up, 40 minutes exercise
      training, and 10-minute cool down for exercise prescription

      Study Objectives:

      To investigate the effect of long-term exercise training, eccentric and resistance exercise
      on muscle mass in patients with total knee arthroplasty. To monitor the performance index
      included: physiological indices, muscle mass, ambulation and the quality of life index.

      Study Design Duration of Treatment: Total of 6-month exercise intervention in each year. The
      number of Planned Patients: 35 subjects in each control and exercise group in one year, the
      total of 210 subjects in three years.

      Investigational Product: Automated biochemistry analyzer, Biospace Inbody 7.20 Analysis of
      body composition instrumentation; Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometer (DEXA), isokinetic muscle
      strength measurement, VICON to analysis ambulation, functional fitness, the questionnaire
      including SF-36, KOOS and VAS pain score.

      Endpoints: Data collection in pre-surgery, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after
      surgery.

    <measure>Change from baseline muscle mass</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle mass measurement is measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA measures the muscle mass of the whole body and the measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three months, six months and nine months after the operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline lower extremity muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity muscle strength, including extension and flexion of the hip, knee and ankle were tested by the HUMAC NORM system (CSMi, Stoughton, MA) with the eccentric/concentric contraction mode at an angular velocity of 60 degrees/s.Isokinetic tests were performed five times for each participant, and each test was separated by a rest period of 3 min. The participants are assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up and received verbal encouragement during the exertion of peak torque.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline SF-36 questionnaire assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. Eight sections including physical function, role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to emotional problems, and mental health. Additionally, the eight health domains can be used to provide a physical component summary and mental component summary score. The outcome measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline KOOS questionnaire assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; three month ; six month and nine month after operation; twelve-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS contains 5 subscales with a total of 42 items: 1) pain, 2) other symptoms, 3) function in daily living (ADL), 4) function in sport and recreation and 5) knee-related quality of life. Each question receives a score from 0 to 4 and the scores are transformed to a 0-100 score (0, extreme symptoms, 100, no symptoms). The User's Guide, is available from www.koos.nu. The outcome measurement is assessed at pre-operation, three month, six month and nine month after operation, and twelve-month follow-up.</description>
