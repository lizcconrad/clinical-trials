  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is urgent to make evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for military personnel readily
      accessible in order to meet the growing demand for effective and efficient treatment for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a timely manner. Effective EBTs for PTSD are
      available, but barriers to accessing care can deter military personnel from receiving
      treatment. Web-treatments represent an innovative way to overcome these barriers. The
      efficacy of previously developed web-treatments for PTSD appear promising, however, they are
      not based on treatment protocols with strong empirical support for their efficacy. No study
      to date has examined web-treatment of PTSD using a well-established treatment program.

      The purpose of this open trial is to examine the efficacy of 10 sessions of a web-version of
      Prolonged Exposure (PE), &quot;Web-PE,&quot; delivered over 8-weeks in 40 active-duty military
      personnel and veterans with PTSD who deployed post 9-11. Up to 60 individuals will be
      consented to obtain data from 40 for analysis. Participants will be assessed at pre-treatment
      and 1- and 3-months after treatment completion.
