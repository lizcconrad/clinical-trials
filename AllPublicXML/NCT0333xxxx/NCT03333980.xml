      A non-interventional observational clinical study to document the clinical course of patients
      at 12 months or more following an ischaemic stroke
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      To document and better define the prognostic characteristics of residual disability 12 months
      or more following an ischaemic stroke in patients that originally participated in the
      preceding clinical study RN-CS-0001.

      Other objective:

      To inform the design of efficient Phase 2/3 studies when screening potentially efficacious
      interventions for signals of activity which merit further development.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capacity to give informed consent or witnessed informed consent in the event that the
             patient is unable to sign informed consent due to physical impairments.

          -  Participation in the preceding study RN-CS-0001

          -  Completion of at least one of the 4 functional assessment tests (ARAT, BI, NIHSS, mRS)
             at any time point on the previous study RN-CS-0001

          -  Ability to participate in all assessments and attend all visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any additional incidence of stroke (Ischaemic or Haemorrhagic) since participation in
             the previous study RN-CS-0001 (since the last CS-0001 assessment visit date).

          -  Incidence of significant other disease that judged by the investigator would confound
             completion of all functional assessments (not excluding patients that can complete at
             least one functional assessment with no confounding factor from significant other
             disease).
