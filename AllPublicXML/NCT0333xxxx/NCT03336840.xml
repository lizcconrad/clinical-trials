  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness on the
      clinical and biological parameters of reproductive-aged PCOS women after a 12-week metformin
      and/or probiotics administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live bacteria that offer a health benefit to the host when administered in
      adequate amounts. Probiotic supplementation is safe for use and has demonstrated beneficial
      effects for metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. In this study, about 90
      reproductive-aged women with PCOS will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned
      into one of the following three groups: Metformin tablets (0.5g tid po), ProMetS probiotics
      powder (4g qN po), Metformin tablets (0.5g tid po) and ProMetS probiotics powder (4g qN po),
      for 12 weeks. Blood and stool samples will be collected before and after treatment. Fasting
      glucose levels, fasting insulin levels, sex hormone levels, serum lipid profiles,
      inflammation markers, other metabolic related parameters and change of gut microbiota and
      immune cells will be evaluated.
