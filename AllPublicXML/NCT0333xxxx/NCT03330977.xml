  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this study is to assess the efficiency of NOVATEX MEDICAL pressure garments in
      patients with an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).

      To answer this objectif a comparison before/after use of pressure garments will be performed
      for all patients.

      Inclusion period: 1 year Follow-up period: 26 months Study period : 38 months

      Patient visits will be organized as follow:

        -  V0: first visit at inclusion, clinical evaluation

        -  V1: 4 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation without pressure garments and presure
           garments prescription

        -  V2: 8 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with pressure garments

        -  V3: 14 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with pressure garments

        -  V4: 20 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with pressure garments

        -  V5: 26 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with pressure garments

      Only the first two visits are specific to the study to be able to compare before and after
      the use of pressure garments. Next visits are the usual visits (every 6 months) for the use
      of pressure garments in patients with an EDS.

    <measure>Improvement of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale from 4 months at 8 months</measure>
    <time_frame>month 4, month 8</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18- Item of physical, psychological and social function.
The FIM uses the level of assistance an individual needs to grade the functional status of a person.
For each item, disability level is coded from 1 (Total Assistance or not Testable) to 7 (Complete Independence) A total score is calculated using an addition of all items. Thus, score ranges are [18;126]. More the score is high, better is the independence.
The proportion of patients who present an improvement of 10% of the FIM score between 4 months and 8 months will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution of Pain (before and after pressure garments using)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, month 4, month 8, month 14, month 20, month 26</time_frame>
    <description>Pain evolution using the VAS scale (from 0=no pain to 100=worst imaginable pain) The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.
For each visit, proportion of patients who present a decrease of at least 30% of pain score from inclusion, or a pain score &lt;= 2, will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of Tiredness from inclusion at each visit (4 months, 8 months, 14 months, 20 months, 26 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, month 4, month 8, month 14, month 20, month 26</time_frame>
    <description>Tiredness evolution using Pichot scale Eight items are coded from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little 2 = moderately 3 = much 4 = extremely).
Lower is the score, better is the patient tiredness
For each visit, proportion of patients who present a decrease of at least 30% of Pichot score from inclusion, or a pichot score &lt; 20, will be calculated.</description>

Lower is the score, better is the patient status
For each visit, proportion of patients who present a decrease of at least 30% of HAD score from inclusion, or a HAD score &lt; 14, will be calculated.</description>
