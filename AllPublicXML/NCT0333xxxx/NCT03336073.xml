  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, phase II randomized controlled study that will evaluate
      the efficacy of carfilzomib and dexamethasone in combination with cyclophosphamide in R/R MM
      patients.

      For this purpose, R/R MM patients that have received 1-3 prior lines of therapy, and who are
      not primary refractory or refractory to proteasome inhibitors will be randomized to receive:

        -  Experimental arm: carfilzomib at a dose of 70 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2 only in the first
           infusion) intravenously (iv) on days 1, 8, and 15, dexamethasone by mouth (po) at a dose
           of 20 mg (10 mg for patients &gt;75 years) days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 and cyclophosphamide
           at a dose of 300 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8 and 15, in 28 days cycles; or

        -  Control arm: the same treatment but without cyclophosphamide. Patients older than 75
           years will receive in both arms carfilzomib at a dose of 56 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2 only in the
           first infusion) during the cycles 1 and 2.

      If tolerability is acceptable, the dose could be increased up to 70 mg/m2 since the cycle 3.

      Treatment will be continued until progression, unacceptable toxicity or investigator or
      patient decision.

      Treatment will consist of 28-days cycles with:

        -  Arm 1 (experimental arm):

             -  Carfilzomib administered iv at a dose of 70 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2 only in the first
                infusion) iv on days 1, 8 and 15.

             -  Dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg po (10 mg for patients &gt;75 years) days 1, 2, 8, 9,
                15 and 16.

             -  Cyclophosphamide at a dose of 300 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8 and 15

        -  Arm 2 (control arm):

             -  Carfilzomib administered iv at a dose of 70 mg/m2 (20 mg/m2 only in the first
                infusion) iv on days 1, 8, and 15.

             -  Dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg po (10 mg for patients &gt;75 years) days 1, 2, 8, 9,
                15 and 16.

      Patients older than 75 years will receive in both arms carfilzomib at a dose of 56 mg/m2 (20
      mg/m2 only in the first infusion) during the cycles 1 and 2.

      If tolerability is acceptable, the dose could be increased up to 70 mg/m2 since the cycle 3.

      Treatments will be administered until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.
      Carfilzomib and cyclophosphamide will be provided by the sponsor. Dexamethasone may be
      utilized per a site's standard practice and will not be provided by the sponsor.
