  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions in
      increasing the acceptability and knowledge of the HPV vaccine among females ages 12 through
      26. Subjects will be randomized to one of three study arms (no intervention, viewing an
      educational video or reading an educational handout) and then a questionnaire will be
      administered to assess knowledge and acceptability of the HPV vaccine. Subject charts will be
      reviewed to assess for initiation of the HPV vaccine.
