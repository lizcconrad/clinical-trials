  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this continued access study is to allow ongoing treatment of subjects
      at selected investigational sites while the marketing application for the ReCell® Autologous
      Cell Harvesting Device is under FDA review. This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm
      observational study to evaluate the safety and clinical performance of the ReCell® device
      when used as an adjunct to meshed autografts in patients with acute thermal burn injuries
      requiring skin grafting for closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients 5 years or older with a total body surface area (TBSA) thermal burn injury between 5
      and 50% (inclusive) who require autografting will be considered for participation in this
      study. RES (Regenerative Epithelial Suspension) derived from the use of the ReCell® device
      will be applied over skin grafts meshed more widely than conventional autografting. Healing,
      scar outcomes, pain and treatment-related adverse events will be evaluated at follow-up
      visits. Data concerning the clinical performance and safety of the ReCell device will be
      collected. Safety will be evaluated in terms of treatment and serious related adverse events.

      Each subject will participate in up to 7 total visits (treatment visit and 6 follow-up study
      visits) over a period of 24 weeks. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled and treated within this
      study at up to 15 institutions.

      It is anticipated that enrollment will continue until PMA approval. Subject follow-up will
      continue until the last enrolled subject completes the 24-week visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject requires skin grafting as a result of an acute thermal burn injury (i.e.,
             injuries caused by exposure of the skin to fire/flames, excessive heat, hot steam or
             water).

          2. The area of total burn injury is 5-50% TBSA inclusive.

          3. Area(s) requiring skin grafting at least 320 square centimeters.

          4. The subject is at least 5 years of age.

          5. The subject (or family, for those under 18 years of age) is willing and able to
             complete all follow-up evaluations required by the study protocol.

          6. The subject is to abstain from any other treatment of the wound(s) for the duration of
             the study unless medically necessary.

          7. The subject agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other interventional clinical
             trial for the duration of the study.

          8. The subject and/or guardian are able to read and understand instructions and give
             informed, voluntary, written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject's burn injuries were caused by chemicals, electricity, and/or radioactive
             substances.

          2. The subject is unable to follow the protocol.

          3. The subject has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             may compromise patient safety or study objectives.

          4. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation (Hartmann's) solution.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women.
