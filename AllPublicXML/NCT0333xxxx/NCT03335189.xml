  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Advanced Symptom Monitoring and Management System - Canada (ASyMS-Can) is a remote
      phone-based symptom management system that prompts patient self-care and clinician telephone
      triage and intervention based on alerts for managing cancer treatment side effects such as
      nausea and vomiting, fatigue, etc. ASyMS-Can is an android phone-based application that is
      given to patients to self-report their symptoms using a patient reported outcome symptom
      questionnaire and level of severity daily, on a secure mobile android phone, from home or
      outside of clinics. Based on back-end computations, patients receive automated self-care
      notifications on their mobile phones with advice on self-care for mild to moderate severe
      symptoms. The system also in the case of severe symptoms will alert the designated clinic
      nurse to prompt electronic telephone triage and intervention (yellow alert response in 8
      hours or within 30 minutes for severe symptoms-red alert).

    <description>Data reported by the participants will be sent to a secure, encrypted clinical central server hosting the risk-alerting algorithms. The web interfaces will provide a clinical portal for the nurses to screen and follow any alerts being triggered, as well as review patient-specific information. Based on these back-end computations, participants will receive automated self-care notifications on their mobile phones. If incoming symptom reports indicate severe adverse effects a designated clinic nurse will receive an 'amber alert', or 'red alert', that will require response within 30 minutes. Nurses will handle alerts during business hours (9 am to 5 pm). After-hour alerts will be sent to the oncologist or nursing supervisor on call as per usual care. Patients will be instructed that clinicians will not receive alerts during the evening hours or night and instructed to follow usual practice of contacting their family physician, or oncologist on call, or call 911, as required.</description>
