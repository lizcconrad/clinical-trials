      A transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET ) tube was inserted into mid-gut through the nasal
      orifice and fixed on the pylorus wall by one tiny titanium endoscopic clip under anesthesia.
      This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of TET in mid-gut .

      In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained appeal as a therapeutic
      option worldwide. Traditionally, microbiota can be administered through the upper-gut, the
      mid-gut, and the lower-gut pathways. FMT via colonoscopy is a classic approach, but in our
      previous study on ulcerative colitis, those patients have difficulty to maintain the infused
      microbiota suspension for enough time through this way. Thus, the investigators designed the
      colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) technology, which made whole-colon
      administration of treatment and repeat FMTs possible. However, some patients are resistant to
      undergo bowel preparation for colonoscopy or some are not suitable for colonic delivering
      way. Therefore, mid-gut delivering way is an important option for those patients. In previous
      researches on FMT for Crohn's disease, patients and physician faced the similar problem that
      some patients need repeat FMT during hospitalization, and some may need enteral nutrition at
      the same time. In order to have a quicker and more convenient placement of
      mid-gut/nasal-jejunal TET tube than traditional methods, the investigators designed a novel
      mid-gut TET technique without further confirmation for the location of tube in gut by X-ray
      or other medical devices after the endoscopic procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the
      feasibility, safety, and value of the mid-gut TET technique.
