  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to compare Vitamin C
      versus placebo for patients presenting to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a regimen
      of moderate-dose (6000 mg per day) Vitamin C supplementation versus placebo for the treatment
      of patients presenting to the ICU with septic shock. Both groups will continue to receive all
      other standard of care measures for septic shock as clinically indicated. Groups will be
      enrolled and receive study drug/placebo for 4 days (96 hours) or until 24 hours post-last
      pressor dose, whichever is sooner.

    <description>SOFA score is a mortality prediction score that is based on the degree of dysfunction of 6 organ systems. Minimum, mean, and maximum could be used in data analysis of change. The higher the SOFA score, the higher the likely mortality.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>APACHE score is a severity-of-disease classification system that is calculated from a patient's age and 12 routine physiological measurements. Minimum, mean, and maximum could be used in data analysis of change but an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death.</description>
