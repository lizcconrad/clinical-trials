  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is defined as the spontaneous movement of the limbs (mainly
      legs) associated with unpleasant - painful sensation which is relieved by moving the affected
      limb. It is a common disorder in hemodialysis patients that leads to insomnia, impaired
      daytime functioning and quality of life. Symptoms of RLS are estimated to affect up to 25% of
      patients on dialysis when the international RLS diagnostic criteria are applied. Various
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used to treat primary RLS.
      However, the evidence for use of these interventions in people with End stage renal disease
      is not well established; and some have serious side effects. Because high oxidative stress
      has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RLS, investigators thought of evaluating the
      efficacy of vitamin C in reducing the severity of RLS symptoms in hemodialysis patients in
      this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm parallel trial. To note that only
      two studies were done worldwide that proved the efficacy of vitamin C in those patients.

      The investigators are proposing to carry out a clinical trial. Around 100 stable hemodialysis
      adult patients at Makassed general hospital dialysis center and around 150 patients at Sahel
      general hospital and Zahraa hospital will be assessed according to the international RLS
      criteria. The data on individual, clinical and laboratory indices will be obtained from
      patients' recorded files and interviews. The investigators will compare the RLS group versus
      the non RLS group according to these factors to find the independently associated factors for
      RLS in dialysis patients.

      Those who fulfill all four diagnostic criteria for RLS (confirmed independently by 2
      neurologists) will be classified as &quot;RLS positive&quot; and will be asked to answer 10 questions
      on the international RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. The IRLSSG rating scale was also
      used to evaluate the severity of RLS symptoms. These patients will be randomly allocated to
      two parallel groups to receive vitamin C (200 mg) or placebo for eight weeks.
