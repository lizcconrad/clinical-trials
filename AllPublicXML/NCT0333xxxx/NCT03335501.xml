  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings.

      The objective of this pilot study is to inform both the decision whether to conduct a
      confirmatory study and the design of the larger confirmatory trial. In addition, we want to
      estimate postprandial glucose levels parameters and confidence interval in an 11-hour
      in-patient study with standardized conditions in adults with type 1 diabetes, estimate the
      size and direction of the treatment effect.

      Faster insulin Aspart (FiAsp) will provide preliminary evidence of efficacy to regulate
      postprandial glucose levels compared to rapid-acting Aspart in adults with type 1 diabetes
      using insulin pump therapy.

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at IRCM at 9:30. An intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm or a hand vein for blood sampling purposes. A cartridge containing rapid-acting Aspart or faster acting Aspart will be placed in the insulin pump. Closed-loop strategy will start at 10:00 until 21:00. A glucose sensor reading will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The computer will generate a recommendation for the basal rates of insulin delivery. Pumps' parameters will then be changed manually to implement the computer generated recommendations.
At 12:00, a lunch meal will be served. An insulin bolus will be given 15 minutes before the meal. At 17:00, a dinner meal will be served. As recommended, an insulin bolus will be given at the time of the meal. Each subject will ingest the same meals during both visits.
Venous blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Blood samples will be taken every 20 minutes.</description>
