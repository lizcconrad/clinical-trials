    <textblock>
      A specific scale allowing the measure of anxiety of patients with protate cancer has been
      designed and validated but the French version needs to be validated. This study aims at
      validating the French translation of this scale.

    <textblock>
      The psychological difficulties encountered by patients with prostate cancer are widely known.
      There are, however, problems in the identification of certain disorders that require
      appropriate psychological management. In order to diagnose patients with anxiety more finely,
      a prostate cancer-specific anxiety measurement scale (MAX-PC) was developed and validated.
      This scale includes three sub-dimensions: anxiety related to prostate cancer, anxiety related
      to the PSA assessment and fear of recurrence. This scale generally has good psychometric
      properties which are found in different populations and in different countries. The
      dimensions of the MAX-PC correlate with other anxiety measurement scales such as Beck or
      HADS, but do not show redundancy: it captures a specific anxiety related to the experience of
      patients with prostate cancer.

      To date, this sclae is not validated in French, and its use in the frame of clinical trials
      or in routine practice require a first validation.

    <measure>Total anxiety score assessed by the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is divided in 3 subscales: Prostate cancer Anxiety ; PSA anxiety and Fear of Recurrence. The total score of the scale ranges from 0 to 54, with 54 indicating maximum anxiety. Scores of the Prostate anxiety scale range from 0 to 33 ; with 33 indicating maximum anxiety. Scores of the PSA anxiety scale range from 0 to 9 ; with 9 indicating maximum anxiety. Score of the Fear of Recurrence scale range from 0 to 12; with 12 indicating maximum anxiety. The total score is the sum of the 3 subscales scores.</description>

    <time_frame>At inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF12), is a multipurpose generic measure oh health status. The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health.
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100 where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The scores for anxiety can range from 0 to 21, depending on the presence and severity of the symptom. Patients with a score higher than 7 are detected as having at least mild anxiety.</description>
