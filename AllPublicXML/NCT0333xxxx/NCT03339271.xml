  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and cost of technology-enhanced
      transitional palliative care on family caregivers who provide care to a loved one at home
      after a hospitalization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two groups in this randomized control study: technology-enhanced group and
      usual care group. The total amount of subjects includes both the palliative care recipients
      and the family caregivers (both the patients and their family caregiver will sign informed
      consent.)

      A family caregiver is broadly defined as the person self-identified as the family member or
      unpaid friend who is the primary informal caregiver for a patient with a terminal illness.
      The family caregiver may or may not be a member of the patient's nuclear family.

      For the technology-enhanced group, the study nurse experienced in palliative care will have a
      visit with the caregiver within the first 24 hours after consent, and have daily visits with
      the caregiver as long as the patient is still in the hospital. During these visits, the nurse
      will talk to the caregiver about their own self-care needs, begin transitional care planning,
      and develop Readiness Plans to anticipate care giving needs the caregiver may have when they
      return home.

      For the technology-enhanced group, the caregiver will take an iPad home so that the study
      team nurse can video chat with them. The iPad will need to be returned upon completion of the
      study. The study nurse will have a video chat with the caregiver at home within 24-48 hours
      of discharge from the hospital, and at least weekly for 8 weeks after that. The caregiver and
      the study nurse may also decide to have other calls on the phone during this time.

      For the usual care group, doctors and nurses along with input from the Palliative Care
      service will help the caregiver make a plan for discharge from the hospital and for taking
      care of the patient upon return home. Someone from the study team will call the caregiver
      once a week to check in for the first 8 weeks after the caregiver and patient return home
      from the hospital.

      Both groups will be asked to complete questionnaires before starting the study, and then up
      to seven more times over the course of 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Preparedness for Caregiving Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale captures how well family caregivers feel they are prepared for the multiple aspects of the caregiving role, using a 4-point response set ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very well&quot;). A mean score is calculated; higher scores indicate greater preparation for caregiving.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Communication with Physicians Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Communication with Physicians scale will be used to measure the communication skills of the family caregiver. Originally designed for chronic disease self-management behavior, the scale has 3 questions targeting how often the family caregiver prepares a list of questions for the doctor, asks questions, and discusses personal problems across a 6-point response set ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always.&quot; Scores range from 0-5 with higher scores indicating better communication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) will be used to obtain family caregiver perceptions of the quality of chronic illness care received by the care recipient. The PACIC was originally developed to measure patients' perspectives of the care they had received for their chronic illness, based on best practices as described in the Chronic Care Model. The PACIC consists of 20 questions with 5 subscales: (1) activation, (2) delivery system design, (3) collaborative goal setting, (4) problem-solving, and (5) follow-up/coordination. Scoring is a total mean score and a mean score for each subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Quality of Life Scale - Cancer (CQOL-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Quality of Life Scale - Cancer (CQOL-C) will be used to measure the family caregiver's quality of life. The CQOL-C is a 35-item self-report measure of the impact on the caregiver's physical, emotional and spiritual well-being and on the relationship with the care recipient. Scores range from 0-140; higher scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale-Revised (BCOS-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale-Revised (BCOS-R) will be used to measure the burden placed on the family caregiver in caring for their loved ones. The BCOS-R contains 15 items that measure changes as indicators of the effect of caregiving on caregivers' lives. The response set uses a 7-point Likert scale that ranges from &quot;changed for the worst&quot; to &quot;changed for the best.&quot; Higher scores indicate more positive caregiver outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Post Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale (PDCDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Post Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale (PDCDS) is an 11-item scale used to measure the degree of difficulty in coping with stress, recovery, self-care and management of medical needs, help and emotional support needed, confidence in self-care and medical management abilities, and adjustment after hospital discharge. The items are measured on an 11-point rating scale with higher scores indicating greater coping difficulty. The family caregivers will rate the items on a scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;extremely, completely, or a great deal&quot;). The PDCDS is reliable whether self-administered or completed by interview. The instrument measures important, yet often overlooked, factors that contribute to poor post-acute recovery experiences, which are recognized as important factors likely to impact readmission and Emergency Department (ED) visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10). The CESD-10 has been used as a screening tool for depression in studies with elderly patients as well as patients with chronic conditions. The correlation between this instrument and the original CESD, which had 20 items, is high. The CESD-10 reliability statistics are comparable to those for the original CESD. Higher scores indicate greater depressed mood. Scores of 10 or greater indicate clinically significant depression.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Third Party Expenditures at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Ambulatory and Home Care Record (AHCR) will be used as the healthcare cost measure. The AHCR is designed to capture costs from a societal perspective, implying that costs from all stakeholders (family care giver, care recipients, and health systems) will be collected.The AHCR captures self-reported utilization and cost information for care provided by all family care givers and other unpaid caregivers, paid care received at home (e.g., home health care) and outside of the home (e.g., doctor/therapy appointments),as well as medications, supplies, and equipment. Out-of-pocket costs refer to all care-related expenses not paid for by the insurance.</description>
