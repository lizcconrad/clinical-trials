  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individual and societal cost of alcohol use disorders (TUAL), present in 10% of the
      population in France, is considerable. Despite psychotherapeutic and drug addiction
      treatment, the relapse rate remains very high, partly because of their very frequent
      cognitive disorders. In fact, more than 75% of TUAL patients present to varying degrees
      neuropsychological alterations that are only rarely detected and never treated. However,
      these cognitive disorders limit the benefit of psychotherapeutic care, reduce compliance with
      pharmacological treatments and hinder the patient's ability to change his behavior with
      respect to alcohol. An innovative way to promote the maintenance of the therapeutic contract,
      and therefore to reduce alcohol consumption in these patients, would be to improve their
      cognitive functioning. The objective of this study is to measure the efficacy of a non-drug
      treatment, based on a specific and personalized cognitive remediation program, compared to a
      standard treatment in Day Hospitalization, in order to reduce the rate of relapse very high
      in TUAL. It is a randomized, single-blind study with two parallel groups of patients with
      post-weaning neuropsychological disorders: REMED (cognitive remediation) and CONTROL (usual
      care).

    <description>The innovative nature of this cognitive remediation program is that it integrates both neuropsychological psychoeducation, the principles of reeducation of altered cognitive functions and the setting in addictological context benefiting from the interactions of the group situation. Thus, during the three months of REMED management, six modules corresponding to six altered cognitive domains. The REMED group will benefit from cognitive remediation of episodic memory disorders, executive and attentional functions, and the theory of the mind integrating psychoeducation, training and systematic situations related to an alcoholic context.</description>

    <description>The innovative nature of this program is that it integrates both neuropsychological psychoeducation, the principles of reeducation of altered cognitive functions and the setting in addictological context benefiting from the interactions of the group situation. Thus, during the three months of REMED management, six modules corresponding to six altered cognitive domains that may have an impact on the maintenance of the therapeutic contract will be offered to patients. The REMED group will benefit from cognitive remediation of episodic memory disorders, executive and attentional functions, and the theory of the mind integrating psychoeducation, training and systematic situations related to an alcoholic context. The different procedures of neuropsychological management (facilitation, use of preserved capacities and compensation) will help to integrate the concepts and addictological strategies necessary to maintain the therapeutic contract taking into account cognitive impairments.</description>
