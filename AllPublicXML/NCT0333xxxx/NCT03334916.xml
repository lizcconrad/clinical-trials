      The study has planned 4 visits during 2 weeks period (1 week of screening period, 1 week of

      visit. After the screening period, the final eligibility of the subjects will be assessed at
      the randomization visit. Subjects who are determined to be appropriate for this study will be
      allocated to experimental group(YMC026) or control group(placebo) randomly in a 1:1 ratio.
      Subject will be administered the investigational product daily for 6 days. The safety for the
      subjects will be assessed at Day 3 and Day 6 visit, and the efficacy evaluation will be
