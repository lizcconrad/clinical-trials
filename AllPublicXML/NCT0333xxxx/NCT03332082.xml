  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic relapse occurs in almost 80% of Orthodontic Treatment. The only prevention to
      phenomenon is the use of fixed retainers or life time active retention. Unfortunately,
      patients do not comply and after a year of treatment, many stop wearing their retainers and
      Orthodontic relapse occurs.

      The aim of this project is to prospectively analyze the treatment result of consecutive
      treated patients who have had active orthodontic relapse. 20 patients will be recruited
      through advertisement to the Department of Orthodontics at the University of Alabama at
      Birmingham (UAB). The sample will comprise of 20 patients with Class I malocclusions. The
      records to be collected will comprise of clinical pictures and pre and post study casts. The
      3D study casts will be evaluated using the Little's Index. The results will be analyzed with
      the paired t-test and ANOVA, using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS/STATÂ®) software.

    <description>Orthodontic Tooth positioners treatment have been used in the Orthodontic Industry for many years. These positioners are used for small minor movements to complete the final smile. These positioners are made from a biocompatible and FDA approved clear silicone material after the teeth have been set to the final position.</description>
