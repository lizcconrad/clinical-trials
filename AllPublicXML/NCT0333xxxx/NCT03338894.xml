    <textblock>
      IBD adds additional stressors as a chronic disease that has unpredictable and sometimes
      embarrassing symptoms to the normal challenges that teenagers face. Stress and how stressful
      events are perceived, may contribute to worsening of disease. Complementary and alternative
      medicine (CAM), are used often by pediatric IBD patients and maybe beneficial in decreasing
      stress and improving quality of life. Yoga could be a well suited paring with standard
      medical therapy to decrease and provide a better sense of control and improve quality of
      life.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 25% of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is diagnosed in the pediatric age
      group, with the peak age of onset in the adolescent years. IBD adds additional stressors of a
      chronic disease with unpredictable and potentially embarrassing symptoms to the expected
      challenges of psychological and social adjustment that teenagers face. Various techniques,
      such as psychotherapy programs and IBD overnight camp experiences, have been studied to
      decrease psychological distress and improve quality of life. Stress, and particularly how
      stressful events are perceived, may play a role in triggering IBD flares. Complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM), especially mind-body techniques are used often by pediatric IBD
      patients and may be beneficial in decreasing stress and improving quality of life (QOL). Yoga
      may be well suited as an adjunct to conventional IBD therapy to decrease stress, provide a
      greater sense of bodily control and improve QOL.

      The primary goal of this project is to determine if a structured Yoga program, in addition to
      standard medical therapy, improves HRQOL in pediatric patients diagnosed with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD). Investigators will also examine if the yoga program improves self
      efficacy, which is a person's belief about their ability to influence events that affect
      their lives. Disease response and remission rates will be followed as well, in order to
      stratify HRQOL outcomes in the yoga group.

      Patients will each serve as their own control and complete questionnaires at enrollment and
      at the start and end of the 12 week group yoga class sessions. They will also complete the
      questionnaires three months after finishing the class sessions. .The program will consist of
      a live group class session over 12 weeks. Baseline and follow-up questionnaires will be used
      to determine there are changes in QOL, self-efficacy, and disease response.

    <description>The number of patients diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel disease that have shown an improved health related quality of life (HRQOL) as assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life survey after a structured yoga program, comparing pre-yoga HRQOL to post-yoga HRQOL. The Peds QOL age related surveys are validated pediatric questionnaires that measure general HRQOL in children ages 8-17 years. They consist of 23 questions in areas of social, school, emotional and physical functioning. The answers are scored on a 5 point scale and then reverse scored and linearly transformed to a scale of 1-100 scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Self Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10 item scale that measures a patient's general sense of perceived self-efficacy, aiming to predict coping with daily life as well as adaptation after stressful life events. The General Self Efficacy Scale is correlated to emotion, optimism, and work satisfaction. Negative coefficients were found for depression, stress, health complaints, burnout and anxiety. The total score is calculated by finding the sum of all item. For the General Self-Efficacy, the total score ranges between 10 to 40, with a higher score indicating more self-efficacy.</description>
