    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective the research study drug,
      pembrolizumab is as a treatment for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who have not previously
      been treated for this disease and are unsuitable for standard treatment (adriamycin,
      bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine ABVD).

      The study is a single arm, open label, phase II, international, multi-centre study. Sample
      size will be 25 evaluable patients with a recruitment period of 2 years. Patients will be
      administered 200mg pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks up to 35 cycles or 2 years. Patients will

             contraception for the patient.

         12. Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception as outlined in Section 7.14 - Contraception, starting with the first

             symptoms (prednisolone 50mg or equivalent for up to 10 doses) or patients with asthma
             or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that require intermittent use of

         11. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of registration. Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are

             meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to registration and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to registration. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis
             which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.
