      The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective the research study drug,
      pembrolizumab is as a treatment for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who have not previously
      been treated for this disease and are unsuitable for standard treatment (adriamycin,
      bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine ABVD).

             contraception for the patient.

         12. Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of registration. Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-MistÂ®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are

             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to registration. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis
             which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.
