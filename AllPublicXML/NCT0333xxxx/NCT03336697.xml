  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact cause of PD remains unknown, but current theories suggest that it results from a
      combination of hereditary or genetic factors (i.e. family traits ) and exposure to unknown
      substances in the environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether toxins
      produced by bacteria that live within the nasal canal (nose) and the intestines of people
      with PD might have a role in causing the disease. The investigators in this study would like
      to look at the types of bacteria that live in the nasal canals and intestines of PD subjects
      and compare them with those of subjects who do not have PD.

    <description>For microbiome analysis, in silico community functional predictions will be performed using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) and significant differences in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog (KO) abundances between groups will be identified. &quot;proinflammatory&quot; and &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; bacteria taxa will be classified and differences in inflammatory metabolite abundance will be compared.</description>

    <description>a nasal swab will be performed by a trained physician by gently passing of a cotton swab in the nasal passage to get samples from middle meatus. This will be performed under guide of nasal anterior endoscopy to visualize the location of sampling. The cotton swab heads will be placed in sterile tubes and frozen at -80Â°C until DNA extraction.</description>
