    <description>For patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC, blood will be collected pre-treatment initiation (baseline), after first chemotherapy cycle, every 8-12 weeks while under treatment to coincide with restaging CT scan and at time of disease progression.</description>
  </arm_group>

    <intervention_name>Blood Draw</intervention_name>
    <description>If clinically safe, up to approximately 50ml of blood will be drawn, not to exceed the following criteria:
Patients and controls weighing 50kg or more
For draw amounts up to 50mL, there is no required hemoglobin threshold.
For amounts exceeding 50mL, patients who meet standard blood banking criteria (e.g., hemoglobin values within normal limits and minimum weight of 50kg) may give as much as a full unit of blood (500mL) at one time or in divided fractions over a 56 day/eight week period.
Patients and controls weighing &lt; 50kg
For patients whose hemoglobin is below normal limits but at least 7.0 gm/dL, no more than a total of 50 ml of blood or 5 ml/kg, whichever is less, may be collected per 56 day/eight week period, but no more than approximately 2 ml/kg of blood at any one time.</description>

      Blood samples will be analyzed for various biomarkers. Initial biomarkers to be tested
      include proteins and proteases, functional DNA repair assays, exosomes, stromal elements,
      circular RNAs (cRNA) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

      Tissue will be utilized from already planned. Biopsy tissue is expected to be available for
      virtually all PDAC patients, occasionally for IPMN and cysts patients, rarely for
      pancreatitis and never for healthy controls.

      <textblock>
        Potential research subjects in the PDAC and benign pancreatic disease cohorts will be
        identified by a member of the patient's treatment team, the principal investigator, or
        research team at participating institutions. If the investigator is a member of the
        treatment team, s/he will screen their patients' medical records for suitable research
        study participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling in the research
        study. The investigator will use information provided by the patient and/or medical record
        to confirm that the patient is eligible and contact the patient regarding study enrollment.
        Healthy controls will be recruited from patients from outpatient primary care clinics at
        non-MSK sites and volunteers from which may include the staffs members at collaborating
        sites.
