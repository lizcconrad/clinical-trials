      The study will collect 100 ⅡA - ⅢA stage non-squamous NSCLC tumor tissue and blood specimens
      (Include: (1) tissue by operation: 3 specimens from different regions of each patient; (2)
      Blood: preoperative blood (within one week), postoperative blood (3-4 weeks after operation
      (before adjuvant chemotherapy), 20 weeks after operation (1 month after adjuvant
      chemotherapy), 1 year after operation). Capture-based sequencing(168 genes panel +UMI) will
      performed. All patients are recommended for &quot;pemetrexed combined platinum&quot; adjuvant
      chemotherapy for 4 cycles(Moderate-dose Chemotherapy) 3-4 weeks after operation. The clinical
      data should be collected until disease progression. The relationship of postoperative ctDNA
      and recurrence defined by clinical imaging will be analyzed, as well as the correlation of
      tissue and postoperative blood NGS results.
