  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EPIC-HF study will test the effectiveness of a patient empowerment and activation for
      optimization of Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) medication plans. Three
      main regional centers in the UCHealth system will participate in a two-arm, randomized study
      design. In this design, each site participates in both control and intervention, with members
      of the sites eligible patient population randomly enrolled in either the intervention or the
      control arm. All eligible patients who agree to participate in the study will complete the
      Baseline Survey, the Follow-Up Survey, and will have information collected from their medical
      record at baseline, 1 month after the first clinic appointment post-enrollment, and 1 year
      after enrollment. Enrollment will take place at three UCHealth locations: UCHealth University
      of Colorado Hospital (Metro), UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies and UCHealth Poudre
      Valley Hospital (North), and UCHealth Memorial Central and Memorial North (South). Study
      personnel at the North and South sites will carry out enrollment and Baseline Surveys with
      patients for those locations; all other study procedures will be conducted by study personnel
      at the University of Colorado (UC) School of Medicine (SOM) (UCSOM) at UCHealth University of
      Colorado School of Medicine.

      Patients enrolled in the intervention arm will receive, by email and/or text, a link to 1) a
      short patient engagement video around HFrEF medications, and 2) a link to an online PDF of a
      HFrEF medication checklist. Patients in the intervention arm will receive these materials
      after enrollment and one week prior to their next scheduled clinic appointment. The materials
      will be delivered in a second communication, three days after the first, via text, as well as
      a third communication on the day of the clinic appointment. Patients enrolled in the control
      arm will not receive any materials at any point of time and will receive their usual care.

      For both arms, medication changes in patient medical records will be assessed before and
      after clinic visits to measure the effectiveness of the intervention on aim 1; surveys will
      be compared before and after clinic visits to determine the effectiveness of the intervention
      on aim 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple medications improve left ventricular remodeling, quality of life, and survival in
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Unfortunately, the
      real-world use of HFrEF medications is suboptimal, particularly for more recently approved
      agents such as aldosterone antagonists. The introduction of sacubitril/valsartan and
      ivabradine add to already complex HFrEF treatment regimens. Without novel mechanisms to
      improve medication use, the benefits of advances in HF treatment will be largely unrealized.

      Efforts to optimize HFrEF medication delivery have focused primarily on 1) provider decision
      support around prescribing and 2) patient education around adherence. An important gap is the
      failure to empower patients to engage more directly in HFrEF prescribing efforts. Patients
      have a direct stake in making sure they are getting efficacious treatments, want to be
      involved in decisions about their treatments, and if engaged are more likely to adhere to
      them. Direct-to-consumer marketing and proliferation of shared decision making reflect a
      culture where patients are increasingly involved in medication prescribing.

      Within this context, the American Heart Association (AHA) has funded four centers across the
      United States to examine ways in which heart failure treatment and prevention may be
      optimized. The University of Colorado, Denver is one of these sites; The Development and
      Trial of an Electronic health record-leveraged, Patient-centered, Intensification of Chronic
      care for Heart Failure Tool (EPIC-HF) is the population-focused arm of study. Inspired by the
      gap in HFrEF medication optimization, this study aims to develop a patient-centered
      intervention in order to 1) activate and engage patients with HFrEF in their prescribing
      regimen, 2) empower them to initiate discussions with their provider about ways in which
      their medication plan could be improved, which will result in 3) a superior HFrEF medication
      plan. The investigators modeled this tool with the previous success of flipped classrooms and
      patient empowerment initiatives in mind. The intervention was iteratively developed with the
      input of both clinician and patient stakeholders, and is innovative in its emphasis on
      patient self-actualization and role as an equal with their healthcare provider in the
      discussion around medication prescribing. This study applies the intervention in a two-arm,
      randomized controlled trial across three sites (UCH metro, Memorial, and Medical Center of
      the Rockies) in the UCH medical system.

      Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness of the EPIC-HF intervention on HFrEF medication optimization
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to usual care, EPIC-HF will increase the number of HFrEF medication
      optimizations (i.e., dose changes for Î²B, ACEI/ARB/sacubitril, AldaA, Ivabradine, etc.)
      without compromising secondary outcomes including safety and healthcare provider
      satisfaction.

      Aim 2: Assess the effectiveness of the EPIC-HF intervention on patient empowerment and
      activation around their HFrEF medication plan Hypothesis 2: Compared to usual care, EPIC-HF
      will result in increased patient empowerment and activation around their HFrEF medication
      plan as measured through patient self-assessment

    <description>The investigators are interested in whether the patient engagement tool leads to an increase in optimization of HFrEF medications for patients. This will be measured through medical record review of all medications and doses at enrollment, after delivery of intervention materials, and 12 months from enrollment.</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment, 1 month after delivery of intervention materials.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are interested in whether the patient engagement tool leads to an increase patient sense of engagement around their HFrEF medication prescribing, prompting patients to begin a dialogue with their clinician about their medication plan. This will be assessed by comparing answers from a self-reported survey at time of enrollment and 1 month after delivery of intervention materials. Survey measures include the Patient Activation Measure, 13-Item (PAM), the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions Survey (PACIC) and the Control Preferences Scale, as well as a series of questions asking about how and when medications were discussed during clinical interactions. Qualitative interviews with a subset of patients in the intervention arm will also be conducted to provide deeper context to survey answers.</description>
