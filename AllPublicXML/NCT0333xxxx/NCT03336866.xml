  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the ability of IXT-m200 to change methamphetamine concentrations in
      blood and alter the way methamphetamine feels. Participants will receive either placebo, a
      low or high dose of IXT-m200, in addition to methamphetamine challenge doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IXT-m200 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to methamphetamine in the blood. The main
      purpose of this study is to look at the effects of IXT-m200 on the pharmacokinetics of
      methamphetamine and on methamphetamine liking effects. Additionally, the study will determine
      IXT-m200 pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in subjects with methamphetamine use
      disorder. Qualified subjects will receive a single dose of IXT-m200 followed by up to 4
      methamphetamine challenge doses.
