      The primary objectives of this study are to explore the therapeutic effect of eluxadoline in
      treating IBS-D in pediatric patients 12-17 years of age, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      eluxadoline in pediatric patients with IBS-D, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      eluxadoline in pediatric patients with IBS-D.

          -  Patient is able to read and understand the assessments in the eDiary.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             Visit 1 (screening) and a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 3 (randomization)
             prior to dosing.

          -  Female patients who have had their first menstrual period and are sexually active must
             agree to use a reliable form of contraception. Reliable contraception is defined as:

               1. Hormonal contraception (eg, oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant, or
                  injectable hormonal contraceptive).

               2. Double-barrier method (eg, condom plus intrauterine device, diaphragm plus
                  spermicide).

          -  Patient has a diagnosis of IBS-D as defined by the modified Rome IV child/adolescent
             criteria*: Must include all of the following:

               1. Abdominal pain at least 4 days per month over at least 2 months associated with
                  one or more of the following:

                    1. Related to defecation

                    2. A change in frequency of stool

                    3. A change in form (appearance) of stool

               2. After appropriate evaluation, the symptoms cannot be fully explained by another
                  medical condition

               3. Patient has predominantly diarrheal stool symptoms defined as Bristol stool types
                  6 or 7 for more than 25% of bowel movements and Bristol stool types 1 or 2 for
                  less than 25% of bowel movements that occur in the absence of laxatives

                    -  All criteria fulfilled for at least 2 months prior to Visit 1 (screening).

          -  Patient has been compliant with the eDiary by completing both the morning and evening
             assessments for at least 8 out of the 14 days immediately preceding Visit 3
             (randomization).

          -  Patient has an average daytime abdominal pain scoreless than or equal to 2.0 over the
             2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Patient has at least 1 daytime bowel movement with a consistency of Type 6 or Type 7
             on the pediatric Bristol Stool Form Scale (p-BSFS) on at least 2 days per week during
             the 2 weeks prior to randomization that occurs in the absence of laxatives.

          -  Patient has no clinically significant findings on a physical examination, vital sign
             assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry
             panel, complete blood count, urine drug screen, urinalysis) after providing informed
             assent and after written consent is obtained, but before receiving the first dose of
             study treatment. (A central laboratory will be used to evaluate all urine [except
             urine pregnancy tests] and blood samples and will utilize reference ranges specific to
             a patient's age and gender. ECGs will be performed and electronically transmitted to a
             central ECG laboratory for analysis by a pediatric cardiologist in accordance with the
             instructions provided by the central ECG laboratory. The Investigator will determine
             if a particular finding is clinically significant. [In making this determination, the
             Investigator will consider whether the particular finding could represent a condition
             that would exclude the patient from the study, could represent a safety concern if the
             patient participates in the study, or could confound the study-specific assessments of
             safety or efficacy.])

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has no gallbladder, (ie, agenesis of the gallbladder or cholecystectomy).

          -  Patient has had any of the following surgeries:

                  appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, or polypectomy greater than 3 months post-surgery
                  are allowed. For the purposes of this study, laparoscopic surgeries without
                  complication are considered minor and non-exclusionary, provided the condition
                  for which the surgery was performed was not exclusionary.)

          -  Patient has a history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation,

             intestinal circulation.

             disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (ie, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
             colitis, microscopic colitis).

          -  Patient has celiac disease, or a positive serological test for celiac disease and the
             condition has not been ruled out by endoscopic biopsy.

          -  Patient has any congenital and/or acquired malabsorption syndrome (eg,
             Shwachman-Diamond syndrome).

          -  Patient has a history of a microbiologically documented (ie, stool culture or medical
             history) GI infection within 3 months prior to Screening.

          -  Patient has a known lactose or fructose intolerance that is associated with diarrhea,
             abdominal pain or discomfort, and that could confound assessments in the study.
