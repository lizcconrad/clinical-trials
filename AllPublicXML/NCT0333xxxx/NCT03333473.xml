  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of PPFP Choices is to generate actionable evidence that can be used to
      increase programmatic activities to address post-pregnancy family planning in the public and
      private-for-profit sectors. The ultimate intent of this investment is to advance and scale up
      post-pregnancy FP. Programmatic learning will be crucial to understanding what it will take
      to accelerate post-pregnancy FP in these two countries, and these can later be adapted by
      other countries with similar settings. Our vision of PPFP Choices can be achieved through the
      following objectives:

        -  Objective 1: Establish a comprehensive program implementation framework for the private
           sector to embrace post-pregnancy FP

        -  Objective 2: Improve the quality of post-pregnancy FP counseling and service provision
           in both public and private sectors

        -  Objective 3: Build evidence and contribute to the literature and programmatic guidance
           around post-pregnancy FP uptake and continuation in both public and private sectors

        -  Objective 4: Ensure effective documentation and strategic dissemination which will
           benefit post-pregnancy FP introduction and scale-up more broadly

      PPFP Choices is an operations research study seeking to examine the barriers and facilitators
      in offering a full range of FP methods in the immediate post-pregnancy period in both the
      public and private sectors.

      Jhpiego will implement the study in two counties in Kenya; Meru and Kilifi, and two districts
      in Indonesia; Brebes and Batang.

      This study will employ a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and control group.
      Prior to study start-up, the the intervention group will receive a Jhpiego-designed package
      of interventions designed to advance post-pregnancy FP in both the public and private
      sectors. These interventions draw on WHO's Programming Strategies for Postpartum Family
      Planning, as well as Jhpiego's experience and assessments. After the study is completed, the
      control groups will receive the same intervention. For the study, a mixed method approach
      will be used; both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected through Client
      Quantitative Interviews, Client In-Depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informant
      Interviews, and Facility Assessments.

The intervention package will work within existing public and private health facilities to strengthen and assess the effectiveness of facility and provider level PPFP service provision and counseling, and expand method choice for women during antenatal, early labor, and post-pregnancy pre-discharge periods. Training within the intervention package include provider-lever PPFP counseling and service provision (PPFP Clinical and Counseling Skills), as well as provider and facility-level leadership management and governance training (Facility-Level Leadership Management and Governance Training).</description>
