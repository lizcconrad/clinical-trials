        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will be males or females at least 18 years of age. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days prior to
             randomization into the study.

          -  Patients seropositive for HIV-1 using standard diagnostic criteria.

          -  Patients experiencing inconvenience, toxicity, negative impact on comorbidities or
             risk of drug-drug interactions with their current regimen

          -  Patients virologically suppressed during at least 12 months prior to inclusion (viral
             load &lt;50 copies/mL).

          -  Patients who have signed informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, or planned pregnancy during the study period.

          -  Previous failure to an integrase inhibitor-containing regimen.

          -  Previous failure to a Lamivudine or Emtricitabine-containing regimen.

          -  Resistance mutations to Lamivudine or integrase inhibitor if any resistance test had
             been previously performed.

          -  Any disease or history of disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to patient treatment.

          -  Chronic hepatitis B.
