  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy episodic drinking (HED) among college students remains a concern within the U.S., as
      rates of HED are still high in this population. Though a variety of brief motivational
      interventions for alcohol use in college students have demonstrated significant effects,
      these effects are often small and not consistently maintained over time. Personalized
      feedback interventions (PFIs) are a particularly promising approach, as these are often
      acceptable to college students, as well as low-cost, and easy to disseminate. Though
      presentation of interperson discrepancy via descriptive and injunctive norms has shown
      consistent effects within PFIs and received much attention in the literature, intraperson, or
      ideal-actual self discrepancies, has largely been ignored. Drawing from cognitive dissonance
      theory, self-regulation theory, and motivational interviewing, the current study aims to
      evaluate the efficacy of an alcohol PFI with a values component to incorporate ideal-self
      discrepancy into a typical intervention.
