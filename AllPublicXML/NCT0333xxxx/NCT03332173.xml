             days of study entry.

          9. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 ml/min (as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or

             (APTT) ≤ 2.0 x ULN. Patients with lupus anticoagulant or acquired von Willebrand
             disease due to WM may be enrolled after discussion with the medical monitor.
