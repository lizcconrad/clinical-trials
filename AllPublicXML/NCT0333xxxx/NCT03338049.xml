  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, prospective trial to evaluate a staged
      sampling methodology designed to maximize the diagnostic yield of lung biopsy in a single
      procedure setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate diagnostic yield following biopsy of peripheral
      pulmonary nodules as identified on chest computed tomography (CT) utilizing (1)
      Electromagnetic navigation (EMN) bronchoscopy, and/or (2) EMN-transthoracic needle aspiration
      (TTNA). Overall diagnostic yield will be evaluated to assess the combination of these
      approaches.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is â‰¥21 years old,

          -  The patient has a lung nodule identified on chest CT and is a candidate for elective
             EMN bronchoscopic evaluation as determined by the treating pulmonologist,

          -  The size of the target nodule, as measured at its greatest diameter, is between 1-3cm,

          -  Staging at the time of enrollment indicates NO/N1 (does not involve lymph nodes or
             includes involvement in nodes within ipsilateral hilum),

          -  The patient has an intermediate risk of malignancy (5-65% per the Mayo Model) and is
             in need of diagnosis for alternative treatment, OR The patient has a high probability
             of cancer (&gt;65%) and will be referred for surgical evaluation or stereotactic body
             radiation therapy (SBRT). Note: If the patient refuses surgery or if the surgeon
             requests a definitive diagnosis prior to surgery the patient will have the option to
             be included in this study,

          -  The patient has a lack of bleeding disorders, and

          -  The patient is willing and able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is pregnant as confirmed by urine or serum pregnancy testing,

          -  The patients has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;40,

          -  There is a predetermined plan to pursue stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in
             the event of a nondiagnostic study procedure in patients with a nodule within SPiNPerc
             range (i.e. The patient would not go on for a CT guided TTNA), OR There is a
             predetermined plan to pursue stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the event
             of a nondiagnostic study procedure in patients where the target nodule is within a
             region considered to be not accessible to a percutaneous approach as determined by the
             radiology core lab and thus would prevent a confirmatory tissue diagnosis before SBRT.
