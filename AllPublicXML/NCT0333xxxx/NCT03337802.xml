  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergies (AA) are adverse reactions to food. Over the last decade, the AA scenario has
      changed profoundly. In many countries, there has been a significant increase in the
      prevalence, persistence and severity of AAs and a consequent increase in the socio-economic
      impact associated with these conditions. For these reasons, there is a strong need to develop
      effective strategies to prevent these conditions. To date, the AA etiopathogenesis is not yet
      fully defined. Genetic factors may predispose certain subjects to the development of AA, but
      these alone can not explain the change observed in the AA scenario over the last few years,
      renewing interest in environmental factors.

      Numerous scientific evidence demonstrate the role of eating habits in influencing human
      health. Many of the effects of the diet on human health are due to a modulation of intestinal
      microbiosis. The regulation of the immune system is one of the pathways through which dietary
      modifications from the earliest times of life can alter the susceptibility of the individual
      to the development of allergic manifestations. The diet during pregnancy and lactation
      represents the earliest possible influence on the development of the baby's immune system.
      Observational studies suggest the association between maternal diet during pregnancy and
      lactation and development of allergic pathologies in the unborn, but the data are still
      preliminary. Often, other important parameters such as the atopic status of the parents, the
      type of delivery, the number of brothers, exposure to common allergens, maternal infections
      or early life, smoking exposure were not taken into account of cigarettes. The Mediterranean
      diet (MD) is characterized by a high intake of fruit and vegetables, legumes and whole grains
      combined with a moderate consumption of red wine, and the use of olive oil as the main source
      of lipids. In some studies adherence to MD was inversely related to the incidence of asthma
      and allergic rhinitis, especially in children. High adherence to MD was associated with a
      positive change in intestinal microbiosis and the production of short chain fatty acids
      (SCFA), particularly butyrate, the main SCFA produced by intestinal fermentation of food
      fibers. SCFA regulates mucosal integrity and the immunological and non-immunological
      mechanisms involved in the development of oral tolerance.

      MD mechanisms during pregnancy in the prevention of childhood allergies are not yet fully
      known.

    <measure>The effects of Mediterranean diet in pregnancy on epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the expression of the genes involved in the allergic response in the offspring through epigenetic analysis on cord blood</measure>
    <time_frame>after 9 months (at the end of the pregnancy)</time_frame>
    <description>The cord blood (5 ml) will be harvested in heparin tubes and transported immediately to the laboratory for extraction of peripheral blood lymphocytes by Ficoll gradient. The epigenetic mechanisms that will be explored are: DNA methylation of the major cytokines involved in Th1 / Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IFN-γ and Treg-specific demethylated region of FoxP3 transcriptional factor) , Using the High Resolution melting (RealMore) method and confirmed by sequencing; Expression analysis of the major miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of allergic pathologies (miR-125b, miR-146, miR-155, miR-29a / b, miR-27, miR-128, let-7b, miR-21, miR-126 , MiR-145, miR-106a, miR-375) on RNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes by Real Time PCR; Analysis of the activity of Histone deacetylases (HDAC) 6 and 9, involved in the equilibrium of Th1 / Th2 cells by Real Time PCR.</description>

    <measure>The effect of Mediterranean Diet pregnancy on the composition of maternal gut microbiota through analysis of gut microbiota composition.</measure>
    <time_frame>after 9 months (at the end of the pregnancy)</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal bacteria DNA will be extracted using standard technique outlined by the Earth Microbiome Project. 16S V4-region amplicon libraries will be produced using previously described primers and sequenced using the IlluminaMiSeqplatform (150bpx2). Bacterial load will be determined by qPCR using a standard curve derived from a plasmid containing a single copy of the 16S rRNAencoding gene. Sequence data has been deposited in MG RAST under accession numbers 4571868.3-4571924.3 and project number 10023. Paired end reads will be quality trimmed and processed for OTU (operational taxonomic unit) clustering using UPARSE pipeline, set at 0.97% identity cutoff. Taxonomic status will be assigned to the high quality (&lt;1% incorrect bases) candidate OTUs using the &quot;parallel_assign_taxonomy_rdp.py&quot; script of QIIME software. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction will be performed using PyNast and FastTree.</description>

    <measure>The effect of Mediterranean diet in pregnancy on the production of short chain fatty acids (butyrate and propionate) in the intestinal tract.</measure>
    <time_frame>after 9 months (at the end of the pregnancy)</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal SCFAs concentration Frozen feces weighing 1g will be diluted with saline solution, vortexed, and centrifuged. Supernatants will be filtered and stored at -20°C until analysis. Frozen fecal extracts will be acidified and extracted in duplicate. A quantity of the pooled extract containing acidified butyrate, propionate or acetate will be transferred into a 2ml glass vial and loaded onto an Agilent Technologies 7890 gas chromatograph (GC) system. Detection will be achieved using a flame ionization detector. Peaks will be identified using a mixed external standard and quantified by peak height/internal standard ratio. To examine whether fecal butyrate levels correlates with bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index) and evenness (Pielou's evenness index) and abundance patterns across multiple groups we will calculate the Spearman correlation using the cor.test function implemented in R (http://www.r-project.org/</description>

    <description>The Mediterranean diet (MD) is highly regarded as a healthy balanced diet. It is distinguished by a beneficial fatty acid profile that is rich in both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, high levels of polyphenols and other antioxidants, high intake of fiber and other low glycemic carbohydrates, and relatively greater vegetable than animal protein intake. Specifically, olive oil, assorted fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, and nuts; moderate consumption of fish, poultry, and red wine; and a lower intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meat and sweets characterize the traditional MD.</description>
