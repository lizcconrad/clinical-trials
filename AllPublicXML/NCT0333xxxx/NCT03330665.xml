  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physician empathy and reducing stress are major factors in attaining positive clinical
      outcomes for patients. Fostering empathy in medical students is particularly important as
      they are the future of the healthcare workforce and a trend of declining empathy during
      medical education may lead to decreased health care quality outcomes. Meditation may be an
      avenue to promote positive student attitudes including empathy, though very few studies have
      examined this idea through empirical research. Using validated measures, the Jefferson scale
      of empathy and the perceived stress scale, we seek to investigate whether use of a meditation
      app will be associated with higher levels of self-rated empathy and lower self-rated stress.
