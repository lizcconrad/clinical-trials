  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In kidney transplant patients, CMV infection remains the leading infectious cause of
      morbidity and mortality. Clinical and virological relapses are common and are involved in
      chronic graft dysfunction. To date, it is not certain that secondary prophylaxis allows
      reducing these relapses, although this prophylaxis is part of the current recommendations.
      Our team has recently shown that the expansion of γδ T cells in peripheral blood during CMV
      infection was correlated with the absence of virological and clinical relapses. Indeed, the
      absence of relapse was associated in 94.7% of cases with the presence of γδ T cells expansion
      while relapses occurred in about 90% of cases in the absence of γδ T cells expansion. These
      results suggest that the indication and duration of secondary prophylaxis after the curative
      treatment of CMV infection in kidney transplantation could be guided by the immune
      surveillance of γδ T cells.

      The study aim to demonstrate that the expansion of γδ T cells at the end of curative
      treatment predicts the absence of virological and clinical relapses. This is a pilot study
      that will be conducted in the transplant center of Bordeaux and Lyon. After the curative
      treatment of CMV infection until a negative CMV ADNemia, secondary prophylaxis with
      valganciclovir will be established based on the results of γδ T cells immunomonitoring:

      (I) Secondary prophylaxis will not be started in patients with γδ T cell expansion at the end
      of curative treatment (group 1) (II) Secondary prophylaxis will be initiated in patients who
      have not γδ T cell expansion and will continue for 3 months maximum. The occurrence of γδ T
      cells expansion during or at the end of secondary prophylaxis will define the group 2A.
      Patients who still not had γδ T cells expansion during or at the end of secondary prophylaxis
      will compose the group 2B.

      The primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate the occurrence of virological relapse,
      assessed by monitoring CMV ADNemia, at one year of a first CMV disease, in kidney transplant
      patients, with secondary prophylaxis based on the monitoring of γδ T cells.
