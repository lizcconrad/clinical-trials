  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes in South America, Central
      America and Africa. It is more prevalente in males gender and the age above 15 years due to
      the greater exposure in the wild endemic area of yellow fever.

      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a single dose of the yellow fever vaccine
      is sufficient to maintain protective immunity against yellow fever for a lifetime, therefore
      a booster dose is not required. This issue is difficult to evaluate because there is no
      serological correlate of protection against yellow fever and seropositivity is defined with
      several cut-off points. Although studies indicate that the duration of protection after
      vaccination is long, many studies have demonstrated a reduction of the antibody titrer over
      the years. Consequently, there is more concern about people who live in endemic areas. For
      this reason, Brazil recommends revaccinating once at least until additional studies are
      performed.

      It is important to know the duration of immunity induced by lower doses of YF vaccine. In our
      knowledge, there is a lack of clinical studies evaluating the immunity duration of the yellow
      fever vaccine with lower doses. This information is relevant to subsidize the routine
      recommendation of YF vaccine fractional dose for adults.

      This is an observational study in young adult males who received the first dose of the yellow
      fever vaccine in 2009 when they participated in the &quot;Dose-response study of the yellow fever
      vaccine 17DD produced by Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz.
