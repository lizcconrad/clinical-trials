      Objective: To report the prevalence and risk factors of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and
      the prevalence of intrinsic sphincter deficiency in women with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among Female patients with MS, followed for
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) during a 15-year period. Demographic data, MS history,
      expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score at the urodynamic visit, obstetrical past,
      birth weight, LUTS, and urodynamic findings were collected. SUI was defined as incontinence
      during cough, or any effort. A maximum urethral closure pressure less than 30 cm H2O defined
      intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Results: In total 363 women with a mean age of 46.7±10.8
      years and a mean disease duration of 12.9±8.7 years were included. The incidence of relapsing
      remitting MS, a secondary progressive form, and a primary progressive form was 60.6%, 32.8%,
      and 6.6%, respectively. The prevalence of SUI was 31.4%. The prevalence of intrinsic
      sphincter deficiency was 1.4% and 0.8% of these patients had a SUI (P=0.300). In a
      multivariate analysis, women with a SUI had significantly higher birth weight (P=0.030), a
      pelvic organ prolapse (P=0.021), urgent urinary incontinence (P=0.006), a lower EDSS score
      (P=0.019), and a weaker containing effort (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of SUI in
      women with MS was 31.4%. This symptom could affect the quality of life of women with MS.
