    <textblock>
      To determine if late (at or beyond postnatal day 14) mild permissive hypercapnia is
      associated with reduction in apnea, bradycardia, and hypoxemic episodes and with improved
      stability of oxygenation.

      Preterm infants who remain intubated or on nasal mechanical ventilation (IMV) at 14 days
      postnatal age, meet blood gas criteria, have transcutaneous carbondioxide (TcCO2) monitoring
      with TcCO2 values that trend and correlate appropriately with PaCO2, and are not judged too
      unstable by Attending neonatologist will qualify.

      The investigators will use the data from the 96 hours of intensive multiparametric
      physiologic monitoring at 2 weeks postnatal age.

      The first 24 hours of data collection will be the baseline data. Over the next 72 hours, the
      investigators will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross-over manner with the initial
      intervention randomly assigned: Intervention 1 (24-48h of data), Intervention 2 (48-72h of
      data) and Intervention 3 (72-96h of data).

    <description>The investigators will evaluate the effects of attempts to increase blood carbon dioxide levels within a narrow range of 5 mm Hg (well within the range of usual clinical practice) in a cross-over manner for 24 hours at a time, over a 4-day period, and use Cardiorespiratory Monitoring to evaluate control of breathing.
The investigators will attempt to adjust PCO2 by 5 mm Hg higher from baseline (to max of 70 mm Hg), as long as pH is &gt;7.2. The first 24 hours of the data collection will be the baseline data. Over the next 72 hours, the investigators will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross-over manner, with the initial intervention randomly assigned: Intervention 1 (24-48h of data; Increase TcCO2 by 5 mm Hg), Intervention 2 (48-72h; TcCO2 back to baseline), and Intervention 3 (72-96h; increase TcCO2 again by 5 mm Hg).</description>

             that trend and correlate appropriately with PaCO2, and are not judged too unstable by
             the Attending neonatologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal or withdrawal of consent

          2. Major congenital malformations (e.g., not including patent ductus arteriosus, small
