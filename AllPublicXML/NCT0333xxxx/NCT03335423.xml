  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate the interindividual variation in metformin AUC in a
      large cohort of healthy volunteers after a single dose of metformin. Part 1 is driven by the
      hypothesis that metformin AUC and renal clearance exhibit significant interindividual
      variation. However this has never been documented in a large cohort of healthy volunteers.

      The investigators aim to investigate the potential interaction between codeine and metformin
      in the intestine. The hypothesis underlying part 3 is that the increased risk of early
      discontinuation of metformin during co-administration with codeine is primarily due to local
      inhibition of OCT1 via codeine at the intestinal level.

      Part 1: The investigators intend to investigate the inter-individual variation in metformin
      Area Under Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC) following a single dose of oral metformin based
      on the plasma concentration of metformin after 3 and 10 hours and urine collection for 24
      hours . Part 2: The investigators intend to contribute with DNA and metformin AUC
      determinations from subjects from part 1 to a major international study that aime to
      highlight the Genome Wide Association (GWA) between the entire genome and variations in
      metformin pharmacokinetics (AUC) in a large group of healthy subjects and patients. Part 3:
      The investigators aim to investigate the potential interaction between codeine and metformin
      in the intestine.

      The investigators secondary objective in part 3 is to investigate if the plasma concentration
      of morphine increases when codeine and metformin are given together due to competitive
      inhibition of the Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) transport protein (in the liver).
      Furthermore, the investigators will measure lactate after metformin ingestion as a proxy for
      metformin's effect on the intestinal mucosa, both after oral and intravenous metformin

In part 3, 18 healthy subjects will be randomized to ingest: a) oral metformin b) intravenous metformin c) 4 pills of codeine with the 5th taken together with oral metformin and d) 4 pills of codeine with the 5th taken together with intravenous metformin.</intervention_model_description>
