  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar paravertebral block (LPB) has been used for anesthesia in different settings such as
      in varicocelectomy and inguinal hernia repair in adults and pediatrics. Different studies
      considered LPB as an alternative to general and spinal anesthesia when contraindications
      exist, especially in elderly patients. However, the results obtained when using LPB are
      controversial in terms of number of injections performed and the success rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for hernia repair who will agree to undergo different number of
      paravertebral injections in the thoraco-lumbar plexus area under CT guidance.

      While the patient is in lateral decubitis position, LPB injections will be made using a 100
      mm 22 G nerve stimulator needle (Stimuplex, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The site of
      injection is determined by manual palpation. The number of injections ranges from one to five
      and the level of injections ranges from T11 to L3.

      The needle is penetrated perpendicular to the skin using the following nerve stimulator
      settings: 5mA, 9V and 2Hz. The stimulating needle is gently manipulated into a position to
      allow an adequate muscular response with a stimulating current of 0.4-0.8 mA. At this point,
      4-5 ml of the contrast (Telebrix 35, 350 mg/ml, Roissy CDG Cedex, France) is injected. The
      patients will receive the same amount of contrast, despite the different number of
      injections. The needles are kept in their position and afterwards followed by CT scan.

      A radiologist who is blind to the study will interpret the radiological results and document
      the level at which the needle tip is found, the distance from the kidney and the spread of
      the injected contrast. In order to ensure patient's safety, different measures will be taken
      to keep the radiation as low as reasonably achievable.

      Following the radiological practice, patients will be transferred to the operating room to
      undergo inguinal herniorrhaphy, and will not followed for the purpose of this study.
