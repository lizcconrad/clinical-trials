  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal obstruction is a very subjective sensation but it's also a frequent reason of
      consultation. Two specific questionnaire NOSE and RhinoQOL were validated; but rhinomanometry
      value is still a question to debate. As well as the difference between acoustic rhinometry
      and rhinomanometry.

      Usually nasal obstruction due to a septal deviation is treated by septoplasty. If the
      anatomic result can be proved true, the patient's felt would be unsuccessful.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of septoplasty on the nasal obstruction,
      objectively by rhinometry and subjectively by questionnaire.
