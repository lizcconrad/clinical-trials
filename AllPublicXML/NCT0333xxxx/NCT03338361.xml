  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluate the efficacy of a computerised program (T.O.P. tool) consisting of
      an approach avoidance training (AAT) (to retrain action tendencies for alcohol-related
      stimuli), a visual probe training (VPT) (to retrain attentional bias for alcohol-related
      stimuli) and the combination of both training procedures versus placebo training, as an
      add-on to treatment as usual (psycho-education and cognitive behavioral therapy).

      The investigators include hospitalized detoxified alcohol-dependent patients, who receive a
      four week training procedure, existing of a pre-assessment, 6 training sessions and a
      post-assessment.

      Outcome measures consist of behavioral measures (consumption of alcohol - self report over 1
      year), questionnaires (AUDIT; craving on 9-point likert scale) and approach avoidance and
      visual probe measurement tasks.

      A six month and 1 year follow-up is included (behavioral measures and AUDIT). Further, the
      investigators will also assess credibility (9-point likert scale) of the training procedure
      before the start of the training and immediately after the assessment of the AAT and VPT
      training.
