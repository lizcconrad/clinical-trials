  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will adapt a physical activity lifestyle intervention to adolescent congenital
      heart disease (CHD) survivors with the primary goal of increasing physical activity levels.

      The study will be split into 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires, wear an accelerometer around the waist for 7 days, and undergo an exercise
      stress test. The accelerometer and exercise stress test will be used to determine whether
      participants are eligible to be randomized for the intervention study. A parent will be asked
      to complete questionnaires at baseline as well. In Phase 2, participants will be randomized
      to one of two conditions: 1) receiving a physical activity tracker (a Fitbit) or 2) receiving
      a Fitbit AND engaging in videoconferencing sessions with a physical activity coach. During
      Phase 2, participants will also be asked to complete 2 assessments (weeks 9 and 22). The week
      9 assessment will consist of completing questionnaires and wearing an accelerometer for 7
      days. Week 22 will be similar to week 9 with the addition of a final exercise stress test.
      The same parent will be asked to complete questionnaires at the final assessment as well.

      Participants who are randomized to the videoconferencing condition will be asked to meet with
      a physical activity coach 8 times over the course of 20 weeks. Coaches will help participants
      to (1) change attitudes toward physical activity, (2) increase perception of others' approval
      of physical activity (e.g., family members, peers), and (3) increase participants' perceived
      control by troubleshooting barriers and increasing efficacy for physical activity. Coaches
      will use the Fitbit to facilitate self-monitoring and goal setting.
