  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of
      CC-90006 following administration of multiple subcutaneous doses in subjects with mild to
      moderate plaque-type psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in subjects with mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis.

      The study will consist of escalating multiple (three) doses in sequential groups.
      Approximately 40 subjects with plaque-type psoriasis will be enrolled into approximately 4
      planned dose cohorts.

      Each cohort will study a different CC-90006 dose level and have ten subjects; eight subjects
      will receive CC-90006 and two subjects will receive placebo. Subjects will be dosed according
      to a computer-generated randomization scheme. Dosing will occur on Days 1, 15 (Week 2), and
      29 (Week 4). During the study, blood samples and punch biopsies will be collected to
      determine the amount of CC-90006 in the body and to evaluate its effect on the subject's
      condition. Subjects will return to the clinic for regular follow up visits for safety, PK,
      and PD. A follow up phone call to each subject to determine general health will occur on Day
      141 (week 20).

             time of signing the ICF, and be willing to adhere to the requirements of contraception
             use throughout the study.

               1. Female subjects who claim to be surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; proper documentation required)
                  must have undergone the procedure at least 6 months before screening,

               2. Females who claim to be postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without
                  menses before screening, should have a confirmed follicle-stimulating hormone
                  [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).

               3. All other females must:

             i. Have two negative pregnancy tests (at screening and baseline) as verified by the
             Investigator prior to starting study treatment. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy
             testing during the course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies
             even if the subject practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.

             ii. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use two
             forms of reliable contraception simultaneously. One must be a highly effective method
             and one additional effective (barrier) method, and both must be practiced without
             interruption, 28 days prior to starting investigational product, during the study
             therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 4 months after discontinuation of
             study therapy.

             d. Males must practice true abstinence1 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and
             source documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made
             out of natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended]) during sexual
             contact with a pregnant female or FCBP2 while participating in the study, during dose
             interruptions, and for at least 4 months after the last dose of IP, even if he has
             undergone a successful vasectomy.

          2. Must be diagnosed with mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis at least 6 months prior
             to baseline (Day 1).

          3. Must have a PASI ≤ 15 at screening and baseline (Day 1).

          4. Must have a body surface area affected score (BSA) ≥ 1 and sPGA ≥ 3 at screening and
             baseline (Day 1).

          5. Must have at least two plaques, at least 3 x 3 centimeters(cm) in diameter. One plaque
             will be used for punch biopsy and the other for TPSS evaluation.

          6. Other than the diagnosed condition of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis, the
             subject must be in good health as determined by a physical examination (PE) at
             screening.

          7. Has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 35 kg/m2 at screening.

          8. For all other clinical laboratory safety test parameters, the subject has results
             within normal limits or judged to be not clinically significant by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following is a summary of the exclusion criteria:

          1. Presence of any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness which places him or her at unacceptable risk by participating in the study, or
             that would that would prevent the subject from participating in the study for other
             reasons, or would confound the ability to interpret data from the study.

          2. History of cancer.

         10. Use of topical therapy for psoriasis within 14 days of first dosing (including but not
             limited to corticosteroids, retinoids, vitamin D analog, calcineurin inhibitors,
             salicylic acid).

         11. Use of systemic therapy for psoriasis within 30 days of first dose administration.

         12. Use of phototherapy for psoriasis within 30 days of first dose administration.

         13. Use of systemic biologics treatment for psoriasis within 24 weeks of first dose
             administration.

         14. Exposure to an immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drug within 30 days of first dose
             administration, or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer).

         15. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the
             first dose administration, or five half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

         16. Smoking &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco products
