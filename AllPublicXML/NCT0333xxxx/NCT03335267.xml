  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the suitability of CPX-351 as first intensive therapy
      in elderly (age ≥60 years) patients with AML. Patients may have received prior AML treatment
      with non-intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating agents, low dose Ara C or lenolidomide, but
      may not have received intensive AML treatment with anthracyclines and/or cytarabine prior to
      enrollment on this trial. The outcome of elderly patients following intensive treatment with
      CPX-351 will be measured by clinical endpoints for efficacy and safety and by
      biological/functional response.
