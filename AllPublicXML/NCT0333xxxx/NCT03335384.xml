  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study to explore the relationship between clinically assessed pulmonary
      function test (PFT) measures and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) measures in Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy (DMD) as well as to explore the relationship between sniff nasal inspiratory
      pressure (SNIP) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) measures in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

    <textblock>
      Two small balloons, which are attached to small, flexible tubes, will be put into the
      esophagus and stomach through your nose. Each balloon is about 2 inches long (deflated) and
      about the width of a pencil tip. To reduce any discomfort with this procedure, lidocaine gel
      or spray will be put into the subject's nose and administered to the back of the throat
      before the balloon. In addition, swallowing water during the procedure will help to reduce
      any gagging sensation and will assure that the balloon goes into the esophagus. Proper
      placement of the catheters will be determined using normal tidal breathing against an
      occluded mouthpiece with a nose clip. Once proper placement is ensured, the catheters will
      remain in place during your normal PFT maneuvers. Additionally, while the gastric and
      esophageal balloon catheters are in place, the subject will be asked to perform a maximal
      sniff maneuver (SNIP) while one nostril is occluded with a plug containing a distal pressure
      measurement catheter to measure airway pressure. The distal end of the pressure catheter will
      be connected to a hand held pressure meter to display peak pressure and to provide you visual
      feedback. This maneuver will be performed 10 times.
