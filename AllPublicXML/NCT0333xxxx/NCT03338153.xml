      the purpose of this study is to determine whether appropriate control of diabetes around the
      PCI time is related with MACE and outcome of diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in coronary revascularization, cardiovascular disease accounts for
      about 75% of all hospital admissions in diabetic patients.although the introduction of
      drug-eluting stents has reduced the rates of restenosis after PCI, diabetic patients
      undergoing PCI will have poorer clinical outcomes.In this study, we sought to investigate
      whether a pre and post procedural glycemic control in diabetic patients,as reflected by
      HgbA1C prior,1 and 6 months after elective PCI,was related to major advance cardiac events
      (MACE) during 3 year follow up.
