    <textblock>
      The learning environment in Higher Education as well as autonomous work of students, mobile
      technology is increasingly present due to the mass use of mobile devices and the development
      of high speed in data transmission, which provides today the possibility of being able to
      access in real time a great amount of information.

      M-learning is defined as the ability to access educational resources, tools and materials
      using a mobile device anytime and anywhere.

      Considering the advantages of this technology, m-learning can be a real option to the
      traditional teaching-learning method by encouraging the active participation of students in
      their own learning process.

      Therefore, this educational innovation study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and the use
      of a mobile application as a complementary learning strategy in interactive format for the
      acquisition of professional competencies in Health Sciences.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instructional Materials Motivation Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Change scores: Baseline, 2-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The level of learning motivation is evaluated using Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS). The IMMS consists of four domains: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction, with a total of 36 questions on a 5-point Likert scale. Possible scores range from 36 to 180, with a higher score indicative of a higher level of learning motivation.</description>

    <time_frame>Change scores: Baseline, 2-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire is a measure of emotional state. It contains 65 items assessing mood state, which are grouped into six subscales: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigour-activity, fatigue-inertia and confusion-bewilderment. The score rate is a Likert scale (not at all: 0; a little: 1; moderately: 2; quite a lot: 3; extremely: 4).</description>
