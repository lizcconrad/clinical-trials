  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical study to investigate and characterize the immune response profile to
      four different prostate cancer treatments (total cryotherapy, focal cryotherapy, Cyberknife
      SBRT, and radical prostatectomy) in patients with localized prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immune system plays an important role in cancer, and there is evidence that different
      types of cancer treatment can elicit different responses from the body's immune system. This
      study is designed to look at immune markers in the blood and urine of patients undergoing
      four different types of prostate cancer treatment and compare the differences.

      Patients who have elected Total Cryotherapy (freezing of the entire prostate), focal
      cryotherapy (freezing only the side of the prostate affected by cancer), Cyberknife
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and Radical Prostatectomy (removal of the entire
      prostate) for the treatment of their prostate cancer will be eligible to participate in this
      study. The study is expected to enroll 40 patients, 10 patients per treatment group. The
      study includes a screening visit during which the subject will provide informed consent, and
      provide a blood sample and a urine sample. At 2-3 weeks following their scheduled treatment,
      they will again provide another blood and urine sample. At their regularly scheduled follow
      up at 3 months, they will again provide another blood and urine sample. These samples are
      collected for research purposes only, and the costs will be covered by the study grant
      account, without any additional cost to the patient.

      The investigators have determined that this study presents no more than minimal risk to
      patients due to the minimal risks involved with a blood draw and urine specimen collection.
