  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose this study is to determine the continued reach and effectiveness of the
      OurRelationship.com program once paid advertising and payment for participation ceases. The
      answer to this question is essential to determining the sustainability of web-based
      interventions for couples. Specifically, this study has four aims:

        1. Examine continued level of initial interest in the study, as measured by number of
           initial visits to the website, time spent on the page, and number of couples signing up
           for the study.

        2. Measure any changes in the characteristics of the individuals expressing interest in the
           study, including demographics (e.g., race, ethnicity, education), relationship
           functioning (e.g., relationship satisfaction, previous help-seeking), and individual
           functioning (e.g., depression, anxiety)

        3. Determine completion rates and effectiveness of the program once payments for
           participation have been removed.

        4. Determine whether having a single Skype/phone call with a coach (rather than the four
           calls that were used in the NIH trial) significantly degrades completion rates.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and the end of the intervention (approx. 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>Relationship satisfaction as measured by the Couple Satisfaction Inventory, 16-item (Funk &amp; Rogge, 2007; http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.21.4.572). Higher scores on this scale indicate greater satisfaction. Total scores range from 0 to 81, with a score below 51.5 indicating clinical distress. Internal consistency (alpha = 0.98) and convergent validity are strong.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and the end of the intervention (approx. 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms as measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Higher scores on this scale indicate greater depressive symptoms. The scale has been shown to have excellent sensitivity, specificity, and internal consistency (e.g., Irwin, Artin, &amp; Oxman, 1999; doi:10.1001/archinte.159.15.1701).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and the end of the intervention (approx. 2 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lowe; DOI: 10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092). Scores on this measure range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety symptoms. Sensitivity (89%), specificity (82%), and criterion validity are excellent for this measure.</description>
