    <textblock>
      The goal of the CBPT study is to determine the efficacy of the CBPT program for improving
      outcomes in service members and civilians at-risk for poor outcomes following traumatic
      lower-extremity injury. Primary outcome is physical function measured through a
      patient-reported questionnaire and physical performance tests. Secondary outcomes include
      pain and general health. Tertiary outcome is return to work/duty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following extremity injury, referral (and direct access) to physical therapy (PT) is
      considered standard of care. And, while PT strategies are commonly impairment focused,
      clinicians across multiple subspecialties of physical therapy recognize the importance of
      addressing pain and pain-related psychosocial factors as strong predictors of chronic pain as
      well as long-term physical and psychological disability.

      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have documented positive influence on
      psychosocial factors in patients with chronic pain. CBT-based self-management programs have
      also demonstrated improvement in patient outcomes and the adoption of a physically active
      lifestyle, as well as improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs and self-efficacy, in various
      populations with chronic conditions. These evidence-based CBT and self-management strategies
      provide the basis for the study intervention.

      The proposed project will conduct a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to determine
      the efficacy of the CBPT program in patients at-risk for poor outcomes following traumatic
      lower-extremity injury. Central hypothesis is that delivery of CBPT by physical therapists
      over the telephone will improve outcomes, through reductions in pain catastrophizing and fear
      of movement and improvement in pain self-efficacy. The investigators propose a large,
      rigorous evaluation of the CBPT program in patients with lower extremity trauma with the goal
      of engaging civilians and service members in their own care and improving pain and functional
      outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1 To determine the efficacy of the CBPT program for improving outcomes in
      service members and civilians at-risk for poor outcomes following traumatic lower-extremity
      injury. Primary outcome is physical function measured through a patient-reported
      questionnaire and physical performance tests. Secondary outcomes include pain and general
      health. Tertiary outcome is return to work/duty.

      Specific Aim 2 To determine whether changes in the intermediary outcomes of pain
      catastrophizing, fear of movement, and self-efficacy at 6 months are associated with
      improvement in outcomes 12 months after hospital discharge.

      Specific Aim 3 To determine whether subgroups of patients are more likely to benefit from the
      CBPT program.

      Specific Aim 4 To examine the value of CBPT relative to Education using Markov
      decision-analysis.

    <description>The CBPT intervention delivers a patient-oriented cognitive-behavioral self-management program to improve physical function and reduce pain, through reductions in pain catastrophizing and fear of movement and increases in self-efficacy. The program consists of six weekly telephone sessions with a trained physical therapist. Sessions cover an introduction and rationale for treatment in addition to techniques such as deep breathing, graded activity plan and goal-setting, distraction techniques, automatic thoughts, coping self-statements, being present-minded, and relapse prevention and symptom management plans. At the end of the 6th week, patients will build individualized recovery plans with selected strategies and details on frequency of practice.</description>

    <description>The education program provides a postoperative recovery and is based on education that would typically be provided by a treating physician or a physical therapist in an outpatient setting. The education program is matched to the CBPT treatment in terms of session frequency and contact with the study therapist. The therapist will call weekly to check in with the patient and encourage him/her to read the manual. Manuals contain educational information on injury patterns and symptoms, stress and recovery, benefits of physical therapy, and importance of daily exercise, and ways to promote healing. Education on sleep hygiene, energy management, healthy eating, and preventing future injury are also provided.</description>
