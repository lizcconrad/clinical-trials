      Objective: It is widely accepted that breastfeeding (AS) is superior to other forms of
      nutrition in the first six months of life. Breastmilk contains nutrient items in appropriate
      quantities and a high bioavailability according to the needs of each baby. The United Nations
      Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that babies take
      AS alone and then continue to feed on AS with up to two years of age, with appropriate
      supplementary nutrition, during the first six months of life.

      Even in the hottest climates, breastfeeding babies have been shown to have no additional
      nutrient or fluid requirements for the first six months, including water. In the first 6
      months of breastfeeding with breast milk alone (YAS), the incidence of many diseases,
      especially infectious diseases, decreases and the brain development is better.

      Despite its numerous benefits, mother milk is not utilized in our country sufficiently.
      According to the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey (TNSA), the rate of breastfeeding in
      Turkey was 91.8% in Turkey, while the proportion of babies fed only breast milk in the first
      6 months was 30.1%.

      Infants related deaths, otitis media, lower respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis,
      obesity were more common in children who were fed formula milk compared to children who were
      fed breast milk during the first year of life. Obesity can reduce insulin resistance and
      hypertension risks later in life.

      According to the research done by Kramer and his colleagues on 13889 children, no effect of
      breastfeeding on physical development, obesity and hypertension was found.

      In this study, whether breast feeding was associated with otitis media in the first year,
      lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis; in the first 5 years of age, obesity and
      hypertension.

      Method: This descriptive study will be conducted by Gaziantep Şahinbey Bağlarbaşı ASM, a
      5-year-old children who applied between 01.10.2017 - 04.04.2018, with their weight and blood
      pressure measurements and their parents' questionnaires. Approximately 500 children will be
      taken to work. Informed consent is obtained from the parents of the patients who will be
      employed, and verbal consent is given from the children. Those who do not give their approval
      will not be included in the study. People with a known congenital disease, those with no
      birth week between 38 and 42 and a birth weight between 2500 and 4000 grams will not be
      included in the study.

      The length measurement shall be made on a fixed scale, with the back of the head on a flat
      surface, with the head perpendicular, and with the eyes vertically facing (Frankfurt plane),
      the distance between the top of the head and the soles of the feet shall be a fixed scale or
      gauge. Blood pressure measurement will be measured by a digital blood pressure meter from the
      left and right hand (M6; Omron Healthcare).

      Measurements of height, weight and hemoglobin in the past ages of the subjects taken in the
      study group will be taken from the computer programs used in the family medicine system.
      Percentile values of measurements belonging to each age group will also be recorded.
