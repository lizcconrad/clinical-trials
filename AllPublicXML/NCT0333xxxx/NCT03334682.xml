  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris of adult woman has increased over the past 10 years; it affects currently 20%
      to 30% of adult women.

      The physiopathology of adult woman acne is distinguished from the teenager one by essentially
      2 factors:

        -  hormonal factor with a peripheral hyperandrogenism coupled with an hypersensibility of
           cutaneous androgens receptors of these women. But this point is still at the stage of
           hypothesis.

        -  inflammatory factor linked with Propionibacterium Aces ; indeed these women received
           most of the time many cures of local and systematic antibiotics at the origin of
           resistant Propionibacterium Aces strains which lead to a chronical activation of
           cutaneous innate immunity.

      On a therapeutic plan, four types of systemic treatment, approved in this indication are:

        -  Tetracyclines which are problematic for the bacterial resistance and consequently
           constant relapse when they are stopped.

        -  Zinc salts which target only the inflammatory lesions and were shown less effective than
           cycline

        -  Antiandrogens, with acetate of cyproterone associated with risks of phlebitis and
           pulmonary embolism, and increase risk of triglycerides, cholesterol and hepatic balance.

        -  The last alternative is represented by isotretinoin but the use in women of childbearing
           potential is binding because of the teratogen risks and the hyperandrogenism represents
           an identified risk of relapse.

      In this context, the spironolactone could represent an interesting alternative. It blocks the
      5-alpha-reductase receptors at sebaceous gland and inhibits Luteinizing hormone (LH)
      production at the pituitary level. It is not submitted to isotretinoin constraints, does not
      lead to bacterial resistance and targets the peripheral hyperandrogenism.

      Currently, very few studies have been performed and on a weak number of patients but they
      showed that at low doses (lower than 200mg/day), spironolactone can be effective against
      acne.

      In that context, it seemed clearly interesting to perform the first double-blind randomized
      study spironolactone vs cyclines which remains the moderate acne reference treatment and to
      demonstrate the superiority of spironolactone's efficacy in order to establish it as
      alternative way to cycline.

    <description>The treatment's efficacy will be determined by the rate of success in each arm. The best rate of success between Month 4 and Month 6 will be chosen for the final result. Rate of success, defined by a decrease of both Adult Female Acne Scoring Tool (AFAST) scores 1 and 2:
AFAST score 1: decrease of at least 2 grades compared to baseline or to grade 0 if the baseline was at 1 and
AFAST score 2: decrease to grade 1 if baseline was &gt; 1 or to grade 0 if the baseline was at 1
AFAST 1 (also called GEA) assesses the comedones (open and closed), the non-inflammatory lesions, the papules and pustules and the nodules. The stage is defined according to a global evaluation of severity of acne and ranges from Grade 0 (no acne) to Grade 5 (the worse situation).
AFAST 2 assesses acne on an area from the left and right mandibular zone to the upper edge of the trunk and ranges from Grade 0 (no acne) to Grade 3 (the worse situation).</description>

    <description>Factor F2 of ECLA scale ECLA (&quot;Echelle de Cotation des Lésions d'Acné&quot;) is a scale for acne proposed by the dermatology research team of Nantes University Hospital. It is composed of 3 factors: Factor 1 (F1) counts the acne lesions on the face; Factor 2 (F2) counts the lesions acne on the trunk and Factor 3 (F3) counts the scars. In this study, the factor F2 will be used. The factor F2 assesses the extensive character of acne lesions on 5 defined areas: cervical areas (F2N); chest areas (F2C); back area (F2B) and arm area (F2A) according to a qualitative scale 0=absent, 1=poor 2=medium 3=significant. It is completed by the count of the present nodules in each area.</description>
