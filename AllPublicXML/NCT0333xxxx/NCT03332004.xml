    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish a new and more accurate method to visualize the
      peritoneal changes caused by endometriosis using Indocyanine Green mediated fluorescence
      imaging. The hypothesis is that Indocyanine Green, a fluorescent dye that has wide
      applications throughout medicine in identifying vascularity of tissues and
      neovascularization, could facilitate the localization and excision of endometriotic lesions
      exploiting the hypervascularization due to the chronic inflammation

      Patients were recruited within the clinical routine after indication for laparoscopy under
      consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The first abdominal and pelvi's inspection was made using direct laparoscope visualization
      under white light conditions. All areas suspected of peritoneal endometriosis were classified
      as white, black and red lesions and recorded together with their anatomic location in the
      surgical record for the purposes of subsequent extirpation.

      After the first visual inspection the patient was administered with 0.05 - 0.25 mg /(kg BW)
      Indocyanine Green intravenously. The Indocyanine Green imaging mode of the Olympus
      Indocyanine Green Imaging System was activated and suspected areas in Indocyanine Green
      imaging mode were recorded with their corresponding appearance in white light mode.

      If suspected areas were visible either in white light or Indocyanine Green imaging mode,
      specific sample has been taken from these areas.

      In addition control biopsy specimens from inconspicuous peritoneum has been taken.

    <description>All the enrolled patients met the inclusion criteria. No patients have been excluded from the study. All patient have been subjected, during laparoscopy, to an accurate inspection of the abdomen and all the visible endometriotic lesions have been described. Subsequently, 0.25 mg /(kg BW) Indocyanine Green were administered intravenously during surgery and a second look of the abdomen and pelvis with the Near Infrared Vision has been made, in order to identify the fluorescent lesions. All the lesions has been described and localized pre and post the Indocyanine Green injection and then removed and properly cataloged</description>
