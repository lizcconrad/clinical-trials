      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability and of
      BGB-3111plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab alone in subjects with relapsed/refractory
      non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma.

      This is an open-label, randomized active control study of BGB-3111 plus obinutuzumab versus
      obinutuzumab alone in subjects with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. Randomization
      is 2:1 and subjects will be stratified by the number of prior lines of therapy (2 - 3 vs &gt; 3)
      and rituximab-refractory status. The study will evaluate the efficacy, as measured by overall
      response rate by independent review, safety and tolerability. Pharmacokinetic profile of
      BGB-3111 and obinutuzumab combination therapy will also be evaluated.
