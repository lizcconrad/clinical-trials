  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test whether the application of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) concurrent with fluency training results in improvements in speech fluency in adults
      with developmental stuttering, measured up to three months after the intervention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developmental stuttering affects 5% of children and persists to adulthood in about 1%.
      Changing the way speech is produced in adults who stutter is a particular challenge for
      speech and language therapy and there is a need for novel interventions. One such
      intervention involves the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      alongside therapies aimed at improving speech fluency. tDCS influences brain activity by
      modulating neuronal plasticity through the application of weak electrical currents across the
      brain. Pairing tDCS with speech therapy has potential for producing larger or longer lasting
      effects and reducing time spent in therapy.

      The study will evaluate the potential of tDCS combined with speech fluency training to
      improve outcomes in people who stutter (PWS). PWS will have this training while receiving
      tDCS for five days (1 milliampere [mA] for 20 mins per day) in a double-blind randomized
      controlled trial. Outcomes will be measured in terms of changes to stuttering severity.

      An additional research questions is how changes in interactions between sensory and motor
      brain regions relate to changes in speech fluency in PWS. MRI will be used to measure brain
      structure and function and the vocal tract during speech production. Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) will assess motor excitability before and after the training.

    <masking_description>A researcher from another research group who is not involved in any aspect of the trial will perform the randomisation of participants into the sham and tDCS study arms using a minimisation procedure within randPack package in R (Carey and Gentleman, 2016). Allocation concealment will be achieved by assigning a unique 5-digit code per participant (containing no identifying information regarding trial arm). This will be emailed to the researcher. The code is used to deliver stimulation via study mode on the stimulator (http://www.neurocaregroup.com/dc_stimulator_plus.html). The participants and the researchers who will deliver the intervention, assess the outcomes, and analyse the data will be masked to trial arm.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Stuttering Severity Instrument (SSI-4) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the end of the 5-day intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stuttering Severity Instrument (SSI-4) is a standardised measure of stuttering severity comprised of 3 sub-scores (frequency, duration and physical concomitants) which are summed to give a total score. We will use change from baseline in total score (i.e. baseline subtracted) on the Stuttering Severity Instrument version 4 measured post intervention. The maximum total score of the SSI-4 is 56, which corresponds to the highest stuttering severity. Therefore, larger negative change scores represent better outcomes (larger reductions in stuttering severity).</description>

    <measure>Change in Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 12 weeks after the end of the 5-day intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES) is a standardised self-assessment to measure the effect of stuttering on a person's life, comprising of 4 sub-scores (general information about speech, your reactions to stuttering, communication in daily situations, quality of life). The total score (out of a possible 500) is divided by the number of items (out of a possible 100. Note that some items may not apply to all participants). This gives a total impact score between 1 and 5, with 5 representing the highest negative impact on person's life.
We will use change from baseline in total score (i.e. baseline subtracted) on the OASES total impact score, measured post intervention, as an outcome. Larger negative change scores represent better outcomes (larger reductions in negative impact of stuttering ).</description>
