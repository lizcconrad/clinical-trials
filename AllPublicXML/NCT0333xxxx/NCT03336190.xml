  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate an interactive training program for
      military-connected caregivers (MCCs) of wounded warriors. The program leverages existing
      resources and incorporates evidence-based training and peer-based support networks to enhance
      continuity of care. The program consists of an educational Toolkit (workbook) and an avatar
      training interaction where an MCC can practice skills learned from the toolkit training with
      the avatar (how to navigate difficult conversations). This is an educational training
      evaluation to determine whether or not avatar interaction can effectively improve health
      outcomes in MCCs.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate an interactive training program for
      military-connected caregivers (MCCs) of wounded warriors. The program leverages existing
      resources and incorporates evidence-based training and peer-based support networks to enhance
      continuity of care. The program consists of an educational Toolkit (workbook) and an avatar
      training interaction where an MCC can practice skills learned from the toolkit training with
      the avatar (how to navigate difficult conversations). This is an educational training
      evaluation to determine whether or not avatar interaction can effectively improve health
      outcomes in MCCs.

      The investigators will implement a between subjects design looking at two groups of
      caregivers across multiple time points examining differences between groups and changes in
      the outcomes from baseline (before engaging in the training/intervention) to after completing
      the training, including follow-ups at 3- and 6-months to evaluate longer-term outcomes. The
      groups include an experimental group who will receive the complete training program (toolkit
      and avatar) and a control group who will receive the avatar PLUS additional self-care
      (toolkit and avatar PLUS extra self-care).

      Project participants (i.e., MCCs who engage in the training and follow-up activities) will
      receive the (a) training toolkit workshop and will engage with the avatar to practice the
      knowledge and skills described in the workshop or will receive only the (b) training toolkit
      workshop (control). Each scheduled workshop will be randomized to either the experimental
      (full training program) or control (avatar plus extra self-care).

      Comparing the groups and time differences will enable us to determine if the training
      program, specifically the avatar interaction, is associated with improved health and quality
      of life in caregivers of wounded warriors, enhanced caregiver social support and networks,
      improved patient (wounded warrior) experience of care, and reduced per capita costs of care
      for both the wounded warrior and caregiver.

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess changes between baseline and 3 &amp; 6 month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief version (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original instrument that may be more convenient for use in large research studies or clinical trials. The WHOQOL-BREF (Field Trial Version) produces a quality of life profile. It is possible to derive four domain scores. There are also two items that are examined separately: question 1 asks about an individual's overall perception of quality of life and question 2 asks about an individual's overall perception of their health. The four domain scores denote an individual's perception of quality of life in each particular domain. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score -</description>

    <time_frame>Assess changes between baseline and 3 &amp; 6 month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, military version. Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988) is a 12-item self-report measure that inquires about three dimensions of social relationships (family, friends, and a significant other) on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = very strongly disagree to 7 = very strongly agree). Higher scores on each of the subscales indicate higher levels of perceived support. A Global satisfaction with perceived support score can be obtained by taking the sum of the three scales. The current study added a fourth dimension relevant to military personnel that assessed sources of social support from military peers.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>

    <description>Patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-2. Frequency of depressive symptoms were assessed with the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0-3; higher scores indicate greater symptoms. Respondents then indicate the difficulty the symptoms have made their life on a 4 point scale, where high scores indicate greater difficulty.</description>

For scoring, response options for these two symptoms are coded as 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;), 1 (&quot;several days&quot;), or 2 (&quot;more than half the days&quot; or &quot;nearly every day&quot;). Thus, the total PHQ-15 score ranges from 0 to 30 and scores of ≥5, ≥10, ≥15 represent mild, moderate and severe levels of somatization.</description>

    <description>12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). SF-12 measures physical functioning, role limitation due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation due to emotional problems, and mental health. 2 items are used to estimate scores for four of the 8 health concepts (physical functioning: 0-5 where higher indicates more limited), role-physical: 0-3 where higher indicates more limited, role-emotional: 0-3 where higher indicates more limited, mental health: 0-11 where higher indicates more problems). Scores for the remaining 4 (bodily pain: 0-4 where higher indicates more problems, general health: 0-4 where higher indicates more problems, vitality, and social functioning: 0-4 where higher indicates more problems) are estimated using a single item each.</description>

Respondents were asked about their use of professional physical or mental health services and about perceived barriers to physical and mental health treatment, particularly stigmatization as a result of receiving such treatment. Items are rated on a 2 point scale where higher scores indicate barriers. Overall scores range from 0-15 where higher scores indicate more barriers.</description>
