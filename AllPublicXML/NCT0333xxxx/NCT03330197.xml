  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single tumor
      injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex in the pediatric population.

      Eligible patients will be stratified to one of two arms, according to clinical indication for
      tumor resection. Pediatric patients who are scheduled for craniotomy and tumor resection will
      receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 will be
      administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      Pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) will receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 by
      stereotactic injection and then will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
