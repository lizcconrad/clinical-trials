      The goal of this study is to evaluate a tactile prosthesis that provide individuals who have
      demonstrated chronic imbalance with help to maintain a correct sense of orientation with
      respect to the gravity and improve posture control. Chronic imbalance leads to significant
      problems. This study is designed to evaluate a device which can potentially improve the
      balance of these patients.

      The participant will be asked to come to Washington University on two occasions (pre- and
      post-trial) for approximately 2 hours. Between visits, they will be asked to use the device
      daily (intervention group) or to not use the device (control group) for a prescribed period
      of time doing different activities. They will be provided written instructions from a
      physical therapist that will be determined by their individual ability. The activities will
      be typical exercises that are given to people with balance disorders.

      On their first visit (week 1) participants will be asked to complete the same kind of tests
      that evaluated the function of their balance system at the time of their diagnosis. They will
      have their eye movements recorded using goggles and an infra-red camera while the prosthesis
      is in place and providing vibration feedback. Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP)
      testing will require them to stand on a platform and perform tests (20 seconds each) with
      their eyes open or closed, with the platform moving or still, and/or with the visual surround
      either stable or moving. They will be fitted with a safety harness that will keep them from
      falling. Next the investigators will evaluate their ability to perform movement tasks while
      walking (walking down the hall, walking down the hall avoiding objects, changing speeds while
      walking, going up and down stairs etc). They will walk a 25-foot distance at a comfortable
      gait speed, and again at a maximum gait speed. Lastly, they will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires.

      On their last visit they will repeat the evaluations that were performed during the first
      visit.

    <description>Participants will be asked to perform a series of appropriate exercises daily at home wearing the BALCAP prosthesis for a period of 6 weeks. The training exercises will include: (1) standing on a firm surface with feet apart, eyes open and closed; (2) standing on a firm surface with feet together, eyes open and closed; (3) standing on thick footing (e.g., multiple pairs of socks) with feet apart, eyes open and closed; (4) standing on thick footing with feet together, eyes open and closed; (5) standing in a modified Romberg position on a firm surface, eyes open and closed; (6) standing in a Romberg position on a firm surface, eyes open and closed; (7) walking on a firm surface eyes open; (8) walking with thick footing, eyes open; (9) walking with head turns and tilts, eyes open; and (10) walking around a room, incorporating turns and movements other than straight forward walking, eyes open.</description>
