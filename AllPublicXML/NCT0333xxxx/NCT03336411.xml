  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-phase, randomized clinical trial will be to examine the effects of two
      behavioral weight loss interventions on weight loss. This study will be conducted in 200
      overweight or obese prediabetic individuals recruited from community-based settings.. Phase 1
      will include 6-months of active intervention. Phase 2 will consist of 6-months of maintenance
      and observation. Measurements will occur at screening, baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
      Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to 2 groups: (1) a standardized
      behavioral weight loss intervention with a one-size-fits-all regimen that includes counseling
      about restriction of calories and calories from fat, and physical activity, delivered using
      mHealth technology, or (2) all of the elements of mHealth, plus personalized dietary
      recommendations to minimize glycemic response to meals. Participants will be required to
      attend 6 separate visits over both phases of the study.
