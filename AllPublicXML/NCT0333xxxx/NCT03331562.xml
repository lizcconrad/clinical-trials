  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy regimens for pancreatic cancer can now stabilize a patient's cancer and/or place
      some patients in remission or partial remission. The challenge now is to find options for
      maintenance therapies that will improve survival and allow continued benefits with minimal
      toxicities and inconvenience to the patients. This study will determine the effects of one
      possible maintenance regimen.

      The study is being conducted to determine the effects that pembrolizumab with or without the
      addition of paricalcitol may have on pancreatic cancer. Half of the patients will be
      randomized to receive pembrolizumab + paricalcitol and half to receive pembrolizumab +
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab (also known as Keytruda®), which is approved in the USA and some other
      countries, is available by prescription to treat several different cancers, but has not been
      approved to treat pancreatic cancer. Pembrolizumab helps the body detect and fight cancer by
      making cancer cells more vulnerable to attack by the body's immune system. This medication
      binds to and lessens the action of specific parts of cells in the body's immune system, which
      act to modulate or balance the immune response. By decreasing this modulation of the immune
      response, the body's own system may be better able to fight the cancer. Pembrolizumab is
      known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

      It is thought that the effect of pembrolizumab could possibly be strengthened by the addition
      of paricalcitol, which is a form of vitamin D. Paricalcitol may make the cells in the immune
      system more sensitive to the activity of pembrolizumab and could make the local environment
      hostile to the cancer cells. Both activities could be effective against cancer growth.

      Paricalcitol (also known as Zemplar®) is used to treat high levels of parathyroid hormone and
      prevent bone loss in patients with advanced kidney disease. Paricalcitol is not approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      The effects of the study drugs will be assessed by repeated radiological imaging (CT scans),
      incidence of adverse reactions, and survival rates.

      Participants will also be asked to provide biological specimens for the study team to measure
      cellular changes. This will include fecal matter (stool), blood, and tumor tissue.

      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that this study meets the requirements
      for Investigational New Drug (IND) Exemption.

             Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

             Note: Without known history testing needs to be performed to determine eligibility.

         19. Current, serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the
             investigator, or patient receiving a digitalis derivative.
