  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of a home-visiting program, called &quot;Family Spirit
      Nurture&quot; (FSN), on reducing early childhood obesity in American Indian (AI) children. The FSN
      intervention targets parent feeding practices, young children's diet and physical activity
      (PA) and early childhood (0-2 years of age) weight status, all associated with risk for early
      childhood obesity and, consequently, risk for obesity over the life course. The investigators
      will also explore whether maternal psychosocial factors (stress, depression and substance
      use), household food/water security and/or constrained physical activity environments
      moderate FSN intervention impacts on: mother's feeding behaviors for infants and toddlers;
      and, children's diets, PA patterns, and weight status. Finally, the investigators will
      examine how maternal/infant characteristics, diet and behaviors impact the underlying
      biologic mechanisms of early childhood obesity and whether social and behavioral
      interventions can impact infant metabolic health. The investigators evaluation will employ a
      randomized controlled design, in which both the intervention and comparison condition receive
      assisted transportation to prenatal and well-baby visits (called &quot;Optimized Standard Care&quot;),
      and the comparison condition also receives potentially beneficial injury prevention education
      at 8 assessment visits.

      Primary Aims:

      Efficacy of Family Spirit Nurture (FSN) + Optimized Standard Care (OSC) versus Injury
      Prevention Education (IPE) + OSC will be assessed for each of the following from birth to 24
      months postpartum:

      Aim 1. Mothers' implementation of recommended feeding behaviors. Hypothesis 1. FSN + OSC
      mothers will be more likely to meet breastfeeding and complementary feeding recommendations
      and engage in responsive parenting/feeding behaviors compared to IPE + OSC mothers.

      Aim 2. Children's consumption of healthy diet and physical activity engagement. Hypothesis 2.
      FSN + OSC children will consume more fruits and vegetables and fewer calories from sugar
      sweetened beverages (SSB), snacks and desserts, and they will have higher physical activity
      and reduced screen time/other sedentary activities compared to IPE + OSC children.

      Aim 3. Children's weight status. Hypothesis 3. Mean BMI z-scores for FSN + OSC children will
      be closer to zero (the mean age- and sex- specific BMI z-score for the World Health
      Organization standard reference population) compared to IPE + OSC children.

      Secondary Aims:

      Secondary Aim 1. To explore whether maternal psychosocial factors (stress, depression and
      substance use), and household food/beverage security and/or constrained physical activity
      environments moderate FSN intervention impacts on: infant and young children's feeding
      behaviors; and, infant/young children's diets, PA patterns, and weight status.

      Secondary Aim 2. To explore how maternal/infant characteristics, diet and behaviors impact
      the underlying biologic mechanisms of early childhood obesity, and whether social and
      behavioral interventions can impact infant metabolic health.

      Aim 2a. At delivery, examine how measures of infant metabolic health (fasting glucose,
      insulin, leptin, adiponectin, lipids, and c-reactive protein) are a) correlated with maternal
      biologic measures of metabolic health (fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, lipids,
      and c-reactive protein) and b) are impacted by sociodemographic, biological and psychosocial
      characteristics of mothers at baseline (e.g. age, parity, water/food security, BMI,
      gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, depression, perceived stress). Hypothesis:
      Infant biologic measures of metabolic health will be highly correlated with maternal levels
      of metabolic health at birth and will vary by maternal baseline characteristics.

      Aim 2b. Between delivery and 12 months postpartum, examine how biologic measures of infant
      metabolic health change in relation to a) maternal biologic measures of metabolic health, b)
      sociodemographic, biological and psychosocial characteristics of mothers at baseline, and c)
      maternal/infant behaviors (e.g. responsive feeding practices, infant diet, introduction of
      sugar-sweetened beverages, early physical activity, etc.). Hypothesis: Biologic measures of
      infant metabolic health over the first 12 months of life will begin to diverge from maternal
      levels; and, infant metabolic health between delivery and 12 months postpartum will vary by
      maternal baseline characteristics and maternal/infant behaviors across study groups.

      Aim 2c. Infant metabolic health. Hypothesis: FSN + OSC infants will have better metabolic
      health (defined by fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, lipid and c-reactive
      protein levels) at 12 months postpartum compared with IPE + OSC infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized 1:1 controlled trial with 338 mothers (ages 14 to
      22) and their children (ages 0-24 months) living in the three study sites (2 Navajo; 1
      Apache). Assessments in both groups will occur at baseline (&lt; 32 weeks gestation), 36 weeks
      gestation, delivery (blood sample collection only), 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9
      months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months postpartum.

      Intervention: The intervention group (n=169) will receive the FSN + OSC. OSC consists of
      transportation assistance to prenatal and well-baby clinic visits as recommended by the
      Indian Health Service (IHS) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and rescue services
      through linkages to community agencies as needed. The FSN home-visiting module consists of 36
      60-minute lessons delivered by trained local FHCs, from 28 weeks gestation to 18 months
      postpartum. The lessons will be delivered bi-weekly from 28 weeks gestation to birth, weekly
      from birth to 3 months postpartum, bi-weekly from 3 to 6 months postpartum and monthly from 6
      to 18 months postpartum. The lessons focus on three key content domains: 1) promotion of
      optimal breastfeeding, complementary and responsive feeding across early childhood; 2)
      promotion of healthy infant/toddler diet and physical activity, as well as reduced screen
      time and sedentary lifestyle; and 3) promotion of maternal psychosocial well-being,
      optimization of healthy food/beverage availability and identification/creation of safe play
      spaces in the home environment.

      Comparison Condition: The comparison group will receive IPE + OSC. The IPE home-visiting
      module consists of 8 30-minute lessons delivered by trained local Family Health Liaisons
      (FHL), from 28 weeks gestation to 18 months postpartum. The lessons will be delivered at the
      following assessment time points: 36 weeks gestation, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months,
      9 months, 12 months, and 18 months postpartum. Injury prevention lessons focus on injury
      prevention topics relevant to the participating communities but that will not overlap in
      anyway with FSN content, including: motor vehicle safety for mothers and children; preventing
      scald burns; fire safety; child-proofing a home; preventing falls; preventing poisonings; and
      preventing animal bites.

      OSC transportation visits for both the intervention and comparison groups include
      transportation for up to 6 prenatal visits from 28 weeks gestation to birth and 8 well-baby
      visits during the first 18 months of life. OSC was selected because it optimizes the standard
      of care for young mothers and their children within reservation communities, addresses
      transportation and access barriers, provides beneficial and ecologically-valid services in
      the participants' settings, and was previously approved and endorsed by Community Advisory
      Boards and tribal Institutional Review Boards. By providing OSC to both intervention and
      control groups, the quality and dose of OSC is controlled so differences between study arms
      can be validly attributed to the FSN intervention. Two hours is allotted for each OSC visit
      (for transportation and waiting at clinic visit) x 14 visits = 28 hours of
      obstetric/pediatric care support. OSC visits will also be used to administer maternal
      self-reports at relevant time points for both study arms.

      Both the intervention and comparison condition participants will receive a follow-up
      assessment at 24 months, but no education sessions will take place with either study group
      between 18 and 24 months postpartum.

    <measure>Group differences in percentage of mothers who meet breastfeeding and complementary feeding recommendations and percentage of mothers who introduce sugar sweetened beverages over time as assessed by the Child Feeding Assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks - 24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers will be asked questions from an adapted version of the Pre-School-Aged Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ-15) in addition to items developed by the study team and based on previous studies conducted by the co-investigators. The assessment will be used to assess feeding practices, duration of exclusive and non-exclusive breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods and types of first foods, and introduction of SSBs among infants/toddlers, including questions about the frequency and amount of child's beverage intake</description>

    <measure>Group differences in mean scores for infant feeding style subscales assessed using the Infant Feeding Behavior Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months-12 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The Infant Feeding Behavior Questionnaire (IFBQ) (administered at 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum) asks mothers to indicate how often they engage in specific feeding behaviors to assess maternal feeding styles. There are 5 subscales that are used to assess maternal feeding style; Responsive, Forceful, Restrictive, Indulgent, and Uninvolved. There is no total scale score. The assessment is valid and reliable. This 24-item scale is scored with a 3-point Likert scale. A mean score is calculated for each subscale, with a range of 0 to 2. The range of the 3-point Likert scale is as follows: 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (always). Higher scores reflect higher levels of feeding style indicated by a given subscale. So, for example, for responsive feeding a higher score would be better, and for forceful feeding a higher score would be worse.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The TFBQ (administered at 24 months postpartum) asks mothers to indicate how often they engage in specific feeding behaviors to assess maternal feeding styles. There are 5 subscales that are used to assess maternal feeding style; Responsive, Forceful, Restrictive, Indulgent, and Uninvolved. There is no total scale score. The assessment is valid and reliable. This 27-item scale is scored with a 3-point Likert scale. A mean score is calculated for each subscale, with a range of 0 to 2. The range of the 3-point Likert scale is as follows: 0 (never), 1 (sometimes), 2 (always). Higher scores reflect higher levels of feeding style indicated by a given subscale. So, for example, for responsive feeding a higher score would be better, and for forceful feeding a higher score would be worse.</description>

    <measure>Group differences in children's consumption of fruit and vegetable intake from sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), snacks, and desserts over time as assessed by the USDA Household Food Security Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers will be asked questions about her child's fruit and vegetable consumption beginning at 6 months postpartum and at all subsequent time points. These items have been added to a standardized 18-item U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food security survey, the U.S. Household Food Security Survey, that measures household food security. Fruit and vegetable consumption will be measured by asking mothers how much and how often her child eats fruits and vegetables and whether she feels she is able to provide her child with the fruits and vegetables he or she needs. To obtain weekly fruit and vegetable servings consumption, the number of times per week fruits or vegetables are consumed will be multiplied by the number of servings consumed each time. Serving size will be age adjusted.</description>

    <measure>Group differences in children's physical activity levels as assessed by accelerometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months-24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Child's PA will be measured objectively using accelerometry. We will use the Actical accelerometer (formerly MiniMitter Co, Philips Respironics, Bend, OR), a small waterproof device (28x27x10mm) weighing 17g, which is omnidirectional (sensing motion in all planes), and integrates the degree and intensity of motion. We will use procedures co-investigators have used successfully in previous studies of young adolescents, toddlers and their mothers, placing the accelerometer on the non-dominant ankle with a non-removable, reinforced hospital band worn next to the skin, under socks, for 7 consecutive days. Accelerometers will be attached on the day of the 18- and 24-month assessment battery and removed one week later. Data will be collected in 1-minute epochs. The time-stamped data will be examined. Summary statistics will include average and total activity counts and minutes in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)</description>

    <measure>Group differences in children's mean BMI z-scores over time as assessed through child weight and length measurements over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks-24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Child weight (to the nearest ounce) and recumbent length (to the nearest 1/8 inch) will be measured using a digital scale and a recumbent measuring board (in accordance with IHS guidelines). All measurements will be taken in triplicate, removing the most disparate measurement, and averaging the remaining two. Averages will be used to calculate BMI z-scores using age- and sex-specific World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards.</description>

    <measure>Group differences in levels of maternal stress over time as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4).</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;32 weeks gestation-24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Completed by mothers, the 4-item questionnaire will assess maternal stress. This 4-item scale is scored with a 5-point Likert scale. The range of the 5-point Likert scale is as follows: 0 (never), 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (fairly often), 4 (very often). We will reverse scores for items 2 and 3. On these questions, the scores will be as follows: 4 (never), 3 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 1 (fairly often), 0 (very often). Scores for each item will be summed to get a total score. The lowest score is 0 and the highest score is 16. Higher scores are correlated to more stress (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Group differences in depression scores over time as assessed by the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10 (CESDR-10).</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;32 weeks gestation-24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item questionnaire is a validated adapted version of the CESD-R (which has been utilized to assess depression with Navajo mothers) to screen for depression in adolescents. The questionnaire asks participants to rate how often over the past two weeks have they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling sad. Response options range from 0 to 4 for each item, with 0 = not at all or less than 1 day in the last 2 weeks, 1 = 1-2 Days, 2 = 3-4 Days, 3 = 5-7 Days, 4 = Nearly every day for 2 weeks. Scores for each item will be summed to get a total score. Scores range from 0 to 40, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms (worse outcome). A CESD-R score of 8 or greater indicates individuals at risk for clinical depression.</description>

    <measure>Group differences in alcohol and drug use over time as assessed by the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST).</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;32 weeks gestation-24 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Adapted from WHO ASSIST questionnaire covering 10 main substance groups, this 15-item questionnaire screens for all levels of problem or risky substance use (alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription drugs). A risk score is provided for each substance, and scores are grouped into low, moderate, or high risk. Only items 2-7 and 9-14 are scored. Each question has a set of responses to choose from and each response has a numerical score. The scores from questions 2-7 and questions 9-14 are added together to produce an ASSIST risk score for each substance that falls into 1 of 3 categories: low, moderate, or high substance-related risk. Participants with risk scores 3 or less are at lower risk of problems related to their substance use. Participants scoring between 4 and 26 are at moderate risk and may be experiencing some of these problems right now. A score of 27 or higher for any substance suggests that the participant is at high risk of dependence/dependent on that substance.</description>

    <time_frame>Delivery-6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Blood specimens will be collected from mothers at delivery and 6 months postpartum. Blood specimens will be collected from infants at delivery (cord blood), 6 and 12 months postpartum. Laboratory testing will be completed to assess levels of fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, lipids panels, and c-reactive protein in mothers and babies to examine how infant metabolic health relates to maternal metabolic health at delivery, and whether there are between group differences in this relationship over time. In all cases, higher levels indicate poorer metabolic health.</description>
