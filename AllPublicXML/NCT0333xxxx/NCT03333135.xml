      Subjects will be asked to undertake three (3) sets of assessments at prescribed time
      intervals: Baseline (at 72-24h prior to each event), immediately post (within 2h of race
      completion) and during recovery (within 24-48h of race completion). Each assessment will
      consist of 1)lung function tests; 2) a saliva and blood sample; 3) a lung and cardiac
      ultrasound. Subjects will be recruited from a range of age groups and fitness levels, before
      being divided into a sham or treatment group. Both groups will use a commercially available
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy device (50% of devices will not produce
      electromagnetic fields - i.e., sham device) before the event and during recovery.

    <time_frame>baseline, within 2 hours of race completion, 24-48 hours post race</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac ultrasound (Philips CX50) will be performed to determine left and right ventricular morphology and function. Ultrasound will be performed in accordance with the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (ASE). Imaging of the ventricles and the diameter during relaxation (diastole) will be captured and evaluated. Normal value for right ventricle EDA indexed to body surface area ranges between 5-12.6 cm^2/m^2 for males and 4.5-11.5 cm^2/m^2 for females .</description>

    <measure>Change in exhaled nitric oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, within 2 hours of race completion, 24-48 hours post race</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of nitric oxide in ones exhaled air will be measured by a handheld device. Levels under 25 parts per billion are normal, more than 35 parts per billion would be a sign of airway inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Change in hemoglobin</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, within 2 hours of race completion, 24-48 hours post race</time_frame>

For males normal range for hemoglobin is 13.5-17.5 grams per deciliter and for females normal range for hemoglobin is 12.0-15.5 grams per deciliter. Low values means anemia is present and higher levels is a normal response to altitude.</description>
