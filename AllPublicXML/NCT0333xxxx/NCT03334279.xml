  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to detect P53 expression in clinically normal oral mucosa of
      cigarette smokers, simultaneous cigarette and cannabis smokers and non-smokers as a surrogate
      marker for field cancerization.

      1- Intervention: A.K. will collect specimens from cigarette smokers and simultaneous
      cigarette and cannabis smokers. then the expression of p53 as a marker for field
      cancerization will be investigated in formaline fixed paraffine embedded specimens of mucosal
      biopsies obtained from the oral mucosa of both groups.

      2-comparator: mucosal biopsies from non smokers will be investigated as a copmaratitive to
      smokers group.
