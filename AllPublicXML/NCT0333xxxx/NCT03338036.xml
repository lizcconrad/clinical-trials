    <textblock>
      Most concussions resolve within 7-10 days, but approximately 40% of individuals do not fully
      recover and suffer from persistent post-concussive symptoms. This 8-week intervention study
      will evaluate the efficacy of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and neurofeedback on
      reducing the number and severity of concussion symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40% of minor head injuries are diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome 3 months after injury
      (Ingebrigtsen, Waterloo, Marup-Jensen, Attner, &amp; Romner, 1998). These individuals have
      persistent symptoms after completing conventional rehabilitation programs. Persistent
      post-concussion symptoms not only decrease quality of life (Ingebrigtsen et al, 1998), but
      also impair cognitive and motor performance and increase the likelihood of impaired driving
      performance (Preece, Horswill, &amp; Geffen, 2010) and motor vehicle accidents (Bivona et al,
      2012). While case reports indicate that biofeedback can reduce the number and severity of
      post-concussive symptoms (Lagos, Thompson, &amp; Vaschillo, 2013; Thompson, Thompson, Reid-Chung,
      &amp; Thompson, 2013), no studies have systematically evaluated these biofeedback treatment
      programs.

      HRV biofeedback works by displaying beat-to-beat heart rate data to the participant, and
      through operant conditioning with breathing techniques, the participant learns to control
      their HRV (Lehrer &amp; Gevirtz, 2014). This results in an increase in parasympathetic (PNS)
      activity and decrease in sympathetic (SNS) activity, which leads to reduced anxiety, and
      increased focus and concentration (Lagos, Bottiglieri, Vaschillo, &amp; Vaschillo, 2012).
      Neurofeedback works in a similar fashion, except it monitors brain wave power, frequency, and
      connectivity using quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain functioning is displayed
      while playing an electronic game, and the participant learns through operant conditioning to
      increase the amplitude of desired EEG frequencies, such as low beta waves that are associated
      with active problem solving, usually while simultaneously decreasing the amplitudes of
      undesired EEG frequencies (Conder &amp; Conder, 2014).

      This will be an eight-week intervention where participants suffering from long-term
      post-concussion symptoms will be recruited using email from the cohort of individuals that
      have been discharged after completing a concussion rehabilitation protocol (BrainEx90) at
      Parkwood Institute in London, Ontario. Non-concussed control participants will be recruited
      using posters. Participants will complete pre, mid, and post-intervention driving simulation
      tasks, electrocardiogram and HRV measures, and subjective questionnaires. These will be
      utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of HRV biofeedback and neurofeedback in this difficult
      to treat population.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will include two intervention arms and two control arms. The intervention arms will include 1) heart rate variability biofeedback, 2) a combination of heart rate variability biofeedback and neurofeedback. The control arms will be 1) age-matched post-concussive individuals and 2) age-matched individuals who have not been diagnosed with a concussion in the last two years.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The interval between heartbeats, specifically the artifact-free intervals between R waves in the QRS complex, will be measured. This is known as the standard deviation of the norm (SDNN), and is a universal method of quantifying HRV (Camm et al., 1996). This information is collected using the Mindja application for android devices, created by Evoke Neuroscience.</description>

    <description>These are assessed using the Rivermead Post Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ). It evaluates the severity of 16 common post-concussion symptoms over the past 24 hours (with the option to add 2 additional symptoms not already listed). Some examples include headache, sleep disturbance, noise sensitivity and blurred vision. It asks the evaluator to compare each symptom to how they would &quot;normally&quot; have felt prior to the concussion. It is a 5-point scale, which goes from 0-4. When the symptom is not experienced at all, the evaluator is to put a 0 (better outcome), whereas 4 indicates the symptom is a severe problem (worse outcome). The total from each symptom can be summed for a total score out of 72, whereas 72 represents experiencing all symptoms, and they are all a severe problem (worse outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, mid-intervention (4 weeks) and post-intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7). Seven anxiety symptoms experienced over the past 2 weeks are evaluated on a 4-point scale, which goes from 0-3. Some examples include feeling nervous or anxious, inability to stop worrying, and trouble relaxing. When the symptom is not experienced at all, the evaluator is to put a 0 (better outcome), whereas 3 indicates the symptom is experienced nearly every day (worse outcome). The total from each symptom can be summed for a total score out of 21, whereas 21 represents experiencing all symptoms, and they are all experienced nearly every day (worse outcome).</description>
