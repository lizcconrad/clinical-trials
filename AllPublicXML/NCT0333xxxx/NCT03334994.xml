  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of current study to evaluate connective tissue graft combined with immediate implant
      placement as an innovative option for less facial gingival tissue recession, less pocket
      depth and less clinical attachment loss versus immediate implant alone.

      P- Adult patients with single or multiple non-restorable teeth in esthetic zone.

      I- Immediate implant + Connective tissue graft. C- Immediate implant alone. O- Primary
      Outcome: Facial gingival level Secondary Outcome: Patient satisfaction, Pocket depth and
      Clinical attachment loss.

      P.M will select patients from the outpatient clinic of the Oral Medicine and Periodontology
      Department - Cairo University. Screening of patients will continue until the target
      population is achieved. Identifying and recruiting potential subjects is achieved through
      patient database.
