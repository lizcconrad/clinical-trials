    <textblock>
      The Apple Heart Study (AHS) is a research study conducted to evaluate whether the Apple Heart
      Study App can use data collected on the Apple Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms,
      including those from potentially serious heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Up to
      500,000 can participate in the study.
