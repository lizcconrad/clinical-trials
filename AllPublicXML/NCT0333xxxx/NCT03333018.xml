    <textblock>
      DUS1 and DUS2 are descriptive drug utilisation studies in new users of aclidinium bromide in
      Europe.

      The objectives of DUS1 and DUS2 are to describe the characteristics and patterns of use of
      new users of aclidinium bromide (monotherapy or in combination) and new users of other
      medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); to evaluate the potential
      off-label use of aclidinium bromide; to describe users of aclidinium bromide in subgroups of
      patients for whom there is missing information in the risk management plan (RMP); and to
      establish a core cohort of new users of aclidinium bromide for the future evaluation of
      safety concerns described in the RMP.

      The data source for these studies will be the CRPD in the UK, the GePaRD in Germany, and
      national health databases in Denmark.

  <detailed_description>

      DUS1 will be conducted when the target number of new users of aclidinium monotherapy is
      reached, and DUS2 when the target number of new users of aclidinium fixed-dose combination
      with formoterol is reached.

      As this was a descriptive study no primary or secondary endpoints were specified.

        New users of aclidinium bromide (on monotherapy or with concomitant use of formoterol) and

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in the study will be required to meet the following criteria, as ascertained
             from each of the automated databases:

          -  To have at least 1 year of enrolment in the database (DUS1 and DUS2).

          -  To have not been prescribed aclidinium bromide as monotherapy or with concomitant use
             of formoterol during the 6 months before the date of first prescription of aclidinium
             bromide (index date) in DUS1

          -  To have not been prescribed aclidinium bromide as monotherapy, with concomitant use of
             formoterol, or as aclidinium/formoterol during the 6 months before the date of first
             prescription of aclidinium bromide (index date) in DUS2

        The same inclusion criteria will be applied for each of the comparator drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No age restrictions or exclusion criteria will be applied. This will allow for the
             characterisation of all users of aclidinium bromide and comparator drugs irrespective
             of the indication for which these medications are used. Identification of potential
             off-label use of aclidinium bromide in the paediatric and adult populations is one of
             the specific objectives of this DUS.
