The patient will be asked to score how difficult he/she feels it is to perform such activities using a 0 to 3 scoring (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do). If the patient is using assistance for any of these activities, scoring may be adjusted. For each category, the highest score given for one of the question is attributed to the category. The total score is the sum of all categories' scores divided by the number of answered categories (at least 3 categories should be answered)</description>
