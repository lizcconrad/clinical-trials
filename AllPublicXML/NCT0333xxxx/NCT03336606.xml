  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is the first to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a humanized OX40
      agonist, MEDI0562, in the pre-operative setting for patients with head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma or melanoma.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two MEDI0562 administration schedules; initially
      5 patients will enroll to each cohort. All patients will have a tumor biopsy before
      administration of MEDI0562 and surgery will be performed on approximately day 15 (+/- 2
      days).

      There will be a comparison of a surgical specimen to the original biopsy focusing on the
      composition and immunologic phenotypes of lymphocyte subsets. Although the primary endpoint
      of this study is immunological, valuable exploratory data on clinical outcomes will also be
      obtained.

      Both the HNSCC and the melanoma patients to be enrolled on this trial are anticipated to have
      a 50 - 90% probability of recurrence within 5 years after surgery, even with current
      state-of-the-art post-surgical adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. A
      recurrence of 25% or less within the 12 months after surgery will be deemed of clinical
      interest and would inform the design of a larger follow-up study.
