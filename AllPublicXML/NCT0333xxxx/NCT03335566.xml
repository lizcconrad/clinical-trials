  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Sonazoid™ and SonoVue® in
      participants with focal liver lesions (FLLs), by comparing pre-and post-contrast ultrasound
      examination findings with regard to various aspects of lesion diagnosis including diagnosis
      as benign versus malignant, specific lesion diagnosis, confidence in diagnosis, and quality
      of delineation of lesion-related blood vessels (from images obtained during vascular imaging)
      and detection of lesion presence and quality of delineation of the whole liver (from images
      obtained during whole liver imaging).

    <measure>Accuracy Improvement with Post-Contrast Versus Pre-Contrast Ultrasound (US) Examination for Diagnosis of the Target Lesion as Malignant or Benign Against the Reference Diagnosis (RD)/Standard of Truth</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-administration up to 15 minutes post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy improvement is calculated by the number of participants with improved diagnoses from the pre-contrast diagnosis to the post-contrast diagnosis divided by the total number of participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Lesions Detected by Post-Contrast US Relative to Number of Lesions Detected by Pre-Contrast US (Both by Blinded Readers[BR]) and Number of Lesions Detected by Post-Contrast US (by BR) Relative to Number of Lesions Detected by RD (Investigators)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-administration up to 15 minutes post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>For the cases that can be assessed by the blinded readers both pre- and post-contrast, differences will be calculated between the Sonazoid™ and SonoVue® groups in the number of lesions detected during whole-liver imaging (post-contrast minus pre-contrast). The differences will also be calculated between the Sonazoid™ and SonoVue® groups in the number of lesions (post-contrast minus reference diagnosis) detected during whole-liver imaging.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic Confidence (Evaluated by Blinded Readers) in Pre-Contrast and Post-Contrast Ultrasound Examination Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-administration up to 15 minutes post-administration</time_frame>
    <description>Confidence in diagnoses from the pre- and post-contrast ultrasound examinations is evaluated based on 4-point scale: 0-Unknown (cannot make a judgement on level of confidence), 1- Not confident (another examination was required), 2- Probable (Would have more confidence if another diagnostic imaging test such as MRI or CT was performed), 3- Definite (Sufficient confidence to the extent that another diagnostic imaging test such as MRI or CT was unnecessary).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Participants may be included in the study if they meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  Participant has at least 1 untreated focal liver lesions (FLL) but =&lt;8 lesions
             (excluding cysts) &lt;10 centimeter (cm) in diameter confirmed in a diagnostic
             examination performed in the past month (or past 3 months if lesion is benign) that
             can be visualised by non- contrast-enhanced (CE) ultrasound

          -  Participant has had a dynamic CE-computed tomography (CE-CT) or CE-magnetic resonance
             imaging (CE-MRI) examination within the past month or is scheduled to have one in the
             month following inclusion in the study and the original images (or copies thereof)
             are/will be available. (This inclusion criterion does not apply for participants
             enrolled as training cases. Investigators will be asked to submit standard of truth/
             reference diagnosis for training cases whenever possible, since the cases may be used
             for training and testing the blinded readers prior to the blinded read)
