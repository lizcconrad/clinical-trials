  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult degenerative (de novo) scoliosis (ADS) is a condition of the ageing population caused
      by degenerative changes without pre-existing spinal deformity. Pain is the most frequent
      problem, especially low back pain and radicular pain, and seriously affects the daily
      activities and health of ADS patients. The current treatment for ADS is not well defined. The
      main intervention for ADS treatment is surgical, but surgery is clearly not appropriate for
      every patient. Active bodysuits will be designed based on body alignment and pain management
      using special design components and incorporating active posture training from a biofeedback
      system. Back pain is often localized along the convexity of the curve, and passive support to
      the areas of pain, most likely in the lower trunk, hip and lower extremities, should be
      provided.

      The potential materials that can provide support are 3D printable rigid materials, semirigid
      foam padding, Velcro tape and stretchable wide waistbands. The 3D printable materials can be
      very versatile in terms of properties and can be further finished with an epoxy resin or
      thermoplastics. Different compositions and structures of knitted fabrics will be used in
      different areas of the proposed bodysuits to provide a close fit, high breathability and
      effective pain management due to extra support. The fastening system includes a magnetic
      zipper and pulley system that can be adjusted by pulling on knobs. The pulley system contains
      a microadjustable dial, super-strong lightweight lacing, and low friction lacing guides.

    <description>The wear trial period will be 9-12 months for each subject depending on the active biofeedback training progress. The bodysuits should provide active biofeedback training to the users. By incorporating the IMU sensors, the body alignment in the sagittal or coronal planes can be detected to provide feedback to the users via a wireless platform. This training will be customized to each individual user and will achieve a uniform body alignment goal that benefits the user. The participants will be assessed using the Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire (SRS-22r), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measures.</description>
