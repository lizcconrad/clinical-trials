      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a) the feasibility and b) the potential outcomes of a
      first version of an occupational therapy intervention program aiming at enhancing the ability
      to perform activities of daily living (ADL) among persons living with chronic conditions.

      In the study a pre-post test design is applied.

      Introduction

      Existing research has revealed that persons with chronic conditions experience decreased
      ability to perform both Personal ADL (PADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) tasks. Persons living
      with a chronic condition are offered various interventions. Besides medical treatment
      provided by physicians, to prevent or treat symptoms, persons with chronic diseases are often
      offered physical exercise in order to improve physical and/or mental body functions. Such
      interventions are founded on a belief that enhanced physical and mental body functioning also
      will result in improved ability to perform ADL tasks. However, existing research indicate
      that improvements in body functions not necessarily translate into improved ADL ability.

      Research investigating the outcomes of rehabilitation services designed to enhance
      occupational performance, including ADL task performance, is sparse and insufficient.
      Existing research within this area is characterized by diversity and methodological
      limitations preventing development of clear intervention guidelines for clinical practice.
      Therefore, an occupational therapy program directly aiming at enhancing the ADL ability in
      persons with chronic conditions.

      Aim

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a) the feasibility and b) the potential outcomes of
      a first version of an occupational therapy intervention program aiming at enhancing the
      ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) among persons living with chronic
      conditions.

      Methods

      In the study a pre-test - post-test design is applied. That is, 30 participants living with
      chronic conditions are assigned to an eight week occupational therapy intervention program.

      Outcome measures are self-reported and observed ADL ability measured using the ADL-Interview
      (ADL-I) and the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Furthermore, various
      registrations (made by occupational therapists and participants) related to the feasibility
      of the intervention will be collected and analyzed.

    <description>The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) is a standardized observation-based evaluation tool used by occupational therapists to measure a person's observed quality of ADL task performance in terms of physical effort and/or fatigue, efficiency, safety and independence. After the observation the quality of each skill is evaluated on a four point ordinal scale according to the scoring criteria in the AMPS manual.
The available AMPS software, based on Many-Faceted Rasch statistics, makes it possible to convert ordinal raw scores into overall linear ADL motor and ADL process ability measures adjusted for task challenge, skill item difficulty and rater severity. The measures are expressed in logits (log-odds probability units).</description>

    <measure>ADL-Interview (ADL-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at eight weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL-Interview (ADL-I) is developed to describe and measure the ADL ability based on self-report. Using the ADL-I, the participant is asked to report their perceived ADL ability (i.e. quality of ADL task performance) for each of the 47 ADL items using seven response categories.
Data will be used to (a) describe the self-reported quality of ADL task performance on each task for a single person or a group of people and (b) measure a single person's overall self-reported quality of ADL task performance. To create an overall measure of self-reported quality of ADL task performance Rasch measurement methods are applied in order to transform the ratings into an overall linear (interval scale) measure of self-reported quality of ADL task performance, adjusted for the difficulty of the ADL task.</description>
