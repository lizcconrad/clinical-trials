  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomised clinical trial. The aim is to investigate the clinical effects
      of the addition of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) to standard treatment protocols
      (chemoradiotherapy, CRT) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive and negative locally
      advanced cervical cancer patients (LACC). SAMPLE: The investigators aim to enrol 236 HIV
      negative and HIV positive women with LACC, FIGO (Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et
      d'Obstétrique) Stages IIB (distil) to stage III. Participants will be randomly assigned to a
      control group (N=118) and a study group (N=118). METHODOLOGY: Randomisation is based on age,
      stage and HIV. Participants from both groups will receive the standard treatment for cervical
      cancer at the hospital at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital in South
      Africa: Up to three doses of 80mg/m2 cisplatin, administered three weeks apart; 50Gy external
      beam radiation (EBR) in fractions of 2Gy; Three doses of 8Gy High Dose Rate (HDR)
      brachytherapy. The study group will have two 55 minute mEHT treatments per week, at 130W,
      directly before the EBR using the EHY 2000 Device. OUTCOMES: 1) Determine the local disease
      control after treatment at 6 months using a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
      computerised tomography (CT) scans. 2) Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months after the last treatment date. PFS will be assessed in all registered
      participants, regardless of completion (Intent to Treat-ITT) as well as only in the subset of
      participants who complete the prescribed CRT. 3) Overall survival at two years will be
      assessed. 4) To evaluate the adverse events associated with mEHT. 5) The effect of mEHT on
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy tolerability and toxicity will be evaluated. 6) The quality of
      life of enrolled participants will be assessed before, at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and
      24 months after completion of therapy using the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer) and EuroQoL forms. 7) To evaluate the economic viability of the addition
      of mEHT to standard treatment protocols for LACC. 8) The effect, if any, of mEHT treatments
      on the HIV disease status of HIV positive patients will be assessed by the presence of
      Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) defining illnesses before and after treatment. 9) The
      cancer recurrence patterns will be described and compared in all the participants.
