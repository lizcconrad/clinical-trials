    <textblock>
      This study investigate the prevalence of elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury in patients
      with suspected influenza infection and the prognostic implication on the composite endpoint
      of death of any cause, hospitalization due to myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart
      failure and stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between influenza and cardiovascular events was described in an early study
      of influenza epidemics from 1915 to 1929 including the 1918-1920 pandemic. Retrospective
      studies have shown increased risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the first week
      following an infection with influenza.

      Biochemical markers of cardiac injury such as high sensitive cardiac troponins may be
      increased during infection with influenza. Increased levels of cardiac troponins are
      associated with adverse outcome in many different populations.

        The clinical study will be conducted in Region Örebro County. Recruitment will start
        October 1st 2017 and is expected to continue for two influenza seasons until April 30,
        2019. Individuals for inclusion are recruited among adult patients &gt; 18 years presenting
        with influenza-like illness at the emergency unit and who, due to strong clinical suspicion
        of ongoing influenza infection, are tested.
