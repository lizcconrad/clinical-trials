      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of liposomal irinotecan and
      rucaparib and when given together with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with pancreatic, colorectal, gastroesophageal, or biliary
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and rucaparib, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the recommended dose level for the phase Ib and phase II trial of liposomal
      irinotecan (nal-IRI) and fluorouracil (5-FU) with rucaparib (MFR) in patients with metastatic
      disease from pancreatic cancer (up to 2 lines of prior therapy), colorectal cancer (up to 3
      lines of prior therapy), gastroesophageal cancer (up to 1 line of prior therapy) and biliary
      tract cancer (with 1 line of prior therapy allowed). (Phase I) II. To assess, in a
      preliminary fashion, antitumor efficacy, in terms of objective response, of the recommended
      dose level of combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU with rucaparib in patients with metastatic
      disease from pancreatic cancer (up to 1 line of prior therapy in the metastatic setting) and
      gastroesophageal cancer (with 1 line of prior therapy in the metastatic setting). (Phase Ib)
      III. To estimate the proportion of evaluable patients who reach complete response
      (CR)/partial response (PR) =&lt; 32 weeks after registration among patients with metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous recombination
      deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutation, treated with the combination
      of nal-IRI and 5FU/leucovorin calcium (LV) with rucaparib (MFR). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients
      with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous
      recombination deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutation, treated with
      the combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU/LV with rucaparib (MFR). (Phase II) II. To assess the
      toxicity of the combination of nal-IRI and 5-FU/LV with rucaparib in patients with metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with genomic markers (signature) of homologous recombination
      deficiency (HRD), specifically BRCA1/2 and PALB2 mutation. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the role of genomic markers (signature) of HRD, mutation other than BRCA1,
      BRCA2, and PALB2 as predictive biomarkers of response to MFR.

      II. To evaluate BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 mutations as predictive biomarker of response to MFR.

      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of liposomal irinotecan and rucaparib and
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium
      IV, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive rucaparib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 4-13 and 18-27. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

    <description>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be based on the assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment only (i.e., 1 cycle of therapy = 28 days) and will be defined as the dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT to study treatment. The MTD is the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT with the next higher dose having at least 2 out of 3 or 2 out of 6 patients encountering DLT.
