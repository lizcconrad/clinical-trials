  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry/repository is to provide a mechanism to store data and specimens
      to support the conduct of future research about Wilson disease (WD). The overall aim is to
      determine the optimal testing for diagnosis and parameters for monitoring treatment of WD
      that will aid product utilization and development.

      There are three aims outlined as part of this research study.

      Aim 1 is to study the natural history of a carefully characterized cohort of patients with WD
      followed longitudinally at Centers of Excellence for WD in the United States and in the
      United Kingdom.

      Aim 2 seeks to evaluate parameters for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients on
      chelation therapy and zinc treatment for their WD. Data gathered in Specific aim 1 will be
      used for analyzing the components of the diagnostic scores for patients.

      Aim 3 is intended to determine whether a composite index or a biomarker can be used as
      surrogate marker for treatment monitoring for current patients on therapy that can be used
      for future patient treatment trials.

      Data will be collected prospectively from standard of care assessments as well as study
      specific assessments and entered into a central database. Some retrospective data in regards
      to the treatment for Wilson Disease prior to enrollment will be collected as well, if
      available from the medical record.
