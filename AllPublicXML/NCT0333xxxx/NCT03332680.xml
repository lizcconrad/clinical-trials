  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is an increasingly common treatment for infertility. Clinics
      which offer IVF are continuously trying to improve their success rates, measured by the
      numbers of IVF cycles which result in the birth of a live baby.

      One factor which is thought to have contributed to the success of IVF is the improvements in
      the embryo culture media, that is, the fluid in which the embryo resides in the laboratory
      before being replaced into a woman's womb. This trial seeks to identify if IVF cycles in
      which a particular culture media called EmbryoGlue is used have better results when compared
      to IVF cycles in which a conventional embryo transfer media is used.
