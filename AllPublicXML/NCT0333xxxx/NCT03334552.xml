  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In natural HIV disease, a small fraction (1-2%) of infected individuals develops
      exceptionally high titres of HIV-1 neutralizing serum activity. Antibodies isolated from
      these individuals have been shown to be highly active against a broad range of different HIV
      strains and are therefore called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). These antibodies
      are in fact able to prevent (S)HIV infection in animal models and therefore of great interest
      for the development of an HIV vaccine. Information of neutralizing antibodies in patients
      from Africa is still scarce and would be of great value in the development of adapted HIV
      vaccine strategies in these regions. This study aims to investigate African HIV-infected
      individuals, who have developed neutralizing antibodies using highly specialized laboratory
      methodologies.

        Adult HIV-infected, preferentially ART-naïve patients within the Mbeya region. The
        prevalence of elite neutralizers is expected to be 1-2% from the overall population. The
        study therefore targets to recruit 500 subjects in order to identify at least 5 elite
        neutralizers, which will be subjected to further in depth antibody characterization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntary and informed consent

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Documented HIV infection.

          4. Willing to consent to active tracing including home tracing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Deficiency, rendering it difficult, if not impossible, to take part in the study or
             understand the information provided. This includes alcoholism, drug dependency as well
             as psychiatric illnesses, suicidal tendencies or any other inability.

          2. Prisoners

          3. If within the discretion of the investigator study participation would possibly add
             not acceptable risk or burden to patient (e.g. significant health deficiencies, social
             harm)

          4. Unlikely to comply with protocol as judged by the principal investigator or his
