  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to evaluate the impact of two USAID-funded projects that are implemented
      in rural Upper Egypt. The first project is the Feed the Future Egypt, Food-Security and
      Agribusiness Support (FAS) project; the second project is the Improving Maternal, Child
      Health, and Nutrition Services (IMCHN) project.

      The specific study objectives are (1) to estimate the impact of FAS interventions on project
      outcome indicators—especially on household income (measured by total household expenditure),
      household food security, and maternal and child nutrition—among farm households; (2) to
      estimate the effects of IMCHN interventions on maternal and child health and nutrition
      knowledge among community health workers (CHWs) and among farm households; and (3) to
      analytically explore potential synergistic effects of FAS and IMCHN interventions on maternal
      and child nutrition among farm households being exposed to both projects.
