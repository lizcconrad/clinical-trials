  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of a
      combination drug product (SM-1) containing diphenhydramine, zolpidem and lorazepam, in adult
      participants who sometimes have difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep, but who do
      not have chronic insomnia. Participants will receive SM-1, or a combination of
      diphenhydramine and zolpidem, or a combination of diphenhydramine and lorazepam, or placebo
      during 4 one-night stays at a sleep center.
