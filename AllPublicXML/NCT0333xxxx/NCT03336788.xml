  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a mood disorder affecting an individual in its entirety, altering its emotional
      and intellectual functioning . The major form of depression is the most common psychiatric
      disorder in Western countries. It is considered to be the most expensive psychiatric
      neurological disease in Europe and is currently treated by different methods.

      However, almost a third of depressed patients shows no clinical improvement. Advances in
      neuroscience and understanding of neuromodulation have enabled the emergence of new
      treatments such as the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) . It consists of
      modulating the neuronal activity of a targeted brain region through a magnetic field applied
      by a coil. Even though this form of treatment has proven to be effective, it appears that
      more than half of depressed patients exhibited little to no response to it.

      As brain regions targeted by TMS may also be stimulated beforehand by sensory afferent
      signals, it was hypothesized that optimizing the effects of TMS with virtual reality is
      possible through the activation of these brain regions with sensory stimuli holding emotional
      valence (images, sounds) while using TMS concomitantly. Based on this new research premise,
      the investigators propose, in the context of an open and controlled clinical trial, to use a
      new media entitled virtual reality for displaying interactive virtual environments with
      positive emotional valence ( field of flowers, green valley) to a group of depressed patients
      undergoing TMS at the same time.

      The study will include 66 depressed patients randomly assigned into two groups : TMS and
      Virtual Reality Versus TMS alone. Any differences in therapeutic efficacy between the two
      groups will be measured by questionnaires and brain functional imagery. This innovative and
      therapeutic approach will allow us to better understand the appropriate processes for
      modulating the neuronal activity in specific brain areas for treatment purposes.
