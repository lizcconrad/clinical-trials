  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous sodium nitrite
      compared with placebo in reducing the occurrence of CSA-AK as diagnosed by KDIGO criteria
      during the first 72 hrs after cardiac surgery in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. Secondary objectives are to determine whether IV sodium nitrite achieves adequate
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of CPB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is one of the most untoward consequences of cardiac-surgery with the use
      of CPB. As such it is associated with a high mortality and morbidity and health care expense.
      Unfortunately, currently, there is no effective preventive or treatment strategy for cardiac
      surgery-associated (CSA) AKI other than renal replacement therapy.

      It is postulated that a major mechanism of CSA-AKI is created by the ischemia reperfusion
      injury (IRI) resulting from aortic cross clamping and unclamping. This creates a cascade of
      events culminating in inflammation, microvascular dysfunction and tubular cell maladaptation
      and eventually renal tissue damage. Current treatment modalities that target the
      microcirculation such as blood pressure and cardiac output fails to prevent renal
      abnormalities and as such may be deleterious to the renal tissue microcirculation. The PI
      hypothesizes that a therapeutic strategy that limits IRI such as the administration of
      inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or sodium nitrite (NaNO2) would ameliorate CSA-AKI by limiting
      inflammatory injury to the kidney.

      The anion nitrite (NO2-) releases NO in biological systems and has been demonstrated to
      inhibit IR injury in the heart, liver and kidneys created by various pathologic states1-3 and
      improve outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction, in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension and is the putative active mediator of protection in liver-transplantation
      patients receiving inhaled nitric oxide4.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether the NO donor, nitrite will prevent I/R
      injury in patients at high risk of development of CSA-AKI undergoing open-heart surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass.
