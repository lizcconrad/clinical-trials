  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of the Cogmed training program
      on working memory among youths 7 to 13 years old, while controlling presence and presentation
      of ADHD-related comorbidity. A secondary objective was to examine the generalization of
      effects to ADHD symptoms, non-verbal reasoning, attentional and executive functions, motor
      impulsivity, reading comprehension, and mathematical reasoning. Participants were under
      pharmacological treatment for ADHD combined type and a comorbidity. They were randomized into
      an experimental group that received the Cogmed program and an active control group that
      received a low-intensity comparison version of the training. They were evaluated at three
      time points: six weeks prior to intervention onset (T1), immediately prior to onset(T2), and
      one week following intervention completion (T3).

      Participants completed the Cogmed WM training program at home.Each training session lasted
      from 30 to 45 minutes and was supervised by a parent. For five consecutive weeks,
      participants had to complete at least five sessions per week.

    <description>questionnaire Child ADHD symptoms were assessed with the Conners 3AI questionnaire (Conners, 2008). The parent version for youths 6 to 18 years old was used. Each item is rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 3 (0=never or rarely; 1=sometimes; 2=often; 3=very often). The instrument's test-retest reliability and internal consistency have been found to be satisfactory, r=.84-.93, α=.80-.93. Expected outcome—Interventions to decrease symptom of ADHD (higher values represent a worse outcome).

Subscales for inattention and Hyperactivity/impulsivity are used. Symptoms indicated for each subscale are summed to get the total.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &amp; Kenworth, 2000) was used. The parent version of the instrument comprises 86 items rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 2 (0= never or rarely; 1=sometimes; 2= often). The questionnaire's psychometric properties have been found to be adequate, with both internal consistency,α = .72-.98, and test-retest reliability,r= .82, reaching satisfactory levels. The Working Memory scale was used to measure daily WM.The Global Executive Function scale was used to assess the child's daily executive function at home and school.
Expected outcome—Interventions to decrease executive dysfunction (higher values represent a worse outcome).

    <description>12 exercises proposed in the Cogmed program. Eight of these target visuospatial WM and four target verbal WM. Eight exercises are preprogrammed for each session, for a total of 90 trials (Pearsons, 2014). The degree of difficulty of the trials increases as a function of the participant's performance. For each trial, the participant receives feedback on their performance.</description>
