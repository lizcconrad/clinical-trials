    <measure>Trans epidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The trans epidermal water loss is measured on the peristomal skin using a probe. The trans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always a loss of water from the skin due to natural evaporation. However, when the skin barrier is damaged the evaporation will increase leading to an increase in the trans epidermal water loss.Thus, trans epidermal water loss is used to assess the damage to the skin. Maesurents are taken at time 0 and after 8 hours of output exposure to the skin.</description>

    <description>On the peristomal skin 4 different patches are applied to the skin (Standard hydrocolloid adhesive patch; LT-2, LT21 and 33-20. There is a bag welded to each patch. Tthe bag contains real output.
The difference between the four patches is that they are made of four different adhesives.
The primary endpoint is measured after 8 hours and 24 hours.</description>
