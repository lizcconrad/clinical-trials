  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seeking for effective therapeutic strategies, the investigators are proposing to test the
      effectiveness of different formulations of medical cannabis oil to alleviate chronic pain,
      which was partially relieved with conventional prescriptions. Furthermore, the investigators
      would like to assess the effect of different formulations of medical cannabis oil on other
      symptoms associated to chronic pain like anxiety and depression, as well as insomnia and
      appetite. Finally, as recently recommended for clinical studies on medical cannabis, the
      investigators will examine the safety profile of different cannabis formulations focusing on
      the following elements: a real chronic administration with more than two weeks of treatment,
      a larger number of patients, and the clinical relevance of medical cannabis oil to change the
      amount and type of concomitant medications used to control chronic non-cancer and cancer
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial
      followed by an open-label extension phase of 12 weeks, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      different formulations of medical cannabis oil to reduce chronic pain intensity.

      The study will be conducted at Santé Cannabis Clinic, the only medical cannabinoid therapy
      clinic, located in Montreal, Quebec. One hundred and sixty consecutive adult patients, male
      and female, with chronic non-cancer and cancer pain (at least 3 months in duration), with an
      average weekly pain intensity score greater than 4 on the 11 points NRS, will be
      prospectively recruited and invited to participate in this trial.

      Informed consent will be obtained by a Research Assistant.

      After baseline documentation with standardized scales, patients will be randomized to one of
      4 parallel groups:

        -  Group A: THC/CBD ratio 1:1 capsule

        -  Group B: THC/CBD ratio 1:2 capsule

        -  Group C: THC/CBD ratio 0.1:2 capsule

        -  Group D: Placebo capsule Patients will have a dose titration phase during the first
           week. The dose escalation will allow patients to adapt to the potential adverse effects
           (AEs) of the medical cannabis.

      Follow-up visits will be done after 1 week and 6 weeks of treatment. At the end of the first
      phase of the study, patients who wish to participate in the open-label extension phase will
      have the option to continue in the same treatment regimen. For the placebo group, the
      investigator may propose one of the cannabis oils to the subject if they feel it may
      potentially provide benefits.

      They will take this new treatment for other 12 weeks. For this open-label extension phase the
      follow-up visits will be done after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment.
