  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the explosive popularity of sweet flavored electronic cigarettes, there is little
      empirical evidence regarding how &quot;sweet&quot; flavors interact with different levels of nicotine
      to reduce its perceived bitterness and harshness, and thereby increase its appeal and
      additive potential. This study will serve to fill this knowledge gap through empirical
      psychophysical data that will determine the association between sweet flavor and nicotine and
      its link to the acceptance and rejection of vaped nicotine.

      We will recruit current, healthy e-cigarette users between the ages of 18-29.This study will
      require 1 visit to the Oregon State University campus to partake in a 1 hour (approximate)
      testing session. During the testing session, participants will be asked to puff commercial
      e-cigarettes containing 9 commercially available e-liquid preparations.

    <description>The outcome will be ratings obtained for liking or disliking of the stimulus and ratings for perceived intensities of sensations. These quantitative values collected from the scaling procedure will be analyzed corresponding to the level of nicotine and flavor for the particular stimulus. For rating perceived intensity, we will use the general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS), developed for measurement of the intensity of oral sensation and taste. The scale is bounded by 'no sensation' at the bottom to 'strongest imaginable sensation of any kind' on top, with intermediate ratings between (bottom to top: barely detectable, weak, moderate, strong, very strong). A Labeled Hedonic Scale (LHS) will be used to measure individuals' liking or disliking of the oral sensation. The scale encompasses from &quot;most disliked sensation imaginable&quot; on one end to &quot;most liked sensation imaginable&quot; on the other end, with intermediate hedonic labels (like/dislike: slightly, moderately, very much, extremely).</description>
