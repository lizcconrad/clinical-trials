    <textblock>
      Tolerogenic dendritic cell (tDC)-based clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune
      diseases are now a reality. Clinical trials are currently exploring the effectiveness of tDC
      to treat of type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's
      disease. The general objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a
      single intra-articular injection (into the knee joint) of autologous monocyte-derived
      dendritic cells generated in the presence of interferon-alpha (IFN-α)/granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tolerized with Dexamethasone in rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) patients.

      A phase I dose-escalating clinical trial will be conducted to determine the safety and
      tolerability of a single intra-articular injection (into the knee joint) of autologous
      tolerogenic dendritic cells, and to enable selection of a suitable dose regimen for phase II
      trial. The primary objective of the phase I study will be to determine whether tDC-based
      therapy is safe and well tolerated and to establish the dose-response with disease activity
      measured over 6 months. Patients will serve as their own controls (pre- and post-treatment).
      Five doses of tDCs will be tested. The Study will start with intra-articular injection (into
      the knee joint) of 1x106 cells. Depending on safety/tolerability outcomes, the dose will
      gradually increase to 3x106, 5x106, 8x106 and 10x106 cells. The safety will be determined by
      the evaluation of the number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse
      events (SAEs) following the intra-articular administration of tDC (within 6 months of
      injection). Systemic RA disease activity will be measured using DAS28 (Disease Activity Score
      using 28 joints) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), a standard instruments used
      in RA. Patients will be monitored at baseline and at 3, 7 days and 1, 3, 6 months post
      treatment.
