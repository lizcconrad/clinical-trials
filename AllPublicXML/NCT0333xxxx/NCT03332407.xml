  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is important in maintaining the physiological function of the human body. Recently
      several studies have reported that preoperative sleep quality is associated with
      postoperative emergence delirium (ED) The ED is a common in pediatric patients undergoing
      general anesthesia with sevoflurane, but studies on the association of sleep quality have
      been rare. The investigators, therefore, aimed to investigate the relationship between
      postoperative delirium and pre and postoperative sleep quality in pediatric patients
      receiving strabismus surgery through this study

    <textblock>
      This study aimed on pediatric patients aged 4-12 years, undergoing elective strabismus
      surgery. Informed consent was obtained from both parents and children on the day of
      pre-anesthetic evaluation visit. The child and his or her parents were questioned on
      preoperative patient's sleep quality based on Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Surgery
      was performed under the same anesthesia as usual. After the operation, extubation was
      performed and patient was moved to post anesthesia recovery room (PACU). During the stay in
      PACU, one investigator measured degree of ED by Watcha and PAED (Post anesthesia emergence
      delirium ) scale to minimize bias. One day after the surgery, the investigator mede a phone
      call to the parents of the patient to obtain information for postoperative PSQI.
