  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common cause for attendance to the
      Emergency Department with a wide range of clinical severity, ranging from insignificant to
      life-threatening. While there is robust data to support the benefit of upper endoscopy within
      24 hours of admission, the implementation of early upper endoscopy while patients are still
      in the emergency room has not been widely accepted due to lack of added benefit in terms of
      patient outcome such as mortality and re-bleeding rate. However, the use of upper endoscopy
      in the emergency room with the purpose of facilitating early discharge of low risk patients
      with upper gastrointestinal bleeding has not been studied.

      The Glasgow Blatchford Score (GBS) was developed in 2000 to identify very low risk patients
      who would not need any intervention and were of low risk of rebleeding and death(1). The GBS
      used objective clinical parameters that could be easily obtained in the emergency department
      and did not use any endoscopy findings as parameters. Unlike the Rockall score which was
      designed to identify high risk patients, the GBS was used to identify low risk patients who
      could be safely discharged from the emergency department without endoscopy and studies have
      shown it to be superior in this regard(2-3). The main limitation of GBS is its low
      specificity with only 4-8% of all patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding
      stratified as low risk(3-4). Furthermore, the GBS was derived from a Scottish
      gastrointestinal bleeding registry and may not be applicable to the local population.

      Suitable patients attending the Accident &amp; Emergency Department for symptoms of upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding will be identified and recruited by the Accident &amp; Emergency
      physicians. Patients presenting to Endoscopy Centre after admission will also be recruited to
      collect clinical data.

      Univariate analysis was carried out on the development set using Pearson's chi-square method
      to examine the association among the factors on the outcome. Variables significantly
      associated with 30 day re-attendance rate in univariate analyses (P&lt;=0.1) will be entered in
      multivariate logistic regression models. Risk factors which retained significance in
      multivariate analyses will be selected for incorporation into the risk score. A weighting
      will be assigned to each independent variable in the risk score, applying the corresponding
      adjusted odds ratio (AOR). The risk score for each subject is the sum of all the risk
      factors. To evaluate the predictive ability of the scoring system, a receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was delineated.
      A concordance (c)-statistics was used to reflect the discriminative ability of the prediction
      tool.

      Cost-effective economical model will be used in cost effective analysis of the use of early
      discharge strategy.
