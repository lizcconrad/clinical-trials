  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of Virtual Reality (VR) as a distraction method to
      help those patients undergoing trigger points therapy to reduce anxiety and increase patient
      satisfaction. Half of the participants will wear VR gear, meanwhile the other half will be in
      control group, which will not wear VR headset, only the normal care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      trigger points can cause a wide range of pain symptoms; pain in the anterior shoulder and
      down the arm, headache pain, back pain, hip pain, knee pain, frozen shoulder pain, and other
      symptoms. Local anesthetic injections and lidocaine injections are common &quot;wet&quot; needling
      treatments for trigger points injections. The proposed mechanism by which trigger points
      injections alleviate pain is based on mechanical disruption of the taut bands of muscle with
      palpation based needling. During injections, patients may feel an intensified pain and a
      twitch response.

      Distraction has been proved to be an effective tool in pain management, and it can also be
      used for a variety of medical procedures. By engaging in assigned tasks, pain and anxiety are
      assumed to be lessened throughout the procedure, while leaving patients less occupied by pain
      stimuli. . An immersive virtual environment may be preferable to medications such as
      sedatives, due to side effects and prolonged discharge from procedure suite. Occasionally,
      medications may not even be available in a busy interventional pain suite. At the UCD pain
      clinic, we do not offer sedating medications for bedside procedures like trigger point
      injections. By wearing VR headset, patients may feel less tense, anxious, and painful during
      trigger point injections.

    <description>all patients will answer a survey named State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before their trigger points injections, and State Anxiety Inventory after their injections as well. Then we compare their change of anxiety scores, and seek if the change of scores is significantly differed among experimental group and control group.</description>
