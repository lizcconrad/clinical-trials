  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the associations between different types of infant feeding and BMI and
      overweight in childhood. The study is based on the Danish National Birth Cohort, established
      in 1996.

      The objective of the study is to examine whether duration of breastfeeding, timing of
      introduction of complementary food and protein intake at 18 months are associated with BMI
      and overweight at ages 7 and 11 years, independent of BMI during infancy.

      Children participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort were followed-up at ages 7 and
      11years. Information on infant feeding, protein intake at 18 months, Ponderal Index at birth,
      child BMI (5 months, 12 months, 7 and 11 years) and several parental factors was available.

      Path analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of infant feeding on BMI
      z-scores at ages 7 (n= 36,481) and 11y (n=22,047). Logistic regression analyses were used to
      examine associations with overweight.

    <description>DNBC is a nationwide cohort study of pregnant women and their offspring. The women were enrolled early during pregnancy between 1996 and 2002. They provided information on exposures during and after pregnancy by means of four computer-assisted telephone interviews in gestational weeks 12 and 30 and post-partum when the child was 6 and 18 months old.</description>

        The DNBC was established during the years 1996 to 2003. A total of 100,418 pregnancies
        among a total of 92,274 women were enrolled into the cohort from all over Denmark. The
        women were invited at their first antenatal visit at the general practitioner. It is
        estimated that approximately 30% of all pregnant women in Denmark participated in the DNBC
        and the response rate is estimated to be 60%.The women were interviewed by telephone twice
        during their pregnancy, in approximately gestational week 16 (interview 1) and 31
        (interview 2), and twice after their pregnancy when the child was approximately 6
        (interview 3) and 18 months old (interview 4). During the computer assisted telephone
        interviews, the women gave detailed information on their physical and mental health, life
        style, nutrition and medicine use, and in the post-partum interviews the women gave
        information on growth, health and nutrition of the children.
