    <textblock>
      The study involves a comparison of a LY900014 U-200 formulation with a LY900014 U-100
      formulation. LY900014 is a type of fast acting insulin. Study participants will be
      administered LY900014 U-100 two times and LY900014 U-200 two times, over 4 study periods, by
      injection under the skin. Blood samples will be taken to compare how the body handles the
      study drugs and how they affect the blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will be
      documented. The study will last about 4 weeks, not including screening and follow up.
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study and follow up is
      required at least 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
