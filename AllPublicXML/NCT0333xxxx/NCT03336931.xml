  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre prospective study of the feasibility and clinical value of a diagnostic
      service for identifying therapeutic targets and recommending personalised treatment for
      children and adolescents with high-risk cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre study conducted under the Zero Childhood Cancer Program. The study will
      be enrolling patients under the age of 21 with high-risk cancer over 3 years from cancer
      centres in Australia. Patient's cancer cells will be tested for genetic abnormalities
      (mutations) and undergoing drug testing in highly specialised laboratories. A
      Multidisciplinary Tumour Board comprising of oncologists, clinical geneticists and scientists
      will then discuss the results of each case and determine whether a personalised medicine
      recommendation can be made. A report describing the results and Tumour Board recommendation
      (if any) will be provided to the patient's treating doctor. It is always at the discretion of
      the treating doctor whether to alter the patient's management based on the information
      arising from this research project.
