  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on the severity of psoriasis
      measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) in adults with lower vitamin D levels. Half
      of the participants will receive vitamin D, while the other half receive placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have indicated an association between lower levels of vitamin D and increased risk of
      psoriasis. This study investigate if vitamin D supplementation can reduce the severity of the
      skin disease as measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), as well as positively
      influence the cardiometabolic profile and skin microbiota of persons with psoriasis through a
      winter season.

      Consenting participants will be randomized to high dose vitamin D (20.000 IU/week) versus
      placebo for four months. The participants will be recruited based on their 25-hydroxyvitamin
      D (25(OH)D)-measurements in the 7th survey in the Tromsø study where 21.083 subjects
      attended.
