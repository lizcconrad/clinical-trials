    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Device efficacy will be assessed as change in exercise tolerance quantified by peak VO2 measured on cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing (CPX). Subjects on device under FIX-HF-5C2 protocol will be compared to subjects on control under FIX-HF-5C protocol with respect to peak V02 mean change at 24-weeks from baseline.</description>

    <description>A comparison will be made between the Optimizer per-protocol groups in the FIX-HF-5C (3-lead) and FIX-HF-5C2 (2-lead) device configurations to show there is no difference between the amount of CCM therapy provided by the two device configurations. Total CCM delivery (effective hours delivered) will be evaluated at the end of 24 weeks following the Optimizer implantation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are 18 years of age or older

          -  Subject is male or a non-pregnant female

          -  Subjects who have a baseline ejection fraction greater than or equal to 25% and less
             than or equal to 45% by echocardiography determined by the echocardiography core
             laboratory.

          -  Subjects who have been treated for heart failure for at least 90 days (including
             treatment with a β-blocker for at least 90 days unless the subject is intolerant) and
             are in New York Heart Association functional Class III and IV at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Subjects receiving appropriate, stable medical therapy during the 30 days prior to
             enrollment for treatment of heart failure according to guideline recommendations. For
             patients with EF≤35%, this regimen shall consist of the appropriate doses of
             diuretics, ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and β-blocker. Angiotensin
             receptor -neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) may be substituted for ACE inhibitors or ARBs
             and Ivabradine may also be considered in subjects with a heart rate &gt;70bpm. Stable is
             defined as no more than a 100% increase or 50% decrease in dose.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (based on the current
             guidelines for clinical practice), have a clinical indication for an implanted cardiac
             defibrillator (ICD, e.g., EF≤35%) and/or pacemaker, must have an existing device
             unless the patient refuses to undergo the implantation of such device for personal
             reasons.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to return for all follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects whose baseline peak VO2 is &lt;9 or &gt;20 ml O2/min/kg. The qualifying CPX test
             must be deemed adequate.

          -  Subjects who have a potentially correctible cause of heart failure, such as valvular
             heart disease or congenital heart disease.

          -  Subjects who have clinically significant angina pectoris, consisting of angina during
             daily life (i.e., Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina score of II or more), an
             episode of unstable angina within 30 days before enrollment, or angina and/or ECG
             changes during exercise testing performed during baseline evaluation.

          -  Subjects hospitalized for heart failure requiring acute treatment with intravenous
             loop diuretics, IV inotropes or hemofiltration within 30 days before enrollment and
             baseline testing or subjects receiving any form of positive inotropic support within
             30 days before enrollment, including continuous IV inotrope therapy.

          -  Subjects having a PR interval greater than 375ms.

          -  Subjects whose exercise tolerance is limited by a condition other than heart failure
             (e.g., angina, COPD, peripheral vascular disease, orthopedic or rheumatologic
             conditions) or who are unable to perform baseline stress testing.

          -  Subjects who are scheduled for a CABG or a PTCA procedure, or who have undergone a
             CABG procedure within 90 days or a PTCA procedure within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Subjects who have a biventricular pacing system, an accepted indication for such a
             device, or a QRS width of 130ms or greater.

          -  Subjects who have had a myocardial infarction within 90 days of enrollment.

          -  Subjects who have mechanical tricuspid valve.

          -  Subjects who have a prior heart transplant.

          -  Subjects on dialysis.

          -  Subjects who are participating in another experimental protocol.

          -  Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent.
