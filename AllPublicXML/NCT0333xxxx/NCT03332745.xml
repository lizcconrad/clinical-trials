  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common heart valve disease requiring intervention in high income
      countries. It is characterised by progressive valvular thickening, and restriction as well is
      hypertrophy and fibrosis of the left ventricle in response to pressure overload. The
      pathological processes in the left ventricle that ultimately result in heart failure and
      death are incompletely understood. Further elucidation of these processes and how they
      correlate with novel blood biomarkers may help us design new treatments and optimise the
      timing of surgical intervention.

      In brief, recruited patients with severe aortic stenosis and scheduled to undergo valve
      replacement surgery will be invited for some simple tests (blood sampling, ECG,
      echocardiogram). A septal myocardial biopsy will be taken at the time of surgery and the
      disease valve retained. These will be examined histologically and pathological changes
      compared with results obtained from ECG, echocardiogram and blood tests.
