      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of platelet rich
      plasma in reducing scalp symptoms and promoting hair growth in patients diagnosed with
      frontal fibrosing alopecia. Platelet rich plasma is an autologous blood product, and platelet
      rich plasma will be administered intralesionally for this study. The platelet rich plasma
      used for this study will be prepared using the Eclipse Easy Spin centrifuge.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of platelet rich
      plasma in reducing scalp symptoms and promoting hair growth in patients diagnosed with
      frontal fibrosing alopecia. The secondary objective of this study is subject self-assessment
      through the Dermatology Quality Life Index (DQLI) and Hair-Growth Assessment (HGA) as well as
      investigator-assessment from baseline. Platelet rich plasma is an autologous blood product,
      and platelet rich plasma will be administered intralesionally for this study. The platelet
      rich plasma used for this study will be prepared using the Eclipse Easy Spin centrifuge. The
      duration of this study for participants is 8 months, including an initial screening visit, 6
      monthly treatment visits, and a follow-up visit. Subjects eligible for this study are those
      diagnosed with frontal-fibrosing alopecia via biopsy and clinical assessment.
