      Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in Hong Kong.
      The aim in the evaluation of PMB is to exclude underlying malignancy. Endometrial thickness
      (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) and endometrial biopsy or sampling
      (ES) has been recommended as the first-line investigation. From a study between 2002-2013 in
      the One-stop PMB clinic, investigators found that ET was able to identify women with
      endometrial cancer with the sensitivity at 3mm, 4mm, and 5mm, the current levels recommended
      in professional guidelines, being 97.0%, 94.1%, and 93.5% respectively. However, little is
      known about the level of patient's acceptance of the false negative rate and how patient
      would trade residual risk with more invasive test. There is also a lack of study on the
      experience of women during the management pathway especially the level of anxiety before and
      after investigations and the pain experienced from the investigations offered. The current
      study aim to study the level of false negative rate accepted by women for the investigation
      of PMB and the level of anxiety and pain experienced during the investigation pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in Hong Kong. It
      is estimated that around 10% of women experience postmenopausal bleeding. Around 90% of women
      with endometrial cancer initially presented with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB). The aim in
      the evaluation of PMB is to exclude underlying malignancy. Clinical tests to evaluate the
      endometrium include transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) to measure endometrial thickness
      (ET), endometrial biopsy or sampling (ES), saline infusion sonography, and hysteroscopy. TVS
      ET or ES has been recommended as the first-line investigation.

      There are, however, different ET cut-off values recommended by various professional groups.
      From a study between 2002-2013 in the One-stop PMB clinic, investigators found that ET was
      able to identify women with endometrial cancer with the sensitivity at 3mm, 4mm, and 5mm, the
      current levels recommended in professional guidelines, being 97.0%, 94.1%, and 93.5%
      respectively.

      Although clinical management guidelines and accuracy data are available, little is known
      about the level of patient's acceptance of the false negative rate and how patient would
      trade residual risk with more invasive test. There is also a lack of study on the experience
      of women during the management pathway especially the level of anxiety before and after
      investigations and the pain experience from the investigations offered. There is only one
      study identified from the literature which suggested high levels of anxiety in women who
      experienced PMB.

      There is a dedicated Postmenopausal Bleeding Clinic for the one-stop evaluation for PMB in
      Hong Kong and investigators receive referrals from other centers in Hong Kong. It is a
      tertiary-care university institution with two affiliated hospitals.

      All patients who are new referrals for the symptom of PMB will be invited to participate in
      the study. Informed consent form will be obtained from all patients participating in the
      study. Patients will be asked to read written information on postmenopausal bleeding
      including the risk of endometrial cancer and investigation options including TVS ET,
      hysteroscopy and ES. The information will be focused on the detection rate and
      procedure-related risk. The interviewer will specify that 1) hysteroscopy and ES will be
      considered to offer 100% detection rate but there is procedure related risks including pain,
      bleeding, infection, uterine perforation because entrance into the uterine cavity is required
      2) TVS ET do not require entry into uterine cavity but the detection rate is not 100%. Then
      patients will undergo a structured interview by an interviewer using the standard gamble
      technique.

      In the standard gamble test, patients will be asked to choose from a guaranteed outcome (e.g.
      being blind for the rest of their life), or whether patients would prefer an alternative
      state with some chance of a worst outcome (e.g. dying, &quot;1-p&quot;) and a complementary chance of
      an ideal outcome (e.g. continue to live healthily, &quot;p&quot;). The risks of the two situations will
      be varied until the patient is unable to decide either of the two options. This allows
      quantitative comparison of the health states, which allow us to understand the decision
      -making process of the patient. The interviewer will use blindness, death and healthy life to
      ensure the patient understand the standard gamble method. The participant will be asked to
      make a decision starting with a probability of 100%, which will then be reduced in steps of
      10% until it reach 10% after which it will be decreased at 1% interval until 2% and
      thereafter at 0.1% interval, until the participant is not unable to make a choice between the
      two options.

      Then the exercise will be repeated to test the preferences towards the investigations for
      PMB. The patient will be asked to choose between one of the tests (1) TVS ET (2) hysteroscopy
      with ES. In order to determine the level of acceptance of false negative rate using TVS ET,
      the assumed detection rate of the test will be quoted as 75% and increase in steps in 5%
      interval until it reach 90%, then increase at 1% interval until it reach 98%, and then at
      0.1% interval until it reach 99.9%.

      The anxiety level will be assessed by the Full form State-Anxiety scale. Since anxiety may be
      affected by the anticipated pain associated with each investigation. Patient's idea about the
      potential pain which will experience from the different investigations (TVS ET, hysteroscopy,
      ES) will be rated by a visual analogue scale from 0-10.

      The patient will then enter the consultation room and have the PMB assessment. After the
      consultation, the patient will be interviewed again. The standard gamble and anxiety level
      will be assessed again to determine if the actual experience after the PMB assessments
      changed the patients' choice. The actual VAS score on the investigations received will be
      recorded. The patient will then be asked to complete the same anxiety questionnaire 3 months
      from the consultation and return by the return envelops provided.
