  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asherman's syndrome is characterized by the presence of intrauterine adhesions (IUA) as well
      as symptoms such as amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility. The gold
      standard for the treatment of intrauterine adhesions is hysteroscopic intrauterine adhesions.
      The recurrence of intrauterine adhesions is a major challenge in clinical practice. The
      isolation of barriers in the uterine cavity may be a measure to reduce postoperative re
      adhesion, but the effect of different devices is different. Therefore, this study was
      conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Foley catheter is usually inserted into the uterine after a hysteroscopic adhesiolysis
      and removed after on the 5-7th day after surgery. Several investigators demonstrated its
      favorable effect in the recurrence of adhesion after the treatment of intrauterine adhesion.
      Disposable balloon uterine stent is specially designed to fit into the cavity of the uterus,
      and usually removed on the 7th day after surgery.
