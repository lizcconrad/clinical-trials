  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
      treatment may experience adverse events (AEs). Patients who experience AEs on any 10% IVIG
      solution will be changed to octagam 5% for six infusions to evaluate the potential benefit
      for reduction of AEs on a lower concentration IVIG product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PID require life long immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy with IVIG being
      the most common form. As more 10% IVIG products are FDA approved, the older and well
      characterized 5% IVIG products are becoming less used. Currently, the standard of care for
      patients who experience AEs on IVIG is to move to a subcutaneous (SCIG) delivery and product.
      This study will evaluate the AEs on a 10% product and octagam 5%. The study will enroll 15
      patients after an AE on any 10% product who will then be infused with octagam 5% for six
      infusions. AEs will be documented and compared to the 10% product along with changes in
      biomarkers. The study data may document another therapeutic option for patients who
      experience AEs - SCIG and octagam 5%.
