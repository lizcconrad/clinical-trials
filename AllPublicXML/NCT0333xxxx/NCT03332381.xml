  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 80 students with
      self-reported symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression will be invited to take part in a
      3-session course consisting of either attention training or self-compassion/mindfulness based
      meditation. Attention training involves modifying metacognitive control and enhancing
      attention flexibility so that people can refrain from responding to intrusions with extended
      processing. Self-compassion involves not avoiding painful or distressing feelings. Instead
      these experiences are held in awareness with kindness, understanding, and a sense of shared
      humanity.
