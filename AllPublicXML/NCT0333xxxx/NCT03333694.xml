             must be visually evident and at least 3 mm in either length or width.

          4. The lesion must be located in a place easily accessible for topical application by the

             eyelids, ear and must be &gt;1 cm away from the eyes and mouth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of dermatological disease or histological evidence of a confounding skin

             of SCC, rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, xeroderma pigmentosa, verrucous
             lesions or any other tumor in the biopsy specimen. Lesions with atypical histology
             such as: spindle cell SCC, acantholytic SCC, clear cell SCC, adenosquamous SCC,
             desmoplastic SCC or lesions that have been present for a short time and have been fast
             growing.

          2. Treatment of the target SCCis lesion within 8 weeks of screening visit by any of the
             following treatments: Liquid nitrogen, Photochemotherapy (PUVA), Long wave ultra
             violet radiation (UVB light), surgical excision or curettage within 1 cm of target
             lesion.; Systemic retinoids.; Ionizing radiation or interlesional injections or;
             Undergone a facial resurfacing procedure, i.e., chemical peel, laser resurfacing,
             dermabrasion, within the target lesion;

          3. Treatment with the following topical agents within the 4 weeks prior to the screening
             visit: Levulanic acid, 5-fluorouracil, corticosteroids, retinoids, diclofenac,
             hyaluronic acid, imiquimod.

          4. History of recurrence of the target SCCis lesion.

          5. Systemic use of immunosuppressive drugs within 4 weeks prior to screening visit or
             during the treatment period - Photodynamic therapy or immunomodulators, cytotoxic
             drugs, or interferon/interferon inducers within 4 weeks prior to study entry or
             expected during the study.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are using at least basic methods of
             contraception during dosing of investigational drug.

          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.
