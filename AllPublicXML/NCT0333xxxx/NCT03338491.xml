  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brief Interventions (BI) based on Motivational Interviewing are effective to reduce alcohol
      use. In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that that an open Mindset increases
      the positive effects of BI.

      University students take part in a voluntary screened for risky alcohol use. All students
      with risky alcohol use are eligible to the study and all receive the WHO's ASSIST-linked BI.

      Participants receive a brief Mindset induction prior to receiving BI. They are are randomly
      assigned to either the induction of an open or a closed mindset according to the Mindset
      theory of action phases (Gollwitzer &amp; Keller (2016). Mindset Theory. In: V. Zeigler-Hill,
      T.K. Shackelford (eds.), Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences. New York:
      Springer).

      The investigators measure the change in alcohol-related risk perception, treatment motivation
      and real alcohol drinking after the Brief Intervention in relation to the mindset induced
      before receiving the intervention.

    <description>This induction of a psychological state was extensively studied in basic cognitive science. Gollwitzer &amp; Keller (2016, p.3): &quot;The implemental mindset is evoked by asking participants to think of a personal project for which they have already made the decision to act but did not initiate any action yet. Subsequently, participants are asked to list the steps necessary for successful goal attainment and to plan out in detail when, where, and how they intend to act on each of these steps.&quot;</description>

    <description>This induction of a psychological state was extensively studied in basic cognitive science. Gollwitzer &amp; Keller (2016, p.3): &quot;The deliberative mindset is evoked by asking participants to (a) name an unresolved, important personal problem that is causing rumination but for which they have not made a decision yet and (b) reflect on whether to take action or not. Further, to enhance the depth of reflection, participants are requested to list a number of positive and negative, short- and long-term consequences of both deciding to act and deciding not to act; indicating the probability of the occurrence of each of these consequences is required.&quot;</description>
