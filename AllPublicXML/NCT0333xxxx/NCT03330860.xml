      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of 12 knowledge transfer clips of maternal and
      neonatal health in order to generate knowledge appropriation. Methodology: Randomized
      cross-over clinical trial with a non-probabilistic sample of intentional feature of 150
      subjects: pregnant women, non-pregnant women and men. Participants will be evaluated during
      the observation of 13 clips (one of them is the control clip) in which sequence will be
      assigned randomly. The level of attention will be assessed by means of eye tracking, to see
      the ocular gaze and fixation in relation to the content of clips, and emotional reaction
      through the psychophysiological record (galvanic skin response). In addition, recall of
      information will be assessed through the application of questionnaires at the end of each
      video. The analysis will focus on identifying differences in the three outcomes between
      intervention clips and the control clip, and between the three groups, and determine the
      clips and segments that generate greater emotional response, attention and recall.

    <measure>Emotional impact (electrodermal activity)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Monitoring of autonomous activity will be carried out through the registration of electrodermal activity (galvanic skin response), which allows the evaluation of emotional reaction. Electrodermal activity will be measured by a computerized psychophysiological recording equipment. The electrodes will be placed in the distal phalanx of the third and fourth finger of the non-dominant hand with SE-35 sensors connected to a T-601 preamplifier (J &amp; J Enterprises Seattle, WA).
The analysis of skin conductance will be carried out with the amplitude of electrodermal response which is obtained by the subtraction of the lowest conductance of the latency period from the peak conductance. This analysis will be performed for each event identified in each clip for each subject.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recall (Questionnarie)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the recall component will be carried out by filling out a knowledge test in form of questionnaire once the screening of each video has finished. The proportion of correct answers by questionnaire will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention (Eye tracking)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The eye tracking method will be applied to evaluate the attention to the visual stimulus of the clips. By means of the Eye Tracker Tobii Tx300 tracking equipment, the eye movements will be recorded. The record of how and when gaze is focused on the areas of interest (AOIs) will be measured with the following variables: 1. Duration until the first fixation in an AOI (Time to First Fixation - TFF) in seconds, and number of fixations before focusing on an AOI (Fixations Before - FB). These two measures indicate the anticipation with which attention is fixed in a specific area of the screen. 2. Duration and number of all fixations made in an AOI. These measurements indicate the duration of the fixation in each AOI and the number of times the participant fixes his gaze on that area.</description>
