  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Philadelphia-chromosome-positive or partial ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      preferred chemotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS) therapy. Recently we
      found that there were cytomegalovirus reactivation and even cytomegalovirus infection in
      three ALL patients treated with chemotherapy combined with TKIs. However, the cytomegalovirus
      risk after dasatinib use in patients with philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL is still
      unknown. It is reported that dasatinib can be observed in the treatment of
      philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukemia patients with significant increase in large
      granular lymphocytes, the cytomegalovirus is often positive, and this part of the patient's
      prognosis is relatively good. Dasatinib can inhibit SRC and TEC kinase, and induce immune
      function inhibition,and in vitro experiments have confirmed that it inhibits the immune
      function of T cells and NK cells. In this study, we examined the potential association
      between cytomegalovirus AND EBV reactivation the treatment of chemotherapy combined with
      TKIs, and the numbers of large granular cells and NK cell activity.
