    <textblock>
      This is an observational study at the Obstetrical outpatient clinic at Stavanger University
      Hospital. The main goal is to compare the current marker of glycemic control (glycated
      hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c) with glycated albumin in pregnancies with pregestational diabetes
      mellitus.

      Women with diabetes are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. With improved
      glycemic control, the risk decreases. Glycated albumin is suggested to be a better marker for
      monitoring glycemic control in pregnancies because it reflects blood glucose for a shorter
      period than HbA1c (3 versus 8-12 weeks). Other studies have shown that HbA1c increases in
      pregnancy because of iron deficiency. The investigators want to investigate HbA1c, glycated
      albumin and iron status in diabetic pregnancies. The investigators will compare HbA1c and
      glycated albumin throughout pregnancy with the patient's own blood glucose measurements or
      data from CGM (continuous blood glucose monitoring). Blood samples for HbA1c and glycated
      albumin will be taken 6 times during pregnancy (week 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36).
