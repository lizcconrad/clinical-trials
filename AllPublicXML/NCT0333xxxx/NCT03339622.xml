  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer causes pain in many of the patients that it affects. Physicians specialized in
      palliative care help advanced cancer patients to maintain as good pain control as possible
      through the use of medications such as opioids. Even with palliative care and optimal use of
      medications, many patients still suffer enormously as the cancer spreads. Because of this,
      some cancer patients also try or use cannabis in different ways to relieve their pain and
      improve the way they feel. However, there has not been much high-quality research done yet to
      prove whether or not cannabis products are truly useful to relieve severe cancer pain. This
      study is to test if advanced cancer patients who use inhaled medical cannabis (PPP001), in
      addition to palliative care management, will experience improvement in quality of life and
      relieve uncontrolled pain, providing safety conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled PPP001 to improve quality of life (HRQoL) and
      reduce pain intensity, in patients with uncontrolled cancer pain and incurable malignancy.

      Nine hundred forty six adult patients, male and female, with chronic cancer pain (at least 3
      months in duration) and advanced disease, with an average weekly pain intensity score greater
      than 4 on a 11 points Numerical Rate Scale (NRS), will be prospectively recruited and invited
      to participate in this trial.

      Informed consent will be obtained by a Research Assistant.

      After baseline documentation with standardized scales, patients will be randomized to one of
      2 parallel groups:

      Group A: 4 weeks PPP001-kit three times daily; Group B: 4 weeks placebo-kit three times
      daily; The inhalation of PPP001 or placebo-kit will be allowed three times a day at 4-6 hour
      intervals. Rescue medication will also be allowed.

      Patients will have a dose titration phase during the first week, followed by an additional
      3-week period of treatment. The dose escalation will allow patients to adapt to the potential
      AEs of cannabis.

      Patients will have follow-up after 1 week and 4 weeks of treatment. Once the patient has
      completed 4 weeks of inhaled PPP001 or placebo, it will be rolled into a long-term follow-up
      phase until drop-out or death. All patients, including the ones in the placebo group, will be
      allowed to receive the active treatment once the 4-weeks trial has finished, and continue it
      until death or drop-out.
