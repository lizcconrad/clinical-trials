  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with previously untreated CLL/SLL into two cohorts (Cohort 1
      without del[17p] and Cohort 2 with del[17p]). Cohort 1 subjects will receive either &quot;BGB-3111
      alone&quot; or &quot;bendamustine (B) and rituximab (R)&quot;. Cohort 2 subjects will receive BGB-3111
      alone. The primary purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BGB-3111 versus
      bendamustine and rituximab in Cohort 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global phase 3, open label, randomized study of BGB-3111 versus bendamustine plus
      rituximab (B+R) in subjects with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), including subjects without del(17p) [Cohort 1] and subjects
      with del(17p) [Cohort 2]. Subjects in Cohort 1 are randomized 1:1 to BGB-3111 (Arm A) or
      bendamustine plus rituximab (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by age, Binet stage,
      immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status, and geographic region.
      Subjects in Cohort 2 receive treatment with BGB-3111.
