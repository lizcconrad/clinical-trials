  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical monitoring is the most common method of adjustment of the appropriate level of
      general anesthesia. However, the episodes of intraoperative awareness are still reported,
      suggesting that clinical observations may not be sufficient in some cases. The objective of
      the study was to compare the efficacy of clinical and instrumental neuromonitoring with
      auditory evoked potentials in intraoperative analysis of the proper level of general
      anesthesia.

      The patients scheduled for elective surgery were included into the study, and randomly
      divided into two groups. Patients in the first group (TIVA group) underwent intravenous, in
      the second group (VA group) underwent volatile anesthesia. The adequacy of anesthesia was
      analyzed with standard clinical parameters. All the participants were instrumentally
      monitored with AAI index. After the anesthesia patients received a questionnaire with the
      questions regarding possible intraoperative awareness.

    <masking_description>During the anesthesia, in all the participants an AAI-A line ARX index was continuously monitored. The electrodes were placed after the induction of anesthesia.
Intraoperatively, both auditory evoked potentials with AAI index and electroencephalogram with burst suppression analysis was recorded. Recorded data were blinded for anesthesiologists, so were not used for analysis of level of anesthesia during surgery.</masking_description>
