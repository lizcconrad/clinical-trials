  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, is a very common problem that often accompanies hearing
      loss. It affects up to 1 in 10 adults, and about 30% of people who experience chronic
      tinnitus find it very distressing. In these patients, symptoms of depression and anxiety
      often accompany tinnitus and there are no approved treatments. Clinical trials are ongoing to
      test a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist (called esketamine), which is injected into the
      inner ear. However, the preliminary results with this medication show that it only works for
      tinnitus that results from acute injury. It does not treat tinnitus resulting from
      progressive hearing loss.

      Research in humans and animals suggest that the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are
      important in the development and maintenance of tinnitus. This data shows that
      over-activation of the NMDA receptor and a decrease in GABA signaling in the brain play a
      crucial role. Previous studies show that ketamine, which an antagonist at the NMDA receptor,
      increases GABA levels in the brain in participants with depression. Thus, in this experiment,
      this study will test the effect of ketamine on tinnitus, since it blocks the NMDA glutamate
      receptor and increase GABA levels.

      Two groups of participants will be included in this study: those who experience distress
      (symptoms of anxiety or depression) with tinnitus and those who have tinnitus but do not
      experience distress. Each participant will receive both ketamine and placebo on different
      days. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans will be

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 10 adults in the United States. Among those
      with tinnitus, 36% had nearly constant symptoms and almost 30% of those report that their
      tinnitus as a big or a very big problem. Currently there are few effective treatments for
      tinnitus, and no approved medications. Cognitive behavioral and retraining therapy provide
      some relief, but many patients fail to respond.

      Animal research and human studies indicate that maladaptive plasticity plays a role in
      tinnitus, which involves glutamatergic signaling largely at the NMDA and AMPA receptors.
      Additionally, GABA signaling has been shown to be impaired in tinnitus. Rodent models show a
      diminished sensitivity to GABA signaling and human magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      studies show decreased GABA levels in the auditory cortex.

      Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that has also been shown to activate
      AMPA receptors, and modulates ongoing plasticity. Additionally, ketamine activates a
      subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons and increases GABA
      levels in the human brain, measured with MRS. Ketamine is FDA approved as an anesthetic, and
      recent work has demonstrated its efficacy in treating refractory depression and chronic pain.
      Importantly, these demonstrate that low dose ketamine, at doses lower than those required for
      anesthesia, are effective in lifting depressed mood and improving the sensation of chronic
      pain.

      For many, tinnitus has an important affective component to it, with distress and co-morbid
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. The onset and severity of tinnitus can correlate with
      stressful events, and it has been posited that stress lowers the threshold of perception, and
      unmasks tinnitus. Tinnitus then triggers more anxiety and depressed mood, which in turn
      reinforces the symptoms. An advantage of ketamine may be its effect on depression and
      anxiety, in addition to tinnitus, to interrupt this cycle.

      The goal of this study is to perform a proof-of-concept preliminary study of ketamine in
      tinnitus associated with sensori-neural hearing loss. This will be studied both in
      participants who report depressed mood and anxiety and those who do not. MRS imaging will be
      used to assess ketamine-induced changes in GABA in the auditory cortex.
