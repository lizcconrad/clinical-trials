  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FLX-787-107 study will determine how well FLX-787-ODT works to reduce fasciculations in
      patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The study will measure how often
      fasciculations occur, if tongue and muscle strength, speech, and swallowing are affected, and
      monitor any side effects that might develop while taking the investigational product.
      Participants will be assessed before and after taking a single dose of FLX-787-ODT.
      Approximately 15 people will take part in this study at one center in the United States.
      Participants will be in the study for a single clinic visit and receive a telephone call 7
      days later to monitor for side effects.

             diverticulitis, active peptic ulcer disease, or significant gastroesophageal reflux
             disease (i.e., not well-controlled on antacids or proton pump inhibitors), or oral or
             esophageal lesions/ulcers.

          -  Presence of laryngospasm or significant swallowing problems.

          -  Inability to tolerate a spicy sensation in the mouth or stomach.

          -  Actively using illicit drugs or history of chronic substance abuse within the past
             year prior to screening, including abuse of alcohol.

          -  Participated in a clinical study (except natural history studies without
             administration of an investigational product) within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

          -  Blood pressure of ≥160 mmHg systolic and/or ≥100 mmHg diastolic.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory findings (including screening
             complete electrolyte panel, complete blood count, liver function tests).
