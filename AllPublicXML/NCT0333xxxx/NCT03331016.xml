  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart to Heart is a brief pregnancy prevention training program delivered to foster and
      kinship caregivers to prevent unintended pregnancy in foster youth. The training delivers
      easy to understand information on sexual health, contraception, and adolescent development.
      It also includes a brief behavioral training, and information on effective communication,
      monitoring strategies, and social support. The curriculum was piloted in Los Angeles.
      Investigators will test the intervention in a randomized control trial.

      Dr. Ahrens and her team will evaluate the effectiveness of this training using a randomized
      stepped wedge study design with a target enrollment of 100 foster and kinship caregivers.
      Recruitment will be carried out in collaboration with the Los Angeles Department of Child and
      Family Services, foster family agencies and support groups. After completing a baseline
      survey, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the
      waitlist control group. (With a target 1:1 ratio of controls to intervention subjects, but in
      consideration of greater levels of attrition in the waitlist control group due to the 6-month
      wait before being offered the training, participants will be randomized in a ratio of 4:3 to
      control vs intervention group). The intervention group will receive the training soon after
      enrollment, and will then complete 3 follow-up surveys over the following 6 months.
      Participants assigned to the waitlist control group will first complete 3 surveys over 6
      months, receive the intervention at the 6 month mark, then take 3 follow-up surveys over the
      following 6-month period. Dr. Ahrens and team will use these survey data to measure the
      effectiveness of the training based on the outcome measures. Participants will be surveyed at
      multiple timepoints both because the different outcomes are expected to occur within
      different time intervals (e.g. knowledge may change right away, while behaviors will take
      longer), and to assess whether these outcomes change over time (e.g. whether knowledge gained
      in the training is lasting).
