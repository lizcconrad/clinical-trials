    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of doxorubicin hydrochloride, pembrolizumab,
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine in treating patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, pembrolizumab, vinblastine, and dacarbazine may work better in
      treating classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety of delivering 2 cycles doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin),
      pembrolizumab, vinblastine and dacarbazine (APVD) to patients with previously untreated
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)2 negative
      (Deauville score 1-3) rate after 2 cycles of APVD.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall and progression free survival, association of biomarkers with early complete
      response (CR).

      II. Predictive capacity of PET2 after APVD. III. To evaluate the impact of APVD on T-cell
      repertoire and diversity. IV. To evaluate the ability of this regimen to eradicate minimal
      residual disease as measured by next generation sequencing (NGS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), pembrolizumab IV, vinblastine
      IV, and dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
