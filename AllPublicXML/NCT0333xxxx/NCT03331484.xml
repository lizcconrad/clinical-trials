  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a minimal data on the combination of rivaroxaban and ticagrelor in
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      Furthermore, there exists significant controversy among physicians in the use of oral
      anticoagulants in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy in this population. The present
      recommendation is triple therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel + warfarin) which has been related to
      major bleeding complications. Previous studies have shown that ticagrelor has been proven to
      be more effective in reducing the rate of death, new heart attacks, or strokes than the
      previous recommendation drug, clopidogrel, and studies have shown that less bleeding occurs
      with rivaroxaban than warfarin, it would be ideal to investigate the two potent drugs,
      ticagrelor with rivaroxaban, and gain insight in the management of these high risk patients.

      The CAPITAL PCI AF study is a phase 3 Health Canada regulated interventional study involving
      the use of investigational drugs. It is a non-randomized, open design study. The
      investigational team is studying the high potent drug Ticagrelor, which is prescribed to
      participants receiving a stent placement, given with Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant
      recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The primary clinical endpoint is a
      safety outcome measuring bleeding complications in participants with atrial fibrillation
      treated within one year of the index PCI. The primary efficacy endpoint is measured by the
      clinical outcomes of death, stroke, non- central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism,
      myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis within one year of the index PCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has undergone a PCI with stent placement, plus

          2. Documented non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF)* within 1 year before screening, OR
             &gt;1 year before screening if patient had been receiving oral anticoagulation
             (OAC)therapy for the atrial fibrillation for 3 months immediately before the index
             PCI.

               -  AF is definited by its presence on an electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor, or
                  any device that provides a rhythm strip documenting paroxysmal, persistent or,
                  permanent atrial fibrillation.

        Atrial flutter can be included as &quot;AF equivalent&quot;. The stroke risk in patients with atrial
        flutter is not much different from that in AF. Furthermore, many patients diagnosed with
        atrial flutter subsequently develop AF. Hence, current guidelines recommend that OAC should
        be used in patients with atrial flutter similar to that in patients with AF.

        Non-valvular AF is defined as the absence of moderate to severe mitral stenosis or the
        presence of a mechanical valve as per 2016 ESC guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 years

          2. Any condition that contraindicates anticoagulant therapy or would confer an
             unacceptable risk of bleeding, such as, but not limited to:

               1. active internal bleeding,

               2. bleeding at a non-compressible site,

               3. bleeding diathesis within 30 days of PCI,

               4. baseline platelet count &lt;90,000/uL,

               5. history of intracranial hemorrhage,

               6. clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months of PCI,

               7. baseline INR &gt;1.5 in patients not prescribed VKA, suggesting underlying
                  coagulation disorder.

          3. History of stroke

          4. Cardiogenic shock at the time of screening

          5. Ventricular arrhythmias refractory to treatment at the time of screening

          6. Calculated CrCl&lt;30 mL/min at the time of screening

          7. known significant liver disease (ie: acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
             cirrhosis), or liver function test (LFT) abnormalities at screening: alanine
             transaminase (ALT) &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal or ALT&gt;3 times the upper limit
             of normal plus total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal

          8. Hemoglobin level &lt;90 g/dL at screening

          9. Any severe condition that wold limit life expectancy to less than 12 months

         10. Major surgery, biopsy of parenchymal organ, or serious trauma within the past 30 days.

         11. Incomplete staged PCI procedure (once complete of the PCI has occurred, the final PCI
             may become the index event)

         12. CABG planned

         13. Transient AF caused by a reversible disorder (ie: thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary embolism,
             recent surgery)

         14. any condition other than non-valvular AF requiring long-term anticoagulation with VKAs
             such as moderate to severe mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valves, deep vein
             thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or left ventricular thrombus

         15. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to rivaroxaban or ticagrelor

         16. Participation in a study with another investigational device or drug &lt; four weeks
