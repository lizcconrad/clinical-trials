    <textblock>
      LHRH-a is an important hormone treatment in breast cancer especially in high-risk hormone
      receptor-positive patients or hormone receptor-negative but needing ovarian function
      protecting. The climacteric symptoms caused by LHRH-a are often and prominent, which is a
      common clinical problem.

    <textblock>
      Ovarian function suppression (OFS) or protection has been studied widely in breast cancer. As
      an common drug in clinic, LHRH-a is an important method for OFS in breast cancer especially
      in high-risk hormone receptor-positive patients or hormone receptor-negative but needing
      ovarian function protecting. The climacteric symptoms caused by LHRH-a are often and
      prominent, which is a common clinical problem. Remifemin (cimicifuga racemosa / black cohosh)
      is effective in climacteric symptoms as a hormone replacement treatment, some research
      concluded that it is also safe in breast cancer patients who are postmenopausal or taking
      tamoxifen suffering from climacteric symptoms. While in China, more than 2/3 breast cancer
      patients are pre/peri-menopause, and some part of them should take OFS as an hormone
      treatment. OFS can cause sever climacteric symptoms in a short time. The investigators aim to
      estimate the effect and safety of Remifemin in climacteric symptoms caused by OFS in breast
      cancer.
