    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Child and Family
      Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), provided soon after a violent traumatic event, in
      producing significant and sustained reduction in PTSS among assault injured youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to target modifiable risk and protective factors during the early post-trauma
      period may promote recovery and reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following violent
      injury by facilitating cognitive and emotional processing of trauma reactions, increasing
      coping capacity, and providing emotional support.

      Investigators seek to evaluate the effectiveness of the Child and Family Traumatic Stress
      Intervention (CFTSI), provided soon after a violent traumatic event, in producing significant
      and sustained reduction in PTSS among assault injured youth.

      Participants will be recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) emergency
      department (ED) or Trauma Unit following interpersonal assault. Investigators seek to enroll
      300 participants from CHOP. Participants must reside in Philadelphia County with a parent or
      guardian for at least the last six months, be 8 to 18 years of age (inclusive), have been
      received for an injury resulting from a qualifying interpersonal assault, and both child and
      parent must be able to speak English. Youth must have a Child Post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) Symptom Scale (CPSS) score &gt; or = 11 during study screening.The Child and Family
      Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is the study intervention. The primary outcome measure
      is youth-reported PTSS at 4 and 10 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Research assistants (RAs) will perform eligibility screening in the CHOP ED or Trauma Unit on potentially eligible youth and their parents who present for care following an assault-related injury. For individuals discharged before being screened, RAs will phone them within 7 days of discharge for screening. Consented youth and parents will complete baseline study assessments followed by random assignment to either the intervention [Violence Intervention Program (VIP) with Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI)] or control (VIP-only) conditions. VIP is the standard of care provided to assault injured youth treated in the CHOP ED or Trauma Unit. The study coordinator or VIP staff member will notify youth of their assigned condition. CFTSI clinicians will schedule intervention sessions with the families in community-based mental health centers. RAs will be blinded to participant condition and administer baseline and follow-up assessments to all participants.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS-5) score from baseline to 4 months post-ED visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in youth ages 8 to 18 years old. Items correspond to DSM-5 PTSD symptom criteria. Symptom items are rated on a Likert-type scale (0-1-2-3-4) corresponding to &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;6 or more times a week/almost always.&quot; The CPSS yields a symptom severity score (sum of responses) and can be scored for possible PTSD diagnosis. Possible CPSS-5 scores range from 0 to 80. Based on the current evidence regarding screening for PTSD risk, we will employ a screening cut-off (greater than or equal to 11) on the summed CPSS severity score from 20 symptom items, indicating moderate PTSS.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) score from baseline to 4 months post-ED visit</measure>

    <description>Items assess a youth's self-reported depressive symptoms with responses ranging from &quot;not true&quot; to &quot;true.&quot; Item responses are summed to create an MFQ total score with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptom impairment and severity. Possible scores range from 0 to 66.</description>

    <measure>Change in Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) score from baseline to 4 months post-ED visit</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Items assess symptoms of anxiety including physiological and rumination symptoms. Response options are &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; options. The RCMAS yields a total score and three symptom subscales (Physiological Anxiety, Worry/Oversensitivity, Social Concerns/Concentration). Total Anxiety scores range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating more pathological anxiety potentially nearing clinical diagnosis. Higher subscale scores suggest that a youth is experiencing a number of physiological signs of anxiety (Physiological Anxiety subscale, possible score range: 0-10), tends to experience more internalizing symptoms of anxiety (Worry/Oversensitivity subscale, possible score range: 0-11), and/or is struggling with more symptoms related to not being able to live up to parental or other adult expectations (Social Concerns/Concentration subscale, possible score range: 0-7).</description>

    <description>The SDQ and SDQ-P assess externalizing and internalizing problem areas (conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, peer problems) as well as pro-social behavior in youth. The measure has age-tailored parent- and self-report versions, with two questions assessing intervention change. Items are scored as &quot;not true&quot;, &quot;somewhat true&quot;, or &quot;certainly true.&quot; The first four problem subscales (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems) are summed to create a Total Difficulties scale score ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores on the difficulties subscales and Total Difficulties scale correspond to higher levels of difficulty. Higher scores on the prosocial behavior scale indicate higher levels of strengths.</description>

    <intervention_name>Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is a 4-6 session intervention, initiated within 45 days of trauma exposure for youth reporting acute PTSS. CFTSI is designed for children age 7 and older, and requires the involvement of a parent who knows the child well enough to report changes in the child's behavior and symptoms. CFTSI targets modifiable risk and protective factors during the early post-trauma period to promote recovery and reduce PTSS via parent-child communication and cognitive and emotional processing. CFTSI uses skill modules (e.g., sleep disturbance, intrusive thoughts, anxiety) to teach effective strategies to decrease a child's PTSS. Coping and communication skills are taught and practiced in parent-child sessions and in the home.</description>
