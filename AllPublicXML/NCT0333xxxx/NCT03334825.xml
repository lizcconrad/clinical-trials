      Randomized controlled trial of housing placement assistance for homeless persons with HIV

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 800 persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) reside in HIV emergency
      single-room-occupancy (SRO) hotels in New York City and do not have the ability to secure
      permanent housing on their own. The study evaluated a pilot program which fast-tracked PLWHA
      from HIV emergency SRO hotels into permanent housing. The Enhanced Housing Placement
      Assistance (EHPA) program had three components: 1) active recruitment of emergency SRO hotel
      residents with high need for housing; 2) assistance in the rapid (fast-track) acquisition of
      permanent housing; and 3) participation in a 12-month support services program designed to
      prevent PLWHA from relapsing into homelessness, with services focused on increasing clients'
      capacity to live independently and maintain housing stability. Participants were randomly
      assigned to either 1) EHPA or 2) usual care, which included standard connections to services
      and housing programs offered by the New York City HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA),
      Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA), or Ryan White services, and were
      followed over twelve months using a questionnaire developed with significant input from the
      target population of PLWHA residing in emergency SRO hotels.
