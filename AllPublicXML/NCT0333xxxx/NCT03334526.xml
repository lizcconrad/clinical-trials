  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is considered a therapeutic strategy in its own right in a vast majority of
      disabling chronic disorders. It leads to an increase in physical and probably cognitive
      capacity, thanks to its effects on both metabolism (muscle hypertrophy, improvement in
      oxidative metabolism) and the nervous system (neuroplasticity). Nonetheless, even though
      there is a consensus on the positive effects of physical exercise (PE) on cerebral
      plasticity, the physiological mechanisms by which PE affects neuroplasticity, in particular
      depending on the mode of muscle contraction, are still hypothetical. Moreover, several recent
      studies have shown that mental learning (ML) by motor imagery improves motor performance,
      thus making it of interest in a context of rehabilitation, in particular in situations where
      PE is transient of definitively impossible. Yet, the mechanisms and brain structures involved
      in motor learning by ML have not been established so far. Finally, on the basis of clinical
      observations concerning the key role of sensory input in motor function, the hypothesis that
      increased demand on this input by electrical stimulation (ES) as a means to improve motor
      function has been proposed. However, the mechanisms by which this type of stimulation could
      induce neuroplasticity is still to be elucidated.
