  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal addresses the critical absence of information about the neurobiology of
      recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in alcohol and nicotine users. AUD and nicotine use
      disorder (NUD) are the most commonly abused (non-prescription) substances in the U.S.
      Co-addiction is particularly high in military veterans. Although nationwide estimates peg the
      rate of AUD/NUD co-addiction at 80%, the Substance Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) at the
      Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) finds that 90% of veterans treated
      for AUD also meet criteria for NUD. The investigators hypothesize that a support vector
      machine learning algorithm will be able to use the measures to classify subjects as AUD, NUD
      both or neither and that the algorithm will predict outcome (sobriety or relapse) at three
      months.
