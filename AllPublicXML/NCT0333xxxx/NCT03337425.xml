  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to assess patient satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a
      psychoeducational group treatment, using a randomized waitlist-controlled trial, at two
      different outpatient clinics in mid-Norway. All participants will receive standard treatment
      during the intervention period. Assessment of client satisfaction (CSQ 8), general
      self-efficacy (GSE-6), ADHD-related quality of life (AAQoL) symptoms of ADHD (SCL-9; ASRS),
      and work participation will be conducted at time of recruitment prior to randomization (T0),
      pre- (T1), post-treatment (T2), with a 10 week follow-up.

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and after 10 weeks follow-up (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE-6), a short-form measure of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is regarded as a protective factor in adapting to stress and chronic illness. The scale consists of 6 items, measured on a 4-point scale, with a possible range of 6-24.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and after 10 weeks follow-up (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with ASRS, a self-reporting scale for ADHD-related symptoms in adults. The scale consists of 18 items, based on DSM-V diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The items are measured on a 5-point scale, with a possible range of 0-72.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (10 weeks) and after 10 weeks follow-up (20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with 9 items from the SCL-90. SCL-9 is an ADHD-specific scale, consisting of 9 items of the original 90. SCL-9 covers the specific characteristic traits of ADHD.</description>
