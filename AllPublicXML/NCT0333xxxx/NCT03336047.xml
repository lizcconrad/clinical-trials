  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high physical fitness can prevent cardiovascular disease. Which form of exercise training
      is efficient at improving fitness is well known. The challenge is to get people to do it.
      Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is an algorithm developed for this challenge. It gives a
      score that tells the users whether they are active enough to achieve the maximum health
      benefit of exercise based on their heart rate. It has been shown that people who obtain 100
      PAI a week have less cardiovascular disease, but intervention studies showing that PAI can
      improve physical fitness are so far lacking.

      Step counters have received a lot of attention and 10 000 steps a day is a common
      recommendation, but little is known about the physiological adaptations to this intervention.

      This study will compare the effect of physical activity with a value of 100 PAI points a week
      with 10 000 steps a day in healthy, but overweight (body mass index &gt; 25) participants
      between 30 and 50 years of age.

    <description>Participants randomized to the PAI intervention will receive a Mio Slice fitness bracelet and asked to install the Mio Pai 2.0 app on their smart phone. This tracks their fitness score based on the PAI algorithm where the goal is to maintain 100 PAI points a week. PAI is earned incrementally based on time spent in three different heart rate zones, low, medium and high intensity. PAI is recorded every day and added to the weekly total and the PAI earned on the same day the previous week is deleted (on Tuesday, the PAI earned the previous Tuesday will disappear).
Participants will be encouraged to maintain 100 PAI during the 8 weeks intervention by telephone messages (sms).</description>
