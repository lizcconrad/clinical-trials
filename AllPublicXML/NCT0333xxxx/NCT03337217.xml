  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, colonoscopy has become the most commonly used screening test for
      colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy is typically performed with the patient starting in the left
      lateral decubitus position, however there is little data to support this practice and
      starting position is variable amongst individual gastroenterology physicians.

      The investigators plan to randomize patients with Body Mass Index &gt;30 that are presenting to
      the University of Virginia for colonoscopy to either the prone or left lateral decubitus
      position. The investigators will then record and compare cecal intubation times as well as
      amount of sedation used and complications to help determine which position is superior for
      this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that have been scheduled for colonoscopy will undergo chart review. Patients who
      meet inclusion criteria will be invited to participate at the time consent is obtained for
      the colonoscopy. Participants will then be randomized to one of two colonoscopy starting
      positions.

      After randomization, patients will begin the colonoscopy in either the prone position or left
      lateral decubitus position.

      It is common practice to re-position the patient during endoscopy (including supine and prone
      positions) and some endoscopists commonly employ prone starting position for obese patients,
      although there is no estimate in the literature as to the prevalence of this practice.

      No additional interventions will be performed for research purposes. During the colonoscopy,
      the endoscopist will be allowed, as usual, to adjust patient position as needed to complete
      the procedure. Cecal intubation time, amount of sedation used, and any intra-procedural
      complications (hypoxia, hypotension, etc) will be recorded for data analysis. This
      information is standardly recorded in the procedure report in the patient's medical record.
      The study will not affect any interventions performed during the colonoscopy such as polyp
      removal or biopsies as, clinically indicated. Per endoscopy unit protocol, patients will be
      monitored in the recovery area and discharged home with supervision. The study requires no
      further direct patient interaction after the colonoscopy is completed. Charts will be
      reviewed at 30 days to assess for any delayed and unexpected complications.
