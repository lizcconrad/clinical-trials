  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays there is a growing interest towards non-invasive assessment of urinary dysfunctions
      in clinical practice. The tendency to use uroflowmetry as a first-line screening tool is
      based on the inexpensiveness, time efficiency, comfort of the patient, etc. However, it is
      stated that uroflowmetry as a stand-alone study lacks the potential to make an accurate
      diagnosis. In regard to this, the International Continence Society indicated that the
      addition of pelvic floor electromyography might increase the accuracy of this assessment.
      Despite this recommendation, uroflowmetry in combination with electromyography has not been
      conducted in a healthy population.

      The initial objective of this study was to examine whether adding electromyography to
      standard uroflowmetry in a healthy paediatric population would change the representation of
      parameters, especially of voiding patterns. In addition, the influence of several factors on
      uroflow parameters was analysed to complement current literature.
