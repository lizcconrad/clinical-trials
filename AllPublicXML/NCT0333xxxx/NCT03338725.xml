  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication errors are considered by WHO to be a subject that requires attention at all levels
      of care, in order to reduce the serious and preventable damage related to medication.

      These strategies are aimed at the patient's safety policy. In Colombia, at the regulatory
      level there is no standardized clinical pharmacy model where the role of the clinical
      pharmacist is described extensively and in detail, and in addition, data are unknown of the
      scope or direct effect of the incorporation of this model in the assistance in the results of
      health care.

      The Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, it is a highly complex institution in Medellin (Colombia),
      certified by Join Comission International (JCI), which requires the continuous interaction of
      the pharmacist in patient care, in order to avoid medication errors and contribute to patient
      safety indicators. In this sense, the hospital structured and implemented a clinical pharmacy
      model that establishes the activities of the pharmacist incorporated into the care team in
      the patient attention. Today this model is applied in the institution, however, it is
      necessary to know the effect of its application in the solution of drug-related problems
      (DRPs) or a negative outcome related to medicine. The objective of this study is to know the
      effect on patient safety of a clinical pharmacy model in a hospital of high complexity and
      framed in the WHO initiative to reduce these errors of medication.

      A randomized controlled clinical trial of stepped wedge will be performed. Patients will be
      admitted according to the inclusion criteria. Randomization will be done at the cluster level
      (group) and the result measured in the participants within the cluster.
