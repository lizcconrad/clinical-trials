    <textblock>
      Diseases such as hypertension and stroke affect mid-life and older African Americans at
      higher rates than Whites, negatively affecting health status of this group. This project
      determine the effectiveness of a faith-based health intervention for mid-life and older
      African Americans using community-based participatory research approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mid-life and older African Americans (AAs), a population that is increasing in number, have
      high rates of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality in relation to Whites. For this
      population, dietary and physical activity behaviors are related to the incidence of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Few tested health promotion interventions tailored for mid-life
      and older AAs are available yet churches have been shown to be an effective environment for
      AA health programs. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to reduce CVD risk factors in
      mid-life and older AAs through implementing and evaluating a church-based health
      intervention. Using the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and Socio-ecological
      theory (SE), the objectives of this project were to: 1) determine the effectiveness of a
      church-based intervention in relation to dietary behaviors (food choice, dietary quality),
      habitual physical activity) and CVD clinical risk factors of mid-life and older African
      Americans by increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables and calcium-rich foods; decreasing
      consumption of fat, sugar and sodium; increasing habitual physical activity; and improving
      selected clinical outcomes (blood pressure, body weight, glucose, among others); 2) identify
      the differential influence of program components of the intervention; 3) examine variables
      that might mediate the process of goal achievement; and 4) determine variables that are
      related to stage of change progression in goal achievement. Midlife and older AAs (n=221)
      from six churches, three treatment and three comparison, in North Florida were randomly
      selected from the churches, stratifying by age and gender. The intervention, Health for
      Hearts United, was developed using a community-based participatory approach and included
      literature-based conceptual elements of awareness building, clinical learning and efficacy
      development. Instruments included a food and lifestyle habits questionnaire (food frequency,
      NCI fruit and vegetable screener, NCI fat screener, physical activity items, TTM items,
      background characteristics, among others). Clinical data, including 24 hour recall, were
      collected from a subsample of participants (n=104). Data were collected at four points:
      Baseline, 6 ,18 and 24 month. The project was guided by research and community advisory
      committees.

    <intervention_model_description>Health for Hearts United is a longitudinal church-based intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in mid-life and older African Americans. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches and undergirded by both the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and Socio-ecological theory, the 18-month intervention was developed in six North Florida churches (three treatment, three comparison).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Increase in fruit and vegetable consumption assessed by a single item on number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed daily.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 6 months, 18 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The single item measure was &quot;How many servings of fruits and vegetables do you usually eat each day?&quot; The item had the following possible responses: zero, one, two, three, four, five and six or more servings daily. The range of scores was zero to six, with six representing the highest number of servings daily and zero representing the lowest.</description>

    <measure>Increase in habitual physical activity (total kilocalories per week) as assessed by the Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 6 months, 18 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) uses a simple checklist to provide estimates of caloric expenditure from activity time (minutes per day or week) and activity dimensions (working, yard work, caretaking, exercising, and recreational activities) during a typical day or week. The unit of measure is kilocalories per week (kcal/week) and is computed by converting all activities into minutes per week, multiplying each by an intensity code for kilocalories, and then summing to determine an energy expenditure summary index (kcal/week). The range of possible scores varies per study but the literature on older adult populations suggests low scores on the YPAS in the 300 kcal/week range and high scores of over 20,000 kcal/week.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 6 months, 18 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The abdomen was measured in centimeters (cm) with a plastic non-flexible measuring tape (Issaquah, WA). The abdomen was measured at the top of the iliac crest while each participant was exhaling.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline, 6 months, 18 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three blood pressure measurements were taken on the non-dominant arm after each participant rested for a few minutes, using a digital device (A&amp;D Medical, Miltitas, CA). The three readings were then averaged. The unit of measure was millimeter of mercury (mmHg).</description>
