  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of naloxone standing orders, this study will assess the impact of a targeted,
      web-based overdose prevention and naloxone intervention for patients prescribed chronic
      opioid therapy. Outcomes are changes in opioid risk behaviors, naloxone uptake, and knowledge
      about overdose and naloxone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a patient level randomized study of a targeted, web-based overdose prevention and
      naloxone intervention for patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy. This study will be
      conducted in a health system which has implemented naloxone standing orders. Adults
      prescribed chronic opioid therapy will be identified in the electronic health record,
      outreached, and recruited for participation. Once enrolled, participants will be randomized
      to usual care or the intervention. The web-based intervention is an animated video which
      provides education on what is an opioid overdose, how to prevent and recognize an opioid
      overdose, and how to respond with naloxone. This video also encourages patients to pick up
      naloxone from a pharmacy under standing orders. Participants will be given knowledge and risk
      surveys over the follow-up. The primary outcome is opioid risk behavior. Secondary outcomes
      include knowledge about overdose and naloxone, substance use, and pain intensity. Patients
      will also be followed in the electronic health record for naloxone dispensings, changes in
      opioid dose, aberrant urine toxicology results, and overdose events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Opioid-Related Risk Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months, and 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Risk behavior will be assessed using the Opioid-Related Behaviors in Treatment (ORBIT) scale. The ORBIT is a scale used to identify recent risk behavior among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. Scores on the single scale range from 0-40, with lower values representing less risk behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overdose and Naloxone Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline post-intervention and sustained effects at 4-6 and 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge of overdose and naloxone will be measured using survey items adapted from the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS). The OOKS is a scale measuring knowledge of overdose risks, warning signs, steps to address the overdose and appropriate use of naloxone. The investigators have adapted it to be specific to prescription opioids. The modified-OOKS is scored on a scale of 0-28, with higher values representing greater knowledge about overdose and naloxone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Naloxone Dispensings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacy or insurance claims databases will be used to identify naloxone dispensings in the outpatient setting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported naloxone pick-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient surveys will be used to identify naloxone dispensings in the outpatient setting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in opioid dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using pharmacy or insurance claims data, the investigators will calculate changes in the milligrams morphine equivalent dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Drug Use Risk Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months, and 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Drug Use Risk Behavior will be assessed using question 2 of the validated National Institutes on Drug Abuse-Modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) scale version 2.0. Scores on the single scale range from 0-60, with lower values representing less drug use risk behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hazardous Drinking and Alcohol Use Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months, and 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Use Risk Behavior will be assessed using the validated Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test--Consumption (AUDIT-C) scale. AUDIT-C is a screener used to identify patients with alcohol use disorders or hazardous drinking behavior. The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his or her safety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4-6 months, and 8-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS Scale v1.0 - Pain Intensity 3a. The PROMIS Pain Intensity instrument is scored on a scale of 3-15. A higher score represents greater pain intensity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Opioid Overdose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overdoses will be assessed using self-report, electronic health record data and death records.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Aberrant Urine Toxicology Screens</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urine toxicology screen results found in laboratory databases will be used to measure opioid medication diversion and drug use.</description>
