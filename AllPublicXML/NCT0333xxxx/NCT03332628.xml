  <brief_summary>

      The study to be performed will define the rate of skin barrier recovery following microneedle
      treatment of the skin in healthy subjects of differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transdermal drug delivery (by way of patches that adhere to the skin and deliver drug in a
      time-dependent fashion) allows for systemic drug delivery through the skin, while avoiding
      many of the side effects and challenges associated with oral or intravenous drug delivery.
      One significant challenge limiting the number of drug compounds that can be transdermally
      delivered is the hydrophobic nature of the skin, which provides a highly efficient barrier
      against the absorption of drug molecules. Microneedles are a minimally invasive means of
      allowing drug molecules to cross the skin by creating micron-sized channels (also called
      micropores) in the skin, thereby increasing its permeability. Microneedles have been safely
      used in hundreds of patients for administration of drugs and vaccines through the skin.
      Studies have demonstrated that microneedle treatment is relatively painless and
      well-tolerated by most patients.

      Following microneedle treatment, the skin must heal the micropores in order to restore
      barrier function. In young healthy individuals this process takes approximately 48 to 72
      hours when the skin is covered by an occlusive patch. The timeframe for micropore closure is
      longer in elderly individuals (&gt;65 years of age), taking several days longer to restore the
      skin barrier. As evidenced by the differences in micropore closure rate observed with
      advancing age, biological variation can have a significant effect on the skin's healing
      properties. There are almost no data available regarding how race and ethnicity affect skin
      response to microneedle insertion. It is crucial to better understand how the rates of
      micropore closure vary in different racial/ethnic populations because the potential for
      variability in drug delivery is high if the recovery timeframes are poorly understood.

      In this study we will measure hydration, color, and sebum content to characterize the
      epidermal properties of individuals of different self-identified race and ethnicity.
      Measurements of trans-epidermal water loss and electrical impedance will be used to evaluate
      the formation of micropores in the skin; the electrical impedance measurements will be used
      to calculate the rate of micropore closure. All of these skin characteristics can be measured
      using noninvasive methods that are quick and painless.

    <description>This is the only arm of the study. Nine sites on the upper arm will be identified, and baseline measurements of trans-epidermal water loss, electrical resistance, sebum content, hydration, color, and pH of the skin will be made at every site. At three of the sites a small microneedle patch will be applied to the skin. Microneedle application will only occur once on the first day of the study, and the microneedle patches will then be discarded. The sites will be covered with a small patch secured in place with medical tape; three of the other sites that did not receive microneedle application will also be covered with patches. The last three sites will not have any microneedle application and will not be covered with patches. Measurements will be repeated daily at all nine sites for four consecutive days after the day of microneedle application (trans-epidermal water loss measurements will only be made on day 1).</description>
