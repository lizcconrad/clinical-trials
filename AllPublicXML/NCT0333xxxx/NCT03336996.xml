  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the stem cell therapy is a promising method in treatment of the traumatic nerve
      fiber injuries. And the clinical use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells has been
      approved by FDA. However, the results are inconsistent from both human study and animal
      research, it often difficult to visualize the reconstruction of the motor circuits. A
      separate application of DTI could not precisely reveal white matter integrity. Combining
      blood oxygen level-dependent(BOLD)-functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) with diffusion
      tensor-based tractography (DTT), to detect neural activities in the brain involved in the
      motor function restore and then using the two seeds method to reconstruct the nerve fibers
      between these connecting regions. The main aim of this study: i. To characterize and evaluate
      functional and anatomical changes of nerve fiber injuries after umbilical cord mesenchymal
      stem cells transplantation with BOLD drived-diffusion tensor imaging(DTI). ii. To determine
      the therapeutic efficiency of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and also the utility of
      the integration of BOLD-fMRI and DTI. iii. To correlate the imaging results with the
      electrophysiology outcomes.
