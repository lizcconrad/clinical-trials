    <time_frame>Twice a day (in the morning and at night) from day 1 to day 5</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the efficacy of SP160412 in the reduction of pain as reported by the participants. The Brief Pain Inventory - short version assesses pain in the last 24 hours and its impact on daily functioning. It evaluates the worst, the least, the average pain the participants felt during the last day and the actual pain. Scores range from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;). BPI also evaluates the degree to which pain has interfered with different areas of participants' lives over the past 24 hours: general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others and sleep. BPI pain interference is scored as the mean of the seven interference items, each of which is scored from zero (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;completely interferes&quot;). Finally, BPI also evaluates the amount of relief of pain treatments have provided in the past 24 hours, ranging from 0% (&quot;no relief&quot;) to 100% (&quot;complete relief&quot;).</description>

Participants will on a 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 for &quot;Best possible sleep&quot; to 10 for &quot;Worst possible sleep&quot;. Used on a daily basis, sleep diaries are reliable and valid instruments for capturing patient reported outcomes. The sleep quality NRS has good psychometric properties.single-item sleep quality NRS was correlated with pain.</description>
