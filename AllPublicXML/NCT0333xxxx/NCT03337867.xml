    <textblock>
      The present study aims at investigating the effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation
      (iTBS) for motor recovery in recurrent stroke patients. Therefore a daily intervention of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent
      physiotherapy is compared to a control condition, sham stimulation combined with subsequent
      physiotherapy. Motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order
      to evaluate the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of recurrent stroke patients in the
      first weeks and after three months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of neuromodulation approaches aiming at improving motor recovery after
      stroke are limited to patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. Therefore, rehabilitation of
      recurrent stroke mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, particular
      these patients retain movement impairment relevant for activities of daily living.

      By using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it is possible to promote
      recovery of connectivity between brain regions, particularly after stroke and thereby improve
      motor performance. Previous data indicate that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a
      protocol of neuromodulation, enhances the effects of subsequent motor training in early
      rehabilitation after stroke.

      The current study aims at investigating whether daily repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation over 8 days combined with subsequent physiotherapy leads to better motor recovery
      in recurrent stroke, compared to control condition, physiotherapy after sham stimulation.
      Motor function, degree of disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate
      the effects of iTBS in the rehabilitation of recurrent stroke patients in the first weeks and
      after three months.

    <description>Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale of the upper extremity, FM The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale is an ordinal scale that has 3 points for each item. A zero score is given for the item if the subject cannot do the task. A score of 1 is given when the task is performed partially and a score of 2 is given when the task is performed fully.
Minimum score in upper limb = 0 Maximum score in upper limb = 66, Subscales are summed</description>

    <description>National Instituts of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment.
The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
