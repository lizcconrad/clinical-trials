  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effects of 25 and 50 milligram per square
      meter (mg/m^2) pevonedistat on the Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) of the
      electrocardiogram (ECG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. Pevonedistat in combination with
      standard of care will be used to treat participants who have advanced solid tumors. This
      study will assess the effects of pevonedistat on the QTc interval in participants with
      advanced solid tumors.

      The study will enroll approximately 45 participants. The study will be conducted in two
      Parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will have a 2-way crossover design and will involve the
      collection of triplicate ECGs. In Part A, participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two treatment groups as follow:

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2

        -  Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2 + Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2

      Eligible participants from Part A will continue treatment in optional Part B with
      pevonedistat in combination with SoC, docetaxel or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The
      investigator will decide which pevonedistat combination a participant will receive.

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Docetaxel

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 9.6 months. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic
      30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

Stable Disease (SD):Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression(PD),taking as reference smallest sum of diameter; PD: at least 20% increase in sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference, smallest sum on study(this includes baseline sum if that is smallest on study).In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or
             locally advanced solid tumor(s) appropriate for treatment with one of the 2
             combination therapies in Part B of this study, have progressed despite standard
             therapy, or for whom conventional therapy is not considered effective.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          3. Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study.

          4. Recovered (that is, grade less than or equal to [&lt;=] 1 toxicity) from the reversible
             effects of prior anticancer therapy.

          5. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling (including
             pharmacokinetic [PK] sampling).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with strong cytochrome P3A (CYP3A) inducers within 14 days before the first
             dose of pevonedistat. Participants must have no history of amiodarone use within 6

          2. Treatment with QT-prolonging drugs with a risk of causing torsades de pointes (TdP.
             Participants taking drugs with a possible or conditional risk of QT prolongation or
             drugs that are to be avoided by participants with congenital long QT syndrome may be
             considered if on a stable dose, pending discussion and agreement between the
             investigator and the sponsor.

        of the study. To be eligible for the optional Part B, participants must have completed Part
        A and be reassessed to determine if they meet the entry criteria for optional Part B. Only

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1500 per cubic
             millimeter (/mm^3).

          -  Platelet count &gt;=100,000/mm^3.

          -  Laboratory values for hemoglobin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and serum creatinine or
             calculated/measured creatinine clearance.

          -  Diarrhea symptoms resolved to Grade 1 or better.

          -  QTc interval &lt;480 millisecond (msec).

          -  Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest,
             abdomen, and pelvis within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.
