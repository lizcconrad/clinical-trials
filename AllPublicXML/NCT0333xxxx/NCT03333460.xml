      Background: Cocaine use disorders (CUD) is a complex brain disorder, involving several brain
      areas and neurocircuits. Effective treatments for CUD are still needed. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) stimulates non-invasively parts of the brain.
      Preliminary data suggest that rTMS may help reducing cocaine craving and consumption.
      Researchers want to learn how the brain and the drug-seeking behavior may change with this
      treatment.

      Objectives: To test if rTMS can reduce cocaine craving and use, and also affect several mood,
      behavioral and cognitive alterations associated with prolonged cocaine use.

      Eligibility: Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-65 who do have cocaine use disorder
      (moderate to severe).

      Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study. The study includes three
      phases: 1) a rTMS continued treatment phase; a rTMS follow-up; and a no rTMS follow-up.

      Prior to participating, participants will be screened with:

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Urine tests

        -  MRI (structural)

      After being enrolled, baseline behavioral and imaging data will be collected. In particular,
      participants will undergo:

        -  Questionnaires

        -  Functional MRI

      During the continued rTMS phase, participants with cocaine use disorder will be randomized to
      receive real or fake rTMS. Repetitive TMS will be delivered during 10 outpatient treatment
      days, over 2 weeks (5 days/week). Following this phase, subjects will have 12 follow-up
      visits (once/weekly), during which they will receive rTMS, and behavioral and imaging
      assessments will be performed. At the end of the rTMS follow up period, participants will
      further receive 3 follow up visits (once a month), during which rTMS will not be performed,
      but behavioral data will be collected.

      Treatment includes:

        -  rTMS: A coil is placed on the head. A brief electrical current passes through the coil.
           At each visit, participants will receive two rTMS sessions, with a 1hr interval between
           sessions. At the beginning of each rTMS session, they view cocaine-related images for
           few minutes.

        -  MRIs at baseline and at follow-up visit #12: Participants lie on a table that slides
           into a cylinder that takes pictures of the brain. They respond to images while in the
           scanner.

        -  Repeat of screening tests and questionnaires

        -  Urine toxicological screen

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to reduce craving in
      cocaine addicts. However, the efficacy of rTMS in treating cocaine addiction has not been
      evaluated in double-blind, sham-controlled studies and also, we lack a full characterization
      of rTMS effects on other important aspects, including effects on mood, cognition and changes
      in brain function. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) at 15 Hz frequency on the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex in cocaine dependent patients and to examine possible changes in mood,
      cognition, and brain activity and functional connectivity associated with this intervention.
      For this purpose, the investigators will recruit cocaine dependent patients. After screening
      and informed consent, participants will undergo active or sham rTMS for two consecutive weeks
      (twice a day) during the continued treatment phase, and a maintenance intervention (twice a
      week for 3 months), during the rTMs follow-up phase. Following this phase, participants will
      be followed for further 3 months, during which no rTMS will be delivered but clinical and
      imaging data will be collected. The investigators will also measure clinical, cognitive and
      brain structural and functional connectivity to assess changes related to the intervention in
      the short and long term (measurements at: baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months).

      Procedure: The project consists of: Screening Visit (baseline), Part 1 (continued treatment
      phase), Part 2 (3 months- rTMS follow-up), Part 3 (3 months follow-up without rTMS). First,
      there will be a screening visit, where a clinical interview will be conducted and
      questionnaires and tests will be administered to identify study participants who meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging data will be
      acquired. The neuroimaging data will be exploratory, to be associated with the outcome
      measures. In Part 1, all participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      arms with rTMS (15Hz, 15Hz-Sham). Participants will receive 2 sessions of rTMS (active or
      sham), twice per day for 10 consecutive days, for a total of 20 rTMS sessions. Following
      this, the investigators will evaluate the acute effect of treatment on cocaine craving and
      consumption, mood and cognition. Also, they will collect exploratory neuroimaging data
      (functional MRI and resting state functional connectivity). In Part 2 of the study, all
      participants will continue the assigned treatment arm with rTMS (15Hz, 15Hz-Sham) for three
      months. Participants will receive 2 sessions of rTMS (active or sham) once per week; clinical
      and cognitive data will be acquired once per month. The investigators will evaluate the
      effect of treatment on cocaine craving and consumption, mood and cognition. Also, they will
      collect exploratory neuroimaging data (functional MRI and resting state functional
      connectivity). In Part 3 of the study, participants will not receive any rTMS session.
      Clinical and cognitive data will be acquired once per month for three months. The
      investigators will evaluate the long-term effect of treatment on cocaine craving and
      consumption, mood and cognition.

    <description>The Eriksen Flanker Task is a set of response inhibition tests used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers). A directional response (usually left or right) is assigned to a central target stimulus. Each task begin with a short instruction phase followed by 20 practice trials and 100 experimental trials. The stimuli are displayed for 1500 msec. The measures of performance in each condition is the median reaction time (RT) for correct trials and the proportion of errors.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Each patient will receive active stimulation targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) with a frequency of 15 Hz and 100% of the individual resting motor threshold, for a total of 40 trains (60 stimuli per train, inter-train interval of 15 second, total duration 13 minutes). Each session will be repeated twice/daily for 10 consecutive days for 2 weeks, during the continued treatment phase. Following this, the participants will receive the maintenance intervention of 2 sessions per week for 3 months (rTMS follow-up), at the same parameters described above.

Also, the software will be pre-programmed by a staff member that will not be involved in data collection and analysis. The sham condition will match the number of pulses delivered during the 15Hz session and will use the same coil placement but the intensity of stimulation will be set a 3% of the individual resting motor threshold so to ensure that the participant will feel similar scalp sensations experienced by participants receiving active rTMS, but brain tissue will not be stimulated.
