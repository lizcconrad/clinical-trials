  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with
      platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death for patients with gynecologic malignancies.
      Approximately 75% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage will eventually experience
      disease recurrence. The overall response rates of second-line chemotherapy for recurrent
      ovarian cancer are only 20-27%. The 5-year overall survival rates are less than 20%.
      Therefore, it is important to seek alternative agent that can improve the outcome.
      Fludarabine is a purine nucleoside analog prodrug that upon phosphorylation is toxic to
      dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, exerting its effects through DNA synthesis
      interference and apoptosis. The preclinical studies suggest fludarabine may be effective in
      other cancers such as ovarian cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the
      efficacy and safety of the study drug fludarabine combined with pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum resistant
      or refractory ovarian cancer.

    <description>Progression-free survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the time from registration to the earlier of death or disease progression. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.0 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Equivocal progression of non-target lesions also qualifies as PD</description>

    <measure>Objective response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to four years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate defined as confirmed complete response or partial response under RECIST 1.0 criteria. CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met.</description>
