  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central focus of this trial is to understand the effectiveness of Preoperative
      Immunonutrition (PINT) in improving surgical outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). We hypothesize that PINT will reduce post-operative complications in IBD
      patients undergoing elective surgery with added improvements in length-of-stay (LOS), quality
      of life (QOL) and patient satisfaction. As a secondary focus, the investigator will aim to
      better understand the potential mechanism-of-action by which PINT may have its effects
      through analyses of biomarkers including inflammatory markers, nutritional proteins and the
      fecal microbiome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis, is a chronic
      and costly disease of unknown etiology that now affects over 3.1 million people in the United
      States. Patients with IBD suffer from lifelong malnutrition, pain and bleeding with added
      risks of cancers, obstructions and fistulas. There is no known cure and the incidence
      continues to grow. While treatments are usually medical IBD patients will undergo at least
      one major surgery during their lifetime. Patients also have particularly poor surgical
      outcomes with high rates of post-operative complications. In an attempt to improve the risk
      profile of patients and decrease complications, preoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
      has been used to optimize IBD patients for surgery. While this approach has been successful
      the cost and morbidities of TPN prohibit its generalized application. Practical strategies
      that improve surgical outcomes for IBD patients are urgently needed. Improving nutritional
      deficiencies before an operation may be a practical way to improve post-operative outcomes.
      The oral administration of preoperative immunonutrition, is an alternative method to improve
      nutritional states and may have utility in IBD patients who have particularly severe
      nutritional deficiencies because of disease-specific issues in malabsorption, maldigestion
      and loss of appetite.

    <description>Will be captured preoperatively with the S-CAHPS. Participants will be asked to complete the Surgical-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (S-CAHPS) Survey. The S-CAHPS Surgical Care Survey was developed in 2009 through collaboration of the CAHPS consortium, American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Surgical Quality Alliance (SQA), the American Urological Association (AUA), 11 other surgical subspecialty groups and endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) in 2012. The S-CAHPS is a 47 question survey that addresses patients' preoperative and postoperative experience with surgical care. The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey generates a global rating item, which uses a scale of 0 to 10 to measure respondents' assessments of their surgeon and composite measures (also known as reporting composites), which combine results for closely-related items that have been grouped together.</description>
