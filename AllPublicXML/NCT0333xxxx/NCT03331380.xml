  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers are testing a new kind of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to take
      pictures of the heart. It uses lower energy levels than other MRI scanners. This may help
      scan people with metal devices in their body, or in invasive heart procedures using metal
      tools.

      Objective:

      To test new MRI scanners and software changes to create better pictures of the heart.

      Eligibility:

      People with heart disease and healthy volunteers, ages 18 and older

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood tests.

      Participants with heart disease will have both the new MRI and a conventional MRI. Healthy
      participants will have both MRIs or only the new one. If 2 are done, they must be within 60
      days.

      For both MRI versions, participants lie on a table that slides into a large tube. During
      scans, they will hold their breath for up to 20 seconds at a time. Heart activity will be
      measured by wires connected to pads on the skin. A flexible belt may be used to monitor their
      breathing. They will be in the scanner up to 2 hours.

      Participants can agree to have a dye called gadolinium injected into their arm during the
      scan. This brightens the pictures of the heart.

      Participants can agree to take a drug called a vasodilator. This helps detect areas of the
      heart with abnormal blood supply. Scans of the heart are taken before, during, and after they
      get the medicine. The drug may cause temporary chest pain or shortness of breath. They may
      get other drugs to relieve these symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides accurate and reproducible measures of
      cardiac chamber volumes, cardiac function, blood flow, myocardial scar, myocardial
      extracellular volume as a measure of collagen content, myocardial iron content, and others,
      all without exposure to ionizing radiation. The prevailing wisdom is that CMR using high
      specific absorption rate (SAR) scanning modes produces highest image quality. We propose a
      method of CMR that can be performed with low SAR but that nevertheless preserves image
      quality because of efficient use of CMR signal. CMR using low SAR is attractive because it
      may reduce heating of metallic structures. This may allow safe CMR in patients with metallic
      implants, and it may allow MRI catheterization using metallic guidewires and catheter
      devices.

      The goal of this non-significant risk (NSR) medical device study is to test initial technical
      feasibility of low SAR CMR in healthy volunteers by technical optimization of scanner
      protocols, to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR measurements in healthy volunteers
      using low SAR CMR versus conventional CMR, and to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR
      measurements in adult patients with known stable heart disease using low SAR CMR versus
      conventional CMR.

      A secondary goal is to assess the potential of this new low-SAR CMR system to perform
      non-cardiovascular radiological diagnostic imaging by testing comparative diagnostic accuracy
      of standard MR measurements in adult patients with known non-cardiovascular disease using the
      low SAR CMR system vs conventional MR exam.
