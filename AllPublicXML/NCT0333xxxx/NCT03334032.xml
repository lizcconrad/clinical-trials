      The study aimed to assess protein accretion during weight gain in adolescent patients with
      Anorexia nervosa

      Background: Bone health and growth during adolescence require adequate Total Body Protein
      (TBPr). Re-nutrition for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) should aim to normalize body
      composition, i.e. recovery of fat mass and TBPr.

      Objective: The study intended to analyze predictors of protein status, including exercise
      status, in adolescents with AN, and to investigate whether weight gain would replete body
      protein deficits.

      Methods: The investigators assessed TBPr in a longitudinal, observational study as
      height-adjusted nitrogen index (NI) using in-vivo neutron activation analysis in adolescents
      with AN at the commencement of refeeding (T0), as well as seven months thereafter (T1), and
      in age-matched normal weight controls. Lean tissue and fat mass were assessed with
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). BMI, BMI-SDS and lean tissue mass were tested as
      predictors of protein status using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.

        At baseline assessment, ten patients had primary amenorrhea and 87 girls secondary
        amenorrhea. Six girls were not amenorrhoeic but were taking oral contraceptives or had lost
        more than 20% of their weight and fulfilled the remaining diagnostic criteria for AN. The
        mean duration of the eating disorder at the time of testing was 15 ± 12 months, ranging
        from 3 to 60 months and estimated premorbid BMI of the AN patients was 20.4 ± 2.9 (13.5 -
        28.7 kg/m2; data available for 98 patients). Before admission, the patients (n = 97) had
        lost 15 ± 7 (2 - 36) kg. The mean weight on hospital admission (data available for 88
        patients; 10 patients were outpatients; missing data, n = 5) was 41.1 ± 6.1 kg.
