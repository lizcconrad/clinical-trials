  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in pregnancy carries significant pregnancy specific risks and requires frequent
      glucose monitoring to reduce these risks. This project compares the effect of two incentive
      schemes on adherence rates of glucose testing in pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with increased risks of maternal and fetal complications
      and can be challenging to manage due to increasing insulin requirements with advancing
      gestational age. Based on standard of care guidelines, patients with diabetes check their
      blood glucose at least 4 times per day. Optimal management requires frequent glucose
      self-monitoring and active management of abnormal blood sugars and medications by clinicians.
      Poorly controlled diabetes has both significant maternal and neonatal consequences: Improving
      test adherence could benefit both the pregnant woman and her fetus. In this study, we propose
      to test the effect of two incentive schemes on rates of glucose monitoring on pregnant women
      with diabetes requiring medication.

      Pregnant women with diabetes requiring medication are invited to participate if they meet
      specific inclusion criteria (&lt;28 weeks) and followed in our outpatient clinic. Participants
      are randomized into one of three groups:

        1. control group - receive compensation at time of enrollment,

        2. positive incentive group - receive compensation per test completed

        3. loss aversion group - receive between a range of compensation depending on their overall
           level of adherence.

      Primary outcome of the study is frequency of prescribed glucose testing in pregnancy
