  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the experience of living alone in older age
      with cognitive impairment.

      We recruit adults 55+ living alone with cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease or
      mild cognitive impairment.

      This study investigates the priorities and concerns of older adults living alone with
      cognitive impairment. Participants are interviewed 5 times for one hour in their homes within
      3 months at a time that works for them.

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the experience of living alone in older age
      with cognitive impairment. This knowledge is important to design programs that are
      appropriate. Dr. Elena Portacolone, an Assistant Professor from the Institute of Health and
      Aging is the study researcher.

      Study participants are interviewed by Elena at a time and place convenient to them, usually
      their home. Interviews are audio recorded and last around one hour. Study participants are
      interviewed five times within 3 months.

      After the interview, a transcriptionist will type into a computer the recording and will
      remove personal names. The sound recording will then be destroyed.

      Participants can stop being in the study at any time.
