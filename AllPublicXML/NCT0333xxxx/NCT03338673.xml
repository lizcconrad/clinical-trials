  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illness often report difficulties with thinking skills like
      memory. These difficulties can make it harder to perform day-to-day activities. The purpose
      of this study is to test whether combining a type of non-invasive brain stimulation with
      computerized cognitive exercises is acceptable to participants, and whether it is helpful in
      improving a specific type of memory skill in people who have mental health conditions and
      memory deficits.

      This study is designed so that all participants will get both treatments: the non-invasive
      brain stimulation and computerized cognitive exercises. Half of the participants will start
      with both the brain stimulation and the cognitive exercises (dual therapy), and half will
      start with just the computerized exercises (monotherapy). After three weeks, participants
      will switch to the other condition: the people who did both treatments first will switch to
      just the cognitive exercises alone, and the people who started with the cognitive exercises
      alone will then switch to doing both the brain stimulation and cognitive exercises.

      Overall, participants will be in the study for about 7-8 weeks. The brain stimulation
      treatment involves 10 visits to the clinic over 3 weeks. The computerized cognitive exercises
      can be done at home, and involve 10 hours of exercises over 3 weeks. Participants will also
      complete paper-and-pencil assessments at the beginning, middle, and end of treatment.
