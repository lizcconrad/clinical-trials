      The proposed study is an open-label, non-controlled, adaptive-design Phase II study to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and conditions of use
      (dosage, frequency of administration at maintenance) of ARGX-113 in patients with mild to
      moderate Pemphigus Vulgaris, either newly diagnosed or relapsing.

      The total study duration for each patient is approximately 19 weeks. It consists of a maximum
      Screening period of 2 weeks, an Induction treatment period of 3 weeks, a Maintenance
      treatment period of 6 weeks and a treatment-free Follow-up (FU) period of 8 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of PV, that has been confirmed by positive immunofluorescence or
             enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to the Pemphigus S2 guideline.

          3. Mild to moderate disease severity (Pemphigus Disease Area Index [PDAI] &lt; 45).

          4. Newly diagnosed patients naïve to any treatment or with a first course of oral
             prednisone of at most 4 weeks' duration, and patients who relapse off therapy or
             despite oral prednisone at tapered dose +/- a conventional immunosuppressor (e.g.
             azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil).

          5. Identified serum levels of pathogenic antibodies directed against Dsg-1 and/or -3
             antigens (by positive indirect immunofluorescence or ELISA).

          6. Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent
             (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health information),
             and comply with the study protocol procedures (including required study visits).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant and lactating women, and those intending to become pregnant during the study
             or within 90 days after the last dosing.

          2. Male patients who are sexually active that do not intend to use effective methods of
             contraception during the study or within 90 days after the last dosing. Methods
             include condoms and spermicidal agent, or a hormonal contraceptive method used by the
             female partner plus a barrier method, or two simultaneous barrier methods.

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, drug-induced
             pemphigus or any other non-PV auto-immune blistering disease.

          4. History of refractory disease to active third line therapy (e.g. intravenous
             polyvalent human immunoglobulins [IVIg], rituximab, plasma exchange/
             immunoadsorption).

          5. Use of therapies other than oral prednisone and conventional immunosuppressors, that
             can interfere in the clinical course of the disease (e.g. intravenous [IV]
             prednisolone bolus, methotrexate, dapsone, sulfasalazine, tetracyclines, nicotinamide,
             plasmapheresis/ plasma exchange, immunoadsorption and IVIg) within 2 months prior to
             study entry.

          6. Use of rituximab and other CD20 target biologics within 6 months prior to study entry.

          7. History of anaphylactic reaction, or a known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the
             components of the IMP.

          8. History of vaccination within the last 4 weeks prior to Screening, or with a planned
             vaccination during the study.

          9. Recent serious infection (i.e., requiring injectable antimicrobial therapy or
             hospitalization) within the 8 weeks prior to study entry.

         10. Known active or chronic viral infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV); refer to the
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.

         11. Known seropositive or active infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV).

         12. Known history or known infection with viral infection with human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV 1 and 2 antibodies).

         13. Body Mass Index (BMI) at Screening &gt; 35 kg/m2.

         14. Clinical evidence of significant active, unstable or uncontrolled concomitant disease
             (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrinological and
             metabolic, hepatic, renal, neurologic, malignancy, infectious diseases,
             coagulopathies, other autoimmune disease) or condition (lack of peripheral venous
             access, recent major surgery, etc), which, in the opinion of the investigator, puts
             the patient at undue risk or may affect the interpretation of the results.

         15. Patients in general health condition not allowing study participation (Karnofsky index
             &lt; 60%; see Appendix 14.2).

         16. At Screening, have clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as below:

                  limit of normal (ULN)

                  defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
                  Events (NCI-CTCAE), due solely to a documented medical diagnosis of Gilbert's
                  syndrome)

               3. Serum creatinine of &gt; 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min (using the

                  time (aPTT) &gt; 1.5 x ULN

               6. Total immunoglobulin G (IgG) level &lt; 6 g/L

               7. Presence of &gt; 1 + proteinuria dipstick
