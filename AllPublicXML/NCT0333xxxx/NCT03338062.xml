  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare radiation treatment plans that are designed for
      patients with liver cancer. One treatment plan will be created using routine procedures and
      scans normally performed for radiation treatment planning. The other treatment plan will be
      created using routine procedures with the addition of two imaging scans; a HIDA
      (Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid) scan and an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan. This
      study will evaluate if adding these imaging scans to treatment planning can reduce the amount
      of radiation to healthy liver tissue during treatment.
