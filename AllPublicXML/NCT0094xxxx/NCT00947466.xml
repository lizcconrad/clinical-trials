      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of
      buprenorphine patches in children who require opioid pain relief for moderate to severe mouth
      pain.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and if eligible will apply a buprenorphine patch
      (Day 1). The patch will be worn for 7 days during which time, safety assessments, pain
      scores, mucositis scores, PK sampling &amp; vital signs will be assessed on each day. After patch
      removal subjects will continue with these assessments on a daily basis until Day 12. The
      subject will then be followed up for 10 days (to Day 22) to collect information on
      ongoing/new SAEs/AEs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female children experiencing severe mouth pain secondary to chemotherapy
             induced mucositis requiring opioid analgesic therapy and who will be an inpatient, as
             a minimum up to Day 8 (patch removal).

          2. Subjects experiencing 'severe' pain in the Investigators clinical judgment.

          3. Body weight ≥ 15 kg. Subjects weighing ≥ 25 kg will be recruited in the first phase of
             the study with those weighing &lt; 25 kg also being included in the second phase, (after
             a successful review by an IDSMC). Upper age range to be 16 years.

          4. In dwelling IV cannula or central line from which blood can be obtained.

          5. Written informed consent obtained from parent(s)/legal representative, and where
             possible assent obtained from the subject if appropriate, in line with local
             regulations.

          6. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test if the
             Principal Investigator considers there to be a reasonable possibility of pregnancy.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any of its excipients in the
             transdermal system, as outlined in the Summary of Product Characteristics for BuTrans.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to other opioids.

          3. Skin disease affecting application or local tolerance of BTDS.

          4. Clinically significant history of allergic reaction to wound dressings or adhesives.

          5. Severe respiratory impairment.

          6. Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction.

          7. Severe renal impairment.

          8. Subjects who are receiving MAO inhibitors or have taken them within the previous 2
             weeks.

          9. Subjects receiving hypnotics or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants that,
             in the investigator's opinion, may pose a risk of additional CNS depression with study
             medication.

         10. Subjects who have taken any buprenorphine preparations in the last 14 days.

         11. Subjects with myasthenia gravis.

         12. Subjects with convulsive disorders, head injury, shock, or reduced level of
             consciousness of uncertain origin.

         13. Subjects who are currently participating in another clinical research study involving
             a new chemical entity (NCE) unless the sole purpose of the other trial at the time of
             BUP1501 screening is for long term follow-up/survival data or subjects who have
             participated in a clinical study within the previous 30 days. Participation in a
             chemotherapy clinical trial that is not evaluating a NCE will be accepted for
             inclusion.

         14. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating or in the Investigators opinion are at risk of
             conceiving.

         15. Previous enrollment in this clinical study.

         16. Subjects who the Investigator believes are unsuitable for the study.
