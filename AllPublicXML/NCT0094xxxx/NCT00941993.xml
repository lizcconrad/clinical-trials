      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, prospective, clinical study intended to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a method for iontophoretic delivery of a buffered lidocaine/epinephrine
      solution for provision of tympanic membrane anesthesia in patients who are indicated for an
      ear procedure requiring penetration of the tympanic membrane, including, but not limited to,
      myringotomy, tympanocentesis with culture or tympanostomy with tube placement.

The Wong-Baker FACES pain scoring system is a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 means 'no hurt', 1 = 'hurts a little bit', 2 = 'hurts little more', 3 = 'hurts even more', 4 = 'hurts whole lot' and 5 = 'hurts worst'.

    <measure>Subject/Parent Reported Satisfaction With the In-office Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Adult subjects or parents of pediatric subjects were asked to rate their agreement or disagreement with the statement: 'Overall, I am satisfied with the whole procedure'. Response options included: 'Strongly Disagree', 'Disagree', 'Neutral', 'Agree' or 'Strongly Agree'. The number of respondents who reported that they 'agree' or 'strongly agree' that they were satisfied with the whole procedure are reported.
The analysis population does not include the full study cohort as this survey question was implemented during, not prior to, the enrollment period.</description>

        <description>The Wong-Baker FACES pain scoring system is a subject-reported instrument using a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 means 'no hurt', 1 = 'hurts a little bit', 2 = 'hurts little more', 3 = 'hurts even more', 4 = 'hurts whole lot' and 5 = 'hurts worst'.
Pain scores were recorded for all subjects for which an ear procedure was attempted.Pain scores are presented by subject, as an average of pain scores for both ears.</description>
