             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to discontinue
             HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For
             most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the
             study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study

          -  Severity of Disease: A best FEV1 of 40%-85% of the predicted normal value during the
             Visit 1 screening period.

          -  No history of smoking within 6 months of the start of the study, and with a total pack
             year history of &lt;/= 10 pack years
