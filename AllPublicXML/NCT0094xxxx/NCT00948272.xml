      The purpose of this study is to generate data in human on immunogenicity and safety of
      Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine (VRVg) in support of the vaccine registration.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is at least as immunogenic as the reference vaccine, Verorab,
           in terms of seroconversion rate at Day 42 of the primary vaccination series.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg after each vaccination when administered in a
           pre-exposure vaccination schedule with a booster at 12 months after the first
           vaccination in all subjects.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by VRVg 21 days after two vaccinations in a
           subset of randomized subjects and 14 days after the last vaccination of the primary
           vaccination series.

      All subjects will receive three vaccinations for primary series and a booster vaccination at
      12 months after the first vaccination.
