  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a positive correlation between serum's cholesterol levels and death from
      cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease. The reduction of plasma lipids
      levels is one of the main goals of prevention. Research has shown that green tea has
      beneficial effects on health due to the polyphenolic substances (catechins) that it contains.
      Studies have shown that prolonged consumption of polyphenols has a positive effect on factors
      related to cardiovascular risk such as obesity, dislipidemia and various indicators of
      oxidative stress.

      The aim of this study was to examine the possible effects of catechin supplementation, in
      combination with the classic treatment for the reduction of hypercholesterolemia, statin
      therapy, on the treatment's effectiveness and in the reduction of classic side effects.

      This is a randomized, double - blind placebo controlled trial. The patients will be divided
      randomly in two groups; one group will receive statin and catechin, while the other statin
      and placebo for 12 weeks. The experimental group will receive 20 mg atorvastatin (Lipitor)
      daily and 600 mg of catechin in capsules, while the control group will receive 20 mg
      atorvastatin (Lipitor) and Placebo in identical capsules of 600 mg for the same time period.

      The patients will undergo biochemical evaluation in which the serum lipids, the levels of
      oxidative stress and the antioxidant capacity will be assessed. Body composition will be
      calculated with anthropometric measurements, while the levels of visceral fat, the
      subcutaneous fat, as well as the level of liver fat infiltration will be examined with the
      use of computed tomography images. Factors related to the patients' quality of life will be
      assessed by a series of questionnaires.

      The investigators hypothesized that the combination treatment with statin and green tea
      extract (catechins)will improve in a greater extent the lipidemic profile, increase
      antioxidant capacity, reducing significantly visceral fat and intrahepatic lipids content.
