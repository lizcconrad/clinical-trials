      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of MDCT under stress to assess myocardial
      ischemia. There is some preliminary data in the literature showing the ability of MDCT under
      stress to bring relevant information about myocardial ischemia. Stress MDCT will have several
      advantages over single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging namely: shorter
      acquisition time, lower irradiation dose, lower cost. The feasibility of such experiment is
      still debated and need to be address in a clinical study.

      Hypothesis: Cardiac dual source computed tomography (DSCT) performed during dipyridamole
      infusion allows for 1) myocardial perfusion analysis and detection of myocardial ischemia and
      2) good quality evaluation (artefact free) of the coronary artery anatomy. Cardiac DSCT
      during dipyridamole infusion may assess in a single volume acquisition relevant information
      about coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia that required today two different examinations
      each with a cost and side effects. Recently investigators showed on animal models as well as
      in humans that MDCT during stress test could detect myocardial ischemia.

      Purposes: 1) To evaluate the diagnostic potential sensitivity, specificity of coronary DSCT
      during dipyridamole infusion for the assessment of myocardial ischemia with myocardial single
      photon emission computed topography (SPECT) as standard of reference. 2) To evaluate the
      feasibility (presence of artefact, number of coronary segment assessable) of coronary DSCT
      during dipyridamole injection.

      Methods: This prospective study will include patients referred from the department of
      cardiology of Nord hospital. Inclusion criteria will be: patients who required functional
      evaluation of a known coronary artery lesion. Patients will be successively include. Each
      patient will undergo myocardial SPECT and coronary DSCT during dipyridamole injection.
      Coronary DSCT image analysis will determine the severity and the extension of the ischemic
      territory. Statistical analysis will determine the reproductibility of the described
      technique, compared the DSCT with SPECT as standard of reference and determined sensitivity,
      specificity and predictive values (positive and negative) of the described technique.
