    <textblock>
      The aim of this exploratory randomized, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of Circadin® 2mg in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD) treated with the
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. The effects of add-on Circadin® 2mg vs. placebo on the
      decline in cognitive skills and global functioning, as well as on daytime somnolence and will
      be assessed.

          4. A documented history of confirmed Alzheimer's disease

          5. Dementia severity: MMSE score &gt; 15,

          6. Stable AChE inhibitor dose for 2 months prior to Screening visit.

             significant by the investigator.

         12. Residence: Stable home situation with no planned move during the 28-week

          7. Participation in a clinical trial with any investigational agent within two months
             prior to study enrollment.

          8. Alcoholism.
