  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present primary therapy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 and
      persistent CIN 2 represents conisation. Surgical treatment can cause perioperative
      (infection, bleeding in in 5-10%) and postoperative (increased risk of preterm labor)
      complications, as well as incomplete resections (20%) and risk of recurrence in 5-17%.
      Imiquimod is an immunomodulating drug, that has been reported to be effective in human
      papilloma virus-related disease, such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal
      intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN), and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The present
      randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study evaluates the efficacy of a topical
      treatment with imiquimod for 16 weeks in 60 patients with histologically confirmed CIN 2/3.
