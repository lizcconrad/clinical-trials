  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been little research on how chronic pain is related to brain activity. The purpose
      of this study is to learn more about pain and brain activity by finding any differences in
      brain activity among people who have moderate to severe chronic pain and a spinal cord
      injury, those who have a spinal cord injury but do not experience chronic pain, and people
      who have neither a spinal cord injury nor chronic pain (please note: subjects do not have to
      have pain to participate in this study). The information we collect will help the
      investigators get a better understanding of chronic pain.

      Research staff will record the brain activity of subjects by using an electroencephalogram
      (EEG), a device that measures the electrical activity in the brain through electrodes put on
      the scalp. There is no risk of electrical shock. Research staff will put a cap on the
      subject's head that has electrodes that will measure your brain activity. In addition to the
      electrodes in the cap, two electrode clips will be put on your ears. EEG activity will be
      collected for 20 minutes: subjects will have their eyes open for ten minutes, and then eyes
      closed for ten minutes.

      Before the assessment, subjects will be asked how much pain they are currently in. Once the
      20-minute assessment has ended, the research staff member will again ask subjects how much
      pain they are currently in, and how much pain they had during the EEG assessment. Subjects
      with SCI-related pain on a daily basis may also be contacted in the future to see if they
      want to participate in the second phase of this study that will involve learning to directly
      change their brain activity.

        Subjects will be recruited primarily from a previous survey study conducted by the
        principal investigator, as well as a data registry maintained by the principal
        investigator. Individuals recruited for these studies were recruited primarily from
        rehabilitation clinics. Interested individuals may also learn about the study from
        advertisements in newsletters and magazines from consumer organizations, physician
        referrals, recruitment descriptions on University of Washington websites, and study
        brochures in clinics.

        In addition, SCI subjects participating in the study will give friends and relatives who do
        not have a spinal cord injury or chronic pain a brochure informing them about the study.
