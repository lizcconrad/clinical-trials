    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, outcomes study. In this study, the Zero-P PEEK implant
      will be used in patients undergoing ACDF for treatment of SCDD at a single level between C3
      and C7. The cohort will be followed over time to twenty-four (24) months after surgery. Up to
      fifteen (15) sites will participate in this study. This is not a controlled study.

    <description>The Zero-P PEEK is a stand-alone device intended for use in cervical interbody fusion. The device consists of a plate and a spacer with four rigid screws to provide similar stability to a traditional cervical plate and interbody spacer. It is intended for use in skeletally mature patients with symptomatic cervical disc disease (SCDD) with accompanying radicular symptoms, at one level from C3 to C7.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic cervical disc disease (SCDD) in only one vertebral level between C3-C7
             requiring:

               1. Neck or arm (radicular) pain and/or

               2. Functional/neurological deficit confirmed by imaging (CT, MRI, X-Ray) of at least
                  one of the following:

             i. herniated nucleus pulposus

             ii. spondylosis (defined by presence of osteophytes)

             iii. loss of disc height

          2. NDI score greater than or equal to 15/50 (30%) (considered moderate disability);

          3. Skeletally mature adult between the ages of 18-70 years at the time of surgery;

          4. Has completed at least six (6) weeks of conservative therapy;

          5. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with this protocol

          6. Personally signed and dated informed consent document prior to any study-related
             procedures indicating that the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. More than one vertebral level to be fused;

          2. Posterior instrumentation necessary at same level;

          3. Has had previous surgery at the index level;

          4. Has a fused level adjacent to the index level;

          5. Active systemic or local infection;

          7. Active hepatitis (receiving medical treatment within two years);

          8. Active rheumatoid arthritis, non-controlled diabetes mellitus, or any other medical
             condition(s) that would represent a significant increase in surgical risk or interfere
