    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a survey instrument to be used by
      persons with type 1 diabetes aged 12 and older to screen for an eating disorder.

      Phase 1 - Develop an initial instrument and start to establish content validity. What do
      dually diagnosed patients believe are the most important, relevant, and significantly
      contributing constructs that we should measure in order to capture those individuals with
      type 1 diabetes who may exhibit symptoms of an eating disorder? What individual items will
      best measure these constructs?

      Phase 2 - Conduct individual interviews for cognitive testing of our instrument and further
      examine its content validity. How well do the individual items included in our instrument
      capture eating disorder symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes? Do these items accurately
      capture the information we seek to collect? What symptoms have we not considered? How
      readable and understandable are our questions?

      Phase 3 - Explore the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of our
      instrument. Do the items in our instrument accurately capture the constructs we wish to
      measure? Do similar items &quot;hang together&quot; in a manner that is clinically and theoretically
      meaningful?

      Phase 4 - Address convergent and discriminant validity as well as test-retest reliability.
      Does our instrument demonstrate appropriate convergent and divergent validity as well as
      test-retest reliability? Does our instrument capture eating disorder symptoms among persons
      with diabetes? Is our instrument more specific to the population of individuals with diabetes
      than traditional eating disorder instruments (i.e., does our instrument capture more
      information and give a more accurate presentation than the other instruments)?
