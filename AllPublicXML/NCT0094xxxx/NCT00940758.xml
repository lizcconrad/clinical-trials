      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), toxicity profile,
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the pharmacokinetics of biweekly PEP02
      treatment.

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received irinotecan treatment

          -  With active CNS metastases (indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, steroid
             requirement, or progressive growth)

          -  With clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder (e.g. bleeding, inflammation,
             obstruction, including partial or complete obstruction secondary to peritoneal
             carcinomatosis, or diarrhea &gt; grade 1)

          -  With uncontrolled intercurrent illness that could limit study compliance considered to
             be ineligible for the study by the investigators including, but NOT limited to, any of
             the following:ongoing or active infection requiring antibiotic treatment, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric
             illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance

          -  With other primary malignancies, except those remain disease-free for 3 or more years
             after curative treatment.

          -  Prior chemotherapy within 3 weeks

          -  Major surgery or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
