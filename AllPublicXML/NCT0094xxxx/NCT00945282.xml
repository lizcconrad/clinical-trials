  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK has in-licensed a novel NNRTI-class candidate (GSK2248761, IDX12899) for the treatment of
      subjects with HIV-1 infection from Idenix Pharmaceuticals. Idenix Pharmaceuticals completed a
      proof-of-concept study evaluating GSK2248761 monotherapy over seven days in forty
      treatment-naïve subjects infected with HIV-1. GSK2248761 doses sequentially evaluated were
      800 mg QD, 400 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100mg QD.

      This study will evaluate a lower dose, or doses, of GSK2248761 to better characterize the
      dose-response and concentration-response curves. The results from this study will be used to
      select doses for future clinical studies in HIV-1 infected subjects.

             of normal (ULN), AST or ALT &lt;= 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Exclusion Criteria for Screening ECG (A single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination): Exclusion Criteria for Screening ECG: Heart rate: (males) &lt;45 and &gt;100
             bpm (females) &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm, QRS duration: &gt;120 msec, QTc interval (Bazett): &gt; 450
             msec. Non-sustained (&gt;= 3 consecutive beats) or sustained ventricular tachycardia.
             Sinus Pauses &gt;2.5 seconds. 2nd degree (Type II) or higher AV block. Evidence of
