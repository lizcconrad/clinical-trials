  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of
      JNJ-38518168 compared with placebo in adult participants with active rheumatoid arthritis
      (long time systemic disease of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial
      membranes and bones) despite methotrexate (MTX) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) and
      parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study. The study
      will consist of 3 phases; Screening phase (3 weeks), Treatment phase (12 weeks) and Follow-up
      phase (4 weeks). Each participant will be enrolled in the study for approximately 19 weeks.
      Participants with active rheumatoid arthritis despite MTX therapy will receive JNJ-38518168,
      100 milligram (mg) per day or matching placebo capsules once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy
      will be primarily evaluated by change from Baseline in disease activity index score
      C-reactive protein at Week 12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

          -  Participant who have received intra-articular, intramuscular (into the muscle), or
             intravenous (into the vein) corticosteroids, including adrenocorticotropic hormone

             the first dose of the study medication

          -  Participants who have been treated with any other investigational drug or medical
             device within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer before the
             first dose of study medication

          -  Participants who have undergone surgical treatments for RA including synoviectomy
             (surgical removal of a part of the synovial membrane of a joint) and arthroplasty
