      RATIONALE: Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitomycin C, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into the tumor and
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib tosylate before and after
      chemoembolization may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving sorafenib
      tosylate before and after hepatic arterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin hydrochloride
      and mitomycin C works in treating patients with localized liver cancer that cannot be removed
      by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tosylate therapy when administered
           before and after doxorubicin hydrochloride-based hepatic arterial chemoembolization
           (HACE) as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0 in patients with localized unresectable
           hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if sorafenib tosylate decreases the number of HACE treatments required to
           achieve radiologic tumor kill.

        -  To assess improvement in progression-free survival.

        -  To assess changes in monthly AFP levels in patients with AFP-producing tumors.

        -  To measure VEGF levels.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14. Beginning ≥ 3
      days later, patients undergo hepatic arterial chemoembolization (HACE)* with doxorubicin
      hydrochloride and mitomycin C. Beginning ≥ 3 days after the completion of HACE and/or once
      liver function returns to baseline, patients resume sorafenib tosylate twice daily for up to
      6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may undergo more than one HACE treatment.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for further laboratory analysis.
