      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of calcium dobesilate in combination
      with pulsed dye laser for the treatment of rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a common cutaneous disorder characterized by facial erythema, papules and pustules
      and telangiectasias. The clinical manifestations of this disorder are distributed along the
      convexities of the face such as the cheeks, chin, nose and central aspects of the forehead.

      The flushing and telangiectasias associated with erythematotelangietatic rosacea (ETR) are
      notoriously difficult to treat with standard medications. Patients with ETR have a lower
      threshold for irritation from topically applied drugs and these substances may even
      exacerbate their symptoms.

      Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is widely considered as the treatment of choice for vascular
      malformations including telangiectasias, port wine stains and hemangiomas. Several studies
      have shown successful treatment of rosacea-associated telangiectasia and erythema with pulsed
      dye laser. Moreover, calcium dobesilate (2,5-dihydroxybenzene sulfonate) is a drug that
      inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth and inhibits cellular proliferation. As a
      synthetic inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), calcium dobesilate targets angiogenic
      growth factors which lead to uncontrolled blood vessel growth. In light of the fact that
      angiogenesis has been implicated in erythematotelangietatic rosacea, calcium dobesilate will
      be useful in the treatment of this subtype of rosacea.

      Thus, combination treatment with PDL and calcium dobsilate will act in a synergistic manner
      to reduce the erythema, flushing and telangectasia associated with erythematotelangietatic
      rosacea.

      If the subject meets the inclusion criteria and informed consent is obtained, the subject
      will receive 2.5% calcium dobesilate get to apply to half of the face (randomized). The
      subject will also receive pulsed dye laser treatments to the whole face at two week intervals
      for a maximum of 3 treatments. The primary endpoint of this study will be the severity of
      rosacea at the end of the 20 week study.

    <description>All study patients will be treated with 595 nm PDL (Vbeam, Candela Corp, Wayland, Mass) with an initial test spot using a fluence of 10 J/cm2, 7-mm spot size and 1.5-ms pulse duration. Based on the biologic response of the test area, the fluence will accordingly be adjusted up or down to find a fluence that produces a transient purpuric effect for a few seconds only.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

          2. Must be male or female and aged ≥ 18 years at time of consent.

          3. Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          4. Must have clinically typical confirmed diagnosis of erythematotelangestatic rosacea.

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)‡ must have one negative urine pregnancy tests
             at screening. In addition, sexually active FCBP must agree to use TWO of the following
             adequate forms of contraception while on study medication: oral, injectable, or
             implantable hormonal contraceptives; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier
             contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner while on the study. A FCBP must
             agree to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while on study medication.

          6. Males (including those who have had a vasectomy) must agree to use barrier
             contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in sexual activity with FCBP while on
             study medication.

             (excessive facial hair, excessive scarring, sunburn, or other disfigurement) located
             on the face that would confound the evaluation of the rosacea.

          4. Current or past ocular rosacea, such as conjunctivitis, iritis and keratitis of
             sufficient severity to require topical or systemic antibiotics.

             topical rosacea treatments on the face within 14 days of baseline and throughout the
             study.

          7. Treatment with any systemic medication or therapy known to affect inflammatory
             responses within the 30 days prior to baseline and throughout the study.

          8. Treatment with systemic retinoids within 6 months prior to study entry (e.g.,
             acitretin, isotretinoin).

          9. Use of laser or light based rosacea treatments within the past 2 months.

         10. History of hypersensitivity or allergies to any ingredient in the study drug.
