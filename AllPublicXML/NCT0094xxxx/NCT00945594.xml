      The primary purpose of this study to assess patient pain scores comparing rigid to flexible
      cystoscopy in females; to assess post procedural complications, including frequency, urgency,
      infection and time to resolution of these symptoms between the two procedures; to assess
      physician perception of patient pain or discomfort with flexible or rigid cystoscopy.

      This will be a prospective randomized trial study in order to determine to compare rigid and
      flexible cystoscopy in female patients. Patients will be recruited from OU Physicians Pelvic
      and Bladder Health clinic. Patients receive an information leaflet describing the procedure
      prior to their appointment. All procedures are performed by the attending physician.
      Procedures performed by residents and/or fellows are excluded from this study. The vulva is
      cleaned with antiseptic solution and 10 ml of Xylocaine 2% is be instilled into the urethra
      before the endoscope was introduced. A 16 F flexible cysto urethroscope (Storz, Culver city,
      CA) is used for flexible cystoscopy. When rigid cystoscopy is performed, a 17F, 70° scope
      (Storz, Culver city, CA) is used to enable optimal visualization of the lateral bladder wall
      in those with previous continence surgeries. The investigator may choose to use a 30° scope
      when appropriate. Cystoscopy is commenced by recording a postvoid residual ensuring
      appropriate bladder emptying prior to filling. Filling is performed with continuous saline
      infusion until the maximum tolerated capacity or 300 ml. (whichever was reached first). A
      standard systematic approach was adopted to ensure global assessment of the vesical surface.
      This included the bladder dome, the bladder neck, bladder trigone, sidewalls and ureteral
      orifices. The urethroscopy portion of the procedure is performed last. When performing rigid
      cystoscopy, a 0° degree lens is used for this portion of the procedure.
