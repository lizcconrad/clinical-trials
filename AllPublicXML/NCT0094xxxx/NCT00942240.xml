          -  clinical laboratory evaluations (including serum for Chem-20 [fasted at least 10
             hours], CBC with differential and platelet counts, PT, INR, and aPTT, and UA) within
             the reference range for the test laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant
             by the Investigator;

          -  Males (or female partners of male subjects)and females must be sterile, or agree to

        Exclusion Criteria:
