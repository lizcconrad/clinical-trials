      RATIONALE: Conformal radiation therapy uses a 3-dimensional (3-D) image of the tumor to help
      focus thin beams of radiation directly on the tumor. Giving conformal external-beam radiation
      therapy in higher doses over a shorter period of time may kill more tumor cells and have
      fewer side effects. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy,
      such as leuprolide acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. It is not
      yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective when given together with or without
      hormone therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer who have undergone surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it
      works compared with radiation therapy given together with hormone therapy in treating
      patients who have undergone surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the potential benefit of post-operative radiotherapy with vs without a
           combined and adjuvant treatment consisting of short-term androgen suppression for
           improving the biochemical progression-free survival of patients who have undergone
           radical prostatectomy for stage I-III prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,
      pathological stage (pT2R1 vs pT3R0 vs pT3R1), Gleason sum (≤ 3+4 vs ≥ 4+3), and WHO
      performance status (0 vs 1). Within 3 months after radical surgery, patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo post-operative conformal external beam irradiation for 6.5
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Beginning between days -5 to -3, patients receive an antiandrogen for 2-4 weeks.
           Beginning on day 0, patients receive leuprolide acetate subcutaneously once (6-month
           depot) and undergo conformal external beam irradiation 5 times weekly for 6.5 weeks.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessments periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then yearly thereafter.
