    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm to automatically detect falls and near
      falls, in the elderly and in Parkinson's Disease patients. Subjects will arrive at the
      investigators' gait laboratory for assessment. A sub-group of the subjects, will receive a
      monitoring device, to be worn at home for three days.

      The aim of this study is to develop a detailed algorithm which will automatically detect
      falls and near falls, in the elderly as a general population prone to falls. The algorithm
      will be used as well in patients with Parkinson's Disease representing neurodegenerative
      diseases. All participants will arrive at the investigators' gait laboratory for an inhanced
      assessment, including neurological examination, various questionnaires. A sub-group of the
      subjects, will receive a monitoring device, to be worn at home for three days.
