  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication in patients of
      cirrhosis with ascites and may occur despite antibiotic prophylaxis. Small bowel dysmotility
      and bacterial overgrowth have been documented to be related to SBP. Aims: To investigate
      whether addition of prebiotic plus probiotics (synbiotics) to norfloxacin enhances the
      efficacy of norfloxacin in prevention of SBP in high risk patients with ascites.

      Methods: A prospective, double blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in
      consecutive high-risk cirrhotic patients with ascites who had either recovered from an
      episode of SBP (secondary prophylaxis) or who never had SBP but were at high risk for
      development of SBP (low ascitic fluid protein or serum bilirubin â‰¥2.5 mg/dL; primary
      prophylaxis). Norfloxacin 400 mg once daily with synbiotic capsules (Streptococcus faecalis
      JPC 30 million, Clostridium butyricum 2 million, Bacillus mesentericus JPC 1 million,
      Lactobacillus sporogenes 50 million spores) 2 t.i.d. (group I) or norfloxacin 400 mg once
      daily with placebo (group II) was given and occurrence of SBP within a period of 6 months
      (primary endpoint) or side-effects of therapy and mortality (secondary endpoints) were
      recorded. Every patient received IV albumin to maintain a serum albumin level of &gt;3.2 g/dl.
      SBP was treated with intravenous antibiotics with albumin.
