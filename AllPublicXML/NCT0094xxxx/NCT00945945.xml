    <measure>Change From Baseline to 13 Week Endpoint (Baseline Observation Carried Forward [BOCF]) in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) &quot;24-Hour Average Pain&quot; Item (Question 3) of the BPI-Modified Short Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported measure of the severity of pain based on the average pain over 24-hours. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). BOCF endpoint was defined as the baseline value for participants discontinued during acute phase, and defined as the last non-missing observation in the treatment phase for all other randomized participants. Due to the nature of a study drug labeling error which led to a treatment crossover (see Arms), data from protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised. The results from each mixed-treatment group are presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint (13 Week) in Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A scale that measures the patient's perception of improvement at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. The score ranges from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). Due to the nature of a study drug labeling error and the resultant treatment crossover (see Arms), the data from both protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised, and the intended comparisons for differences between those treatment groups are considered unevaluable. Secondary efficacy results from the 2 mixed-treatment groups are not presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change of Total Score From Baseline to Endpoint (13 Week) of Brief Pain Inventory-Severity (BPI-S) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported scale measuring pain severity. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). Four questions assess worst pain, least pain, and average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. Total score ranges from 0-40. Due to the nature of a study drug labeling error and resultant treatment crossover, data from both protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised, and the intended comparisons for differences between those treatment groups are considered unevaluable. Secondary efficacy results from the 2 mixed-treatment groups are not presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change of Total Score From Baseline to Endpoint (13 Week) in Brief Pain Inventory- Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on 7 questions assessing interference of pain for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Total score ranges from 0-70. Due to the nature of study drug labeling error and resultant treatment crossover, data from both protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised, and intended comparisons for differences between those treatment groups are considered unevaluable. Secondary efficacy results from the 2 mixed-treatment groups are not presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change of Total Score From Baseline to Endpoint(13 Week) in Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain: Knee Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-item questionnaire to individually and jointly assess intermittent and constant pain. Questions assess intensity and impact of pain on activity and emotion. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; higher values indicate higher severity. Total Pain score ranges from 0-44. Due to the nature of study drug labeling error and resultant treatment crossover, data from both protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised, and intended comparisons for differences between those treatment groups are considered unevaluable. Secondary efficacy results from the 2 mixed-treatment groups are not presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change of Total Score From Baseline to Endpoint (13 Week) in European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and mood. Score between 1-3 is generated for each domain which is mapped to single index score. Index ranges between 0-1; higher scores indicate better health perceived by patient. Due to nature of study drug labeling error and resultant treatment crossover, data from both protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised, and intended comparisons for differences between those treatment groups are considered unevaluable. Secondary efficacy results from the 2 mixed-treatment groups are not presented.</description>

    <description>Per the protocol, patients randomized to the duloxetine group were to receive duloxetine for the entire 13-week acute treatment period. Patients were to start at a 30 mg daily (QD) dose of duloxetine for 1 week, then increase to 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the following 12 weeks. However, due to a study drug labeling error, patients randomized to this group received 30 mg of duloxetine for the initial 1-week, but received placebo instead of receiving 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the next 12 weeks. The resulting unintended, mixed treatment group was labeled as DLX30-PLA throughout this document. Per protocol, the last week of the study (week 14) was intended to be a 1-week taper period. Patients in this treatment group were to receive 30 mg QD of duloxetine during that week, and that did occur per protocol.</description>

    <description>Per the protocol, patients randomized to the placebo group were to receive placebo for the entire 13-week acute treatment period. Patients were to start on placebo for the first week, then continue on placebo for the following 12 weeks. However, due to a study drug labeling error, patients in this group received placebo for the initial 1-week, but received 60 mg QD of duloxetine instead of receiving placebo for the next 12 weeks. The resulting unintended, mixed treatment group was labeled as PLA-DLX60 throughout this document. Per protocol, the last week of the study (week 14) was intended to be a 1-week taper period.

      <pre_assignment_details>Due to a study drug labeling error which led to a treatment crossover, the intended comparisons for group-level differences between duloxetine and placebo cannot be made. The results from comparisons of mixed-treatment groups are presented for primary efficacy and safety outcomes.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>DLX30-PLA</title>
          <description>Per the protocol, patients randomized to the duloxetine group were to receive duloxetine for the entire 13-week acute treatment period. Patients were to start at a 30 mg daily (QD) dose of duloxetine for 1 week, then increase to 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the following 12 weeks. However, due to a study drug labeling error, patients randomized to this group received 30 mg of duloxetine for the initial 1-week, but received placebo instead of receiving 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the next 12 weeks. The resulting unintended, mixed treatment group was labeled as DLX30-PLA throughout this document. Per protocol, the last week of the study (week 14) was intended to be a 1-week taper period. Patients in this treatment group were to receive 30 mg QD of duloxetine during that week, and that did occur per protocol.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 13 Week Endpoint (Baseline Observation Carried Forward [BOCF]) in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) &quot;24-Hour Average Pain&quot; Item (Question 3) of the BPI-Modified Short Form Score</title>
        <description>A self-reported measure of the severity of pain based on the average pain over 24-hours. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). BOCF endpoint was defined as the baseline value for participants discontinued during acute phase, and defined as the last non-missing observation in the treatment phase for all other randomized participants. Due to the nature of a study drug labeling error which led to a treatment crossover (see Arms), data from protocol-defined treatment groups were compromised. The results from each mixed-treatment group are presented.</description>

            <description>Per the protocol, patients randomized to the duloxetine group were to receive duloxetine for the entire 13-week acute treatment period. Patients were to start at a 30 mg daily (QD) dose of duloxetine for 1 week, then increase to 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the following 12 weeks. However, due to a study drug labeling error, patients randomized to this group received 30 mg of duloxetine for the initial 1-week, but received placebo instead of receiving 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the next 12 weeks. The resulting unintended, mixed treatment group was labeled as DLX30-PLA throughout this document. Per protocol, the last week of the study (week 14) was intended to be a 1-week taper period. Patients in this treatment group were to receive 30 mg QD of duloxetine during that week, and that did occur per protocol.</description>

Patients were to start at a 30 mg daily (QD) dose of duloxetine for 1 week, then increase to 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the following 12 weeks. However, due to a study drug labeling error, patients randomized to this group received 30 mg of duloxetine for the initial 1-week, but received placebo instead of receiving 60 mg QD of duloxetine for the next 12 weeks. The resulting unintended, mixed treatment group was labeled as DLX30-PLA throughout this document. Per protocol, the last week of the study (week 14) was intended to be a 1-week taper period. Patients in this treatment group were to receive 30 mg QD of duloxetine during that week, and that did occur per protocol.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to a package labeling error, study drug was incorrectly administered to all patients in both treatment groups. This compromised the integrity of the entire study and rendered planned comparisons between duloxetine and placebo invalid.</limitations_and_caveats>
