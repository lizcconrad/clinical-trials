  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will evaluate the efficacy of a telephone-delivered self-management
      (T-SM) intervention for reducing the impact of secondary conditions in persons with multiple
      sclerosis (MS), including chronic pain, fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment. It is
      hypothesized that if the effects of these conditions are reduced, study participants will
      demonstrate improved participation in the community and improved employment outcomes. This
      project is important because the majority of persons with MS experience one or more of the
      following secondary conditions: fatigue, pain, depression, and cognitive impairment. These
      secondary conditions are not always readily apparent and constitute what has been described
      by our Rehabilitation Research and Training Center as &quot;hidden disabilities.&quot; Secondary
      conditions such as pain, depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment frequently not only
      cause distress in their own right but also affect employment, participation, and quality of
      life. Having more than one often compounds the effect; the effect of all may be greater than
      the sum of each individually (e.g. depression can worsen fatigue, and cognitive impairment
      can worsen depression).

      It is critical that this constellation of secondary symptoms be addressed using state of the
      art techniques based on self-management training and that intervention effects be documented
      with carefully controlled treatment efficacy studies.
