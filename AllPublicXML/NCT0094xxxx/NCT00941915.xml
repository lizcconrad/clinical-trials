  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of urinary and gastrointestinal acute
      and late side effects in patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the
      prostate. Stereotactic radiation therapy is given as five treatments over a 2-3 week period.
      The prostate is localized and the plan is reoptimized as needed prior to each treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol requires radiation treatments to be performed with a stereotactic technique
      with the use of a 3-D coordinate system defined by implanted transponders (i.e. Calypso) or
      use of the ExacTrac system and/or use cone-beam CT (CBCT) with fiducial markers.
