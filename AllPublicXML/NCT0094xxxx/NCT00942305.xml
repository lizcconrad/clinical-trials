      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of
      CMX001 administered once weekly for up to 11 weeks. Dosing will be initiated immediately
      following engraftment (between Days 14-30 post-transplant) to prevent/control CMV infection
      or prevent disease in R+ allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years. Males must be able and willing to use adequate contraceptive methods
             throughout the treatment and follow-up phases of the study. Females must be
             postmenopausal,surgically sterile or, for those female subjects of reproductive
             potential, willing to agree to use 2 acceptable methods of birth control throughout
             the treatment phase of the study, with at least one being a barrier method.

          2. Allogeneic HSCT recipients who were CMV seropositive before transplantation (i.e., R+
             patients).

          3. Recipients who are less than 30 days post qualifying transplant. [Note: Under extreme
             circumstances due to timing issues associated with logistics, patients may be
             enrolled, i.e.receive first dose of study drug, up to Day 32 post-transplant. Sites
             must first contact the Chimerix Medical Monitor to receive permission for FDD to be
             Days 31 or 32 post-transplant.]

          4. Recipients must have evidence of engraftment before randomization and receiving their
             first dose of study drug. Evidence of engraftment will be defined as one of the
             following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) increasing for 3 consecutive days with a count ≥
                  500 cells/mm3 by the third day OR

               -  Three (3) consecutive days with an ANC ≥ 500 cells/mm3. [Notes: For sites where
                  standard site practice is to monitor white blood count (WBC) early after
                  transplant as opposed to ANC, then engraftment will be defined as WBC increasing
                  for 3 consecutive days with an ANC ≥ 500 cell/mm3 on the third day. For
                  non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity transplants (i.e., mini-transplants) where
                  ANC does not fall below 500 cells/mm3, the site definition of engraftment should
                  be used.] Able to ingest and absorb oral medication (in the judgment of the
                  investigator and based on lack of significant GI events). [Note: Use of TPN
                  (total parenteral nutrition) is not in and of itself exclusionary as long as the
                  reason for use would not disqualify the patient based on this criterion.]

        6. Willing and able to understand and provide written informed consent. 7. To the best of
        his or her knowledge, willing and able to participate in all required study activities for
        the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant or currently nursing.

          2. Patients with a BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2.

          3. Patients with hypersensitivity to cidofovir or CMX001.

          4. Recipients for whom the current, predose clinical course of CMV infection suggests
             that the investigator would not be able to withhold treatment for CMV for a minimum of
             5, but preferably 7 days following the subject's first dose of study drug. [Note:
             Patients who, with a high probability, will not be able to have their first efficacy
             assessment because of CMV infection should not be enrolled into the study. That is,
             investigators should not enroll recipients with increasing CMV viral loads predose
             such that, in the PI's opinion, continuation along the same clinical course would
             result in discontinuation (due to requirement for CMV treatment with a prohibited
             medication) within the first week.]

          5. Recipients who received any of the following:

             • GCV, vGCV, foscarnet or CDV within 14 days prior to enrollment;

             • any anti-CMV therapy following transplantation (including Cytogam®1),

               -  any CMV vaccine,

               -  any investigational drug with antiviral activity against dsDNA viruses within 14
                  days prior to enrollment, [Note: An investigational drug is defined as a drug
                  that is not approved for any indication by the FDA.]

               -  any other investigational drug (i.e., those without any &quot;anti-dsDNA virus&quot;
                  activity; for example, anti-influenza compounds) within 14 days prior to
                  enrollment without the prior written consent of the medical monitor.

        Patients receiving high dose ACV (&gt; 2000 mg total oral daily dose or &gt; 5 mg/kg IV three
        times daily) or vACV (Valtrex; &gt; 3000 mg total daily dose) at the time of dosing. [Note:
        These doses are for patients with normal renal function; patients who dose reduce on the
        FDD are not excluded from the study.] 7. Patients with active CMV disease diagnosed within
        6 months prior to enrollment; patients with CMV DNAemia requiring intervention with
        antiviral therapy at the time of enrollment.

        8. Patients who are HIV positive; patients with active HCV or HBV infection as evidenced by
        plasma levels of HCV RNA or HBV DNA, respectively. [Note: Tests for viral
        serology/infection performed prior to transplant and within 6 months of dosing may be used
        to satisfy this criteria.] 9. HSCT recipients who, other than the qualifying HSCT, received
        another allogeneic HSCT within the past 2 years. [Note: Patients who received one or more
        autologous transplants in addition to the qualifying allogeneic HSCT are not excluded from
        participation.] 10. Patients with renal insufficiency as evidenced by GFR &lt; 30 mL/min.
        [Note: GFR will be calculated by the central laboratory using the MDRD study formula.] 11.
        Patients with a current diagnosis of hypotony, uveitis, or retinitis or any intraocular
        pathology that would predispose the patient to any one of these conditions.

        12. Patients with hepatic dysfunction as evidenced by ALT or AST &gt; 5 x ULN or direct
        bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN. [Note: for these laboratory values, one retest is allowed per visit
        (i.e.,screening or predose) at the central laboratory, local laboratory retest results may
        be used at the discretion of the medical monitor.] 13. Patients with the following active
        autoimmune disorders; myasthenia gravis, Addison's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis,
        primary biliary cirrhosis, bullous pemphigoid, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune
        hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, Goodpasture's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
        lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or vasculitis.

        14. Patients with active solid tumor malignancies with the exception of basal cell
        carcinoma or the condition under treatment (for example, lymphomas).

        15. Patients who have had one or more episodes of hyperglycemic coma or diabetic
        ketoacidosis within the past 6 months.

        16. Patients with cardiovascular disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, would
        interfere with the conduct of the study.

        17. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 GVHD of the GI tract; patients with any GI disease that
        would, in the judgment of the investigator, preclude the patient from taking or absorbing
        oral medication (e.g. clinically active Crohn's disease, ischemic colitis, moderate or
        severe ulcerative colitis, or any condition expected to require abdominal surgery during
        the course of study participation).

        18. Any other condition including abnormal laboratory values that would in the judgment of
        the investigator put the subject at increased risk for participating in the trial, or
        interferes with the conduct of the trial.
