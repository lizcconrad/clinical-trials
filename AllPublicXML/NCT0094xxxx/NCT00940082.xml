      Objectives: To investigate the cardiac condition of the diabetic patients in our hospital in
      order to seek for the new diagnostic method of warning its cardiovascular complications in
      early times.

      Methods: 317 diabetic patients in our hospital from January in 2004 to July in 2008 were
      divided into 2 groups: group A (106 patients whose age ranged from (31-59) and group B (211
      patients whose age ranged from (60-90). The height, weight, blood glucose, glycosylated
      hemoglobin, lipid, blood pressure, course of disease, ejection fraction (EF), fractional
      shortening(FS), diameter of left ventricle in late diastolic stage(LVEDd), the thickness of
      the ventricular septa（IVSDand the posterior wall of the right ventricle in late diastolic
      stage (LVPWd)were recorded respectively. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall
      thickness (RWT) were calculated and High-sensitive C-reactive protein (HsCRP), homocysteine
      and TNF-α were detected. Multifactor logistic regression was made based on the comparison and
      contrast between all indexes to analyze the correlations between age and the positive
      indexes.

      Diabetes is one of the commonly seen health hazards in modern times. According to statistics,
      70% people with diabetes have died of cardiovascular diseases.

      Framingham `s study has proven the increase of the congestive heart-failure (2.4:1 in male
      patients and5:1 in female patients), which has no association with the age, hypertension,
      obesity, cardiovascular disease and Hyperlipidemia[1]. Other prospective studies also showed
      that the patients with diabetes in the early stage may be subject to abnormal echocardiogram
      and their probabilities of suffering from heart failure in the lifetime and Q-wave and non-Q
      wave myocardial infarction will be increased[1,2]. Early in 2000, American Heart Association
      issued a statement that &quot;diabetes is a cardiovascular disease&quot; [3]and in 2007, with reference
      to the joint guidelines concerning diabetes, pre-diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Diabetes Research Institute (ESAD)
      clearly pointed out that hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely related
      and the danger of CVD can be raised notably for those whose blood glucose is normal when
      fasting but tend to increase postprandially[4]. In the pathogenesis study of cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes, the promotion of oxidative stress and declination of the heart
      antioxidant reserves have close associations with the cardiovascular complications in animal
      and human body[5]. A number of cytokines and inflammatory signaling pathways are involved
      including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP),
      adiponectin, IL-6, NF-κB[1,6]. Accordingly, this study analyzes the echocardiography,
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α of the patients with
      diabetics in our hospital in order to find early warning indicators of the cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes and provide prevention and treatment for cardiovascular
      complications of diabetes.
