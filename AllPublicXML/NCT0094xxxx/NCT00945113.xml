      The aim of the study is to answer the question: Is a large-scale research study of the
      effectiveness of group speech and language therapy (SALT) for young people who stammer
      possible?

      The study will look at the issues involved in setting up a large-scale investigation of
      treatment for young people who stammer. It will inform the investigators whether larger
      studies would be possible and give some early-stage information on the effectiveness of group
      SALT for these young people. The findings will pave the way for building and testing out
      treatment programmes where there will be clear positive benefit for young people who stammer
      and their families.

      To answer the research question, the study will tell the investigators (a) how easy/difficult
      it was to get people to take part, (b) young people and parents'/carers' views on taking part
      and (c) whether the assessments were able to pick up changes in speech and attitudes towards
      stammering reported by the young people and their carers.

      Sufficient numbers of participants were not recruited to carry out the intended rehearsal
      pilot RCT study design.
