      The aims of this study are (1) to study the benefit of branched-chain amino acids enriched
      nutrient-mixture by analyzing a variety of clinical parameter, including laboratory data, the
      duration of hospitalization after the surgery, and (2) To investigate the postoperative
      quality of life (QOL) in receiving peri-operatively branched-chain amino acids enriched
      nutrient-mixture in patients who undergone the hepatic management for hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) with chronic liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cirrhosis of the liver complicated with HCC are often in a state of protein
      energy malnutrition. A limited number of studies have indicated an important role for
      nutritional support in the surgical management of patients who have undergone hepatic
      resection for HCC. In a preliminary study, we reported the clinical efficacy of
      supplementation with branched-chain amino acids in a small number of patients with liver
      cirrhosis who underwent hepatic surgery for HCC. The aims of this study are (1) to study the
      benefit of branched-chain amino acids enriched nutrient-mixture by analyzing a variety of
      clinical parameter, including laboratory data, the duration of hospitalization after the
      surgery, and (2) To investigate the postoperative QOL in receiving peri-operatively
      branched-chain amino acids enriched nutrient-mixture in patients who undergone the hepatic
      management for HCC with chronic liver disease.

    <description>Aminoleban EN™ was administered at a dose of 100 g per day commencing two weeks prior to surgery. A 100 g dose of Aminoleban EN™ contains 13.0 g of free amino acids, 13.0 g of gelatin hydrolysate, 1.0 g of casein, 62.1 g of carbohydrate, 7.0 g of lipid, glycyrrhizin, and other components, producing 420 kcal. The AEN group included 40 patients who were administered 100 g of Aminoleban EN™ as 50 g during the day and 50 g as a late evening snack.</description>

    <description>The patients were divided into two groups including one group administered Aminoleban (the AEN group) and a control group given no additional dietary supplementation. The total caloric energy intake per day during the study period was assumed to be equal to Aminolaban EN group.</description>
