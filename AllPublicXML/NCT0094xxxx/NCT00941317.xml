  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on manufacturer testing, no major difference in drilling condition is expected in this
      study compared to the drilling conditions previously established. However clinical testing is
      needed to establish optimal drilling conditions to be used for further development in both
      unaffected and affected parts of the nail. The aim of this study is to determine the optimal
      drilling condition that could be used in future studies of this device in combination with
      topical treatment for onychomycosis.

      This drug-free, single-blind device study will evaluate the completeness of the holes and the
      tolerability (pain) of the drilling process by testing several trigger levels. Subjects with
      distolateral onychomycosis will have a series of holes drilled into the unaffected and
      affected areas of 1 or 2 big toenail(s). A pain level &lt; 4 using the subject self-assessment
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is considered as acceptable with regard to the study procedure.

      The study will use a two-cohort design in subjects with distolateral onychomycosis.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a male or female 18 years of age or older with clinical diagnosis of
             distolateral onychomycosis without matrix involvement in at least one big toe with a
             nail plate at least 2 cm wide. Note: This diagnosis will be based on clinical signs
             and microscopy; no laboratory culture is required.

          -  The total disease involvement will be at least 30% and no more than 70% of the total
             surface of the 1 or 2 big toenail(s) to be drilled in order to allow drilling of up to
             5 holes spaced at least 3 mm apart, 5 mm from the lunula, and 2 mm from the lateral
             edge in each affected and unaffected part of the nail(s).

          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the CIP and visit
             schedule. In particular, subjects must agree to remove and not reapply any nail polish
             or related products to the target toenails for the duration of the study

          -  The subject understands that this is a drug-free device study for which no therapeutic
             benefit is expected.

          -  The subject must agree not to file, clip, or otherwise disturb the target toenail
             between study visits

          -  The subject agrees to participate in the study and authorize photographs taken per
             study requirements, verified by dating and signing an approved written Informed
             Consent Form (ICF) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
             authorization before any study procedures

          -  The subject is a female of non-childbearing potential (defined as post-menopausal
             [absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year prior to enrollment], hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or if the subject is a female of childbearing potential and
             has a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at the baseline visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Affected toenail(s) distal edge of the toenail plate more than 4 mm thick. The
             distance from the affected distal edge of the toenail plate to the toenail bed will be
             measured by using a ruler or caliper.

          -  The subject has other clinically significant nail disease, including clinical signs of
             nail psoriasis, nail discoloration of nail trauma, or paronychia of the target
             toenail(s)

          -  Signs of infection (other than fungal) in one of the feet, including the contralateral
             foot

          -  The subject takes daily pain medication, including anti-inflammatory and
             corticosteroid medications at doses that relieve pain

          -  The subject takes anti-coagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin) at therapeutic doses.
             Prophylactic anti-coagulant therapy (for example inhibitors of platelet aggregation,
             low dose aspirin, or low molecular weight heparin) is permitted.

          -  The subject has proximal subungual onychomycosis or only superficial nail plate
             onychomycosis

          -  The subject has immunodeficiency, peripheral neuropathy, or peripheral vascular
             disease, or known types 1 or 2 diabetes.

          -  The subject has another underlying known disease, a surgical or medical condition
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with interpretation of the
             study results

          -  The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device study OR
             participated in such a study in the past 3 months prior to Visit 1 OR in an exclusion
             period from a previous study

          -  A female subject is pregnant or plans to conceive a child within 1 month
