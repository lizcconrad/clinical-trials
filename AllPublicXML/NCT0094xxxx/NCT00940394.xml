    <textblock>
      The mutual support group intervention would significantly improve the families' burden of
      care, functioning and social support, reduce the patients' severity of symptoms and
      re-hospitalizations, and reduce the demands for utilization of family services, when compared
      with the standard care group.

      Family interventions in schizophrenia have shown positive effects on patients but little
      attention has been paid to their effects on family members, particularly those in non-Western
      countries. This multi-site randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a
      bi-weekly, 12-session, family-led mutual support group for Chinese caregivers of
      schizophrenia sufferers over 36 months, compared with a family psychoeducation group program
      and standard psychiatric care. It was conducted with 114 families of outpatients with
      schizophrenia in Hong Kong of whom 38 were assigned randomly to a mutual support group, a
      psychoeducation group, or standard care. Families' psychosocial health status and patients'
      symptom severity and length of re-hospitalizations at recruitment, one-month, 18-month, and
      36-month post-intervention were compared between groups.
