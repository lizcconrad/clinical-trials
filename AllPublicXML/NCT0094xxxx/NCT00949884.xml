    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Trough, Cuff, Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (SDBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in trough SDBP at Week 8 as measured by the Omron monitor. Morning doses of study medication were taken after the exam on study visit days, therefore exam measurements were taken when medication levels were at its lowest ('the trough'). Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate blood pressure measurements were taken with a full 2-minute (not exceeding 5 minutes) interval between measurements, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The mean of the 3 seated blood pressure measurements constitute the blood pressure value for the visit.</description>

             informed consent.

          -  Mean cuff seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) must be &gt; 95 mmHg and &lt; 115 mmHg and a
             mean cuff seated systolic BP must be &lt; 180 mmHg when measured at two consecutive
             qualification study visits during the placebo run-in phase.

          -  The difference in mean cuff seated diastolic BP must be &lt; 7 mmHg between two
             consecutive qualification study visits during the placebo run-in phase.

        <description>The change from baseline in trough SDBP at Week 8 as measured by the Omron monitor. Morning doses of study medication were taken after the exam on study visit days, therefore exam measurements were taken when medication levels were at its lowest ('the trough'). Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate blood pressure measurements were taken with a full 2-minute (not exceeding 5 minutes) interval between measurements, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The mean of the 3 seated blood pressure measurements constitute the blood pressure value for the visit.</description>

        <description>The change from baseline in trough SDBP at Week 4 as measured by the Omron monitor. Morning doses of study medication were taken after the exam on study visit days, therefore exam measurements were taken when medication levels were at its lowest ('the trough'). Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate blood pressure measurements were taken with a full 2-minute (not exceeding 5 minutes) interval between measurements, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The mean of the 3 seated blood pressure measurements constitute the blood pressure value for the visit.</description>

          <title>Incremental Change From Week 4 to Week 8 in Trough, Cuff, Seated Systolic Blood Pressure (SSBP)</title>
          <description>The change from Week 4 in trough SSBP at Week 8 as measured by the Omron monitor. Morning doses of study medication were taken after the exam on study visit days, therefore exam measurements were taken when medication levels were at its lowest ('the trough'). Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate blood pressure measurements were taken with a full 2-minute (not exceeding 5 minutes) interval between measurements, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The mean of the 3 seated blood pressure measurements constitute the blood pressure value for the visit.</description>
          <population>The Efficacy Population included participants who received at least 1 dose of double-blind randomized study medication and had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline blood pressure measurement. Last observation carried forward</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Daytime (8am to 4pm) and Mean Nighttime (10pm to 6am) Ambulatory Blood Pressure at Week 8</title>
        <description>In week 8, participants arrived at the site in the morning without having taken that day's dose of medication. Once the ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) had been applied, medication was taken and the participant wore the ABPM for a period of 24-hours. Daytime (8am to 4pm) and nighttime (10pm to 6am) systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are summarized.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Blood Pressure During the Final 2, 4, and 6 Hours of the Dosing Interval at Week 4</title>
        <description>In week 4, participants arrived at the site in the morning without having taken that day's dose of medication. Once the ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) had been applied, medication was taken and the participant wore the ABPM for a period of 24-hours. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings taken in the final 2, 4, and 6 hours of the 24-hour ABPM cycle are summarized.</description>

        <population>The ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) population was defined as participants in the efficacy population that had valid baseline and Week 4 ABPM data. Valid (technically successful) ABPM had at least 23 hours of ABPM data.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Ambulatory Blood Pressure During the Final 2, 4, and 6 Hours of the Dosing Interval at Week 8</title>
        <description>In week 8, participants arrived at the site in the morning without having taken that day's dose of medication. Once the ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) had been applied, medication was taken and the participant wore the ABPM for a period of 24-hours. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings taken in the final 2, 4, and 6 hours of the 24-hour ABPM cycle are summarized.</description>

        <population>The ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) population was defined as participants in the efficacy population that had valid baseline and Week 8 ABPM data. Valid (technically successful) ABPM had at least 23 hours of ABPM data.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Trough, Cuff, Seated Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>The change from baseline in trough systolic and diastolic blood pressure at Week 2 as measured by the Omron monitor. Morning doses of study medication were taken after the exam, therefore exam measurements were taken when medication levels were at its lowest ('the trough'). Following a 5-minute rest period, three separate blood pressure measurements were taken with a full 2-minute (not exceeding 5 minutes) interval between measurements, with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The mean of the 3 seated blood pressure measurements constitute the blood pressure value for the visit.</description>

        <population>The efficacy population was defined as participants who received at least 1 dose of double-blind randomized study medication and had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline blood pressure measurement. Last observation carried forward.</population>
