  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on personal experience and the literature it is reasonable expectation that Vancomycin
      is a viable treatment in a direct contact form to eliminate MRSA from open wounds in order to
      heal the wounds by conventional means. The key question in my research has been to measure
      the effectiveness of my Vancomycin Gel by culturing the wound, applying the Gel in a
      controlled manner and then culturing the wound after one week. The end point to achieve in
      the process, is a clinical response of accelerated healing and negative culture report.
      Another question to solve is the duration of potency and stability of the Vancomycin gel over
      time.

      Over a prior preliminary 33 month study I have found negative cultures at the end of one week
      of treatment and have had microbiological studies establishing the same MIC zones in culture
      media greater than 15mm over a 33 month time frame. The microbiological and HPLC studies are
      completed at present and approved. I have started the phase 2 studies on August 1,2011 as
      authorized by the FDA on June 22,2011.

    <description>Treatment of open wounds with Vancogel(R) 1.25-1.50% to eliminate MRSA. End point is: a negative culture report after 1-3 topical applications. The infected wounds with MRSA will be treated with the Vancomycin 1.25 to 1.50% complex gel formulation and will have conventional management in order to heal the wound. Vancogel is anticipated to accelerate wound healing by eliminating MRSA. A randomized, double blind study protocol approved by FDA.</description>
