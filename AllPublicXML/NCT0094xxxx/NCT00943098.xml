    <textblock>
      The present study is aimed at demonstrating the therapeutic equivalence of diclofenac HPBCD
      75mg/1ml s.c. with the marketed reference product, Voltarol® 75mg/3ml i.m. in the treatment
      of acute moderate-to-severe pain after dental impaction surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing surgical extraction of a single fully or partially impacted
             mandibular 3rd molar requiring bone removal.

          -  Patients experiencing moderate to severe post-operative pain within 6 hours from end
             of surgery.

          -  Pre-operative laboratory tests in the reference ranges or without clinically
             significant abnormalities as judged by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgery performed under general anaesthesia, or sedation.

          -  Complications occurring during the surgical procedure or in the period before
             randomisation as judged by the investigator.

          -  Acute local or systemic infection at the time of surgery that could confound the
             post-surgical evaluation.

          -  Patients with clinical signs of gastritis, gastro-duodenal ulcer, GI bleeding. Other
             GI disturbances or disease that in the opinion of the investigator could be negatively
             affected by the administration of NSAIDs.

          -  Clinical signs or history of coagulation disorders that could be negatively affected
             by NSAIDs administration.

          -  Hepatic or renal impairment.

          -  Patients with significant cardiac impairment, history of cerebrovascular disease,
             history or peripheral arterial disease, uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Hypersensitivity to diclofenac or other NSAIDs or to one of the study medication
             components.

          -  Patients under chronic treatment with topical or systemic analgesics/NSAIDs.

          -  Patients under treatment with any medication that may affect the treatment efficacy
             evaluation.

          -  Patients under treatment with any medication whose concomitant use may be susceptible
             to interactions with diclofenac or may affect safety.
