      The purpose is to evaluate the effects of adding a wheel assisted running training (WART) to
      a conventional mixed physical activity training (CT) program on walking and gross motor
      function in trained children with cerebral palsy (CP).

      Method entails recruiting thirty children with CP (16 females, 14 males), with mean (SD) age
      11.8 (3.5) and training experience 3.4 (3.5), years were assigned to either WART or CT
      groups. The energy Expenditure Index (EEI), the Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM),
      self-selected and fast walking velocity (SSV and FV, respectively), and cadence are
      administered by a trained physical therapist. The intervention period is six months, with two
      sessions per week.

    <description>'Race-Runner' uses the principle of body weight reduction and wheel assisted running training. This is a three-wheel device specifically designed in the 1990s for athletic purposes. The participant is walking or running with the feet on the ground while using a triangular frame equipped with three large bicycle wheels. Support to the participant's body is provided by a regular cycle saddle, a frontal body support plate, and the steering handlebars. The vertical and horizontal distance of the saddle and frontal support from the steering handlebars are adaptable to the participant's body dimension and comfort. This equipment is commonly used in competition in Scandinavia and Central Europe</description>
