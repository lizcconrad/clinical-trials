  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to evaluate an effort to provide a comprehensive package of
      HIV prevention services of which post-exposure prophylaxis (medicines that may help prevent
      HIV infection after an exposure) can be a part. It will also include risk reduction
      information and testing for other sexually transmitted infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Los Angeles County P-QUAD program is a combined effort of County, City, public health,
      community, academic, and private agencies and individuals in an effort to provide a
      comprehensive package of HIV prevention services of which PEP can be an integral component.
      These services are designed to be easily accessible, non-judgmental, culturally, ethnically,
      and linguistically appropriate to the relevant populations, community-based, and independent
      of ability to pay or insurance/documentation status. They will also provide vital linkages to
      associated services, routine HIV testing, and primary health care.

      In its initial pilot project, 2 community-based sites will serve as facilities at which
      patients may present for screening for post-exposure prophylaxis services, as well as
      sexually transmitted diseases. At the sites, initial eligibility and testing will be
      performed, and an initial 14-day supply of PEP medications will be provided if appropriate,
      and referrals will be initiated. All subjects who are provided an initial 14-day supply will
      be required to return to the site for the remainder of the 28-day course of medication,
      follow-up testing, adherence counseling, risk-reduction programming, and other appropriate
      referrals. Follow-up with patients by phone, email, and mobile-phone text message will be
      used as appropriate to maximize program retention.

    <intervention_name>tenofovir + emtricitabine, lopinavir/ritonavir</intervention_name>
    <description>The preferred regimen will be tenofovir + emtricitabine, provided as a fixed-dose combination tablet as Truvada®. Dosing is 1 tablet by mouth once daily. For participants with a creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min, dosing of Truvada is 1 tablet by mouth every other day. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min or on hemodialysis, Truvada should not be used. For intolerance to Truvada, Combivir (zidovudine 300mg/lamivudine 150mg)will be available to be taken as 1 PO BID. For highest-risk category exposures (receptive anal intercourse with a known or suspected HIV-positive source patient or in cases of suspected source drug resistance, see Schema, below) one of the following should be added to the above &quot;standard&quot; treatment, creating an &quot;expanded&quot; regimen:
Preferred: Lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/50mg), 2 tablets orally twice daily or 4 tablets once daily</description>

            <description>An intake of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed by program personnel. HIV-testing and STI testing will be provided as well as a brief and directed history and physical examination. If all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are met, an initial dose of PEP medications will be provided for immediate ingestion. A 14-day supply of PEP medications will be provided. Participant information sheets regarding PEP will be provided. Initial safety laboratory measurements and assessment of necessary referral services will be made, and behavioral risk assessment will stratify participants into “moderate behavioral risk,” or “high behavioral risk.” Moderate risk participants will receive risk-reduction programming within the P-QUAD program; high-risk participants will be referred externally to existing LA County behavioral risk-reduction programming.</description>

      <desc>Some individuals reenrolled in the study if an HIV exposure occurred at a later date. 254 individuals were exposed to HIV once and received PEP; 11 individuals were exposed to HIV twice and received a PEP regimen twice; and 2 were exposed to HIV three times and received a PEP regimen for each of the three exposures. A total of 282 PEP regimens were initiated on 267 unique individuals. 282 was used as the denominator for report Adverse Events.</desc>
