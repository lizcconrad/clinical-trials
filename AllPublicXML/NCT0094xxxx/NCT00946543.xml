      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best dose of intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test the feasibility of delivering hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy
           to the prostate and pelvic nodes of patients with prostate cancer.

        -  To determine the optimal dose level of this treatment regimen to be used in future
           studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to small bowel total volume (low small bowel
      volume &lt; 450 cc vs high small bowel volume ≥ 450 cc).

      Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvis
      for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually thereafter.
