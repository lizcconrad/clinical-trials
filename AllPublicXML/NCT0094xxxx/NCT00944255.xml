      BACKGROUND. Polymorphisms occur in several genes encoding key enzymes in the folate pathway
      may affect drug metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Whether these genetic
      variations contribute to differential responses to antifolate drug in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains to be investigated in the Taiwanese population.

      OBJECTIVE. The goal of the present study is to investigate the interactions between genetic
      variations in folate genes and the efficacy/side effects of anti-folate disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drug in Taiwan.

      DESIGN. A cross-sectional study involving patients with RA were enrolled from TCVGH. Disease
      activity, drug efficacy and associated side-effects were assessed.

      Genotypes in folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase and reduced folate carrier were determined
      by RFLP or pyrosequencing.
