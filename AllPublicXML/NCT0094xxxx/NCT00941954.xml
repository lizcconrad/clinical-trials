  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a debilitating chronic disease reaching epidemic proportions. Lack of physical
      activity is a key factor driving this epidemic and it is therefore vital that workable
      methods of encouraging people to exercise and reducing inactivity are developed and tested if
      we are to stem the rising tide of diabetes.

      This cluster randomised controlled trial will investigate whether a person−centred group
      educational programme can increase walking activity and reduce the risk of developing
      diabetes in high−risk individuals identified in primary care settings. In total 804 patients
      will be recruited to the study. Physical activity levels, glucose control, incidence of type
      2 diabetes and anthropometric measurements (e.g. weight) will be tested on an annual basis
      over three years.

      This trial will be the first to test the feasibility, efficacy and value for money of a
      physical activity intervention aimed at reducing the risk of diabetes in a community setting
      in a multi−ethnic population in the UK.

      Primary research hypothesis: A pragmatic structured education programme aimed at promoting
      walking activity initiates long−term increases in physical activity in individuals identified
      through a risk score as having an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

    <description>The intervention group will be offered a group−based structured educational programme aimed at promoting increased ambulatory activity by targeting perceptions and knowledge of diabetes risk, physical activity self−efficacy, barriers to physical activity and self−regulatory skills based on pedometer use. The programme will employ a person−centred approach to patient education that is based on self−management programmes for individuals with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes that have been developed and tested by our research group. The programme will be designed to be delivered to 5−10 participants by two trained educators and is 3.5 hours long. Brief follow−up counselling will be offered once every 6 months.</description>
