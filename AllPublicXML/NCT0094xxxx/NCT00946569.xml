  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of once daily oral
      administration of JNJ-39758979 in the treatment of adults (18 to 65 years of age) with
      persistent asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participants knows the treatment
      that the participant receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time), exploratory study (JNJ-39758979 is introduced in
      participants with asthma for the first time). This study consists of 4 phases: screening
      phase (4 weeks prior to the start of the run-in period), placebo run-in phase (2 weeks prior
      to the start of treatment phase), double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks), and posttreatment
      phase (5 weeks). Approximately 100 participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2
      treatment groups: Treatment A (participants will receive JNJ-39758979 once daily) and
      treatment B (participants will receive placebo once daily). Safety will be evaluated by
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination,
      and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Total study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 23 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 will be measured by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Lung volumes will be measured according to the body temperature, pressure, and saturated standard convention using the spirometer. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol.</description>

    <description>FVC will be measured by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. FVC is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration and is measured in liters. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, week 4, Week 8, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEF will be measured by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. FEF is the speed (or flow) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. It is generally defined by what fraction remains of the forced vital capacity (FVC), usually 25-75 percent (FEF25-75%). Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 12 in Asthma Daily Diary (ADD) data</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ADD is an electronic peak flow/diary device to score asthma symptoms twice daily (12 hours interval). Upon awakening, participants are asked to record 3 peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), number of puffs of albuterol/salbutamol in the past 24 hours and indicate whether they had night time awakenings requiring albuterol/salbutamol. In the evening, participants are asked to record 3 PEFRs and rate asthma symptoms using a 6-point scale (0 = No symptoms and 5 = symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
