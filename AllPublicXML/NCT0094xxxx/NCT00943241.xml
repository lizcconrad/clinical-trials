      To expand the understanding of the uptake and distribution of Tc-99m sestamibi in the breast
      in a normal female population undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging using Molecular Breast
      Imaging (MBI).

      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been scheduled to
      have a scan of your heart. The radioactive dye used to image your heart is also taken up by
      many types of breast cancer. The investigators have developed a new method for detecting
      breast cancer, called Molecular Breast Imaging that uses this dye.

      The purpose of this study is to see how well this new method works in normal subjects with no
      known breast cancer and to see if we can detect breast cancer at an earlier stage than
      mammography. As you read this form describing the study, ask any questions you have. Take
      your time to decide. Feel free to discuss the study with your family, friends, and healthcare
      provider before you decide. You may stop participating at any time during the study. You may
      decide not to participate. If so, none of your current benefits or normal health care will be
      affected in any way. When you feel comfortable that all your questions have been answered,
      and you wish to take part in this study, sign this form in order to begin your participation.
      Your signature means you have been told about the study and what the risks are. Your
      signature on this form also means that you want to take part in this study.
