    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of a compound called PF-05212384 (also known as PKI-587). The
      purpose of part 1 is to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PF-05212384 using a
      Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). Part 1 will include subjects with any solid tumor. In
      Part 2 two cohorts will be enrolled. One cohort will assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy in 20 subjects at the MTD and will include subjects with breast cancer,
      ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer renal cancer or glioblastoma (a type of
      brain tumor). The other cohort will include 5 to 15 subjects with any type of tumor who
      consent to provide tumor biopsies while participating in the study.
