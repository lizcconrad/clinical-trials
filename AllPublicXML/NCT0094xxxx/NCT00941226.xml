      INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is characterized by a sensory-motor deficiency, involving
      disturbance of muscle tone, posture and voluntary movement. Children who are afflicted need
      special intense care for their carers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze
      the quality of life of CP child carers attended in the physiotherapy sector of a
      philanthropic institution on Maceió - AL. METHODS: 62 carers were assessed in the period from
      the 18th to the 29th of February 2008, in which 96.7% were female carers and 3.7% male. The
      form for the collection of data from the carers, elaborated by the researchers and the
      WHOQOL-26 quality of life questionnaire were utilized as as instruments.
