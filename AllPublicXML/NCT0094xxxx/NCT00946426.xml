  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 children (12 African-American, Hispanic, or American Indian, 12 Caucasian) previously
      diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus will participate in this pilot study to evaluate the
      presence of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. The investigators will use this pilot
      information to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance occurs in some children with type
      1 DM, is secondary to underlying risk factors, and is responsible for increased insulin
      needs. Methods will include a &quot;step-up&quot; hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and infusion of the
      stable isotope 6,6-[2H2]-glucose. Patient and parent interviews will be conducted to gather
      information about nutritional intake, ethnicity, family history, and socioeconomic status.
      The investigators will also measure inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids to determine
      whether they are associated with differences in insulin resistance among type 1 diabetes
      mellitus patients.
