      Prospective, randomized, non-inferiority, multicenter, international study.In total 4000
      patients (70 centers in Europe) with de novo lesions in native coronary arteries who meet the
      eligibility criteria randomized to 6 versus 12 month dual antiplatelet therapies following a
      second generation DES implantation.

      Assuming that the true proportion of thrombotic events is equal to 2.3% for both regimens
      (6-month and 12-month clopidogrel) 2000 patients for each treatment group are necessary to
      demonstrate a non-inferiority of the 6-months regimen if the proportion of thrombotic events
      will be no more than 3.5% with a power of 0.80 and a significance level of 0.05 (one-tail).

      If the non-inferiority hypothesis will be rejected, the superiority hypothesis (12-months
      regimen is superior to the 6-months-regimen) will be tested at a significance level of 0.05
      (two-tails).

      The maximal not clinically relevant difference for the non-inferiority hypothesis of 1.2 %
      more thrombotic events has to be considered together with the lower expected number of
      bleeding events in the 6-months regimen.

      All the analysis will be done as &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; analysis.
