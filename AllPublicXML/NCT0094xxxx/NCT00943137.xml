      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To determine the proportion of Asian patients achieving a target area under the curve
           (AUC) of 20-24 mg.h/L using a pharmacokinetically guided 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) dose

        2. To determine the safety and tolerability of dose adjusted 5-FU

        3. To correlate 5-FU pharmacokinetics with gene variants associated with the 5-FU pathway
           and with clinical outcomes

      Based on Western data, levels of 5-FU are highly variable when doses are based on BSA. A
      relationship between systemic plasma levels of 5-FU and treatment toxicity and efficacy
      exists. Whilst pharmacokinetically-guided dose management has been shown to improve 5-FU
      efficacy and tolerance, there is currently no data in Asian patients using this approach.
      Using pharmacokinetically guided 5-FU-dose adjustment, the investigators hypothesize the
      proportion of Asian patients achieving a target AUC of 20-24 mg.h/L is similar to that of
      Caucasians.

      METHODS:

      This is an open, non-randomised single center Phase II study evaluating dose adjusted 5-FU in
      patients receiving de Gramont, FOLFIRI or mFOLFOX-6 schedules.

             regimen is indicated.

          -  No more than one line of prior chemotherapy for advanced stage disease

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria or evaluable disease
