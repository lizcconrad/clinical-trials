    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the level of medication adherence observed
      among subjects receiving a specific combination of education and support materials (YourWay
      plan) along with a prescription for fesoterodine.

      This is a non-interventional, observational study. Study investigators will recruit
      symptomatic, fesoterodine-naïve subjects when they present with OAB symptoms during
      regularly-scheduled physician visits fesoterodine-naïve subjects with OAB symptoms present
      during regularly-scheduled physician visits

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Filled at Least 90 Days Supply of Fesoterodine (4mg QD or 8mg QD) Within 90 Days of Study Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment (Day 0) up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Prototypical pattern for meeting primary endpoint was to fill 3 separate prescriptions (Rx), each for a 30-day supply between enrollment and Day 90. Rx fills could happen as early as Day 0, 30, and 60 of the study period. Participants could also have chosen to wait until their 14-day medication sample was exhausted before receiving their first fill. Investigators received no prescribing restrictions, but were advised not to write Rx for a 90-day supply of fesoterodine at enrollment visit. Participants whose first observed Rx was for a ≥90-day supply were non-evaluable for the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>The prototypical pattern was to fill 3 separate prescriptions, each for a 30-day supply, between the enrollment date and Day 90 of the study period; these prescription fills could happen as early as Day 0, 30, and 60 of the study period. Primary adherence was met if the participant filled at least 1 fesoterodine prescription during the study period.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Filled at Least Two Fesoterodine Prescriptions (First Refill) During the Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment (Day 0) up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The prototypical pattern was to fill 3 separate prescriptions, each for a 30-day supply, between the enrollment date and Day 90 of the study period; these prescription fills could happen as early as Day 0, 30, and 60 of the study period. At enrollment, the Investigator provided participants with a prescription for fesoterodine 4mg or 8mg to be filled at a pharmacy of their choice. The first refill indicated that 2 fesoterodine prescriptions had been filled.</description>

    <description>YourWay plan was available and accessible to all participants prescribed fesoterodine, but was not defined as an explicit or required component. Plan included motivational support for taking fesoterodine and behavioral interventions shown in clinical studies to improve participants' Overactive Bladder (OAB) outcomes. Objectives included intervening quickly after treatment initiation, before participants had an opportunity to discontinue medication, reinforcing the treatable nature of OAB, and setting appropriate expectations for onset of action with therapy and degree of symptom improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Filled at Least 90 Days Supply of Fesoterodine (4mg QD or 8mg QD) Within 90 Days of Study Enrollment</title>
        <description>Prototypical pattern for meeting primary endpoint was to fill 3 separate prescriptions (Rx), each for a 30-day supply between enrollment and Day 90. Rx fills could happen as early as Day 0, 30, and 60 of the study period. Participants could also have chosen to wait until their 14-day medication sample was exhausted before receiving their first fill. Investigators received no prescribing restrictions, but were advised not to write Rx for a 90-day supply of fesoterodine at enrollment visit. Participants whose first observed Rx was for a ≥90-day supply were non-evaluable for the primary endpoint.</description>
