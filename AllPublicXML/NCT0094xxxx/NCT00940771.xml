      The hypothesis for this study is will a treatment regimen containing Atazanavir in
      combination with Ritonavir work as well as other regimens containing a protease inhibitor
      (PI, one of 5 classes of HIV Medications) and/or a Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase
      Inhibitor (NNRTI, another of the classes of HIV medications) at controlling HIV disease in
      children who are HIV+ and have high cholesterol or high triglycerides. . In this study,
      children who have high cholesterol or high triglycerides as a result of their HIV medicines,
      will have the PI or NNRTI in their medication regimen changed to Atazanavir, which is a PI in
      combination with a low dose of Ritonavir (another PI). Atazanavir has been shown in adults to
      result in lower cholesterol and triglycerides than other PI's and NNRTI's. The dose of
      atazanavir and ritonavir will be according to the Package Insert for this drug that is FDA
      approved for children. They will continue taking the other medications from the pre-study
      regimen. Children will take study drug for 24 weeks, and will be able to continue study drug
      after the study using commercially available drug. Lab tests and a physical exam will be
      undertaken at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after starting study drug to determine how
      effective the new drug is and to monitor for possible side effects.

      The objectives of this study are to see if Atazanavir and Ritonavir together will be as
      effective as the child's previous regimen in keeping the level of virus in the blood stream
      at such a low level it can't be found and will that combination be as effective as the
      previous regimen in keeping the infection fighting cells in the blood at the same level.

        -  To see if cholesterol and triglyceride levels drop in children switching to Atazanavir
           and Ritonavir from other medication regimens.

        -  To see if Atazanavir and Ritonavir result in an increase in patient satisfaction and
           patient reported adherence and a decrease in symptoms related to medication side
           effects.

      Inclusion Criteria are:

        -  On the same medication regimen at least 3 months

        -  Weight equal to or greater than 25kg

        -  Able to swallow pills or willing to learn

        -  Have a parent or guardian willing and able to sign informed consent

        -  Not be taking a medication which interacts with Atazanavir

        -  Not be currently taking sustiva
