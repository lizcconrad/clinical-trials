  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a 3 month course of vitamin D supplementation to treat
      25(OH)D deficiency in stone formers with high levels of 24-hour urinary calcium will not
      increase urinary calcium excretion by greater than 10%.

      We plan to conduct a clinic-based interventional study of 30 patients followed at Brigham and
      Women's Hospital with history of nephrolithiasis, urinary calcium excretion between 200 and
      400 mg/day, and 25-vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum level ≤ 25ng/ml). The intervention
      is oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week for 8 weeks [1], and each participant will serve as
      his own control. The outcome is the change in urinary calcium excretion. The planned study
      duration is 3 months. We will have greater than 95% power to detect a 10% increase in 24-hour
      urinary calcium
