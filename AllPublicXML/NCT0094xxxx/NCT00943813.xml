  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center the investigators want to provide the best care to
      their patients. One way to do this is to evaluate the ways that doctors communicate with
      patients. To this end, the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences runs a
      Communication Skills Training and Research Laboratory. One goal of this laboratory is to
      evaluate doctor-patient communication and provide training in how to improve the quality of
      this communication.

      Invitation to participate in this pilot project does not mean that a problem with
      communication has been identified in your doctor's practice. Rather, it is because your
      doctor and the fellow working with your doctor have agreed to cooperate with us as the
      investigators develop strategies to train physicians, nurses and other clinical personnel to
      communicate with cancer patients in as effective and sensitive a manner as possible.

    <description>When patients are approached in the clinic, they will be given the permission form and asked to participate in the assessment through allowing video-recording and completing the survey. Procedures will be similar to our current operations, with the RSA starting the video-recording equipment before the fellow enters the room and stopping it when the fellow leaves the room. One additional step will be added: When the RSA goes into the room to turn off and remove the video-recording equipment, she will also give the patient the survey, to complete. We expect this survey to take no longer than 5 minutes. In our experience, it is usually at least 10 minutes from when the fellow leaves the room until the attending comes back into the room. Thus, we believe there will be sufficient time for the patient to complete the survey.</description>

    <description>Video record MD consult before MD has completed Comskill training. Post-Video Recording Survey (5 minutes): This is a 22-item self-report scale that measures patient satisfaction and patient reports of communication behavior (Roter et al 1977). Items are rated using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1, &quot;I disagree completely &quot; to 5, &quot;I agree completely &quot;.</description>
