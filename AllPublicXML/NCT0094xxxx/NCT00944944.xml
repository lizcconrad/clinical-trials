  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire
      (GCLQ) truly detects symptoms or signs of lower extremity lymphedema in patients with
      diagnosed lower extremity lymphedema. Lymphedema is a chronic condition in which fluid
      accumulates in the tissues of the body. Many cancer survivors are living with discomfort and
      changes in their activities due to limb swelling following cancer treatment. If the GCLQ is
      able to do detect signs and symptoms of lymphedema, the investigators hope to use it as a
      tool in the clinical care setting to help identify women at risk for or with lymphedema. In
      the future, this could improve clinical care through the use of a more simple and feasible
      way to identify lower extremity lymphedema than measuring limbs.

    <description>Upon obtaining consent, the participants without a history of lower extremity lymphedema will be asked to undergo limb volume measurements to ensure the accuracy of group assignment to the nonlymphedema group. Participants will then be asked to complete the one time GCLQ lymphedema symptom assessment questionnaire. The survey tool and Limb volume (LV) data and feedback from participants about the GCLQ will be collected. We expect the study survey to take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete and 5-10 minutes to collect LV data.</description>

    <description>The gynecologic cancer survivors with lymphedema group will have documented lower extremity lymphedema. Participants will be asked to complete a one time assessment, the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire to identify lower extremity lymphedema symptoms in gynecologic cancer survivors. They will also be asked to provide feedback about their satisfaction with and the feasibility of the GCLQ as a brief assessment tool that could be used in the clinical care setting.</description>
