  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stretching is performed within sports to improve muscle performance and prevent muscle
      injury. However, recent studies are contradictory with common practice. Then raised the
      possibility that stretching before physical activity performed can decrease the muscle
      performance of healthy subjects.

    <description>Participants were divided into 3 groups. The group was referred to stretching 3 weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Group B went 4 weeks without any intervention and held only one stretch before the re-test. And the group C performed passive knee mobilization. All participants were assessed for goniometry of the knee in flexion and extension and peak torque and power on the isokinetic dynamometer.</description>
