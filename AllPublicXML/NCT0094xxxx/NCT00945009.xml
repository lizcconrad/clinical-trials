      This phase III clinical trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy and surgery work
      in treating young patients with Bilateral Wilms tumor and children who are a special risk for
      forming tumors in both kidneys. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after
      surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve 4-year event-free survival (EFS) to 73% for young patients with bilateral Wilms
      tumor (BWT).

      II. To prevent complete removal of at least one kidney in 50% of patients with BWT by using
      prenephrectomy 3-drug chemotherapy induction with vincristine (vincristine sulfate),
      dactinomycin, and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride).

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy in preserving renal units in children with
      diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (DHPLN) and preventing Wilms tumor
      development.

      IV. To facilitate partial nephrectomy in lieu of nephrectomy in 25% of children with
      unilateral tumors and aniridia, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), hemihypertrophy or other
      overgrowth syndromes, by using prenephrectomy 2-drug chemotherapy induction with vincristine
      and dactinomycin.

      V. To have 75% of patients with BWT undergo definitive surgical treatment by 12 weeks after
      initiation of chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive preoperative chemotherapy according to
      radiographic stage.

      intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (weeks 1-6) and
      dactinomycin IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-120 minutes on days 1 and 22 (weeks
      1 and 4).

      Patients are evaluated at week 6. If partial nephrectomy is feasible, patients proceed to
      definitive surgery and lymph node sampling followed by postoperative therapy. If partial
      nephrectomy is not feasible, patients receive additional chemotherapy (as above with the same
      or a different set of regimen) followed by definitive surgery at week 12 and postoperative
      therapy OR patients proceed to a different chemotherapy regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have one of the following conditions to be eligible:

               -  Synchronous bilateral Wilms tumors*; or

               -  Unilateral Wilms tumor and aniridia, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, idiopathic
                  hemihypertrophy, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel-Syndrome, Denys-Drash Syndrome or other
                  associated genitourinary anomalies associated with bilateral Wilms tumor, such as
                  hypospadias and undescended testis (to be eligible, these patients must not
                  undergo any nephrectomy at diagnosis; note-horseshoe kidney is not associated
                  with bilateral Wilms tumor and these patients should go on the appropriate
                  unilateral Wilms tumor study); or

               -  Multicentric Wilms tumor (any age) (to be eligible, these patients must not
                  undergo any nephrectomy at diagnosis); or

               -  Unilateral Wilms tumor with contralateral nephrogenic rest(s) (any size) in a
                  child under one year of age (to be eligible, these patients must not undergo any
                  nephrectomy at diagnosis); or

               -  Diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (unilateral or bilateral)
                  defined by central radiological review; or

               -  Wilms tumor arising in a solitary kidney (patients with metachronous Wilms tumor
                  are not eligible)

               -  It is often difficult to distinguish Wilms tumors from nephrogenic rests based on
                  imaging studies and percutaneous biopsies. The AREN0534 study uses the guideline
                  that Wilms tumor with a single lesion 1 cm or greater in the contralateral kidney
                  or multiple lesions (of any size) in the contralateral kidney should be treated
                  on the synchronous bilateral Wilms tumor stratum; patients with an isolated
                  lesion less than 1 cm in the contralateral kidney should be treated on the
                  appropriate study for unilateral Wilms tumor OR on the unilateral Wilms
                  tumor/contralateral nephrogenic rest stratum of this study if they have not
                  undergone nephrectomy and are under one year of age.

               -  Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) results—which are used in the unilateral Wilms tumor
                  studies—are not a requirement for enrollment on AREN0534; blood samples can be
                  submitted but will not be used to direct AREN0534 therapy

          -  Specimens/materials must be submitted for central review by day 7; for enrollment on
             AREN0534, unless a biopsy was done, the submission requirements at enrollment on
             AREN03B2 refer to imaging studies; tissue samples are only required if a surgical
             procedure (biopsy or nephrectomy) was performed at the time of enrollment on AREN03B2

          -  Patients must begin protocol therapy on AREN0534 by day 14 following surgery or
             diagnosis by initial computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), unless
             medically contraindicated

          -  Karnofsky performance status must be &gt;= 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky
             performance status must be &gt;= 50% (for patients =&lt; 16 years of age

          -  Patients must not have received systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to
             treatment on this study

          -  Patients with unilateral Wilms tumor and aniridia, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome,
             idiopathic hemihypertrophy, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel-Syndrome, Denys-Drash Syndrome or
             other associated genitourinary anomalies; or multicentric or unilateral Wilms tumor
             with contralateral nephrogenic rest(s) (any size) in a child under 1 year of age who
             undergo a nephrectomy at diagnosis are not eligible for this study and should be
             directed to a unilateral Wilms tumor study

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or
             serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) &lt; 2.5
             times upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

          -  Shortening fraction &gt;= 27% by echocardiogram, OR ejection fraction &gt;= 50% by
             radionuclide angiogram

               -  (Cardiac function does not need to be assessed in patients who will not receive
                  doxorubicin as part of their initial therapy on this study [i.e., patients who
                  start on regimen EE-4A])

          -  Female patients of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test

          -  Female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breastfeeding

          -  Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met
