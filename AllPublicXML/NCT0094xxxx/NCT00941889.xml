  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of the HPV vaccine
      Gardasil on anal condylomata recurrence and persistence rates in HIV positive patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine called Gardasil had recently (at start of
      study) been developed and approved by the FDA for the prevention of cervical HPV infection
      and cervical cancer, which is associated with infection from this virus. It is unknown
      whether the same vaccine could also be of benefit in treating anogenital warts, which are
      caused by the same virus. This is an important and clinically relevant question which needs
      to be answered. Anal warts have a high prevalence and recurrence and usually require extended
      lengths of treatment and follow-up, especially in the HIV population. At times, treatment of
      anal warts requires multiple surgeries to excise them if the burden of disease is high.
      Therefore, this disease represents a significant expense to patients and the health care
      system.

      Further, the HPV virus that causes anal warts has been associated with anal cancer and with
      its preliminary lesion known as anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). This study touches on
      two important, relevant and costly healthcare issues: finding a better treatment for the most
      common sexually transmitted disease in our country, and helping to prevent anal cancer, which
      is often a fatal disease.

        <title>The Primary Endpoint of This Study is Persistence and Recurrence of Anal Warts as Compared Between the Experimental and Control Groups.</title>
        <description>Persistence of anal warts will be measured by the presence of any lesions at one month follow-up after surgery. Recurrence of anal warts will be measured by the development of new lesions after one month of follow-up.</description>
        <time_frame>Follow up evaluation after treatment at 1, 3, 6, 9. 12, 15, 18 months after initial treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Five patients from the placebo group and seven patients from the gardasil group completed all three injections per the protocol. The remaining patients did not complete study-required follow-up and therefore could not be analyzed. One patient from the Gardasil Group and one patient from the placebo group met the outcome measure of recurrence.</population>
