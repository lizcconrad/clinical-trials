      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of modafinil in the treatment of fatigue in
      patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis.

      The general aim of the study is to identify a safe and effective therapy for fatigue in
      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

      The general aim of the study is to identify a safe and effective therapy for fatigue in
      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Specific aims include: 1) to determine the safety
      profile of modafinil in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis; 2) to evaluate the
      beneficial effects of modafinil on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and fatigue as
      documented by a well-validated questionnaire (Fisk Fatigue Severity Score) to be applied at
      the beginning and end of the study period; and 3) to compare the performance of three
      questionnaires (Fisk Fatigue Severity Score, Fatigue Severity Scale and the fatigue domain of
      the PBC-40) as instruments to determine the benefits of a therapeutic intervention on fatigue
      by establishing the minimally important clinical difference of these measures of fatigue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary biliary cirrhosis will be defined as present when 2 of 3 of the following
             criteria are met:

               -  Chronic cholestatic liver disease for greater than 6 months with alkaline
                  phosphatase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal prior to UDCA
                  treatment.

               -  Positive AMA titer greater or equal to 1:40 or AMA greater than 0.1U. Liver
                  histology in the past with features consistent with or diagnostic of PBC.

          -  A previous ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or cholangiography of the biliary
             tree excludes biliary obstruction.

          -  Verbal report of fatigue for greater than 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other serious coexistent conditions such as pre-existing advanced
             malignancy or severe cardiopulmonary disease which would be expected to limit their
             expectancy to less than three years.

          -  Findings highly suggestive of liver disease of other etiology such as chronic
             alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, hemochromatosis, Wilson's
             disease, 1-antitrypsin deficiency, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or sclerosing
             cholangitis.

          -  Treatment of underlying PBC has been modified in the preceding six months.

          -  Anticipated need for transplantation in one year (Mayo survival model &lt;80% one-year
             survival without transplant) or MELD above 15.

             beta-blockers and untreated depression.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to modafinil.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension.
