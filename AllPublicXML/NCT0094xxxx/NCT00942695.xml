      The objective of this study is to measure the energy value of pistachios in the human diet
      and study molecular mechanisms that may help explain the beneficial health effects of
      pistachios.

      Previous studies have suggested that nut consumption imparts a variety of health benefits,
      including reduction of cardiovascular disease and improved satiety. However, studies of
      pistachios are extremely limited. The aim of this study is to determine the energy value of
      pistachios in the human diet and to probe mechanisms by which pistachios impart health
      benefits. The metabolizable energy value of pistachio nuts will be calculated based on the
      chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will provide a
      better estimate of the energy value of pistachios than simply calculating energy value based
      on Atwater factors. In addition to determining the energy value of pistachios, we will
      evaluate the effects of pistachio-rich diets on plasma phytonutrient levels and on gene
      expression changes to determine what protective mechanisms are activated by pistachio
      consumption.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of kidney disease, liver disease, gout, hyperthyroidism, untreated or
             unstable hypothyroidism, certain cancers, gastrointestinal disease, pancreatic
             disease, other metabolic diseases, or malabsorption syndromes

          -  Type 2 diabetes requiring the use of oral antidiabetic agents or insulin
