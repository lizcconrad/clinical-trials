  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does the consumption of various combinations of mono and disaccharides (lactose, sucrose and
      fructose) and protein isolates (whey or soy) result in altered substrate absorption,
      substrate oxidation, and glucose regulation? This proposed research will provide data to
      determine the relative contribution of source of protein (whey vs soy) and carbohydrate
      (mono- and disaccharides) on the observed effects of dairy products on absorption, substrate
      oxidation and glucoregulation mechanisms that affect body composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological research has shown that dairy products aid in weight loss and weight
      maintenance. Some evidence suggests that this effect is due to the whey component (which
      contains whey proteins and lactose) of milk. Previous work from our laboratory has
      demonstrated that chronic administration of whey protein concentrate results in decreased
      body fat and insulin concentration. Recent research (unpublished) from Castonguay and
      colleagues (University of Maryland, College Park, MD) has suggested that specific
      combinations of sucrose, maltose and lactose similarly alter body fat levels in rats. This
      proposed research will provide data to determine the relative contribution of source of
      protein (whey vs soy) and carbohydrate (mono- and disaccharides) on the observed effects of
      dairy products on absorption, substrate oxidation and glucoregulation mechanisms that affect
      body composition.
