  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diet rich in Omega-3 (fish oil) reduces plasma triglycerides and the risk for ischemic
      heart disease. Recently, a large trial evaluating treatment with Omega 3 in heart failure
      patients suggested that omega 3 may lower the risk of death from CHF. The mechanism of this
      potential benefit is not well understood.

      Methods:

      Forty patients will be enrolled in the study. Twenty patients will receive Omega 3 (lovaza 4
      gm a day) and 20 patients will receive placebo. All subjects will have assessment of their
      exercise capacity and blood vessel function before and after an 8 week treatment period.
      About 4 table spoons of blood will be drawn throughout the study.

      Expected results:

      The investigators believe that omega 3 may improve the ability to exercise and improve blood
      vessel function.

    <textblock>
      A diet rich in Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Omega 3 reduces plasma triglycerides and
      the risk for ischemic heart disease1, and may exert direct antiarrhythmic effect on the
      myocardium 2-9. A post-hoc analysis of the GISSI-Prevenzione trial demonstrated a reduction
      in all-cause and sudden mortality in a subgroup of nearly 2000 post-infarction patients with
      left ventricular dysfunction 10. This provocative finding has now been prospectively studied
      in a large-scale, randomized, double-blind study designed to investigate the effects of Omega
      3 on mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic heart failure (the GISSI Heart
      Failure project). The results of the GISSI-HF trial demonstrate that 1 g per day of Omega 3
      is associated with 9% reduction in mortality and cardiovascular admissions in patients with
      predominantly systolic heart failure, when added to optimal medical therapy11.

      The mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects remains to be elucidated and will be
      critical in fully exhausting the therapeutic benefits of Omega 3 in CHF. We have recently
      demonstrated that lipid oxidation during acute exercise is altered in patients with CHF 12
      and that the degree of this alteration carries prognostic significance. It is conceivable
      that Omega 3 modulates lipid oxidation during exercise and thereby favorably effect outcome.
      Accordingly we propose to study the effect of Omega 3 on lipid oxidation during exercise in
      CHF. We will further examine VO2 and endothelial function at present the principal surrogate
      markers for survival in CHF 13.
