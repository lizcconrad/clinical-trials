    <description>Coronary angiogram is performed to allow identification of the culprit coronary artery and to check no reperfusion before PCI (TIMI grade &lt;2). Restoration of coronary blood flow can be achieved by thrombus aspiration, balloon angioplasty, direct stenting or together.In the postconditioning group, immediately after restoration (TIMI grade ≥2) of coronary flow (without regard to method of achieving restoration), angioplasty balloon will be positioned at the culprit lesion or stented segment and inflated 4 times for 1 minute with low-pressure (4 to 6 atm) inflations, each separated by 1 minute of reflow. When restoration of coronary flow is achieved by thrombus aspiration or balloon angioplasty and residual stenosis is remained ≥30%, stent will be deployed.</description>
