      The HABIT clinical study is being performed to determine the benefit and optimal frequency
      for at home testing of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for heart failure patients following
      hospitalization from decompensation. Subjects will be enrolled following hospitalization for
      decompensated heart failure. Enrolled subjects will be trained on the use of the Triage Touch
      meter for fingerstick BNP assessment; these subjects will then test their BNP levels daily
      using the Triage Touch product for approximately 60 days.

      This is a multi-center, single-arm double-blinded prospective clinical study to determine the
      optimal frequency of home B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing and the changes in BNP
      concentrations that correlate with clinical heart failure (HF) decompensation and related
      adverse clinical outcomes in at-risk HF patients. Approximately 200 subjects will be
      enrolled.

        Subjects admitted to the hospital with decompensated Heart Failure. Subjects may be
        enrolled while still in the hospital or within 3 days post-discharge through a heart
        failure clinic or other type of outpatient clinic.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (18 years of age or older);

          -  Admitted to the hospital or observation unit with a diagnosis of decompensated HF for
             which treatment will be administered;

          -  Blood BNP level measurement &gt; 400 pg/mL documented during admission; If NT-proBNP is
             used routinely in the laboratory at a clinical site rather than BNP, then blood
             NT-proBNP level measurement &gt; 1,600 pg/mL documented during admission.

          -  Successfully trained on how to perform a fingerstick and to use the Triage touch.

          -  Either the subject or their care provider is fluent in reading and writing English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent;

          -  Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that is concomitant with the diagnosis of decompensated
             HF and for which treatment will be provided.

        A history of ACS is not reason for exclusion if it is not concomitant with the present
        decompensated HF for which admission is being made. Small elevations in cardiac troponin
        that are considered by the treating physician to be associated with myocardial injury due
        to the acute decompensated HF and not due to a concomitant ACS or myocardial infarction are
        not a basis for exclusion.

          -  Previous cardiac transplantation - or cardiac transplantation anticipated within 3
             months;

          -  Current or planned use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), use of outpatient
             intravenous inotropic HF therapy, major surgical procedure or percutaneous coronary
             intervention within 3 months;

          -  Life expectancy less than 3 months due to causes other than HF or cardiovascular
             disease (e.g., cancer);

          -  End stage renal disease;

          -  Prisoner or other institutionalized or vulnerable individual;

          -  Residence in regions where either transmission of Triage Touch data or a home visit on
             day 5 is not possible.

          -  Dementia, tremors or other impediments to performing daily home BNP testing via
             fingerstick.

          -  Deemed by the Investigator not to be likely to comply with study-mandated procedures
             or instructions.
