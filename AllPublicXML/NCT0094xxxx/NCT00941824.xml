  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate acid (MPA) has been developed and approved in combination with cyclosporine and
      has been used in kidney transplantation for more than a decade. At present, combination of
      tacrolimus and mycophenolate acid tends to be considered as the standard of care for
      maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation. Mainly due to a different effect on
      the entero-hepatic recycling pathway, cyclosporine and tacrolimus differently interfere with
      MPA clearance. When used with tacrolimus, MPA dosage has thus to be adjusted and cannot be
      extrapolated from what is recommended for a cyclosporine-based treatment. However, there is
      currently no clear guideline for MPA dosing when this drug is used in combination with
      tacrolimus. This is potentially detrimental for patients since under-or overexposure of MPA
      has been clinically linked to the outcome of transplantation.

      The purpose of this study is to pharmacologically validate an original MPA dosing regimen in
      combination with tacrolimus within the three months post-kidney transplant. This regimen
      consists in an intensified dosing of mycophenolate sodium during the earliest period of
      transplantation in order to rapidly reach the appropriate MPA blood exposure followed by a
      gradual decrease in dose in order to prevent MPA overexposure.
