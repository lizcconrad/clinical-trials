  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the combination of aliskiren, amlodipine and
      Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) versus the combination of aliskiren and amlodipine as therapy in
      minority Stage 2 hypertensive patients.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (MSSBP) at Week 8</title>
        <description>To evaluate change from baseline in MSSBP after 8 weeks of treatment with an aliskiren, amlodipine, and HCTZ treatment regimen versus an aliskiren and amlodipine treatment regimen in minority patients with Stage 2 hypertension.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was based on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all patients to whom study medication had been assigned. Last-observation-carried-forward was used. Baseline was not carried forward. In the Aliskiren/Amlodipine/HCTZ group, 5 patients did not have a post baseline measure. Hence, change from baseline to week 8 is reported for 197 patients.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (MSSBP) at Week 2 and Week 4</title>
        <description>Primary objective at additional timepoint.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was based on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all patients to whom study medication had been assigned. Last-observation-carried-forward was used. Baseline was not carried forward. In the Aliskiren/Amlodipine/HCTZ group, 5 patients did not have a post baseline measure. Hence, change from baseline is reported for 197 patients.</population>
