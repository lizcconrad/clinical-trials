  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not energy and macronutrient intake
      changes when comparing habitually active and habitually sedentary college-aged males in two
      different sessions of one resting and one exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a consequence of positive energy balance, in which more energy is consumed than
      expended. It is hypothesized that regular amounts of physical activity may be important in
      helping individuals more accurately regulate energy balance. More research is needed to
      understand the impact of a physically active lifestyle on energy regulation capabilities
      Therefore, this study looks at sedentary college aged males compared to active college aged
      males when looking at two different sessions of energy expenditure, one exercise session and
      one resting session, and their energy and macronutrient intake after these sessions. The
      sessions will take place in the morning where each participant will exercise or rest and then
      be allowed to eat from a buffet ad libitum, where acute energy and macronutrient intake will
      be assessed.

      The following hypotheses are proposed:

        -  Individuals who regularly engage in physical activity will more accurately respond to an
           energy deficit caused by an acute period of physical activity by increasing intake at a
           subsequent meal.

        -  Individuals who do not regularly engage in physical activity (sedentary individuals)
           will be less sensitive to accurately regulate energy balance and will not respond to an
           energy deficit caused by a period of acute physical activity.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>20 male students attending the University of Tennessee were recruited to participate through ads and flyers posted around campus. The recruitment period started in November 2008 and ended in August 2009 upon completion of the study. The initial phone screen conducted to determine eligibility occurred in the HEAL lab.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomly assigned to which session, exercise or rest, they engaged in first. As this is a crossover design, participants did complete both the exercise and rest conditions.</pre_assignment_details>
