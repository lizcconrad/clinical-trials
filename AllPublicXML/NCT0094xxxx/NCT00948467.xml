  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      maximum tolerated dose of TAK-733 in patients with advanced, nonhematologic tumors. The
      expansion stage of the study will evaluate evidence of antitumor activity of TAK-733 in
      patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.

    <description>The Initial Escalation Stage will enroll approximately 30 patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. TAK-733 will be administered orally in 28-day treatment cycles consisting of intermittent dosing with 21 days of continuous treatment, followed by a rest period of 7 days.
The Expansion Stage will enroll approximately 30 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. The recommended phase 2 dose determined in the Initial Escalation Stage of TAK-733 will be administered orally in 28-day treatment cycles consisting of intermittent dosing with 21 days of continuous treatment, followed by a rest period of 7 days.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  18 years or older.

          -  Have one of the following diagnoses: a nonhematologic malignancy for which standard,
             curative, or life-prolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective; OR
             have stage 3 or stage 4 unresectable melanoma not priorly treated with either MEK or
             BRAF inhibitor therapy.

          -  Melanoma patients should have the V600E BRAF mutation status of their tumor
             documented, if available, and tumor tissue must be provided for confirmatory
             genotyping by a central laboratory.

          -  Have a radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor.

          -  Have suitable venous access for the conduct of blood sampling.

          -  Provide voluntary written consent, which can be withdrawn by the patient at any time.

          -  Female patients who: are post-menopausal for at least 1 year before screening; OR are
             surgically sterile; OR if they are of childbearing potential agree to practice two
             effective methods of birth control from the time of signing the informed consent form
             through 30 days after the last dose of the study drug, or agree to completely abstain
             from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, must agree to practice effective barrier
             contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 30 days after the

             intercourse.

          -  Abnormalities on 12-lead ECG performed within 28 days before the start of the study
             drug that are considered to be clinically significant or rate corrected QT interval &gt;
             470 milliseconds.

          -  Melanoma patients will be excluded if they have had a diagnosis with or treatment for
             another malignancy within 2 years of the first dose of the study drug, or have been
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy with any evidence of residual disease.

          -  Treatment with any investigational product within 28 days before the first dose of the
             study drug.

          -  A history of an ongoing or newly diagnosed eye abnormality, such as retinal or corneal
             pathologies.
