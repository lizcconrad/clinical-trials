      The study hypothesis is that the safety and efficacy of sufentanil following transdermal
      application is comparable to sustained release morphine sulphate tablets in patients with
      chronic pain due to cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the consumption, in milligrams, of rescue
      analgesia (normal release morphine sulfate tablets) after the administration of sufentanil
      TDS or sustained release morphine sulfate.

      The secondary efficacy objectives of this study are to evaluate:

        -  Pharmacokinetic data

        -  Adverse events

          4. Documented history of moderate to severe chronic cancer pain requiring
             around-the-clock therapy and are likely to benefit from WHO step III opioid analgesics
             for the duration of the study;

          5. Has been informed of the nature of the study and has provided written informed
             consent;

             month before study entry, or previous participation in this study;

         17. Is an employee of the investigator or study site with direct involvement in the
             proposed study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study
