    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate the behavioral responses to varenicline, helping to better
      understand its mechanisms. Hypotheses for the study are to observe decreases in smoking
      topography and nicotine cigarette choice on varenicline, relative to placebo; and decreases
      on day 21 relative to day 7 during varenicline treatment. We also propose to examine if
      extended duration of treatment has clinical significance in decreasing smoking behaviors,
      thus increasing the efficacy of varenicline.

      This study is designed to examine the behavioral responses a cigarette smoker may have to
      using varenicline. Behavioral responses may help to better understand its mechanisms which in
      turn could improve treatment outcomes. The primary hypothesis for the study is to observe
      decreases in smoking topography, an objective measure of smoking behavior or puffing, on
      varenicline, relative to placebo; and decreases on day 21 relative to day 7 during
      varenicline treatment. We will also examine puffing and nicotine cigarette choices during lab
      visits at baseline, and Days 7 and 21. We also propose to examine if extended duration of
      treatment has clinical significance in decreasing smoking behaviors, thus potentially
      increasing the efficacy of varenicline.

    <measure>Smoking Topography: Total Puff Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-21 of each of 2 study periods</time_frame>
    <description>Total puff volume was created by summing all of the puffs from the cigarette smoked in the lab at each time point (each lab visit). This value represents the total volume of smoke extracted from a single cigarette and it a standard measure of smoking behavior. A total puff volume represents the total smoking volume from a cigarette. Values are reported in milliliters. Value of interest is the average puff volume across all sessions for all participants in a group and is reported as a key measure of smoking behavior. Analyses were repeated measures analysis of variance where individual, time and drug were within factors.</description>

    <description>Participants were given 4 puff choices (between a nicotine containing and de-nicotinized cigarette) on 6 study visits, for a total of 24 choices. Number of puffs reported is average across both study periods.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Measures to Assess Smoking Urges</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 21 of each of the two 21-day study periods, range 1(low)-7(high)</time_frame>
    <description>Craving for cigarettes was assessed with the 32-item Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) during each study visit. In order to calculate the QSU measure, each item is rated on a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The values are then summed to create a single total score. Well validated 2 factor subscale scores were also created by summing the item scores for the 2 factors: Factor 1 reflects the desire to smoke for pleasure and Factor 2 reflects urges to smoke to relieve withdrawal-related negative affect. Internal consistency for each scale across all time points was high (Cronbach's α &gt; 0.95, 0.85, and 0.95 for Factor 1, Factor 2, and QSU total, respectively). Scale range is 1-7 where 1 is low urge to smoke and 7 represents high urge to smoke. Data was collected at each time point but outcome measure of interest is end of period.</description>

        <title>Smoking Topography: Total Puff Volume</title>
        <description>Total puff volume was created by summing all of the puffs from the cigarette smoked in the lab at each time point (each lab visit). This value represents the total volume of smoke extracted from a single cigarette and it a standard measure of smoking behavior. A total puff volume represents the total smoking volume from a cigarette. Values are reported in milliliters. Value of interest is the average puff volume across all sessions for all participants in a group and is reported as a key measure of smoking behavior. Analyses were repeated measures analysis of variance where individual, time and drug were within factors.</description>

        <title>Subjective Measures to Assess Smoking Urges</title>
        <description>Craving for cigarettes was assessed with the 32-item Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) during each study visit. In order to calculate the QSU measure, each item is rated on a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The values are then summed to create a single total score. Well validated 2 factor subscale scores were also created by summing the item scores for the 2 factors: Factor 1 reflects the desire to smoke for pleasure and Factor 2 reflects urges to smoke to relieve withdrawal-related negative affect. Internal consistency for each scale across all time points was high (Cronbach’s α &gt; 0.95, 0.85, and 0.95 for Factor 1, Factor 2, and QSU total, respectively). Scale range is 1-7 where 1 is low urge to smoke and 7 represents high urge to smoke. Data was collected at each time point but outcome measure of interest is end of period.</description>
