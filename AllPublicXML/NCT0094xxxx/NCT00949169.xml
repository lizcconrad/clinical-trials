      The aim of this study was to investigate whether carotid IMT can predict the presence of more
      advanced atherosclerosis such as carotid stenosis, coronary or intracranial artery disease by
      MDCT and whether MDCT could be useful next step for more aggressive treatment modality in
      Korean type 2 diabetic patients.

      We evaluated mean/maximal carotid IMT in seventy-one type 2 diabetic subjects, and defined
      increased carotid IMT as maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm. Multidetector CT (MDCT) and pulse wave
      velocity (PWV) were taken to evaluate carotid artery stenosis (CS), coronary artery disease
      (CAD), intracranial arterial lesion (ICA), and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We compared
      prevalence of large artery stenosis according to carotid IMT group and evaluated whether
      maximal IMT ≥ 1.0 mm could predict for significant CAD by MDCT. We performed invasive
      coronary angiography in some patients (N=14) and analyzed association for degrees of CAD
      between two angiographic methods.
