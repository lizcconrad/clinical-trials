  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators will explore three specific aims. First, the
      investigators will examine cross-sectionally the association of obesity on sympathetic,
      parasympathetic, and sympathetic/ parasympathetic nerve fiber balance. In addition, the
      investigators will determine the relationship of the ANS and osteocalcin. Osteocalcin will be
      measured before and after a mixed meal tolerance test.

      In the second specific aim, the investigators will prospectively follow-up these individuals
      (n=30) following bariatric surgery. The effect of weight loss on measures of the ANS and
      osteocalcin will be examined 6 months following surgery with participants serving as their
      own control, pre- and post-surgical intervention.

      Thirdly, the investigators will address whether the effect of weight loss on the ANS and
      osteocalcin differ between those who had a history of diabetes at baseline versus those with
      no history of diabetes.
