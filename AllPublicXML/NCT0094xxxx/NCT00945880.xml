    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that clemizole hydrochloride is safe and
      well tolerated when administered to subjects who are infected with hepatitis C virus and have
      not yet received treatment. This study will also examine how the virus and body respond to
      clemizole hydrochloride.

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1b, open label study of four weeks of treatment with 100 mg po BID of
      clemizole hydrochloride administered immediately prior to the initiation of treatment with
      HCV standard of care therapy consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in
      treatment-naïve subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 or genotype 2. The duration
      of the study for each subject will be approximately 11 weeks (up to three week screening
      period, four week treatment period and four week safety follow-up period). The duration of
      the entire study is anticipated to be approximately four months (first subject in to last
      subject out). Pharmacokinetic sampling will be done at Day 1 and Day 28 of dosing. PK
      sampling will be conducted only on subjects who have consented to participate in the PK
      portion of this study. Participation in PK sampling is optional for each subject.
