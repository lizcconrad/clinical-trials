      This study is being done to gain knowledge on how effective different approaches of providing
      a diagnosis and varying educational tools that include DVDs and multimedia or printed
      instruction sheets on your readiness to increase the subject's level of exercise, lose more
      weight, eat a healthier diet; and to assess the subject's awareness of their risk of heart
      disease and their readiness to participate in a comprehensive lifestyle modification program.
