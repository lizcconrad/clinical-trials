      Primary Objective:

      · The primary objective is to estimate the prevalence of use of complementary and alternative
      medicine (CAM) in patients with advanced malignancies who are seen in the Phase I clinic at
      MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

      Secondary Objective:

      · Examine the association between prevalence of CAM use and demographic and socioeconomic
      characteristics (age, gender, race, income, and education level), participation in a phase I
      clinical trial, disease characteristics (diagnosis), patients' perceptions about their
      prognosis, physicians' information and permission for patients' CAM use, decision-making, and
      types of CAM used by patients.

      This survey study is intended to estimate the prevalence of use of CAM in patients who are
      currently being treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at University of Texas MD
      Anderson Cancer Center. The survey includes questions about socioeconomic characteristics
      (age, gender, race, income, and education level), patients' diagnosis and patients'
      perceptions about their prognosis, physicians' information and permission for patients' use
      of CAM, patients' use of CAM (yes or no), decision-making (purpose of CAM use), resources and
      types of CAM.

      Patients will be asked to drop the questionnaire into a box in a specified location after
      completion of the questionnaire. Accrual is expected to be 50-100 patients per month. This
      survey is expected to finish in 6 months.
