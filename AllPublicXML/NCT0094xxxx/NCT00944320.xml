    <textblock>
      Polymorphisms occur in several genes encoding key enzymes in the folate pathway may affect
      drug metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Whether these genetic variations
      contribute to differential responses to antifolate drug in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) remains to be investigated in the Taiwanese population.

      Objective. The goal of the present study is to investigate the interactions between genetic
      variations in folate genes and the efficacy/side effects of anti-folate disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drug in Taiwan.

      DESIGN. A cross-sectional study involving 100 patients with RA were enrolled from TCVGH.
      Genotypes in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR677C&gt;T), tandem repeat polymorphism in
      thymidylate synthase enhancer region (TSER) and folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase
      (FPGS1901T&gt;C) were determined by RFLP or pyrosequencing.
