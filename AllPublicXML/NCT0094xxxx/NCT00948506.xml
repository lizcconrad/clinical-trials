  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, single center placebo-controlled double-blind proof of concept study which
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical cidofovir (both 1% and 3%)compared to
      placebo for the prevention of hair growth.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, placebo controlled double blind, dose-ranging clinical trial
      of topical cidofovir for the prevention of hair growth. This proof of concept study will
      evaluate 1% and 3% cidofovir in petrolatum topically applied once a day to the target
      treatment area on the hair bearing area of the face known as the beard area. This target area
      will be of a circular shape with a diameter of three centimeters along the jaw line of one
      side of the face.The first 14 enrolled subjects in the study will be randomized in a 1:1
      fashion to receive either 1% topical cidofovir and placebo or 3% topical cidofovir and
      placebo. The last cohort of subjects to be enrolled in the study to achieve a total of 16
      evaluable subjects will all receive the 3% formulation and placebo. Subjects will also be
      randomized as to which side of their face (left or right) will receive active drug versus
      placebo.

      Subjects will be treated for up to eight weeks. Any subject who achieves 100% alopecia (which
      corresponds to a 0 on the PGA of Hair Density) in the treated area prior to eight weeks will
      be classified as a responder and will discontinue active treatment and begin the four week
      observation period. From the time of discontinuing treatment, subjects will be followed for
      four weeks during which time safety data will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be able to give informed consent.

          2. Subjects must be male, age 18 years or older.

          3. Score of 4 or 5 on the Physician's Global Assessment of Hair Density at baseline

          4. Subjects must have to shave at least once a day to avoid a visible beard with a hair
             length that is above the skin line.

          5. Male subjects who are sexually active with female partners and are capable of
             fertilization must ensure that their female partners will either be postmenopausal,
             surgically incapable of childbearing, or will use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the entire study period. Medically acceptable methods of
             contraception that may be used by the subject and/or partner include oral
             contraceptives or patch, diaphragms with spermicide, IUD, condom with spermicide, or
             progestin implant or injection. Female partners taking oral contraceptives must have
             taken them consistently for at least two months prior to subject receiving study
             medication.

          6. Subjects must be able to limit the use of alcohol to 2 or fewer drinks per day for the
             duration of the study period. One drink corresponds to 6 oz of wine, 12 oz of beer or
             1 oz of hard liquor.

          7. Subjects must be willing and able to avoid exposure of the study drug to others

             g/dL, platelet count &lt;125,000/cm3, white blood count &lt;3,500 cells/cm3 or &gt; 15,000
             cells/cm3, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) within two weeks of the baseline visit.

          6. Active inflammatory skin disease in the treatment area (e.g. acne, cysts) or neoplasms
             in the treatment area that in the judgment of the investigator precludes enrollment.

             foscarnet, vancomycin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) 7 days prior to the
             baseline visit.
