  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, to
      patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. Each 28 day cycle of treatment will consist of
      3 consecutive weeks of treatment every 28 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days
      1, 8, and 15 every 28 days). Each 21 day cycle of treatment will consist of 2 consecutive
      weeks of treatment every 21 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days 1 and 8 every
      21 days). Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity is observed. Approximately 110 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients
      will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) for the
      2 dosing schedules are established. To further evaluate safety, approximately 40 additional
      patients with advanced malignant solid tumors will be enrolled and treated at the MTDs (20
      for each dosing schedule) during an expansion phase.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an IV infusion, to patients with
      advanced malignant solid tumors. Drug will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion on days
      1, 8, and 15 of the 28 day treatment cycle, or on days 1 and 8 of the 21 day treatment cycle.

      Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      is observed. Patients will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated
      Doses (MTDs) are established.

      Safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

    <description>Genz-644282 will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion. The initial dose of Genz-644282 will be 0.5 mg/m2 and will be administered once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of the 28 day cycle. Each 28-day period will represent one treatment cycle. Study drug will continue to be given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed.</description>

    <description>The starting dose of Genz-644282 for the 21-day schedule will be prescriptive and will be based on review of available safety data from the 28-day dosing schedule by the Investigator and Sponsor. Patients will receive Genz-644282 once-weekly for 2 consecutive weeks on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 day cycle. Each 21-day period will represent 1 treatment cycle. Patients enrolled in subsequent cohorts will receive higher doses until the MTD is established.</description>

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease or a history of serious organ dysfunction or
             disease involving the heart, kidney, liver, or other organ system that may place the
             patient at undue risk to undergo chemotherapy.

          -  A known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune
             deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or viral hepatitis B or C.
