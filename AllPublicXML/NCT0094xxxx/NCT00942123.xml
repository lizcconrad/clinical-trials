  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is the first line drug of choice for the treatment of type II diabetes. Lactic
      acidosis can develop as a side effect, especially when renal failure leads to drug
      accumulation. Lactic acidosis is usually attributed to an abnormal inhibition of hepatic
      lactate clearance.

      Growing evidence suggest that metformin can dose-dependently inhibit hepatocyte mitochondrial
      function. Whether a similar effect occurs in extra-hepatic human tissues remains unknown.

      The investigators hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during metformin
      intoxication even in tissues other than the liver, thus contributing to the development of
      lactic acidosis. The aim of this study is to investigate mitochondrial integrity in
      circulating platelets of patients with lactic acidosis due to metformin intoxication.
