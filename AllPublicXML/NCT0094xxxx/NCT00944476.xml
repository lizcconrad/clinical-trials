  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presently the best study for assessing the size and
      extent of the patient's sarcoma. Many sarcomas contain fat that can interfere with the
      accuracy of sarcoma detection. The investigators have developed a new MRI method that can
      suppress all the fat signals in the patient's tumor and this may improve the investigators'
      ability to see the patient's sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      investigators' new fat-free imaging methods provides them with images that are better than,
      equal to, or worse than those images obtained by standard MRI methods. This study may help
      the investigators develop a more accurate MRI examination.

      In addition, we will perform the same scans on 4 volunteers who have no history of sarcoma.
      Scanning volunteers will allow us to optimize the imaging technique by 1.) Determine the best
      combination of pulse-sequence and magnetization transfer technique to obtain the greatest
      contrast and 2.) Determine the parameters of repetition time (TR), echo time (TE) and
      magnetization transfer time and power in order to reduce overall image acquisition time while
      optimizing image quality. Honing this technique on volunteers will allow us to decrease scan
      time and potential discomfort for patients.

    <description>Fat-free MRI images utilizing standard magnetization transfer imaging will be acquired on 10 patients known or suspected sarcoma of the of the extremity or trunk, in addition to their traditional clinical MRI. In addition, we will perform the same scans on 4 volunteers who have no history of sarcoma.</description>

    <description>In addition to the traditional MRI exam for clinical use, a fat-free MRI based on standard magnetization transfer magnetic resonance imaging will be acquired. Pts will spend 20 extra minutes and 20 minutes total for volunteers in the MRI scanner. Patients/volunteers will complete the MR Screening Questionnaire before the MRI exam.</description>
