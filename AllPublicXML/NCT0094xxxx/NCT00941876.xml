  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV positive women and couples have broad reproductive health needs that are not always met
      within HIV services. The integration of family planning (FP) services into Tanzania's HIV
      Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) will address the fertility desires of CTC clients and
      ultimately result in the reduction of unintended pregnancies and HIV incidence. One strategy
      for integrating FP and CTC services is to use a &quot;facilitated referral&quot; model. Facilitated
      referrals are enhanced referrals for additional services that have been used in other
      settings and which are the preferred intervention strategy the Government of Tanzania would
      like to pilot test. This study will evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and costs of
      implementing a &quot;facilitated referrals&quot; intervention by examining FP use among female clients
      attending HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Centers. This study will measure whether there is a
      reduction in unmet need for contraception among female CTC clients after the facilitated
      referral integration intervention has been implemented.
