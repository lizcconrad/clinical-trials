      The goal of this study is to learn which of 3 methods is best for helping people quit
      smoking.

      Objectives:

      Specific Aim 1: Specific Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions
      targeting community based low-income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a
      group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach,
      consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replace therapy (NRT), and self-help
      written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components
      and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC)
      approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered
      proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component.

      Hypothesis 1.1. Participants randomized to the EC condition will have higher smoking
      abstinence rates at 12-month follow-up compared to participants randomized to the SC
      condition.

      Hypothesis 1.2. Participants randomized to the IC condition will have higher smoking
      abstinence rates at 12-month follow-up compared to participants randomized to the EC
      condition.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception,
      self-efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking
      abstinence

      Hypothesis 2.1: The EC's and IC's effects on abstinence will be mediated by quit motivation,
      nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self-efficacy, social support, and negative affect.

      Specific Aim 3: Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.

      Hypothesis 3.1: Compared to SC and EC, the IC is a cost-effective use of health care
      resources.

      Baseline Interview:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will complete a series of
      questionnaires on a laptop computer. You will be asked questions about your smoking habits.
      You will be asked how much tobacco you use, how many times you have tried to quit, how ready
      you are to quit, and how dependent you are on nicotine. You will be asked about symptoms
      related to nicotine withdrawal and any breathing problems associated with smoking. You will
      also be asked about support you receive from family and friends. The questionnaires on the
      laptop will take about 1 hour to complete. You will also complete an interview with the study
      staff to test your level of basic health knowledge. This test will about 10 minutes to
      complete.

      Study Groups:

      You will be assigned to a study group based on the location of where you enroll in the study.
      Everybody enrolled at a location will be in the same group and will get the same help.

      Study Procedures:

      For participants in Group 1:

        -  You will receive a cell phone for study staff to call you about scheduled follow-up
           visits.

        -  Right after the baseline interview, you will be asked by the study staff to set a quit
           date. The study staff will explain why it is important for you to quit and will also
           explain how to use the nicotine patches you will receive.

        -  You will receive a manual that explains how important it is to quit smoking, how smoking
           hurts your health, and how family and friends can help while you try to quit. You will
           receive this manual at the beginning of the study.

        -  You will receive a 10-week supply of nicotine patches that may help you to quit.

      In addition to everything Group 1 receives, for participants in Groups 2 and 3:

        -  You will receive a telephone number to a hotline for you to use to call and talk to
           someone who can help you to quit. You can use the cell phone you are given to call the
           hotline anytime you need support in your effort to quit smoking or stay quit.

        -  You will receive between 1-5 supportive text messages a day on the cell phone. These
           text messages will continue for 12 weeks.

        -  Once per week, you will receive a text message from the study staff asking if you have
           smoked within the past 24 hours. You will be asked to respond to this text message
           either by sending a text back to the study staff or calling the hotline. If the study
           staff does not receive your response you may receive a phone call from the staff asking
           about your smoking status over the past 24 hours.

      If you are in Group 3, you will also receive 11 phone calls over a 12-week period. During
      this call, you will be given support to help you quit and stay quit, and each call will last
      about 15 minutes. These phone calls will be recorded, and the recordings may be used by the
      study staff to check the quality of the support you receive.

      Follow-Up:

      Study staff will call you once per month for 6 months to ask you for information about how
      you are doing with quitting smoking.

      A year after you started the study, you will be asked to return to the site where you were
      enrolled in the study for an in-person follow-up interview. You will be asked for more
      information about quitting smoking and how the study went for you. At this visit, you will
      also be asked to spit into a clean cup and to blow into a cardboard tube to check your
      smoking levels. This session will last about 1 hour.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 1 year.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 756 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at community sites
      in the greater-Houston area.
