  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binodenoson (an experimental drug) and adenosine (an FDA-approved drug that is currently used
      by doctors) are used to increase blood flow to the heart just like when a person exercises on
      a treadmill. Using imaging techniques, this increased blood flow can help determine if areas
      of the heart are not getting enough blood and oxygen during exercise. The purpose of the
      study is to determine if binodenoson is as good as adenosine in determining if there are
      areas of the heart not getting enough oxygen when blood flow to the heart is increased.
