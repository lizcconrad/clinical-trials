  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity plays a causal role for kidney disease incidence and progression. Moderate weight
      loss reduces the high metabolic demands on the kidney and decreases proteinuria in both
      diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathies. However, maintaining behavioral changes for weight
      loss is very challenging, and common chronic kidney disease (CKD) co-morbidities such as
      decreased exercise capacity only compound this difficulty. Moreover, no weight loss
      medications have been adequately tested in adults with CKD and most are contraindicated in
      this population. Mindful meditation or &quot;mindfulness&quot; in addition to other relaxation
      techniques may help adults lose weight by interrupting learned behavior, curbing compulsive
      eating, and reducing stress and appetite. Although mindful meditation and other relaxation
      techniques have gained the attention of the mainstream media for obesity treatment,
      scientific data on its efficacy remain limited. Due to the short duration of this study,
      substantial weight loss in any participant is not expected. Instead, the primary purpose of
      this study is to examine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of mindful
      meditation relaxation techniques combined with standard care compared to standard care alone
      for the treatment of obesity among Veterans with CKD.

    <description>Participants assigned to the mindful meditation plus standard care arm will receive individualized instruction on mindful meditation at the time they are randomized to this arm. The participants will be led through a 20 minute relaxation exercise. They will then be led through a brief eating exercise where they will be instructed to eat the food very slowly and pay attention to how the food tastes and the sensations of swallowing the food. This is done to enhance the person's awareness of what and how they are eating and enhance their intuitive sense of satiety. Finally, they will receive an MP3-player with several relaxation instructional audios loaded on the MP3 player.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the control arm will receive the dietary counseling and will be told that relaxation can help reduce appetite. However, techniques to relax will not be taught. Instead, participants will be encouraged to sit quietly listening to music (of their choice) every day for 20 minutes. Participants assigned to the standard care arm will receive an MP3-player and will be given a choice of selection of music that they can load on their MP3 player (classical music, country music, jazz, etc.).</description>
