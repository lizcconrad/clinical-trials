  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous clinical studies of post-surgical pain the investigators found that nalbuphine
      (Nubain), a narcotic pain killer, relieves pain more effectively when combined with low-dose
      naloxone (Narcan), a drug that is used to treat narcotic overdose. This finding was
      particularly true in men. The purpose of this study is to find out if nalbuphine combined
      with naloxone is more effective in relieving experimentally produced pain than either drug
      alone. A second reason for this study is to find out if study medications work more
      effectively in women or in men. Subjects will come to the University of California at San
      Francisco (UCSF) Clinical Research Center (CRC) for 4 study visits. The first visit will be a
      2-hour screening to assess the subject for study eligibility. During the other three visits,
      the investigators will use a thermal stimulating device to produce temporary, non-injurious
      skin sensitivity that subjects will feel as painful. Changes in pain will be measured
      following the intravenous (i.v.) administration of study drugs. Three drug combinations will
      be administered, a different one each visit: 1) nalbuphine 5 mg and naloxone 0.4 mg , 2)
      naloxone 0.4 mg and saline (an inactive solution), nalbuphine 5 mg and saline. These drug
      combinations will be administered in random order; all subjects will receive all three
      combinations.
