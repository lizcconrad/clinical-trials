    <time_frame>Days 1-8</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with fever between the two treatment groups was compared based on the upper limit of the two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) for the rate difference (Vaccine minus Placebo). The upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI was evaluated against the prespecified equivalence criterion of 10% which corresponded to the following hypotheses • H0 (null): rate difference ≥ 10% • HA (alternative): rate difference &lt; 10%</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were screened for the study within 14 days prior to randomization. The first and last dates of informed consent were 03 Aug 2009 and 18 Aug 2009. Once informed consent was obtained, a subject identification number was assigned using an interactive voice response system, and screening evaluations began to assess study eligibility.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of monovalent vaccine or placebo by intranasal spray; the doses were administered approximately 28 days apart, on Days 1 and 29.</pre_assignment_details>
