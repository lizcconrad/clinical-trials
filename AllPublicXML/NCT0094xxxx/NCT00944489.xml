      The main goal of this study is to achieve a deeper knowledge of the adherence to
      antihypertensive drug treatment and to evaluate the quality of life in this population. This
      work has the following goals: primary objective is to assess the antihypertensive treatment
      adherence in patients with essential hypertension on treatment for more than 6 months.

      The secondary objectives include the assessment of quality of life, identification of
      associated factors that affect adherence, knowledge of drugs used and comparison of levels of
      adherence according to the different drug regimes

      Two questionnaires shall be prepared The first questionnaire shall be anonymously completed
      by the patient willing to participate. It is divided into two parts:

        1. Treatment Adherence Scale (MMAS): this survey is made up of 4 questions having YES/No
           answers and it grants 1 point per every &quot;NO&quot; answer, and zero points to every &quot;YES&quot;
           answer.

        2. The second part is the health-related quality of life Questionnaire (MINICHAL). The
           questions refer to the &quot;last 7 days&quot; with 4 possible answer options: 0 (no, absolutely
           not), 1 (yes, sometimes), 2 (yes, frequently) and 3 (yes, a lot). It is made up of 16
           items, 10 correspond to the &quot;State of Mind&quot; dimension and 6 to the &quot;Body-related
           Symptoms,&quot; also described as &quot;Physical symptoms&quot;.

      The second questionnaire shall be completed by the intervening physician as regards patients
      that attend medical visits, and who have answered the anonymous questionnaire.
