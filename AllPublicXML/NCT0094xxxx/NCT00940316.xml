      RATIONALE: Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Panitumumab
      may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet
      known whether erlotinib hydrochloride given together with panitumumab is more effective with
      or without irinotecan in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving erlotinib hydrochloride together
      with panitumumab to see how well it works with or without irinotecan hydrochloride as
      second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
           erlotinib hydrochloride and panitumumab with versus without irinotecan hydrochloride as
           second-line therapy .

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to disease progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens on downstream targets of EGFR in skin rash
           associated with pharmacologic EGFR inhibition (exploratory).

        -  Determine the association between KRAS mutations and response to EGFR inhibition
           (exploratory).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to wild-type Kras
      tumors ( 6/6 UGT1A1 vs 6/7 UGT1A1), and are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients
      with wild-type Kras tumor 7/7 UGT1A1 receive treatment in arm III.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-14,
           panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-14 and
           panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon disease progression,
           patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride and panitumumab as in arm II. Skin
           biopsies and blood samples may be collected for further analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 weeks.
