    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to determine the effects of a cholesterol-lowering
      medication, called simvastatin on pneumonia. People in the study will be in the hospital
      because they have pneumonia. The people will also have a medical condition like heart
      disease, diabetes, stroke or high cholesterol for which cholesterol-lowering medication has
      been shown to prevent future disease and/or death but are not taking a cholesterol-lowering
      medication when they go to the hospital. Some people will get treated with antibiotics only
      and other people will get antibiotics and simvastatin while they are in the hospital. The
      study will compare the effects the combination of simvastatin and antibiotics has on people
      with pneumonia to treatment with antibiotics alone.
