  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presently, there are very few treatments available which affect the progression of the
      disease in the spine. The only proven treatment is the use of drugs inhibiting tumour
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF). However, there are limitations with this treatment in that it
      needs to be administered via an injection and is also very expensive. Therefore it is
      necessary to develop new therapeutic agents for this condition.

      Apremilast (the study drug) is an oral tablet which has been shown to inhibit TNF production
      in a mouse model of inflammation. It has also been used in clinical trials for asthma and
      psoriasis in humans with good affect and tolerability.

      These studies were funded by Celgene Corporation and they will be funding this study.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of apremilast in AS as measured by improvement in
      patients' signs and symptoms of the disease and changes in imaging. Additionally the safety
      and tolerability of apremilast in AS will be assessed. The patients will be recruited from
      hospitals by Consultant referral. The patients will have had AS for at least 2 years and
      their symptoms will have been uncontrolled on conventional non−steroidal anti−inflammatory
      drugs such as ibuprofen. Patients will be randomised to either receive apremilast or a
      placebo and treated over a period of 12 weeks. They will then be followed up for 28 days
      after the treatment period.

          -  Diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as defined by the modified New York criteria
             (1984) as follows:

               1. a history of inflammatory back pain;

               2. limitation of motion of the lumbar spine in both the sagittal and frontal planes;

               3. limited chest expansion, relative to standard values for age and sex;

               4. definite radiographic / imaging evidence of sacroiliitis and/or spinal
                  inflammation

          -  Patients must have daily spinal pain and stiffness for at least 2 weeks prior to
             randomization. This is defined by having a score of &gt;1 on questions #2 and #5 of the
             BASDAI score for the 2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Patients receiving NSAIDS and/or COX-2 inhibitors must be on stable doses for at least
             2 weeks prior to randomization.
