  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome, a group of cardiovascular risk factors related to insulin resistance, is
      a major determinant of cardiovascular mortality.

      Intermittent claudication is a symptom of an early stage of atherosclerosis.

      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients
      with intermittent claudication and its correlation with age, gender, localization of arterial
      obstruction and association with coronary artery disease.

    <textblock>
      Studies correlating metabolic syndrome and several illnesses are being published, especially
      affections associated with atherosclerosis, like coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular
      disease and peripheral arterial disease.

      The term peripheral arterial disease, however, refers to several stages of the development of
      atherosclerosis in the extremities, comprising since asymptomatic patients as far as
      individuals with critical ischemia.

      Intermittent claudication is a symptom of an early stage of atherosclerosis, when medical
      interventions may still prevent the progression of the disease. Despite the importance of a
      precocious diagnosis of metabolic syndrome to initiate adequate treatment, its prevalence
      among these patients is not well determined in the literature.

      This is the biggest casuistic in the literature as far as we know.
