    <textblock>
      The investigators want to prove that people WITHOUT advanced cancer who are taking opioid
      medications (for problems like back pain) can receive methylnaltrexone (MNTX) safely. Since
      the FDA has only approved MNTX for advanced cancer patients, the investigators' research is
      investigating how MNTX can work for NON-cancer patients. This research is being conducted to
      prove that MNTX can work for non-cancer patients with opioid related constipation.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age 18 and greater

          2. Clinical diagnosis of constipation

          3. Any patients that report taking an opioid analgesic for greater than two (2) weeks (eg
             known oncology patients and chronic pain syndrome patients, including those with low
             back pain or sciatica)

          4. Patients must have previously tried a stable laxative regiment for at least three (3)
             days prior to study entry.

          5. All patients will have a flat and upright abdominal x-ray, and chest x-ray to exclude
             gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction. Any patients who have radiographic evidence of GI
             obstruction will need a CT scan of the abdomen to exclude GI obstruction prior to
             study enrollment.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must be
             encouraged to use appropriate birth control for a period after the study.

          7. Willing to comply with study instructions and sign an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or lactation

          2. Recent surgery within six (6) weeks of the emergency department visit

          3. Opioid withdrawal syndrome as determined by clinical judgment.

          4. Patients with previous history of diabetic gastroparesis.

          5. Any patient who has known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction

          6. Any patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min

          7. Constipation for which other medical causes cannot be excluded such as anticholinergic
             medications, botulinum toxin, or botulism.

          8. Any patient with SBP ≤ 80 mmHg or DBP ≤ 45 mmHg or unstable vital signs.

          9. Inability to understand or follow the instructions associated with the clinical study
             as determined by clinical judgment.

         10. A known history of substance abuse on methadone maintenance therapy &gt; 12 months

         11. Allergy or contraindication to use of methylnaltrexone

         12. Prior enrollment in study
