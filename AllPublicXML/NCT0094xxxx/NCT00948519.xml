  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is common disorder which affects up to 13% of the US population.
      CRS affects numerous Quality of Life (QOL) factors including smell, sleep and communication.
      The common treatment for medically noncompliant CRS is Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery
      (FESS).

      As the disease course is generally idle, prolonged medical treatment guidelines are for
      antibiotic treatment, prescribed accordingly following appropriately obtained nasal cultures,
      lasting weeks with or without additional topical or oral steroid treatment. While FESS
      success rate is a general notion, a failure rate of primary FESS is as high as 2-24%2, with a
      Cochrane review even suggesting that FESS though a safe procedure is of no benefit more than
      medical management.

      With that in mind as we address the failed FESS, new bacteria emerge. The new bacteria in CRS
      are Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (36%), followed by
      Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Streptococcus viridans (8.3%), Corynebacterium (4.6%), and
      anaerobes (6.4%).

      Patients not relieved by primary FESS demonstrate a significant rise in Pseudomonas and MRSA
      bacteria positive cultures. Moreover surgical success for patients with Staphylococcus aureus
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive cultures is usually reduced.

      Bacterial killing, by usage of light-activated agents such as Indocyanine Green (ICG) with
      exposure to the specific wavelength, eventually produces bacterial killing. Mechanisms
      primarily involved are production of reactive oxygen species (i.e. singlet oxygen and free
      radicals) which can then kill bacteria. ICG by itself does not have any bacterial killing
      effect.

      Low level laser therapy (LLLT) was shown to be effective as a bactericidal by single and
      multiple wave exposures.

      The study purpose is to treat CRS with an alternative to antibiotics, thus sparing volunteers
      from prolonged antibiotics use and its possible side effects, not to mention the cost and
      growth of resistant bacteria. We believe that by combining ICG with light or even by light
      alone we can produce you a beneficial effect. Although this has been shown to kill bacteria
      in lab or animal studies it is still investigational for humans. The study will have two
      arms: ICG + laser and laser only arm. ICG will be applied locally in the nasal passage
      (internally) followed by laser activation with a power setting of 6W. The laser will be
      activated with a diffuser mode meaning light of a specific known wavelength will be delivered
      evenly in the nasal cavity and not as a beam. Laser only treatment plan will be the same only
      without ICG. Volunteers will be assigned to one of the groups randomly meaning you have a 50%
      chance of enrolling to each treatment group. Volunteers will not know to which group. Weekly
      visits with a total of three visits will follow. With each visit Volunteers will receive
      additional treatment as the initial treatment was and a nasal culture will be taken.
      Volunteers will have to fill a questionnaire with each visit.

      A prospective randomized trial that will be performed over the period of 1 year or until 20
      patients in each arm meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. One arm will be treated
      with a NIR laser (ARC Lasers Gmbh, Germany) alone and another arm will have an ICG+ NIR laser
      treatment.

      FDA approved NIR lasers in the range of 810- 980nm. FDA approved ICG (Akorn, Buffalo Grove,
      IL) applied locally total application will not exceed 2.5 mg Randomization method: first five
      volunteers will start the ICG+ laser followed by five from only laser treatment group. This
      will be followed by allocating one volunteer to each study arm alternatively.

      Data to be collected: demographical data including age and gender, approximate duration of
      symptoms, culture results, SNOT 20 (QOL questionnaire) score.

      Urine test will be done to rule out pregnancy prior to study enrollment. Treatment: ICG arm-
      will be defined as local application on a pledget soaked with ICG with a concentration of
      200µg, upon removal of the pledget a NIR diode laser set at 6W with light emittance
      introduced intranasally with a 30mm diffuser fiber capable of radiating light
      circumferentially allowing the light energy to reach all treatable areas. Laser will be
      activated for 180 seconds. Assuming an approximate radius of the nasal cavity is 3mm, energy
      density will be around 200J/cm². Treatment will be repeated twice, 5-7 day apart. Cultures
      will be collected at the end of all treatments.

      Non-ICG arm: same as above but without ICG appliance. Follow up will consist of an office
      visit upon end of treatment with an additional visit scheduled two weeks later Protective
      equipment: specifically designed eye goggles, draping preventing clothes stains from the dye
