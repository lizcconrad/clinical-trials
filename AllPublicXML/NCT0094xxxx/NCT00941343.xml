      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the sexual function of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia patients

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the association between Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms severity and sexual
           disorders

        -  To compare the sexual function, urinary symptoms and Quality of Life of Benign Prostatic
           Hyperplasia patients on XATRAL 10mg OD among the different regions

        -  To correlate the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire(MSHQ) and 5-item version of the
           International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5)

        -  To assess the onset of action of XATRAL 10mg OD

        -  To assess the peak urinary flow rate

        -  To assess the safety and the tolerability of XATRAL 10mg OD
