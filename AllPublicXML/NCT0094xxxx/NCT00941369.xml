      Primary Objective:

      To investigate the impact of insulin glargine versus Neutral Protamine Hagedorn basal insulin
      on a composite diabetes related quality of life score (DRQoL).

      Secondary Objective:

      A comparison of combination therapy with insulin glargine versus Neutral Protamine Hagedorn
      basal insulin from baseline to endpoint in terms of:

        -  Glycaemic parameters: 7 blood glucose profiles

        -  Incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia as well as confirmed severe hypoglycemia

        -  Change in lipid status
