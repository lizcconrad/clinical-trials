  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine if the use of Guided Relaxation
      Training (GRT) during cancer treatment in individuals with newly diagnosed breast cancer
      increases their ability to cope as measured by the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES) and
      reduces their perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

      This is a study of self-reported stress in individuals with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
      Subjects will be randomized to either the standard of care (SOC) arm or the intervention arm.
      The principle investigators will be blinded to the arm assignment. The intervention utilized
      will be six weekly on-site GRT sessions. In addition, subjects will be provided with a CD
      utilizing a standardized GRT script and music for home use twice daily during the study
      period. During the intervention period, they will also be provided with a diary and required
      to keep a record of date and time of CD utilization at home. The subjects will also be
      required to record their stress level before and after each of the two home sessions. The
      sessions must be at least 4 hours apart.

      The SOC arm will consist of an education session with the nurse or nurse practitioner and
      supportive care / symptom management as needed. This group will also be required to keep a
      daily diary in which they record their stress levels twice daily, at intervals separated by
      at least 4 hours.

    <description>Eligible subjects who have been randomized to the intervention arm will be scheduled for GRT introduction and training with a research staff member. The GRT sessions will consist of six weekly on-site sessions in which the subject is provided instructions and then allowed to listen to the GRT CD. Subjects will be instructed to conduct independent GRT sessions at home, twice daily, at least four hours apart, for the duration of the study. Subjects will also be instructed that on the days of one-on-one sessions with a research staff member at TCCC, that they will only be required to perform the independent session once at home.
Subjects will be provided with a diary to record the date and time of each independent GRT session performed at home. Subjects will be instructed to bring their completed diary with them at each subsequent visit.</description>

    <description>Eligible subjects who are randomized to the SOC arm will not receive the GRT sessions. During the six week treatment phase, these subjects will only receive SOC provided to all subjects newly diagnosed with breast cancer at TCCC. This consists of an education session with the nurse or nurse practitioner. In addition, they will also be provided with supportive care and symptom management as needed. This arm will also be provided with a diary to record their stress level at least twice daily.</description>
