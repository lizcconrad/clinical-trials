      Objectives:

      This study will help to establish the feasibility of a new smoking cessation and prevention
      intervention including two new modules addressing alcohol use and depression. In addition, we
      will demonstrate the feasibility of a smoking prevention website. Both cessation and
      prevention programs will be tailored to the needs of culturally diverse urban (University of
      Houston) and rural (Texas A&amp;M) university campuses.

      Nonsmokers:

      Orientation:

      You will also attend a 1-hour orientation meeting about the study. The study staff will give
      a PowerPoint presentation that describes all study procedures and study participant
      responsibilities in detail. You will have a chance to ask the research staff questions at the
      meeting.

      Full Survey and Counselor Visit:

      Within about 2 weeks of the orientation meeting, you will be scheduled for a visit with a
      research study counselor. During the visit, you will complete a 30-minute survey on-line and
      then discuss the results with the counselor. The survey asks about health-related attitudes
      and behaviors such as your mood, sleep habits, alcohol and drug use, smoking and exercise
      habits. You will also have a saliva sample collected to check your smoking status. To collect
      a saliva sample, you will spit into a small plastic container. The entire visit should last
      about 1 hour.

      Email Messages:

      After the counselor visit, you will be emailed messages with information and links about the
      health risks of smoking, the environmental and financial impact of smoking, and the
      importance of healthy behaviors, such as stress and weight management. You will receive these
      messages every week for up to 3 months (up to 12 messages total). You will also receive up to
      3 email reminders before your final follow up telephone call with the date and time of the
      call.

      Telephone Calls:

      At the end of the study (2 to 3 months after your first visit), you will receive a telephone
      call from research staff during which you will answer some of the survey questions from the
      first survey. You will also be asked questions about how you liked the website, how easy it
      was to use and how helpful it was to you. This call should last about 1 hour. You will
      receive an phone call reminder before your final follow-up telephone call with the date and
      time of the call.

      Length of Study:

      You may be on the study for up to 5 months.

      This is an investigational study. The use of this program to help prevent smoking is
      investigational.

      Up to 200 people will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 100 participants will take
      part in the &quot;nonsmokers&quot; part of this multicenter study. Up to 50 will be enrolled at the
      University of Houston Central Campus and up to 50 will be enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University.
      Up to 50 smokers will also be enrolled at each campus.

      Smokers:

      Orientation:

      You will also attend a 1-hour orientation meeting about the study. The study staff will give
      a PowerPoint presentation that describes all study procedures and study participant
      responsibilities in detail. You will have a chance to ask the research staff questions at the
      meeting.

      Study Visit:

      You will have one in person study visit with a research study counselor.

      Within about 2 weeks of the orientation meeting, you will be scheduled for a visit with a
      research study counselor. During the visit, you will complete a 30-minute survey on-line and
      then discuss the results with the counselor. The survey asks about health-related attitudes
      and behaviors such as your mood, sleep habits, alcohol and drug use, smoking and exercise
      habits. This visit should take about 1 hour.

      You will also be asked to perform the following tests:

        -  You will have a lung function test to learn how well your lungs work. To perform a lung
           function test, you will take a deep breath and blow into a mouthpiece that is connected
           to a device that records how much air your lungs can hold and shows how much force you
           use when breathing out.

        -  Your carbon monoxide levels will be checked. You will breathe gently into a different
           machine that records how much carbon monoxide is in your lungs.

        -  The study staff will discuss the results of the lung function test and the carbon
           monoxide test with you.

        -  You will have a saliva sample collected to check your smoking status. To collect a
           saliva sample, you will spit into a small plastic container.

        -  You will also have an interview about your tobacco use. You will be asked how much
           tobacco you use, about any time(s) you have tried to quit, how ready you are to quit,
           and how dependent you are on nicotine. You will also be asked about your overall mood
           and how often you use alcohol.

        -  You will speak with a member of the study about how to quit smoking and your personal
           goals for quitting.

        -  The study staff will give you instructions on how to get Nicorette Mini-Lozenges from
           the on-campus pharmacy. The on-campus pharmacy will provide detailed instruction on how
           to use the lozenges.

        -  The study staff will also tell you about a website designed for this study. The website
           will have helpful tips and information on quitting smoking. A blog will also be
           available where you can post comments and start discussions. The study staff will teach
           you how to access and use the study website, blog and forum.

      Internet Surveys:

      In between the in-person study visit and the final follow up telephone call, you will be
      asked to complete up to 3 surveys on the Internet. The surveys will have questions based on
      your goals for quitting smoking, your responses from the tobacco use interview, and your
      answers from previous surveys. The surveys should take about 20 minutes to complete.

      After you complete the first Internet survey, you will receive a personalized newsletter on
      the study website based on the answers from your surveys, your lung tests, and the tobacco
      use interviews. You will be able to access and print the newsletter from the website.

      Email messages:

      You will receive an email to remind you to take your next on-line survey. You will also
      receive up to 3 email reminders before your final follow-up telephone call with the date and
      time of the call.

      Telephone Calls:

      At the end of the study (2 to 3 months after your first visit), you will receive a telephone
      call from research staff during which you will answer some of the survey questions from the
      first survey. You will also be asked questions about how you liked the website, how easy it
      was to use and how helpful it was to you. This call should last about 1 hour. You will
      receive an phone call reminder before your final follow up telephone call with the date and
      time of the call.

      Length of Study:

      You may be on study for up to 5 months.

      This is an investigational study. The use of this program to help quit smoking is
      investigational.

      Up to 200 people will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 100 participants will take
      part in the &quot;smokers&quot; part of this multicenter study. Up to 50 will be enrolled at the
      University of Houston Central Campus and up to 50 will be enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University.
      Up to 50 nonsmokers will also be enrolled at each campus.
