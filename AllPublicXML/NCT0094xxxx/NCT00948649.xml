  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to validate an experimental paradigm to assess medication
      effects on smoking relapse following a brief (3-day) monitored period of smoking abstinence
      and a programmed cigarette lapse.

      The proposed human experiment will test the validity of a novel paradigm that may provide a
      method for distinguishing compounds that are likely to have efficacy from those that are not,
      before they are tested in more costly large-scale clinical trials. Specifically, in a
      within-subject (cross-over) behavioral pharmacology investigation of 60 smokers, we will test
      the effects of varenicline versus placebo on smoking behavior in the natural environment
      following a 3-day period of monitored abstinence and a programmed cigarette lapse. A positive
      signal for varenicline effects in this study would provide support for the sensitivity of the
      paradigm. In addition, following completion of all assessments, participants will be followed
      in a 13-week open-label varenicline smoking cessation trial to determine whether response to
      varenicline in the laboratory study predicts clinical response in the open-label trial.
