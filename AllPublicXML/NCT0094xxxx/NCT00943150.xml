    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate healing of incisions made with the PEAK
      PlasmaBlade 4.0 compared to scalpel and traditional electrosurgery (Bovie); to monitor and
      record key post-operative metrics following abdominoplasty with the PEAK PlasmaBlade 4.0
      versus current standard of care (SOC); and to evaluate performance metrics of the PEAK
      PlasmaBlade 4.0 during abdominoplasty.

      Abdominoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure performed to correct abdominal elastosis with
      skin and fat redundancy. During the procedure, a scalpel and traditional electrosurgical
      device are used to cut away this excess skin and fat from the abdomen and the underlying
      muscles are tightened together with sutures.

      The PEAK PlasmaBlade™ uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy to enable precision cutting and
      coagulating at the point of application, without the thermal damage to surrounding tissues
      that is normally seen with traditional electrosurgery. The PlasmaBlade has received FDA
      clearance for use in plastic, general, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery, and has
      demonstrated significantly reduced serous drainage in tissue reduction surgeries, like
      abdominoplasty.

      A total of twenty (20) human subjects were recruited from the local community against
      standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, each patient underwent placement of
      three sets of full-thickness comparison incisions in their abdominal skin with a standard
      scalpel, PlasmaBlade, and traditional electrosurgery at six (6) and three (3) weeks prior to
      abdominoplasty, and on the day of surgery under general anesthesia. Subjects were then
      randomized to undergo abdominoplasty with the PlasmaBlade or the SOC (scalpel and traditional
      electrosurgery). Following abdominoplasty, harvested healed incisions were submitted for
      histological analysis and burst strength testing and additional data were recorded in the 10
      day post-operative period.
