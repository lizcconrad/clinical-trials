          3. In good health as determined by:

               -  Medical history;

               -  Physical examination;

               -  Clinical judgment of the investigator. Informed consent must be obtained for all
                  the subjects before enrollment into the study after the nature of the study has
                  been explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are not to be enrolled into the study if at least one of the following criteria is
        fulfilled:

             including but not limited to:

               -  Cancer, except for localized skin cancer;

               -  Advanced congestive heart failure;

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);

               -  Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis);

               -  Acute or progressive hepatic disease;

               -  Acute or progressive renal disease;

               -  Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder;

               -  Severe Asthma.

          2. History of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction following a
             vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine (e.g., to
             ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral protein neomycin or
             polymyxin).

          3. Known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing) impairment/alteration of immune
             function (excluding that normally associated with advanced age) resulting for example
             from:

               -  Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any parental or oral cortical steroid or
                  cancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy) within the past 60 days and for the full length
                  of the study;

               -  Receipt of immunostimulants;

               -  Receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma
                  derivatives within the past 3 months and for the full length of the study.

               -  Suspected or known HIV infection or HIV-related disease.

          4. Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          5. They have a bleeding diathesis or conditions associated with prolonged bleeding time
             that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the safety of the subject;

          6. Women who are pregnant or woman of childbearing potential unwilling to practice
             acceptable contraception for the duration of the study (21 days). Female who pregnant
             of nursing (breastfeeding) mothers of females of childbearing age who do not plan to
             use acceptable birth control measures, for the duration of the study. Adequate
             contraception is defined as hormonal (oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant,
             cervical ring), barrier (condom or diaphragm), intrauterine device (IUD) or monogamous
             relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 6 months or more
             prior to the subject's study entry.

          7. Influenza vaccination or laboratory confirmed influenza within the last 6 months and
             more than one influenza vaccination within the past 12 months.

          8. Within the past 4 weeks they have received:

               -  Another vaccine;

               -  Any investigational agent.

          9. Any acute or chronic infection requiring systemic antibiotic treatment or antiviral
             therapy within the last 7 days.

         10. They have experienced fever (i.e., axillary temperature ≥ 38°C) within the last 3
             days.

         11. Simultaneous participation in another clinical study.

         12. Any condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, might prevent the subject
             from participation or interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.

         13. Severely obese with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35.

         14. Site personnel involved in evaluation of safety and their immediate relatives are
             excluded from participation.
