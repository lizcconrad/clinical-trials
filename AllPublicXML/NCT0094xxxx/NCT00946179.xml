      This study is in support of the annual application for the variation of the vaccine strains
      for a marketing authorization.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of the influenza vaccine (split
           virion, inactivated) Northern Hemisphere (NH) 2009-2010 formulation in two adult groups,
           aged 18 to 60 years and aged 61 years or older.

        -  To describe the safety of the influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) NH 2009-2010
           formulation in both adult groups.
