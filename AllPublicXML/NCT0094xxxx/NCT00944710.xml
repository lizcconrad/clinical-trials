    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adding a plano lens to weekend
      atropine after visual acuity has stabilized with weekend atropine but amblyopia is still
      present. Children ages 3 to &lt;8 years with visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/400 in the amblyopic
      eye will be enrolled in a run-in phase with weekend atropine until no improvement, followed
      by randomization of eligible patients to weekend atropine treatment with a plano lens over
      the sound eye versus without a plano lens over the sound eye. The primary objective is to
      determine if adding a plano lens to weekend atropine will improve visual acuity in patients
      with amblyopia still present after visual acuity has stabilized with initial treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular visual impairment in both children and young
      and middle-aged adults. Both patching and atropine are accepted treatment modalities for the
      management of moderate amblyopia in children.1 Many practitioners prescribe weekend atropine
      as initial therapy for amblyopia. However, many children fail to achieve normal visual acuity
      in the amblyopic eye after treatment with this regimen. In a randomized trial conducted by
      PEDIG comparing atropine regimens, 58 of 83 patients with moderate amblyopia (70%) had
      amblyopic eye visual acuity of 20/32 or worse after 4 months of treatment with weekend
      atropine.2 In another PEDIG randomized trial comparing atropine with a plano lens versus
      without a plano lens for initial treatment of amblyopia, 60 of 84 patients with moderate
      amblyopia (71%) had amblyopic eye visual acuity of 20/32 or worse after 16 weeks of treatment
      with weekend atropine.3 When improvement stops after initial therapy and amblyopia is still
      present, treatment options include increasing the dosage of current treatment, switching to
      another treatment, maintaining the same treatment and dosage, or combining treatments. Many
      clinicians will add a plano lens over the sound eye to atropine treatment, in part because
      families using atropine have become comfortable with its use. This option is limited to
      children with hypermetropia in the sound eye. However, it is unknown whether adding a plano
      lens over the sound eye will improve amblyopic eye visual acuity more than continuing
      atropine alone in patients who have shown no improvement after initial treatment with
      atropine. In a PEDIG randomized trial comparing patching to atropine for initial treatment of
      amblyopia, a plano lens was prescribed for the sound eye for 55 patients who had not improved
      to 20/30 or at least 3 lines after 4 months of daily atropine use.1, 4 Their mean acuity
      improvement prior to using the plano lens was 1.0 line, compared with 1.6 lines after
      prescribing the plano lens. We are unaware of any reports of the response of treatment of
      amblyopia still present after initial treatment with weekend atropine.

    <measure>Distribution of 10-week Amblyopic-Eye Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The masked 10-week amblyopic eye visual acuity scores were tabulated for both treatment groups, and included data from 10-week visual acuity exams completed between 8 to 15 weeks (inclusive) with no imputation for missing data.
The primary outcome analysis followed the &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; principle. Therefore, data from randomized participants were included in the analysis regardless of whether the assigned treatment was actually received or whether they deviated from treatment against protocol. In addition, randomized participants who were found to be ineligible upon subsequent review of enrollment data were included in the primary outcome analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between November 2009 and August 2013, 73 participants from 20 sites were randomly assigned to either augmenting weekend atropine by changing the lens over the fellow eye to plano (n=33) or continuing with weekend atropine with best spectacle correction (n=40).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to being considered for the randomized trial, participants who had not completed at least 12 weeks of atropine were enrolled into a run-in phase and treated with weekend atropine 1% ophthalmic solution and spectacles based upon a recent cycloplegic refraction, with follow up every 6 weeks until no improvement</pre_assignment_details>

The primary outcome analysis followed the &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; principle. Therefore, data from randomized participants were included in the analysis regardless of whether the assigned treatment was actually received or whether they deviated from treatment against protocol. In addition, randomized participants who were found to be ineligible upon subsequent review of enrollment data were included in the primary outcome analysis.</description>

        <description>The proportion of participants who achieved 20/25 or better visual acuity since randomization was computed at the 10-week outcome.
The secondary outcome analysis was a treatment group comparison of the proportion of participants whose 10-week masked amblyopic eye visual acuity was 20/25 or better since randomization. The analysis included data from 10-week visual acuity exams completed between 8 to 15 weeks (inclusive) according to the principles specified in the primary outcome analysis.</description>

The secondary outcome analysis was a treatment group comparison of the proportion of participants whose 10-week masked amblyopic eye visual acuity improved at least 2 logMAR lines since randomization using logistic regression, adjusting for visual acuity at randomization.

        <description>The primary outcome analysis was a treatment group comparison of the masked 10-week amblyopic eye visual acuity using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, adjusting for visual acuity at randomization. The analysis included data from 10-week visual acuity exams completed between 8 to 15 weeks (inclusive) with no imputation for missing data.
The primary outcome analysis followed the &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; principle. Therefore, data from randomized participants were included in the analysis regardless of whether the assigned treatment was actually received or whether they deviated from treatment against protocol. In addition, randomized participants who were found to be ineligible upon subsequent review of enrollment data were included in the primary outcome analysis.</description>

          <description>Participants in both groups who have improved by one or more lines from randomization to the 10-week outcome exam will continue in the study and visits will occur every 10 weeks until no improvement of one or more lines from the previous visit. The mean change in amblyopic eye visual acuity since randomization was computed for both treatment groups based on the visit of best post-randomization visual acuity (10 weeks or later) using the initial visual acuity score (if a retest was obtained.)</description>
