  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a long term follow on study to assess the continued long term safety and efficacy of
      lomitapide in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase III open label clinical trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety
      of lomitapide at the maximum tolerated dose (for each patient) established during the
      clinical trial 733-005/UP1002. Subjects completing the 78-week treatment period in study
      733-005/UP1002 who have not met any of the stopping criteria will be eligible to participate
      in 733-012. The treatment period continued until a decision was made by the local competent
      authority regarding marketing authorization. Lomitapide will be given orally once daily.
      Patient specific doses will be carried forward from 733-005/UP1002, but will not exceed the
      maximum tolerated dose the patient received during 733-005 /UP1002. The maximum dose for any
      patient was 80 mg/day. There was no reference therapy in this trial. The effects of the study
      drug were compared to baseline data (from 733-005/UP1002). Concomitant lipid-lowering therapy
      including plasmapheresis or LDL apheresis is permitted.

      Note that hereafter, Week 0 in Study 733-005/UP1002 will be referred to as Baseline and Week
      48 in Study AEGR-733-012 will be referred to as Week 126 (of overall treatment).

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The CTAs generally envision a multisite publication, with the PI’s right to publish individually if the pooled publication does not occur within 12 months of study completion. Sponsor has a 45 to 60 day review/approval period to request deletion of confidential information or to request limited deferral to protect its proprietary technology. In one case, the publication provision is more general, specifying that the Sponsor and clinical site will agree on the manner/terms of publication.</restrictive_agreement>
