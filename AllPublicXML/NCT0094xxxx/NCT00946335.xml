  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-888 when given in
      combination with temozolomide in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory CNS
      tumors. ABT-888 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving ABT-888 together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with temozolomide
      in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      II. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 and PARP inhibition in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to recommend a Phase 2 dose of ABT-888 in combination
      with temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      III. To describe the toxicities of the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide in children
      with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) prior to and following ABT-888 administration.

      II. To assess PARP expression and/or activity in tumor tissue obtained at either initial
      diagnosis or relapse.

      III. To determine expression and/or activity of DNA repair pathways, including MGMT and
      mismatch repair, in tumor tissues, when available.

      IV. To document, within the confines of this phase 1 trial, radiographic tumor response to
      ABT-888 and temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ABT-888.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 13-26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetics and further laboratory analysis.
