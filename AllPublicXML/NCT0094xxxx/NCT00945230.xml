      The study examines and illustrates the utility of utilizing actigraphic measurements to
      assess treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actigraphic measurements, repeated verbal fluency and multi-symptom operationally defined
      observations will be recorded for an 11 to 12 day baseline period and continued following
      neurosurgical tumor resection until a repeat MRI is completed three months after the
      procedure.

    <description>Actigraphic measurements that will be obtained by attaching the actigraphic watch device to the individual's non-dominant wrist and operationally defined repeated observational measurements. All measurements will continue through a baseline period and continue through the identified post surgical period. Actigraphic measurements will occur every 30 seconds with brief periods of non-measurement during the actual neurosurgical procedure and periods when the actigraphic device has reached storage capacity (approximately every 22 days) when data is retrieved and the device prepared resume measurements.</description>
