      Project Overview:

      Poor hypertension control has dire consequences for the African-American population who
      suffer greater death and disability from heart disease, stroke, and renal failure than
      whites. To reduce these health disparities it is critical to promote of a healthy lifestyle
      in regard to diet, exercise, adherence to medications, as well as other behaviors. However,
      physicians usually fail to address lifestyle behaviors in the context of the harried patient
      visit. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the investigators could reduce
      cardiovascular risk by providing additional support to persons with poorly controlled
      hypertension through phone calls from trained peer patients and visits to an office support
      staff member.

      Study Design:

      A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 280 African-American primary care patients
      aged 40-75 with poorly controlled hypertension (HTN). The intervention group receives a
      practice-based team intervention that combines peer coach with office staff (i.e., medical
      assistant or licensed practice nurse) visits to address lifestyle challenges. Both
      intervention and control groups receive informational materials and healthy soul food recipes
      from the American Heart Association. The 6 month intervention alternates monthly phone calls
      from peer coaches about lifestyle behavioral changes with office-based visits with the
      support staff member during which patients review and discuss low literacy slide shows about
      healthy behaviors as well as examine their personal cardiovascular risk profile.
