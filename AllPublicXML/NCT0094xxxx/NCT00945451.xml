      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less
      damage to normal tissue. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery after docetaxel and cisplatin may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of stereotactic
      radiosurgery when given after docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiation therapy and to see how well
      it works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with
           locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
           (Phase I)

        -  Assess the response rate (complete and partial response) in these patients by RECIST
           criteria. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients by QLQ-C30 v3. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the overall and disease-free survival of these patients. (Phase II)

        -  Assess progression-free survival of these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose escalation study of stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV and cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, 43, 50, 57, and 64 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 43, patients
      undergo concurrent radiotherapy to the mediastinum 5 days a week. Beginning 2-3 weeks after
      chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on days 1, 3, and 5.

      Quality of life is assessed by the QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire at baseline, after radiosurgery,
      and at 6 and 12 months after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
