  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain imaging tests are routinely used to detect the presence of a brain tumor or to evaluate
      the response to treatment. Sometimes the images obtained are not specific and the only way to
      establish a diagnosis is by obtaining a tissue sample. The hypotheses of the study is to
      determine if multimodal MR technique will provide tissue signatures that differentiate
      between tumor progression and treatment related necrosis in high grade glioma patients.
