    <textblock>
      Lumbar puncture is one of the most common painful procedures performed on neonates in the
      Emergency Department (ED). The investigators will study in a randomized controlled trial, the
      efficacy of intravenous administration of a single dose of Midazolam in reducing pain and
      anxiety in neonates undergoing lumbar puncture in the ED, as well as the rate of adverse
      sedation reactions. The investigators hypothesize that compared with placebo, single dose
      Midazolam would significantly decrease pain and anxiety and will have low rate of adverse
      reactions.
