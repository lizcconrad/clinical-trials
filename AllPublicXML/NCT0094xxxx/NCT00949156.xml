  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the preliminary anatomical and histological study, the membranous structures of the
      sellar region was considered to be closely related with the growth pattern of
      Craniopharyngiomas(CP). By combined considering of the tumor-membrane relationship, this
      project was trying to classify the CP through retrospectively summarizing the pre- and
      postoperative imaging (MRI and CT), the intrasurgical findings, and the endocrine data of 198
      CPs with primary surgery in our hospital (since 1997 until now). As a result, a distinct and
      systematic CP classification was proposed. The possible originate site, surgical skills and
      postoperative treatment of all the subtype tumors were discussed and analyzed to provide a
      normalized surgical treatment for this kind of tumor. Then in the prospective cohort, the
      anticipated 100 CP patients will accept the normalized surgical treatment. And by the long
      term follow up, the postsurgical quantity of life (QOL) of patients was evaluated with aspect
      in cognition, circadian rhythm, endocrine, Water-Electrolyte and body weight, et al. By
      comparing with the long-term results of the retrospective cohort, the totally follow up data
      was statistically analyzed to assess the rationality of this standard treatment of CP.

    <description>The 198 cases of CP with primary surgery in our hospital (since July, 1997 until now) were divided into three topographical groups based on the pre-operative MRI, intraoperative findings and the tumor-membrane relationship. The presurgical manifestation, the different surgical approach, intraoperative techniques, and postoperative complication were described and analyzed to establish a normalized surgical treatment of individual CP patient, which has the highest rate of the totally tumoral resection and the lowest rate of the hypothalamic injury.</description>

    <description>The anticipated 40 cases of CP were surgical treated by our standard procedure, which is recruited in the prospective cohort. With the long-term follow up, QOL including the cognition, circadian rhythm, endocrine, Water-Electrolyte, and body weight et al were evaluated to assess the rationality of the treatment. Then according to the results, the surgical treatment was modified, and the endocrinic substitution therapy was also been developed.</description>

        The clinical data of 198 patients who underwent primary microsurgery for craniopharyngiomas
        at our institute since July, 1997 until now was analysed retrospectively. The anticipated
        40 CP patients in the following two years were recurited in the prospective cohort, who
        will be surgical treated according to the standard process.
