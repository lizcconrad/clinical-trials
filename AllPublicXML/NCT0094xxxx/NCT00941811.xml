  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurance and clinical course of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced lesions is largely
      determined by the nature of the cellular immune defense generated. Even tough both genital
      warts and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) are HPV-associated genital lesions they
      differ in their risk of malignant progression. Imiquimod (IMQ) is a topically applied
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist that has been approved for the treatment of superficial
      (pre-) carcinomas of the skin (basal cell carcinomas, actinic keratosis) and HPV-associated
      lesions (genital warts). It acts by activation of the immune system exerting anti-tumor and
      anti-viral properties. The aim of the study is to evaluate the mechanisms of IMQ treatment
      and to analyze the differences in HPV-affected and non affected tissue at cellular and
      molecular level as determined by immunofluorescence stainings and real time PCR,
      respectively.
