      The purpose of this study is to determine if MDX-1203 is safe for the treatment of renal cell
      carcinoma or non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, multidose study of MDX-1203, a fully human
      monoclonal antibody drug conjugate targeting the CD70 transmembrane cell-surface protein
      which is highly expressed in ccRCC and B-NHL. MDX-1203 is composed of a human anti-CD70
      monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a prodrug form of a cytotoxic deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) minor-groove binding agent (MGBA).

      The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to 17 cycles or
      2 years), and Follow-up (up to 6 months).

          -  Criteria specific to each tumor type:

               -  For Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): advanced or recurrent disease. Must
                  have failed at least 1 prior systemic therapy

               -  For B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL): Must have failed at least 1 prior
                  systemic therapy
