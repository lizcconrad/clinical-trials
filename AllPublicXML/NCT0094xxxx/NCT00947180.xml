      This study has been completed. The following is a brief description of the aims, methods, and
      results of the study:

      Previous small studies suggest that chronic proctalgia (chronic recurring pain in the anal
      canal or rectum), which is also called levator ani syndrome, can be treated with biofeedback
      to teach relaxation of pelvic floor muscles, or electrogalvanic stimulation (electrical
      stimulation to relax muscles), or massage of pelvic floor muscles. The aim of this study was
      to compare the effectiveness of these three treatments, to determine how they work
      physiologically, and to identify which patients are most likely to benefit.

      Methods: Subjects had to meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic proctalgia and to report
      pain at least once a week. They had to also be free of medical or psychiatric disorders that
      could explain their chronic proctalgia. Patients qualified to enter the study were separated
      into two groups based on whether they reported tenderness when the examining physician
      pressed on the levator ani muscles of the pelvic floor. All 157 patients who were enrolled
      received 9 sessions of psychological counseling plus biofeedback or electrogalvanic
      stimulation or massage. The results of treatment were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
      after the end of treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Recurring episodes of pain or aching in the anal canal or rectum for at
        least 12 weeks in the previous year. Episodes last at least 20 minutes. Pain must occur at
        least weekly during a 4-week run-in.

        Exclusion Criteria: Other medical or psychiatric diagnoses that could explain recurring
        rectal pain. Daily use of psychotropic medications. Meets diagnostic criteria for irritable
        bowel syndrome or functional constipation. Screening studies included physical examination
        by a gastroenterologist, colonoscopy, pelvic ultrasound, and surgical consult in all
        patients and referral to a gynecologist or urologist if indicated by history.
