  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether an adaptation of cyclosporine (CsA) dose
      according to a longitudinal calcineurin (CN) activity monitoring would prevent the onset of
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous studies established a correlation between increased calcineurin (CN) activity
      and the risk of developing severe acute GVHD in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients
      receiving immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors.

      This proof-of-concept trial is aiming at evaluating CALCIneurin activity as a monitoring
      biomarker of efficacy of cyCLOsporine - (CALCICLO) - for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD. Our
      aim is to assess whether a longitudinal monitoring of CN activity would permit to adapt and
      optimize the dose of CsA that would prevent the onset of severe acute GVHD, yet still
      maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile.

    <description>The protocol of the CALCICLO trial consisted in a CsA dose adaptation during the first 100 days following transplantation. This dose adaptation was performed according to both residual CsA blood and CN activity levels only if the safety of vital functions - especially renal, liver, and neurological - was preserved as assessed by clinical evaluations and laboratory analyses such as creatinine clearance higher than 40 ml/min, serum bilirubin lower than 40 µM and absence of neurological signs. According to the protocol, CsA blood levels and CN activity were measured concomitantly at least once a week from day 0 to day 15, twice a week from day 16 to day 35 and then once a week until day 100.</description>
