      The primary purpose of this experimental therapy is to treat, with the aid of bacteriophages,
      patients with non-healing postoperative wounds or bone, upper respiratory tract, genital or
      urinary tract infections in whom extensive antibiotic therapy failed or the use of the
      targeted drug is contraindicated.

      Bacterial infections of different tissues and organs that prove incurable by antibiotics are
      a serious clinical problem. Bacteriophages (phages) are bacterial viruses which attack,
      multiply within, and then destroy bacteria. They can efficiently destroy bacteria which have
      acquired resistance to antibiotics and which cause life-threatening infections. The method of
      treating bacterial infections using phages has been known since the beginning of the 20th
      century. This experimental treatment enables the use of phage preparations under the rules of
      a therapeutic experiment (on the basis of the respective Polish regulations) in cases where
      no effective available therapy exists or the use of the targeted drug is contraindicated. It
      is not a research study.

      The bacteriophage preparations which are used in the treatment procedures contain phages from
      the Bacteriophage Collection of the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the
      Polish Academy of Sciences in Wrocław. For each patient only specific formulations of single
      phage or a phage mixture that are active against the pathogenic bacterial strain or strains
      isolated from the patient are used for the treatment.The isolation of live bacterial pathogen
      from the patient is necessary to carry out a phage-typing procedure to determine if the
      preparation of an active formulation is possible which is a prerequisite for receiving the
      treatment.

             and/or urinary tract, digestive tract, middle ear, sinuses, tonsils, upper and lower
             respiratory tract, or a state in which a targeted antibiotic therapy is impossible to
             carry out due to other medical reasons.

          -  A putative pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Escherichia,

             Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, or Morganella present in
             the site of the said infection as confirmed by the result of microbiological culture.

          -  Ineffective antibiotic therapy of said infection and/or antibiogram-confirmed
             multidrug resistance of a putative pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus,
             Enterococcus, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella,
             Salmonella, Serratia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter,
             Burkholderia, or Morganella.

          -  The presence in the Bacteriophage Collection of the Institute of Immunology and
             Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences of a phage able to lyse a
             bacterial strain cultured from a patient in the Bacteriophage Collection of the
             Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences
             (positive result of a phage-typing procedure).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, allergy to food or animal protein, or advanced hepatic
             insufficiency when it is impossible to apply the phage preparation using other route
             than oral.

          -  Allergy to components of phage preparations.

          -  A health condition which does not allow conducting the experimental therapy in the
             opinion of the qualifying physician.
