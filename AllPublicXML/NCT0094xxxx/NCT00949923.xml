  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognostic factors for breast cancer beyond stage at diagnosis and tumor characteristics have
      not been well studied. Of special interest are lifestyle factors that can be modified by
      women after diagnosis to increase disease-free survival. Green tea is rich in polyphenols
      consisting primarily of epicatechins, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and
      epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The investigators hypothesize that there will be a reduction
      in proliferation and/or an increase in apoptosis in association with short-term EGCG
      treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal (at least 2 years since last menstrual period) or age 55 or older if
             prior hysterectomy

          -  Non-current (not with past 6 months) user of menopausal hormones

          -  Mammographic abnormality consistent with any type of incident breast cancer
             necessitating a diagnostic biopsy (BIRAD IV(b), (c) or V) will be sufficient to draw
             baseline LFT and complete screening questionnaire. Unless the biopsy confirms incident
             breast cancer, such subjects will not be included in further research interventions
             and they will not serve as EGCG treated or control subjects.

          -  Diagnosed with incident breast cancer on the diagnostic biopsy is required for
             inclusion in the EGCG or control treatment groups.

          -  Non-green tea drinker (less than monthly) - this criteria does not apply to black tea
             or herbal tea

          -  Provided written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Green tea drinker (once per month or more)

          -  History of breast cancer or other cancer including a prior diagnosis of any type of
             incident breast cancer.

          -  Known allergy to tea

          -  Abnormal liver enzymes (plus or minus 10% of the normal ranges).
