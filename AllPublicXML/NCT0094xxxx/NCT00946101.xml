    <measure>Number of Participants With Fever Post Dose 1 (Days 1-8), Defined as an Axillary Temperature ≥ 101°F (38.3°C).</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1- 8</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with fever between the two treatment groups was compared based on the upper limit of the two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals for the rate difference (Vaccine minus Placebo). The upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals was evaluated against the prespecified equivalence criterion of 10% which corresponded to the following hypotheses: H0 (null): rate difference ≥ 10%, HA (alternative): rate difference &lt; 10%.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study participation began once written informed consent was obtained. The first and last dates of informed consent were 03 Aug 2009 and 19 Aug 2009. Once informed consent was obtained, a subject identification number was assigned using an interactive voice response system, and screening evaluations began to assess study eligibility.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of study monovalent vaccine or placebo by intranasal spray; the doses were administered approximately 28 days apart, on Days 1 and 29.</pre_assignment_details>

Examples of events not considered NOCDs were mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital anomaly present at study entry, or acute illness (eg, otitis media, bronchitis).</description>
