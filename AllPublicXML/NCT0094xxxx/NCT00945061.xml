      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. It is not yet known whether a single dose of radiation therapy is more effective
      than implant radiation therapy for 5 days in treating patients with recurrent breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying implant radiation therapy to see how well it works
      compared with radiation therapy during surgery in treating patients with recurrent breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the in breast recurrence rate following repeat radiation to the breast with
           Mammosite® brachytherapy or intraoperative radiotherapy in patients with recurrent
           ipsilateral breast cancer.

        -  To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast re-irradiation using
           different techniques, including both physician- and patient-rated scales.

        -  To determine patient satisfaction of partial breast re-irradiation as it pertains to
           their overall treatment experience, as measured by a questionnaire.

        -  To determine if there are patient factors which limit a patient's suitability to receive
           partial breast re-irradiation delivered by a particular technique.

        -  To evaluate tylectomy wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast
           re-irradiation.

        -  To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to which modality is best suited for the patient.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      All patients undergo excisional biopsy or needle localization removal of the tumor. Patients
      with margins &lt; 2 mm undergo re-excision of the biopsy cavity.

        -  Group 1: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered as a single
           intra-operative radiation dose to the tumor bed.

        -  Group 2: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered by Mammosite®
           brachytherapy consisting of 10 fractions over 5 days.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month after completion of radiotherapy, and then
      at follow-up visits.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years.
