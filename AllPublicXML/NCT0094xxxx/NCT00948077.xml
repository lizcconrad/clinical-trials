      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on pharmacokinetic profile of
      multiple doses orally administered first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in subjects with
      pulmonary tuberculosis.

      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, two way crossover design, pharmacokinetics
      study.

        1. Treatment A: study agents (Rifater+EMB) will be given approximately 45 minutes prior to
           breakfast.

        2. Treatment B: study agents (Rifater+EMB) will be given approximately 45 minutes after the
           breakfast is finished.

    <description>The main difference between Treatment A and Treatment B is the time of taking drugs, so the intervention of this study belongs to a behavioral intervention.
The patients assigned randomly the Arm &quot;Treatment A&quot; on the fifth day will be switched to the Arm &quot;Treatment B&quot; on the sixth day. On the other hand, the patients assigned randomly the Arm &quot;Treatment B&quot; on the fifth day will be switched to the Arm &quot;Treatment A&quot; on the sixth day. The flow of intervention is drawn as below.
