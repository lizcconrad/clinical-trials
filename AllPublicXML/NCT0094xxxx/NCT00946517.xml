    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that certain parenting styles are associated with greater
      non-adherence to therapy in children and teens with type 1 diabetes. To test their
      hypothesis, the investigators will use standardized and validated questionnaires for parents
      and children to determine: parenting styles (the investigators will measure parental
      strictness, parental attachment, and parental monitoring), parent ability to cope with
      stress, parent comfort with the parenting role, parent and child level of depression and
      parent perception of financial resources. The investigators will also measure parent and
      child's perception of the child's underlying temperament and parent-child conflict. The
      investigators will correlate these findings with both parent and child subjective measures of
      adherence to therapy. The investigators will also obtain objective measures of therapy
      adherence including: HbA1c, number of hospitalizations for diabetes ketoacidosis and number
      of missed outpatient appointments. These measures will be correlated with our other findings.
