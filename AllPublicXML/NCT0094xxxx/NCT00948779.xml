      The purpose of this study is to determine if a patient education in acute condition about the
      intake of oral solution antibiotic in children under 6 year-old are effective to improve the
      satisfaction about the therapeutic education, the knowledge about antibiotics among the
      patients' families and thereby decrease the misuses of antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to antibiotic regimen for common childhood illnesses, such as otitis media and
      streptococcal pharyngitis, is related to a variety of outcomes such as illness' remission,
      prevention of recurrent infections, maintaining of cost-effectiveness, and prevention of the
      growth of antibiotic-resistance. A patient and family 's therapeutic education about the
      intake of an oral solution of antibiotic should decrease the misuses of antibiotic, improve
      the family 's knowledge and the satisfaction of the patient and his family. Those factors are
      related to the understanding and adherence to the antibiotic prescription.
