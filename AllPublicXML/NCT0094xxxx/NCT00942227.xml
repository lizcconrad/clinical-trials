  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of adding mechanical traction to
      standard physical therapy treatments for patients with low back pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the opinions of clinical experts that patients who might benefit from traction may
      represent distinct sub-groups of patients, most studies have not attempted to narrow their
      inclusion criteria beyond loose definitions of 'acute' or 'chronic' symptoms. While these
      studies seem to indicate that traction interventions will be of little benefit when
      administered to large groups of patients without a prior attempt to select which patients are
      most likely to benefit, they are not sufficient to preclude the possibility that a subgroup
      of patients may benefit substantially from the intervention. Recent preliminary studies
      suggest a there exists a subgroup of patients with LBP that is likely to benefit from
      traction.

      The two primary aims of this study are:

        1. Determine the validity of the previously-identified prediction criteria to identify
           patients highly likely to benefit from the addition of traction to a standard physical
           therapy intervention.

        2. Compare the overall effectiveness of addition of a traction component to a standard
           physical therapy intervention.

    <description>Mechanical lumbar traction will be applied with subjects in prone utilizing 40-60% of subject's body weight to create a distraction force in the lumbar spine. Following traction, subjects will be instructed in a progression of extension oriented exercises and manual therapy to increase extension as described for the comparator group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chief complaint of pain and/or paresthesia in the lumbar spine with a distribution of
             symptoms that has extended distal to the gluteal fold on at least one lower extremity
             within the past 24 hours based on the patient's self-report.

          -  Oswestry disability score of at least 20%

          -  Age at least 18 years and less than 60 years

          -  At least one of the following signs of nerve root compression:

               1. Positive ipsilateral or contralateral straight leg raise test (reproduction of
                  leg symptoms with straight leg raise &lt; 70 degrees)

               2. Sensory deficit to pinprick on the ipsilateral lower extremity

               3. Diminished strength of a myotome (hip flexion, knee extension, ankle
                  dorsiflexion, great toe extension, or ankle eversion) of the ipsilateral lower
                  extremity

               4. Diminished lower extremity reflex (Quadriceps or Achilles) of the symptomatic
                  lower extremity

        Exclusion Criteria:

             metabolic diseases, RA, osteoporosis, spinal compression fracture, prolonged history
             of steroid use, etc.)

          -  Evidence of central nervous system involvement, to include symptoms of cauda equina
             syndrome (i.e., loss of bowel/bladder control or saddle region paresthesia) or the
             presence of pathological reflexes (i.e., positive Babinski)

          -  Patient reports the complete absence of low back and leg symptoms when seated
