  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intestinal hormone called Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) is released
      into the blood immediately after ingestion of a meal and plays an important role in
      regulating blood sugar levels. However, GIP is not active in persons with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) which is also known as adult onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This
      study is being conducted to determine whether a hormone called xenin-25 can restore the
      activity of GIP in persons with T2DM.

      Each eligible participant will be administered an oral glucose tolerance test so he/she can
      be assigned to the group with &quot;normal glucose tolerance&quot;, &quot;impaired glucose tolerance&quot;
      (between normal and diabetic), or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Each study subject will then be
      administered a meal tolerance test (MTT) on 4 separate occasions. For the MTT, a liquid meal
      (Boost Plus)will be ingested following an overnight fast. A primed-continuous infusion of
      vehicle alone, GIP alone, xenin-25 alone, or the combination of GIP plus xenin-25 (each
      peptide at a dose of 4 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1) will be initiated at the same time the meal is
      ingested. Blood samples will be collected before and during the MTT for the measurement of
      glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP and xenin-25 levels.
