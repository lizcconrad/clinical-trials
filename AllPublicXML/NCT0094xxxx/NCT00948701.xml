    <textblock>
      Physical activity programs, when offered in research settings, have been shown to improve
      quality of life and reduce fatigue among breast cancer survivors. The investigators are
      training Reach to Recovery volunteers at the American Cancer Society (New England Division)
      to provide a 12-week telephone-based physical activity program (RTR Plus) for breast cancer
      survivors. The comparison group of survivors will receive Reach to Recovery services (RTR).
      Physical activity, fatigue and other outcomes will be examined among 108 breast cancer
      survivors at the start of the program, at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. If the physical activity
      program is found to be effective, there is a potential for dissemination among the 13,000
      Reach to Recovery volunteers across the U.S.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study, a randomized controlled trial, represents the next step in our efforts to
      extend the research on physical activity to the community setting; community volunteers will
      deliver the intervention, thereby making physical activity interventions much more accessible
      to survivors. In partnership with the National ACS office (Atlanta, GA) and the New England
      ACS Division, researchers at the Miriam Hospital will share their skills, experience and
      resources to examine the effects of training RTR volunteers to deliver brief physical
      activity counseling to breast cancer survivors. Fifteen to twenty RTR volunteers will be
      trained to offer a 12-week telephone-based PA program as a supplement to 12-week RTR services
      (RTR Plus) vs. delivering the standard 12-week RTR services (RTR) to 108 breast cancer
      survivors. Assessments of physical activity, fatigue and other outcomes will be completed at
      baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Data on side-effects of the intervention and costs of
      intervention delivery will be tracked. If the proposed randomized trial demonstrates positive
      effects, the results will be used to design and support a dissemination trial of the effects
      of physical activity promotion to enhance cancer recovery in a community setting.

    <description>The PA intervention consists of PA counseling, matched to participants' motivational readiness, plus educational materials. RTR volunteers or &quot;coaches&quot; will be asked to contact participants by telephone once a week for 12 weeks. The purpose of these calls is to build a supportive relationship with the participant, monitor PA participation, identify any health concerns, assist the participant to identify relevant barriers to PA and help her to problem solve to overcome such barriers.</description>

    <description>RTR volunteers will contact the participants in this group by telephone once a week, providing support and information integral to RTR. The volunteers will also review the educational materials sent to all participants receiving RTR services. This will allow the volunteers to build a relationship with the participants over 12 weeks and ensure that these participants receive a minimal intervention, reducing the risk of attrition at the 12-week assessment.</description>
