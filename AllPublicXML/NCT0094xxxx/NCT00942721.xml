  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a woman gives birth, she will often feel anxious, depressed, or upset. For most women,
      these feelings go away within a week of giving birth, but for some, postpartum depression
      (PPD) can develop. PPD involves long-term, more severe feelings of anxiety, depression, and
      despair that impair normal functioning. Untreated PPD threatens both the mental health of
      mothers and the development of their infants, but many cases go untreated. This may be
      because of the stigma of mental health treatment, limited availability of programs, cost of
      treatment, or difficulty finding the time to schedule trips out of the home. Treatment
      through a Web-based program addresses all these concerns by providing a private,
      cost-efficient program available anywhere with computer access. This study will develop and
      test a Web-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat women with PPD to
      determine its feasibility and acceptability.

      Participation in this study will last 3 months. All participants will be offered a Web-based
      version of CBT for PPD. The CBT program will include guided behavioral strategies for dealing
      with depression, online videos of women who have used these strategies, Web forums in which
      participants can ask questions of peers and experts, and periodic phone coaching. The program
      will last 6 weeks. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment,
      and 3-month follow-up. Safety monitoring questionnaires will also be completed at Weeks 2 and
      4 of treatment. Assessments will include clinical interviews and questionnaires related to
      the following: health; depression; demographics; maternal skills, stress, and self-efficacy;
      Internet use, experience, and self-efficacy; behavioral self-efficacy; and program
      acceptability.
