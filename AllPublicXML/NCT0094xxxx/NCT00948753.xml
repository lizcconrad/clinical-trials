      This study investigates the effectiveness and safety of Maraviroc (an oral medication given
      twice daily given in addition to the standard GVHD prophylaxis) in preventing Graft versus
      Host Disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing non-myeloablative allogeneic stem-cell
      transplantation (SCT). Subjects will receive Maraviroc bid (in addition to standard GVHD
      prophylaxis) beginning after the last dose of the chemotherapy conditioning regimen until day
      30 after stem-cell infusion.

               -  Hepatic function: Baseline direct bilirubin, ALT or AST lower than three times
                  the upper limit of normal;

               -  Pulmonary disease: FVC or FEV1 &gt; 40% predicted; Cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 40%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not expected to be available for follow-up in our institution for at least
             100 days after the transplant

          -  Patients who are not undergoing standard non-myeloablative SCT with Flu/Bu
             conditioning and Tax/MTX GVHD prophylaxis

          -  Patients with uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections

          -  Patients who take strong inducers or inhibitors of the CYP450A4

          -  Patients receiving other investigational drugs for GVHD

          -  Women who are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding
