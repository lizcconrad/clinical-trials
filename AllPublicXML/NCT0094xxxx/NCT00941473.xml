  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate for the effect of corticosteroid epidural injections on bone mineral density in
      postmenopausal women. Candidates for the study: Post menopausal women between the ages of 55
      and 80. No history of bone disease. No thyroid/parathyroid disorder. not used injected or
      oral steroids in the last year. No recent smoking.

      The purpose is to identify any significant change in bone mineral density with the use of
      epidural steroid injections. This may implicate the need for patient counseling regarding
      this possible side effect and the possible use of preventive measures to avoid this adverse
      effect.

    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids reduce bone formation and increase bone loss via a variety of mechanisms.
      This effect has been shown to be dose-dependent. Doses as low as 10mg of Prednisone, has been
      shown to lower bone density over periods as short as 20 weeks, an effect which may be
      prevented with use of Calcium and Vitamin D. Inhaled Tramcinilone has also been shown to lead
      to dose-related loss of bone at the hip in premenopausal women. Clinic visits will be
      arranged for recruited patients at baseline and then at 3 and 6 months after the ESI and at
      any time for new-onset or severe back pain. During the initial visit, consent will be
      obtained, patient will be given details on the study design and rationale, severity and
      characteristics of back pain. Epidural corticosteroid injection (ESI) has been shown to
      decrease pain, speed return of function, and improve neurological signs in patients
      presenting with low back pain.
