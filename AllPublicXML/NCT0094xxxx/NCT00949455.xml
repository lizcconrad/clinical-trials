      RATIONALE: Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether lapatinib ditosylate is more
      effective than a placebo in killing tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well lapatinib ditosylate works
      compared to a placebo in treating patients with stage IV bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival in patients with HER1- and/or HER2-overexpressing
           stage IV bladder cancer who have been randomized to maintenance therapy with lapatinib
           ditosylate or placebo following first-line chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival between these patient groups.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the regimens in these patients.

        -  Assess and compare quality of life between these patient groups.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance
      status and response to first line chemotherapy (complete or partial response vs stable
      disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessment by EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and every 4 weeks
      during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
