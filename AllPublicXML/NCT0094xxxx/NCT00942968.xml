    <description>A bleeding event was considered as major if it was clinically overt and satisfies 1 or more of the following criteria: 1) bleeding accompanied by a decrease in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL), 2) bleeding occurred at a critical site (intraocular, spinal/epidural, intracranial, retroperitoneal, or pericardial bleeding), 3) bleeding leads to a transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells, 4) bleeding leads to death.

    <measure>Number of Participants With New or Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Adjudicated by Central Adjudication Committee</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 7 up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>VTEs included both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off (embolizes) from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes pulmonary embolism (PE). When a blood clot (thrombus) breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called a venous thromboembolism. DVT was diagnosed using either computed tomography scan or contrast venography. PE was diagnosed by either radionuclide ventilation-perfusion studies, contrast CT scan or an angiogram. In this outcome measure, number of participants with new or recurrent VTE (adjudicated by Central Adjudication Committee) were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With New or Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Adjudicated by Central Adjudication Committee</title>
        <description>VTEs included both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off (embolizes) from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes pulmonary embolism (PE). When a blood clot (thrombus) breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called a venous thromboembolism. DVT was diagnosed using either computed tomography scan or contrast venography. PE was diagnosed by either radionuclide ventilation-perfusion studies, contrast CT scan or an angiogram. In this outcome measure, number of participants with new or recurrent VTE (adjudicated by Central Adjudication Committee) were reported.</description>

        <description>VTEs included both DVT and PE. DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off (embolizes) from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes PE. When a blood clot (thrombus) breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called a venous thromboembolism. DVT was diagnosed using either computed tomography scan or contrast venography. PE was diagnosed by either radionuclide ventilation-perfusion studies, contrast CT scan or an angiogram. In this outcome measure, number of participants with new or recurrent VTE (identified by investigator) were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Investigator Identified New or Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or Central Venous Thrombosis (CVT)</title>
        <description>VTEs included both DVT and PE. DVT is a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. If a DVT clot breaks off (embolizes) from a vein wall and flows towards the lungs and blocks some or all of the blood supply, it becomes PE. When a blood clot (thrombus) breaks, loose and travels in the blood, this is called a venous thromboembolism. DVT was diagnosed using either computed tomography scan or contrast venography. PE was diagnosed by either radionuclide ventilation-perfusion studies, contrast CT scan or an angiogram. CVT is blood clot of the venous channels in the brain. CVT was diagnosed by contrast venography or ultrasonography. In this outcome measure, number of participants with new or recurrent VTE or CVT (identified by investigator) were reported.</description>

        <description>Creatinine clearance is an indicator of renal function. Creatinine clearance is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 milliliters per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age.</description>
