      This pilot study aims to evaluate Maraviroc intensification strategy during 24 weeks in HIV
      infected patients under efficient (CV&lt; 50 cp/mL), controlled antiretroviral therapy (≥ 6
      months) and uncompleted immune restoration (CD4&lt;350 cells/mL and CD4 earning &lt;100 cells/mL
      during last 24 months).

      The study will include 60 patients whose follow up is carried out for 48 weeks. recruitment
      period will be maintained for 12 months.
