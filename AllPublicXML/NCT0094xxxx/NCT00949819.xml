    <textblock>
      Active Surveillance (A.S.) of prostate cancer (CaP) is the systematic monitoring of men with
      low-risk, localized lesions, with curative treatment of those whose tumors show substantial
      progression. A.S. is different from Watchful Waiting (W.W.), which is the palliative
      treatment of men with progressive prostate cancer.

      This protocol is not designed as a formal clinical trial, but rather an observational
      protocol; no treatments and no randomization are included. Longitudinally, specimens and
      clinical data will be collected to provide information on the following:

        -  Imaging studies of the prostate

        -  Rates of curative intervention

        -  Measures of tumor recurrence/progression

        -  Disease specific survival

        -  Overall survival

        -  Clinical data to track Quality of Life
