    <textblock>
      Background: Bleeding and coagulopathy still accounts for the majority of early in-hospital
      deaths following trauma. There have been lately several published studies suggesting that
      higher transfusion ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets (PTL) and cryoprecipitate
      (CRYO) to red blood cell (RBC) are associated with survival advantages. However, the evidence
      comes from retrospective data limited by a significant number of unaddressed confounders. In
      addition, the use of blood products bears known and important risks of complications.

      Hypothesis: The adoption of a formula-driven transfusion practice with pre-defined ratios of
      FFP to PTL to RBC transfusion (1:1:1) is feasible and superior to current laboratory-guided
      transfusion practice in treating and/or preventing early coagulopathy improving survival
      rates in massively bleeding trauma patients .

      Objective: To exam the feasibility of implementing a pre-defined ratio of FFP to PTL to RBC
      (1:1:1) transfusion protocol and its impact on a population of bleeding trauma patients.

      Design: A two-year pilot feasibility randomized control trial at Sunnybrook Health Sciences
      Centre. Randomization: 70 patients are expected to be randomized to lab-driven or to
      formula-driven massive transfusion protocol and followed-up to 28 days or hospital discharge.

      Study outcomes: protocol violation; in-hospital mortality by exsanguination; death at 28
      days; coagulation competence defined by current standard coagulation tests (INR &amp; PTT &lt; 1.5
      times normal; PTL ≥ 50 and Fibrinogen ≥ 1.0) or clotting factor levels ≥ 30%; correlation of
      current standard coagulation tests with clotting factors levels; cessation of bleeding;
      incidence of ALI, sepsis, MOF, transfusion-related circulatory overload, transfusion
      reactions; Ventilator-free days; ICU &amp; Hospital LOS; thromboembolic events.

      Intervention protocol: Transfusion of pre-defined ratios of FFP and PTL to RBC (1:1:1)
      (formula-driven) for the first 12h of hospitalization without coagulation tests guidance
      while patient is hemorrhaging or before if bleeding stops.

      Statistical analysis: protocol compliance rate and in-hospital mortality rates within 24h and
      at 28 days will be assessed using Chi-square test. ROC analysis will be used to analyze
      coagulation competence.

      Main expected outcomes: implementation of a formula-driven transfusion protocol is feasible
      and coagulation competence will be achieved faster and more efficiently in the study group.

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will be treated as per Sunnybrook's current standard of care massive transfusion protocol. Crystalloid and red cell transfusions are performed to maintain volume status, and to maintain haemoglobin levels above 70 g/L. FFP is transfused based in 3-4 unit aliquots, for INR&gt;1.5. Platelets are transfused 1 pool at a time (4 units Buffy coat platelets) to maintain platelet counts above 50 x 109/mL. Cryoprecipitate is transfused 8-12 units at a time to keep fibrinogen above 0.8 gram/L.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will be transfused based on a pre-defined massive transfusion protocol. Blood bank will release blood a pre-defined packages. Blood will be received in aliquots containing 4 units off FFP, 1 pool of buffy coat platelet (4 units) and 4 units of RBC. This corresponds to an FFP:RBC transfusion ratio of 1:1.
Patients randomized to the study protocol will be receiving the FFP and PTL at pre-defined ratios to RBC (1:1:1) up to 12h of hospitalization or earlier if cessation of the massive transfusion requested at the discretion of the treating physicians.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients were eligible for this study if they:

        i) were adult trauma patients assessed by the trauma team; and ii) suffered either
        penetrating or blunt mechanism of injury; and

          1. were bleeding and expected to require massive transfusion (either 4 units within the
             next 2 hours or ≥ 10 units of RBC in 24 h) or required transfusion of un-cross matched
             emergency stock red blood cells; and

          2. had an episode of hypotension (systolic bp ≤ 90mmHg).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients were excluded if:

        i) they were assessed in the trauma room more than six hours after injury; or ii) they
        received more than two units of RBC transfusion prior to arrival; or iii) they had suffered
        a concomitant severe brain injury (defined as any of the following: Glasgow Coma Scale of 3
        due to severe traumatic brain injury; clear indication of immediate neurosurgical
        intervention based on clinical findings, mechanism of trauma associated with focal signs
        (anisocoria, CT evidence of intracranial bleeding with mass effect); or iv) they had
        evidence of having a catastrophic head injury (such as transcranial gunshot wound, open
        skull fracture with exposure/loss of brain tissue, or expert opinion by either the trauma
        team leader or neurosurgical consultant based on initial clinical or initial CT findings);
        or v) they had evidence that their shock state was unrelated to hemorrhage (ie cardiogenic,
        septic, anaphylactic, acute adrenal insufficiency, neurogenic, or obstructive (cardiac
        tamponade, tension pneumothorax and massive pulmonary emboli); or vi) they had a known
        hereditary or acquired coagulopathy unrelated to the trauma resuscitation (for example:
        hemophilia, hepatic insufficiency, or anti-coagulant medications); or vii) they were
        moribund with evidence of unsalvageable injuries.
