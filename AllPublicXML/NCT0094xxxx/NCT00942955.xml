    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that POCT will shorten ED turn-around-time (TAT) such as
      blood drawing TAT, lab TAT, and decision TAT.

        This study was performed in five EDs. Three were urban EDs with 30,000 to 45,000 annual
        visits, and two were suburban EDs with 15,000 to 25,000 annual visits. Each hospital has
        its own central laboratory which can test the same emergency chemistry tests, including
        liver panel (alkaline phosphatase, protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin,
        GOT, and GPT), renal panel (BUN, creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus), pancreas enzymes
        (amylase, lipase), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, total CO2), lipid panel
        (total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol), and blood gases (pH,
        pO2, pCO2, and bicarbonate).
