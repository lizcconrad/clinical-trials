  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a disease of complex origin with a strong genetic component. The incidence
      of breast cancer is very high in monozygotic twins of patients, and it is thought that a high
      proportion and perhaps the majority of breast cancers arise in a small number of genetically
      susceptible women. Recent studies in human genetics have discovered several intervals in the
      human genome containing inherited variants that are statistically associated with the
      propensity to develop breast cancer. The investigators plan to use this knowledge to design a
      genetic screening test to guide recommendations for breast cancer screening with mammography.
      If the small group of genetically susceptible women can be identified, more effective breast
      cancer screening strategies can be implemented. In contrast, a very large proportion of women
      who undergo yearly mammography are at exceptionally low risk from a genetic perspective.
      Using genomic guidance could eventually reconfigure the most efficacious strategy to screen
      women for early detection of breast cancer.

      By developing a genetic screening panel based on genetic markers for breast cancer, the
      investigators will be able to more accurately determine a woman's individual risk for
      developing breast cancer.

      Women the age of 30 or over who are undergoing screening or diagnostic breast imaging as an
      out patient at the Scripps Polster Breast Care Center in La Jolla, CA, with at least 5 years
      of historic breast imaging data available will be eligible to enroll. For this study,
      consecutive subjects who have completed screening or diagnostic breast imaging at the Scripps
      Polster Breast Care Center will be enrolled for one day. It is estimated that up to 5000
      subjects will be included in the cohort.

      Approximately 19.5 mls of blood will be collected from volunteers. The blood from each
      subject will be collected via venipuncture. If subject is unable/unwilling to provide blood
      sample, we can also collect 2 mls of saliva.
