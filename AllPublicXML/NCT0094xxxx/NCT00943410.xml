  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Trastuzumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation
      therapy. Giving trastuzumab together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving trastuzumab
      together with external beam radiation therapy works in treating women with stage III or stage
      IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the tolerability of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and concurrent external beam
           radiotherapy in women with HER2-overexpressing stage III or IV breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the locoregional recurrence rate (as site of first recurrence or any
           recurrence) and time to locoregional recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to local progression in patients (who are deemed to be non-surgical
           candidates) treated with this regimen .

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 5 weeks. Patients also
      undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      Three weeks after the completion of trastuzumab and radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical
      evaluation. Patients deemed to be surgical candidates undergo surgery. Patients deemed to be
      non-surgical candidates continue to receive trastuzumab and external beam radiotherapy for 2
      additional weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
