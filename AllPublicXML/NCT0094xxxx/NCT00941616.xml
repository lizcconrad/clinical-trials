    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of
      Biostate® in subjects with Von Willebrand Disease (VWD).

      Pharmacokinetic Component:

      PK parameters will be determined from a subgroup of subjects. Subjects who complete the PK
      component will subsequently continue in the efficacy component of the study, either
      continuing on a previously established prophylaxis regimen or continuing to receive on-demand
      treatment with the occurrence of non-surgical bleeding (NSB) events.

      Efficacy Component:

      Three treatment arms are defined for the efficacy component of the study. (1) Subjects who
      are currently being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product at the time of
      study entry will be enrolled in the &quot;Prophylaxis&quot; arm. (2) Subjects not being treated on a
      set prophylaxis regimen at the time of study entry who require a VWF product for the
      treatment of NSB events will be enrolled in the &quot;On-demand&quot; arm and commence using Biostate
      in the treatment of NSB events. (3) Subjects enrolled in the &quot;On-demand&quot; arm have the
      possibility to enter the &quot;Cross-over to Prophylaxis&quot; arm to receive an additional 12 months
      of prophylactic treatment.
