      The purpose of this study is:

        1. to develop a standardised orientation and mobility training (O&amp;M-training) in the use of
           an identification/symbol cane by older adults with low vision, and;

        2. to evaluate this newly developed standardised O&amp;M-training with respect to effectiveness
           and feasibility in a randomised controlled trial.
