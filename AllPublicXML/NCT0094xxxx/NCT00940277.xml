  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 couple-focused interventions
      developed to reduce the psychological distress on women and their partners during and after
      the breast cancer experience. The first group, an Enhanced Couple-Focused Group (ECG),
      incorporates cognitive-behavioral interventions (e.g., relaxation, stress management skills)
      as well as basic relationship communication and support skills (e.g., expressing support
      needs constructively). The second group, a Couples' Support Group (SG), is a non-structured
      group where general topics are discussed. The investigators will evaluate the impact of each
      group condition on patients' psychological adaptation, social and role functioning, and
      cancer treatment adherence. The investigators will also evaluate whether patient and partner
      perceptions of relationship support, relationship intimacy, stress management skills, and
      intervention group support mediate the groups' effects on each other's psychological
      adaptation.

      The investigators hypothesize that ECG will have stronger positive effects on patient general
      and cancer-related distress and well-being than SG.

      The investigators hypothesize that group support will mediate greater improvements in patient
      psychological functioning in both groups but that the effects of group support will be
      significantly stronger in SG than ECG.

    <description>Enhanced Couples Group: consists of eight 90-minute sessions, conducted weekly. ECG has a didactic educational content presented by the group leader or practice of specific relationship communication, relationship support, and couple-focused stress management. ECG participants are also given instruction about what types of behaviors are unsupportive and training in how to not behave in an unsupportive manner.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Support Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Support Group: 8 weekly 90-minute group counseling sessions. Using a standard approach to supportive therapy, the group interventionists will focus on encouraging participants to share their experiences with cancer, express their emotions related to the experience, voice problems they have in coping with the cancer, and offer support and advice to other members of the group. The co-facilitators will facilitate expression of affect and the sharing of the group's common issues related to cancer. Each session has a broad topic for discussion. Topics include communication with health care providers, issues related to occupational life, and coping with medical procedures and treatment. No formal or didactic information will be provided.</description>
