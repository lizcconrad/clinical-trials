  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the delay between the detection (by
      mechanomyography-MMG) of rectus abdominis contraction and the detection of cough in cough
      effort.

    <description>This biomedical research consists specifically in the simultaneous acquisition of:
EMG and MMG Signals of rectus abdominis of the abdomen,
Respiratory flow,
An electrocardiogram (ECG).
These acquisitions will be conducted on 16 healthy volunteers according to a standardized protocol, at rest and during voluntary cough and various physical exercises often resulting in urinary leakage in the incontinent person.</description>
