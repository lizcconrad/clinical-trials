      1) to evaluate treatment fidelity of DRRP: study design, training of interventionists,
      delivery and receipt of the intervention, and application of the intervention in real-life
      settings; 2) to identify successful strategies for participant recruitment and maintaining
      active participation; 3) to collect and analyze preliminary indicators of DRRP's effect on
      dietary intake, physical activity, stress responses, and body weight; and 4) To evaluate
      sample representativeness of the target audience, implementation and acceptability of DRRP,
      and attrition rate.
