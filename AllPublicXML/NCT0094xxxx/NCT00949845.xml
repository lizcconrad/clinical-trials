  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has demonstrated a relationship between depression and immune system
      activity, specifically proinflammatory cytokine activity. Although experimentally-induced
      immune activation leads to increases in depressed mood, the neural correlates associated with
      these changes have remained largely unexplored. Based on relationships between cytokine
      activity, depression, and heightened physical and social pain sensitivity, I propose to
      investigate the effect of proinflammatory cytokine activation on the neural correlates of
      socially painful experience that may contribute to depression. Our previous work has shown
      that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), typically associated with physical pain
      distress, also plays a role in the distressing feelings associated with social rejection or
      social loss. Moreover, recent pilot data has revealed that individuals with elevated levels
      of baseline proinflammatory cytokines report feeling more distressed and show more dACC
      activity during social rejection. To investigate the causal role that cytokines may play in
      the heightened social pain sensitivity that can contribute to depression, participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive either endotoxin (which increases proinflammatory cytokine
      activity) or placebo. Subsequently, participants will complete a neuroimaging study in which
      they will be rejected during an online ball-tossing game. We hypothesize that individuals
      exposed to endotoxin will report more social distress and depression following rejection and
      will show more dACC reactivity during rejection. The proposed study is the first to
      investigate the effect of systemic inflammation on neural reactivity related to social and
      affective processes that may increase the risk of depression.
