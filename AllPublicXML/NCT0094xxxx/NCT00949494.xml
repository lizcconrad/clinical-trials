  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) is an FDA-approved hyaluronate derivative used to treat knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). Animal studies have shown that Synvisc can have favorable effects on
      cartilage when injected into joints. This study attempts to evaluate the effects of Synvisc
      when injected into knees of patients with knee OA by means of a specialized MRI technology
      (dGEMRIC).

    <textblock>
      Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) is an FDA-approved hyaluronate derivative which is administered by
      injection into osteoarthritic joints for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Preclinical
      investigations have demonstrated that Hylan G-F 20 can favorably affect chondrocyte
      metabolism and recent clinical studies [Ann Rheum Dis. 2004 May;63(5):478-82; Osteoarthritis
      Cartilage. 2005 Mar;13(3):216-24] provide support for a disease-modifying effect of Hylan G-F
      20 therapy. This study will utilize dGEMRIC imaging of patients with knee OA to assess the
      effects of Hylan G-F 20 therapy on cartilage in vivo over time. Delayed Gadolinium Enhanced
      MRI of the Cartilage (dGEMRIC) permits a quantitative assessment of GAG distribution within
      intact cartilage in vivo. Since dGEMRIC is noninvasive, the technique may be useful to
      non-invasively monitor the influence of various treatments on hyaline cartilage.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 40 to 80 years of age who meet the ACR Criteria for osteoarthritis
             of the knee.

          2. Radiographic evidence of OA, Kellgren and Lawrence grade I to III on prior X-rays
             (taken within 6 months of the screening visit) or at screening. Only the tibio-femoral
             joint will be evaluated (patello-femoral disease will not be considered).

          3. Mild to moderate levels of knee pain as determined by a VAS pain score of 3-6/10 that
             has been stable for at least 1 month prior to screening visit.

          4. Stable management regimen for knee OA pain for at least 1 month prior to screening
             visit. Subjects can be managed by physical measures alone, simple analgesics, NSAIDs,
             nutriceuticals or other agents with no significant change in treatment regimen during
             the 1 month prior to screening visit.

          5. Ability to comply with the requirements of the study

          6. Able to maintain stable exercise/activity program during course of the study

        6. Signed and dated consent form 7. Women of child-bearing potential should agree to the
        use of an appropriate method of contraception and have a confirmed negative pregnancy test
        at screening.

             bionic ear devices.

          5. Subjects who are unable to receive gadolinium contrast agent injection because of
