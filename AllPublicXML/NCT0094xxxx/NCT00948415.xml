  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major health problem that has reached epidemic levels. Efforts are needed to
      develop cost-effective public health approaches for weight loss and maintenance. One such
      approach is to develop team-based programs that may motivate people to lose weight and/or
      increase their physical activity. One such program is entitled Shape-up Rhode Island (SURI).
      The current trial is investigating whether adding both a behavioral intervention delivered
      online PLUS automated feedback to self-monitoring would enhance the outcomes of SURI
      participants.

      Background: Given the epidemic of obesity, approaches to weight loss that can be applied on a
      community, state, or national level are needed. This project is an ongoing evaluation of
      Shape Up Rhode Island (SURI) program, a state-wide Internet based program involving
      team-based competition to increase physical activity and achieve weight loss.

      Aim: To enhance the effectiveness of SURI utilizing a minimal contact intervention delivered
      online.

      Design: SURI 2009 participants were invited to join a research study focusing on weight loss.
      Interested participants were randomized to two groups including a SURI Enhanced group
      (behavioral intervention presented in 12 weekly online presentations, daily self-monitoring,
      and weekly automated feedback) or a SURI Standard group (group given a list of previously
      existing online resources to aid with weight loss).

    <description>The SURI enhanced group will receive the standard Shape Up RI program. In addition, participants will be asked to record and report their daily calorie intake, body weight, minutes of physical activity, and pedometer steps. Participants will receive automated feedback on progress as well as a behavioral lesson delivered online during each week of the program. Participants assigned to the SURI Standard arm will receive the standard Shape Up RI program. The intervention will take place during the 12-week Shape Up RI campaign.</description>
