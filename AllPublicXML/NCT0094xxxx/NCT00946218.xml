    <textblock>
      Dengue virus is an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes which causes significant morbidity and
      mortality among children in tropical regions, especially in resource limited countries. The
      objective of this protocol is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinical gestalt
      and two rapid antigen tests for dengue virus and to compare the gene expression of leukocytes
      in distinct dengue fever disease phenotypes module-based RNA microarray technology.

      This is a biology protocol with no treatment regimen associated. Blood collection will be
      drawn from subjects in El Salvador to be tested in an effort to improve detection and test
      sensitivity and specificity of a dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, dengue NS1 Ag STRIP, and clinical
      suspicion for the detection of dengue virus infection in children in San Salvador, El
      Salvador compared to the gold standard, PCR. This protocol will also seek to identify and
      compare gene transcription patterns characteristics of each dengue virus disease phenotype in
      children.
