  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have been offering computer assisted therapy of aphasia (CAT) as a
      complement to traditional treatments to aphasia patients of the &quot;Service of
      Neurorehabilitation&quot; for some years. The investigators have shown its efficacy in
      hospitalised patients with recently acquired aphasia.

      In addition to studies stressing the importance of treatment intensity, several studies
      suggest that pharmacological treatment can also improve recovery after a cerebral lesion. The
      underlying idea is that the administration of medication influencing the system of
      neurotransmitters can play a role in functional recovery. Studies have assessed mainly
      substances acting on the dopaminergic (amphetamine and bromocriptine) and GABAergic system
      (piracetam).

      The main objective of the present study concerns the evaluation of the effects of levodopa on
      recovery of anomia in patients with aphasia. In particular, the investigators use CAT to
      control intensity and quality of therapy and they will assess whether the administration of
      levodopa promotes recovery.

      In each patient, two periods of anomia therapy with CAT, each performed with a different word
      list, will be compared. In addition to speech therapy, each period will be associated with
      the administration of either levodopa and benserazide (Madopar ®), or placebo. Evaluations at
      baseline and after each treatment period will be performed with the material and denomination
      battery
