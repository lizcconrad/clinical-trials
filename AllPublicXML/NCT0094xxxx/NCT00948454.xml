  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal, will elucidate the role of oxidant stress (OS) on arterial function as
      measured by flow mediated vasodilation. In addition, the investigators will address the
      hypothesis, that a pro-oxidant might have different degrees of effects on different
      biological targets, by performing quantitative assessment of the effects of OS on lipids,
      proteins and DNA.

      Buffy coat from 4ml of blood will be stored for future genomic and proteomic analysis. Blood
      will also be collected for telemore length. This will be performed at an outside institution.

        Chronic smokers (of between 4 and 20 years duration) and non-smokers will be recruited.
        Smokers will be allocated to a &quot;light&quot; group, smoking 4-10 cigarettes per day and a &quot;heavy&quot;
        smoking group who smoke 11-20 cigarettes per day. Non-smokers will be defined as those with
        a life time consumption of no more than 20 cigarettes, do not live or work in a smoky
        atmosphere. All individuals will have a normal history and clinical examination, including
        a normal EKG, urinalysis and serum chemistry, haemogram and negative urinary pregnancy
        test.
