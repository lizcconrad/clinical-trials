  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the percentage of patients with solid spinal
      fusions after being treated with Osteocel Plus in an ALIF procedure. Due to the unique
      processing conditions, Osteocel Plus retains a high concentration of stem cells in
      conjunction with the allograft bone matrix, so it is hypothesized that the fusion rate with
      Osteocel Plus will be comparable to published data for autograft. The Osteocel product family
      has already been used in approximately 15,000 cases worldwide.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized multi-center study to compare the use of Osteocel Plus
      in subjects who receive ALIF surgery at one or two levels. These subjects will present with
      degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will
      be screened prior to study enrollment. Subjects will receive Osteocel Plus during their ALIF
      operation. Subjects will be followed for 24-months following surgery to determine the number
      of study subjects that are solidly fused at or before 24 months postoperatively, and to
      determine the mean time to fusion. This data will be compared to published and/or
      retrospective data for autograft, synthetic ceramics and BMP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent back and/or leg pain unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least
             six (6) months, unless clinically indicated earlier

          2. Indicated for interbody fusion of one or two contiguous lumbar segments (L1 to S1)

          3. Objective evidence of primary diagnosis must be confirmed by appropriate imaging
             studies

          4. 18-70 years of age at the date of written informed consent

          5. Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history and surgeon judgment

          6. Expected to survive at least 2 years beyond surgery

          7. Willing and able to return for post-treatment exams according to the follow-up called
             for in the protocol

          8. Signed and dated Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with
             study requirements

          2. Lumbar spine abnormality requiring treatment at more than two levels

          3. Systemic or local infection; active or latent

          4. Previous failed fusion at the operative level

          5. Diseases that significantly inhibit bone healing (osteoporosis, metabolic bone
             disease, uncontrolled diabetes, dialysis dependent renal failure, symptomatic liver
             disease)

          6. Undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, or chronic use of steroids (defined as
             more than 6 weeks of steroid use within 12 months of surgery, other than episodic use
             or inhaled corticosteroids)

          7. Pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the study

          8. Subject is a prisoner
