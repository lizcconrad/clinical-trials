    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of three doses of oral mirabegron
      formulations with three different release rates versus three doses of mirabegron administered
      intravenously; to study safety and side effects of the oral and IV doses of mirabegron.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three oral mirabegron doses and then randomly
      assigned to one of three oral mirabegron doses and then randomly assigned to one of six
      treatment sequences.

      For all subjects the first treatment will be a reference IV dose. Treatments 2, 3, and 4 will
      be a random order of slow, fast and target release oral doses of mirabegron. Treatment 5 will
      be a target release dose of mirabegron from a different batch.

      There will be at least 10 day washout between dose administrations.
