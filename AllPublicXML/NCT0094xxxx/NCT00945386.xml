  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients, during their illness often treated with furosemide (Lasix) continuous
      drip, often, with dosages above 4-6mg/kg/day (the recommended dose).

      This study will monitor hearing status of these children prior to their therapy with
      furosemide, during this therapy and after.

      This study will record hearing status, by acoustic emission, of critically ill children,
      treated with different dosages of furosemide drip.

      Acoustic emission test will be done prior to therapy and q48 hours during their course of
      treatment with furosemide drip.

      Dosage of furosemide drip, boluses and other relevant medications (i.e - vancomycin, muscular
      relaxants, aminoglycosides etc) will be recorded.
