  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide
      administered to patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

      The primary efficacy parameter is the percentage of patients in each treatment group that
      meet the protocol definition for Abdominal Pain and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (APC)
      Responder.

    <measure>Abdominal Pain and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (APC) Responder, 9 Out of 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A patient is considered to be an APC responder if, for at least 9 out of the 12 weeks of the treatment period, the patient had at least 3 CSBMs, experienced an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline, and experienced a decrease of at least 30 percent in their Abdominal Pain (AP) score from baseline during a particular week.
The AP score assesses the worst of a patient's AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
A CSBM is defined as a spontaneous bowel movement, associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>

A CSBM was defined as a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) that was associated with a sense of complete evacuation.
An SBM was defined as a bowel movement (BM) that occurred in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the BM or the calendar day before the BM.</description>

The AP score assesses the worst of a patient's AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
A CSBM is defined as a spontaneous bowel movement, associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>

          <title>Abdominal Pain Responder, 9 Out of 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>A patient is considered to be an abdominal pain responder if, for at least 9 out of the 12 weeks of the treatment period, they experienced a decrease of at least 30 percent in the mean abdominal pain score from baseline during a particular week.
The Abdominal Pain score assesses the worst of a patient's abdominal pain in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no abdominal pain and 10 represents very severe abdominal pain.</description>
          <population>803 patients were randomized to treatment, and 802 patients received double-blind study drug. 800 patients had at least 1 postrandomization entry of the primary efficacy assessment and were included in the ITT Population. An observed-cases approach to missing postbaseline data was applied.</population>

        <description>A patient is considered an APC responder if, for at least 6 of the 12 weeks of the treatment, the patient experienced an increase of at least 1 Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) from baseline and experienced a decrease of at least 30 percent in their Abdominal Pain (AP)score during a particular week.
The AP score assesses the worst of a patient's AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
A CSBM was defined as a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) that was associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>
