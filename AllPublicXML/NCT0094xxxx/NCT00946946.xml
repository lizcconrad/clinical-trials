          -  Diagnosis of Crohn's disease confirmed by endoscopic and histological, or endoscopic

             resection,

          -  Clinical remission defined as Crohn´s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &lt; 200, within the
             last two weeks. No clinical relapse due to Crohn's disease since resection,

          -  Moderate (i2a) or severe endoscopic recurrence (i3-i4) within 6 to 24 months after
             curative resection of the terminal ileum and partial colectomy with ileocolonic
             resection for complications of ileal Crohn´s disease and with a construction of an
             ileocolonic anastomosis,

          -  Within the neoterminal ileum at least more than 5 aphthous lesions with normal mucosa
             between the lesions, or skip areas of larger lesions,

          -  Negative pregnancy test at screening visit in females of childbearing potential,

          -  Use of appropriate contraceptive methods for females of childbearing potential and
             males with procreative capacity during treatment and at least up to 3 months after the
             end of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesions confined to the ileocolonic anastomosis (i.e., &lt; 1 cm in length)

          -  Short bowel syndrome,

          -  Serious secondary illnesses of an acute or chronic nature, which in the opinion of the

          -  Presence of an ileo-/colonic stoma,

          -  Genotype: thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) -/-,

          -  Known previous or concurrent malignancy (other than that considered surgically cured,
             with no evidence for recurrence for 5 years),

          -  Treatment with cytostatics or immunosuppressants, methotrexate, cyclosporine, 6-MP,
             Azathioprine, 6-TG or anti-TFN-alpha therapy since resection; postoperative treatment
             with corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks or postoperative treatment with oral
             antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole, ciprofloxacin) for more than 4 weeks,

          -  Application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) within 2 weeks before
             Screening visit except low dose acetylsalicylic acid and except paracetamol,

          -  Known intolerance/hypersensitivity to study drugs or drugs of similar chemical
             structure or pharmacological profile,

          -  Scheduled or intended active immunisation with living vaccines within the next 12
             months,

          -  Well-founded doubt about the patient's cooperation,

          -  Existing pregnancy, lactation, or intended pregnancy or impregnation within the next
             15 months,

          -  Non-use of appropriate contraceptives in males with procreative capacity and females
             of childbearing potential (e.g. condoms for males, intrauterine device [IUD], hormonal
             contraception for females, or a means of contraception for a particular patient
             considered adequate by the responsible investigator) during treatment and within 3
             months after the end of treatment,

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 30 days, simultaneous
             participation in another clinical trial, or previous participation in this trial,

          -  Present stricture plasty (no exclusion if the present stricture plasty was
