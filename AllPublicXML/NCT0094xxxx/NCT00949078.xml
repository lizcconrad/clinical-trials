  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with omalizumab (Xolair, anti-IgE) can
      eliminate or reduce symptoms of peanut allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate if omalizumab is an effective treatment for peanut allergy. In
      addition we will further evaluate the role of allergic cells (mast cells and basophils) and
      IgE in food allergy.

        protocol. If a subject becomes pregnant during the study participation, they will be
        discharged from the study and followed for any adverse events until termination of the
        pregnancy or delivery is complete. Given that the drug is in pregnancy category B, we will
        follow the pregnant mother for any adverse events for the duration of the study.

             release or 10-19% if greater than 50% of an optimal anti-IgE response (at baseline
             visit).

          -  Subjects must have a positive oral food challenge to peanut as defined by having
             objective signs of a clear allergic reaction at a cumulative dose of peanut protein
             &lt;1000 mg. Objective allergic signs may include oral urticaria, cutaneous urticaria,
             rhinorrhea, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, or vomiting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             exacerbation in last 6 months.

          -  History of severe allergic reaction to peanut requiring intubation or ICU admission.

             at the time of enrollment.

          -  Body weight less than 30 kg or greater than 150 kg at enrollment will be excluded.

          -  Patients with plans to become pregnant or breastfeed will be excluded from the study.

          -  Inability to discontinue antihistamines for routine study tests.

          -  History of ischemic cardiovascular disease (i.e., previous Myocardial Infarction,
             angina etc) or uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Significant upper respiratory tract infection (URI) within 7 days of any OFC; OFCs
             should be rescheduled within 7 days following resolution of URI.

          -  Mental illness or history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the

          -  Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply
             with study protocol.
