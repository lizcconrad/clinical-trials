  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic 'Gastroparesis' or 'Gastroenteropathy' is a condition in which patients suffer
      episodes of nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain after eating. These symptoms occur
      in the absence of any structural abnormality of the stomach, rather abnormal gastric function
      underlies the condition. Up to one in five patients with type I diabetes experience symptoms
      consistent with this diagnosis. The effects on diabetic control, physical health and
      emotional quality of life are severe. Patients do not respond reliably to general supportive
      management or conventional medications. Surgical options have disappointing results. The need
      for more effective treatment is acknowledged universally.

      Feeding into the small bowel beyond the stomach (jejunal feeding) is established management
      in diabetic patients with gastroenteropathy that are malnourished due to poor oral intake.
      The benefits have been assumed secondary to improved nutrition and diabetic control; however
      this assertion has never been studied. Recently we observed that patients with severe
      gastroenteropathy recovered promptly and could eat normally during and for a few hours after
      jejunal feeding. These observations suggest that jejunal feeding has 'quasi-pharmacological'
      effects in patients with gastroenteropathy. One attractive explanation for these observations
      is that gastroenteropathy represents a failure of oral intake to 'switch' the stomach from
      the fasted to the fed state. According to this hypothesis, jejunal feeding 'restores' the
      normal fed state by bypassing the dysfunctional stomach.

      This project will assess the effects of feeding on gastrointestinal (GI) sensory and motor
      function in diabetic gastroenteropathy. Healthy volunteers and diabetic controls without
      symptoms will also be investigated. Studies will assess:

        1. Effects on GI symptoms and function to gastric distension in fasted and fed states

        2. Effects on GI symptoms and function to oral vs. nasogastric delivery of a test meal

        3. A trial of gastric feeding with and without prior jejunal feeding on GI symptoms and
           function Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques will be applied to
           assess complex gastric response to feeding. In addition the effects of feeding on
           symptoms and gastric function will be related to alterations in GI hormones and
           autonomic nervous activity (eg cardiovagal tone) to assess how the integrated response
           of the GI tract to feeding fails in patients with diabetic gastroenteropathy.

      The primary aim of this project is to assess the effectiveness of jejunal feeding in the
      management of diabetic gastroenteropathy. However, by defining the processes that 'switch'
      gastric function between the fasted and the fed states and control gastric emptying, we hope
      also to identify candidate targets for more effective pharmacologic treatment of this severe
      disease.
