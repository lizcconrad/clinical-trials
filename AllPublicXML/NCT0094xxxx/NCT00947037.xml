          -  Subject with Parkinson's disease experiencing predictable motor fluctuations, end of
             dose &quot;wearing off&quot;, defined by the patient's report of at least two episodes daily of
             a decline in function from peak benefit, with at least 2 hours OFF a day at the
             discretion of the PI (does not include early morning akinesia or nocturnal akinesia)

          -  Subject that has been treated for at least 3 months prior to the study with 500-1000
             mg Levodopa + DDCI, in 4 or more divided doses per day

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III

          -  Subjects must be able to adhere to the visit schedule and protocol requirements and be
