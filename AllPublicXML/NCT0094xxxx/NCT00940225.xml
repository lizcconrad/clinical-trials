      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not XL184 demonstrates anti-tumor
      activity in selected tumor types under a randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) design.
      Subjects who have responded to study drug after 12 weeks of open-label XL184 administration
      will continue to take XL184. Subjects who are clearly progressing will discontinue study
      treatment and subjects who demonstrate stable disease will be randomized to either XL184 or
      placebo. For individual patients, once disease progression is observed, the blind will be
      broken and subjects who were randomized to placebo will be offered the option to receive
      open-label XL184. Subjects who progressed while taking XL184 will discontinue study
      treatment.

      Emerging data may support enrollment in an open-label, non-randomized expansion cohort (NRE).
      There will be NRE cohorts for prostate and ovarian cancers.
