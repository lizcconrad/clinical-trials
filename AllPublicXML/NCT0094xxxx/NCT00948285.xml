  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
      breast cancer translates into better surgical outcomes. MRIs may help ensure that as little
      healthy tissue is removed as is possible and may help prevent the need for additional
      surgical procedures.

    <textblock>
      We propose that the role of preoperative staging-MRI in breast cancer be studied by following
      the occurrence of negative margins at first surgery and the volume of resection in a
      randomized prospective study. The need for re-excision is an objective marker of satisfactory
      local surgery and is available as soon as the final pathology report is back. We propose that
      the closest margin and the rate of re-excision be used as the primary outcome measures to
      evaluate the contribution of MRI. In addition, since cosmetic preservation is one of the
      goals of breast conservation, we propose that cosmetic outcome be used as the secondary
      outcome measure. The visual analogue scale for cosmetic outcome varies between observers and
      with time; however, the volume of tissue that is excised is an objective surrogate of
      cosmetic outcome.15 Since the excised volume is dictated by the tumor volume, the only
      variable under the surgeon's control is the volume of benign tissue excised in order to
      obtain negative margins. Hence, in this study, we propose to use a volume index of excised
      margins as an outcome measure for cosmesis. The index value will be calculated for each
      subject by adding the two measurements of benign margin for each of the three dimensions
      measured and multiplying them to produce a volume index for each subject.
