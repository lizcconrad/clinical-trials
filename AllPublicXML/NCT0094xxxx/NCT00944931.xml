      Background:

        -  Direct current (DC) brain polarization is a technique in which very weak electricity is
           applied to the head. Doctors have used DC polarization for many years on patients and
           healthy people with no known serious side effects. Earlier, researchers found that DC
           polarization can temporarily improve the ability of healthy people to think of certain
           words.

        -  A disadvantage of existing methods of DC polarization is that they use large electrodes
           and the current spreads over a large area of the brain. This makes it difficult to
           target particular brain areas. High-density DC polarization uses several small
           electrodes to focus the current in a small area of the brain. This study will test
           high-density DC polarization for the first time in humans.

      Objectives:

        -  To see how well high-density direct current polarization works in the brain.

        -  To test a new method of performing direct current brain polarization.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy, right-handed adults, ages 18 and older, who have no history of neurological or
      psychiatric illnesses.

      Design:

        -  After an initial screening visit with clinical examination, participants may be assigned
           to one or both experiments of the study.

        -  Experiment 1: Participants will have electrodes placed on the left side of their heads,
           and will be asked to say aloud as many words as they can think of that begin with
           certain letters. After the high-density DC polarization current is turned on and run for
           10 minutes, participants will say words beginning with a different set of letters and
           perform reaction time and thinking speed tests. Some participants will receive real
           polarization and others will not, although all participants will be told that they are
           receiving the polarization.

        -  Experiment 2: Participants will have DC brain polarization performed with transcranial
           magnetic stimulation (TMS), which uses magnetic pulses to activate nerve cells in the
           brain. We will use TMS to help us understand how far the effect of DC polarization
           spreads in the brain. After attaching electrodes to a point on the scalp above the ear,
           researchers will give about 50 TMS pulses to five different places near this area. These
           pulses will produce some painless muscle twitches in the hand or arm. The TMS pulses
           will be followed by the DC brain polarization, and then by another set of TMS pulses to
           see if there are any differences in muscle response.

      Objective:

      The principal objectives are: 1) to explore the effectiveness of anodal high-density direct
      current (HDDC) stimulation of the brain; and 2) test the focality of the technique.

      Study Population:

      Up to 81 healthy volunteers over the age of 18 will be enrolled.

      Design:

      We will perform three studies:

        1. A parallel trial of anodal and sham HDDC delivered to the lateral prefrontal area,

        2. An exploratory evaluation of the focality of HDDC in the motor cortex and

        3. A study to determine whether HDDC can be better targeted using a finite element model
           (FEM) based on the individual subject's MRI scan (obtained as part of the study).

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measures are the effect of anodal HDDC (relative to sham) on category
      verbal fluency, and the decay in the HDDC-induced change in corticospinal output excitability
      with distance from the active electrode. Performance on the California Computerized
      Assessment Package is included as a secondary safety outcome.
