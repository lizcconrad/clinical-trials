  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uremic etiology Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been associated with poorer quality of life
      (QoL) compared to RLS-free counterparts mainly due to sleep deprivation factors. Exercise
      training in hemodialysis (HD) patients with RLS has been proven to be a safe approach in
      temporally ameliorating RLS symptoms similarly to the use of pharmacological treatment with
      dopamine agonists. However it not known whether the exercise anabolic stimulus and the
      dopamine agonist treatment could act synergistically for the improvement of physical
      functioning and muscle performance as well as in the amelioration of augmentation symptoms in
      hemodialysis patients with RLS.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the acute and long term (6 months)
      effect of exercise training in combination with dopamine agonists in quality of life, muscle
      function, sleep quality and metabolism in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS)
      receiving dialysis therapy.

      Objectives - Aims:

        1. To investigate whether a single bout of intradialytic exercise session could have an
           effect in motor restlessness often seen during hemodialysis session in patients with RLS

        2. To investigate whether a 24 weeks therapy with dopamine agonist or placebo will have an
           effect in sleep quality, functional capacity and metabolic profile of the hemodialysis
           patients with RLS

        3. To examine whether dopamine agonists or placebo and aerobic intradialytic exercise act
           synergistically for the improvement of physical functioning and muscle performance as
           well as it could reduce the signs of augmentation in hemodialysis patients with RLS

Patients will be given evening doses of dopamine agonists, 2 hours before bedtime. The dopamine agonists' dose will be 0.25 mg/dose and remain constant until the end of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically stable hemodialysis patients with positive diagnosis in IRLSS questionnaire
             for the RLS will be eligible to participate. Entry criteria included being on chronic
             hemodialysis for six months, able to perform an exercise training, with dialysis
             delivery (KT/V) &gt; 1.1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they were diagnosed with neuropathies or
             reasons for being in a catabolic state (including malignancies, HIV and opportunistic
             infections, active inflammation), within 3 months prior to the start of the study. In
             addition patients treated with drugs recommended for the treatment of RLS as well as
             patients with Parkinson's disease or untreated depression will be also excluded.
