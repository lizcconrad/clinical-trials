    <textblock>
      Tradition holds that the intake of different drinks with a meal has an important influence on
      the digestion of food and postprandial symptoms such as fullness, bloating and satiety;
      however this assumption have never been subjected to controlled study

      A classic example is the Swiss cheese fondue. The intake of white wine, tea and cherry
      schnapps (Kirsch) are often attributed either positive or negative effects on the
      gastrointestinal tract.

      In this study the effect of white wine vs. tea intake during and an alcoholic digestive
      following a high fat, high calorie Swiss fondue meal on gastric emptying and visceral
      perception will be investigated using a randomized, controlled study design.

      The fondue will be labeled with non-radioactive 13C octanoate for assessment of gastric
      emptying by breath-test.
