      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that look for micrometastases in lymph nodes removed during
      surgery for colon cancer may help doctors learn the extent of disease.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying lymph nodes in patients with stage II colon cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether the immunohistochemical and molecular presence of micrometastases in ≥
           12 lymph nodes removed during en-bloc resection in patients with stage II colon cancer
           correlates with 3-year disease-free survival.

        -  Evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular markers detected in the primary tumor
           and develop a microarray-based gene signature for stage II colon cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor tissue and regional lymph node samples are collected during surgery for analysis of
      micrometastases and molecular markers by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, MM qRT-PCR,
      qRDNA-PCR, and microarray profiling.

      Patients are followed up periodically for 4 years after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria: All of the following inclusion criteria must be met in order for the
        subject to be eligible.

          1. Subjects must have CC detected by proctosigmoidoscopy, flexible endoscopy, or
             gastrograffin/barium enema, with no evidence of distant metastases within 8 weeks of
             enrollment.

          2. Subjects with CC must have a computerized tomography (CT; at a minimum - spiral
             (helical) CT with 5-mm contiguous reconstruction algorithms and adequate volume (based
             on site-specific protocols) of oral and intravenous contrast agents) of the abdomen
             and pelvis and a chest x-ray or CT of the chest per standard of care, within 8 weeks
             prior to enrollment to rule out distant metastases. Subjects with preoperative CT
             scans and testing showing non-specific or non-diagnostic (equivocal) abnormalities may
             be eligible pending intraoperative exploration.

          3. Greater than 18 years of age

          4. Subjects must have a performance status ≤ 2 on the ECOG/Zubrod scale.

          5. Subject is able to give informed consent, and must be willing to be followed
             clinically or by phone/email/mail correspondence

          6. Subject must have a life expectancy of greater than 5 years not including the
             disease/diagnosis of CC.

          7. Subject must have clinical assessment conducted by phone unless patients follow up are
             part of the regular clinical visits.

        Exclusion Criteria: Any of the following criteria will exclude the subject from the study.

          1. Subjects requiring emergent surgery (within 2 hours of presentation) to prevent a
             life-threatening situation or death such as those with a perforated colon,
             metabolically significant complete bowel obstruction or massive GI bleeding will be
             excluded. Subjects who do not require emergent surgery, such as those with occult
             bleeding or early or partial bowel obstruction will be permitted to enter.

          2. Subjects with any history of Crohn's disease, chronic ulcerative colitis, or familial
             polyposis.

          3. Discovery of distant metastases intra-operatively.

          4. Subjects with history of another malignancy over the last three years (except for
             completely resected cervical, skin cancers or in-situ cancers - see Appendix B for a
             list of exempt cancers).

          5. Pregnant and/or lactating women. Potentially childbearing subjects (pre-menopausal
             women) should undergo a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to surgery and after
             signing consent. Subjects found to be pregnant will be ineligible and withdrawn from
             the study.

          6. Subjects should not be participating in another research protocol at the time of
             enrollment. Participation during follow-up is acceptable.

          7. Systemic chemotherapy for node negative colon cancer.

          8. Complete polypectomy by endoscopy

          9. Less than 12 lymph nodes
