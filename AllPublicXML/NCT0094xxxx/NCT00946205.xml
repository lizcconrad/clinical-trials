  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present prospective, double-blind, randomized study is to study whether
      laparoscopic anterior mesh rectopexy is as good as laparoscopic posterior rectopexy with
      respect to obstructive defecation afterwards.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Full-thickness rectal prolapse is defined as a &quot;falling down&quot; of the rectum so that it is
      outside the body. Rectal prolapse can only be treated by surgery.

      The choice of procedure depends on the patient's general condition and is based on a clinical
      judgment. Usually, elderly, high-risk patients are treated by perineal procedures. All other
      patients are offered an abdominal rectopexy using open or laparoscopic techniques. The
      general principle for all abdominal procedures is to induce adhesions between the mobilised,
      elevated rectum and the presacral fascia.

      At least 30%-60% develop long-term complications: Obstructive defecation, which may be
      related to peroperative trauma to rectums innervation. Sparing of the lateral stalks during
      the rectal mobilisation results in lower frequency of obstructive defecation afterwards, but
      also higher recurrence rate.

      A nerve-sparing laparoscopic technique for rectal prolapse has been developed in Belgium:
      Laparoscopic anterior mesh rectopexy.

      After this procedure, the rate of obstructed defecations afterwards has been reported to less
      than 10%, that is, much lower than observed after other procedures.

      The functional results after this nerve-sparing laparoscopic technique should be compared to
      those after laparoscopic posterior rectopexy, i.e. the conventional laparoscopic method.

    <description>The rectum is mobilised down to the os coccygeus, then it is elevated cephalic and sutured with a multifilament suture to the presacral fascia just below the sacral promontory. The lateral stalks should be left intact.</description>

    <description>The peritoneum is incised over the right side of the promontory. The incision is extended in an inverted J-form along the right side of rectum and over the deepest part of the pouch of Douglas. Denonvilliers fascia is incised and the rectovaginal (women)/rectovesical (men) septum is broadly opened. A prosthetic mesh (3 x 17 cm) is sutured with nonabsorbable sutures to the ventral aspect of the rectum in the rectovaginal/rectovesical septum and to the lateral seromuscular borders of rectum and fixed upon the promontory using a stapler. The posterior fornix of vagina (women)/floor of the bladder (men) is elevated and sutured to the anterior aspect of the mesh. The incised peritoneum is then closed over the mesh.</description>
