  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in tissues that connect,
           support, or surround other organs in the body. It relies heavily on new blood vessels to
           grow and spread through the body. There is no effective systemic treatment for patients
           with alveolar soft part sarcoma.

        -  The drug AZD2171 (cediranib) is an experimental drug, not yet approved by the Food and
           Drug Administration. The drug blocks the creation of new blood vessels. The drug has had
           initial clinical trials, and researchers are interested in determining whether cediranib
           is effective in inhibiting tumor growth in individuals who have alveolar soft part
           sarcoma.

      Objectives:

      - To find out whether AZD2171 works in patients who have alveolar soft part sarcoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with alveolar soft part
      sarcoma.

      Design:

        -  After an initial screening visit, patients will take AZD2171 by mouth once a day, every
           day for the duration of the study. The treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.

        -  Patients will keep a study diary to record the doses taken, any missed doses, and any
           side effects.

        -  Patients will have the following tests and procedures during the treatment period:
           clinic visit with physical examination every 2 weeks, regular blood pressure monitoring,
           blood and urine tests, heart function tests, imagining scans to evaluate tumor size and
           response to the treatment, and possible tumor biopsy.

      Background:

      Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, highly vascular tumor accounting for less than
      1% of soft tissue sarcomas. There is no effective systemic treatment for patients with
      metastatic ASPS. Little is known with regards to relevant molecular markers as potential
      therapeutic targets. Cediranib (AZD2171), a VEGF/KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has recently
      demonstrated antitumor activity in early phase clinical trials, which included 7 adult and 3
      pediatric patients with ASPS.

      Objectives:

      Adult patients:

        -  To determine the response rate (PR + CR) of AZD2171 in adult patients with ASPS.

        -  To compare gene expression profiles between pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy
           specimens.

      Pediatric patients:

      -To determine if pediatric patients with ASPS will experience at least a minimal response
      rate when treated with AZD2171

      Eligibility:

      Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic alveolar soft part
      sarcoma.

        -  Less than 16 years old. BSA must be greater than or equal to 1.04 m2 and subject must be
           able to swallow tablets.

        -  Adequate organ function.

      Design:

      Adult patients will be treated with AZD2171 at 30 mg by mouth once a day for 28 days (28-day
      cycles). Pediatric patients (&lt; 16 years old) will be treated with 12 mg/m2/day once a day for
      28 day (28-day cycles).

      Blood pressure will be monitored weekly for the first 2 cycles then every 2 weeks for the
      remainder of the study (unless patients have experienced elevated blood pressure requiring
      drug therapy).

      CT scans will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles for restaging during the first 18

      months; after 18 and 36 months, restaging CT scans will be performed every 3 or 4 cycles,
      respectively.

      The study will be conducted using an optimal two-stage design in both pediatric and adult
      patients. The portion in adults will rule out an unacceptably low 5% clinical response rate
      (PR+CR) in favor of a modestly high response rate of 25%. In pediatric patients, the study
      will rule out an unacceptably low 5% overall clinical response rate (CR + PR) in favor of a
      higher response rate of 35%.

      Optional biopsies will be performed in adult patients only at baseline and after 3-5 days of
      treatment (D3-D5) to evaluate early drug effect. A third optional biopsy after completion of
      4 weeks of therapy (between C1D28 and C2D7) may be collected with the intention of providing
      further information about disease response to treatment. Depending on results of initial gene
      expression profiles, the timing of the biopsies may be adjusted, but without change in total
      number of biopsies per patient.

      In a retrospective pilot study, CT scans from 20 consecutive off-study patients will be
      rereviewed. RECIST imaging measurements will be compared to volumetric density (Total Volume
      of Viable Tumor, TVVT) CT measurements. The objective is to establish whether volumetric
      density/percent necrosis algorithms such as TVVT more accurately assess extent of disease and
      response to therapy than standard RECIST criteria.

      The total accrual ceiling is 73 participants (60 adult and 13 pediatric patients).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients must have histologically confirmed alveolar soft part sarcoma. Pathology should be
        confirmed at the Laboratory of Pathology, National Institutes of Health.

        Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
        accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater
        than or equal to 20 millimeters with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to
        10 millimeters with spiral CT scan.

        Patients must have metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma that is not curable by surgery.

        Any prior therapy must have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to
        enrollment on protocol and the participant must have recovered to eligibility levels from
        prior toxicity. Patients should be at least 6 weeks out from nitrosoureas and mitomycin C.
        Prior radiation should have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to study
        enrollment and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels. Patients must be
        greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a
        Phase 0 study (also referred to as an early Phase I study or pre-Phase I study where a
        sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI s discretion, and should
        haverecovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.

        Any degree of prior treatment is allowed, including other anti-angiogenic treatments (e.g.,
        VEGFR2 inhibitors or bevacizumab). Patients with no prior therapy are eligible, provided
        they have metastatic disease that is not curable by surgery.

        BSA greater than or equal to 0.63 square meter.

        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 for adults, Karnofsky performance status
        greater than or equal to 50% for pediatric patients greater than 10 years of age, and
        Lansky performance status greater than or equal to 50 for pediatric patients less than or

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
             normal

          -  creatinine within normal limits based on age as follows:

        Age (Years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (milligrams per deciliter)

        less than or equal to 5 0.8

        5 less than age less than or equal to 10 1.0

        10 less than age less than or equal to 15 1.2

        greater than 15 1.5

        OR

        creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 milliter/min for adults or greater than or
        equal to 60 milliter/min/1.73m2 for children with creatinine levels above institutional
        upper

        limit of normal.

        QTc must be less than 500 msec.

        Pediatric patients: Normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction greater than
        55% or shortening fraction greater than or equal to 7%.

        At present, the potential of AZD2171 for clinically significant drug interactions involving
        the CYP isozymes is unknown. However, studies of the agent in rats indicated possible
        suppression of CYP1A that may be of biological significance.

        Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known

        to affect or with the potential to affect the activity of PK of AZD2171 will be determined
        following review of their case by the Principal Investigator. Efforts should be made to
        switch patients with brain metastases who are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents
        to other medications one week prior to starting therapy.

        AZD2171 has been shown to terminate fetal development in the rat, as expected for a process
        dependent on VEGF signaling. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must have a
        negative pregnancy test prior to study entry. Women of child-bearing potential and men must
        agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
        abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
        woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
        should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Patients should not be receiving any other investigational agents.

        Prior therapy with anti-angiogenic agents is permitted.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the
        study, including, but not limited to: active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled
        diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
        pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia;
        or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        Patients may not be receiving any medication that may markedly affect renal function (e.g.,
        vancomycin, amphotericin, ibuprofen, pentamidine).

        Patients who are unable to swallow tablets.

        Mean QTc greater than 500 msec (with Bazett s correction) in screening electrocardiogram or
        history of familial long QT syndrome.

        Greater than +1 proteinuria on two consecutive dipsticks taken no less than 1 week apart.

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2171 is a VEGF inhibitor with known
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AZD2171, breastfeeding should be
        discontinued if the mother is treated with AZD2171.

        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
        potential for PK interactions with AZD2171.

        Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (hypertension defined as systolic blood
        pressure greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg despite optimal
        medical management).

        Adult patients with hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (hypertension defined as
        systolic blood pressure greater than 150 millimeters of mercury or diastolic pressure
        greater than 90 millimeters of mercury despite optimal medical management). Pediatric
        patients must have BP WNL for age. NOTE: blood pressure within the upper limit of normal is
        defined as: blood pressure less than or equal to the 95th percentile for age, height, and
        gender, and measured, and not be receiving medication for treatment of hypertension.
