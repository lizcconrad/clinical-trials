  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early connections has two broad goals:

        -  to identify risk indices for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 6 to 24 month old infants
           who have an older sibling with ASD or infants who have an older neurotypical sibling.

        -  to assess whether it is possible to alter risk processes through early intervention with
           high-risk infants, thereby reducing social-communication delays or the severity of
           autism symptoms.

      Researchers at the University of Washington want to learn more about the benefits of early
      monitoring and intervention for younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders
      (ASD). The information gained in this study may improve methods of early detection and
      intervention for infants who may be at risk for developing autism and lead to better outcome
      for these young children and their families.

      Participants include families with a child who has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum
      disorder or typical development and a younger sibling 12 months old or younger. The study
      protocol includes: (1) comprehensive infant evaluations at the University of Washington
      Autism Center at 6-months, 12-months, 18-months and 24-months of age. (2) Developmental
      screening for the older sibling. (3) Questionnaires and phone interviews for parents. (4)
      Random assignment to an assessment and monitoring intervention group or a University of
      Washington intervention group. All families will receive advice regarding appropriate
      intervention services. Families who are assigned to the UW intervention will take part in a
      parent delivered intervention.

PFR is a 10 weekly 60-85 minute in-home visits by a masters level mental health provider trained in the PFR curriculum. The PFR curriculum focuses on increasing parenting sensitivity using attachment theory-informed, strength-based consultation strategies. The curriculum is fully manualized and fidelity was assessed according to the manual.</description>
