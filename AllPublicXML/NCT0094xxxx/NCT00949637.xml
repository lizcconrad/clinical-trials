    <textblock>
      Girls and parents affiliated with Girl Scouts Juniors programs completed a questionnaire
      prior to the beginning of an intervention program, and again after the program. Children
      responded to previously validated questionnaire items assessing demographics, parent-child
      connectedness, parent-child physical activity, screen time usage, family meal-time
      environment, consumption of fruits and vegetables, soda, and fast food. Parents completed a
      similar questionnaire, assessing demographics, parent-child connectedness, parent-child
      physical activity, family mealtime environment, parenting style and parenting practices.
      Children were also assessed on height and weight to characterize their risk for overweight
      status. Questionnaires and environmental observations were used to assess the effectiveness
      of an intervention designed to improve the family meal-time environment at home, as well as
      helping to assess the relationships between parental factors and family health-related
      behavior.

    <description>Intervention group will receive a curriculum based on social cognitive theory, wherein children will be taught skills in a supportive environment to improve their self efficacy and proxy efficacy toward eating healthful meals and being physically active with a parent. Troop leaders and parents will provide support, and help girls to create healthy opportunities in the home environment. Simultaneously, girls will be taught skills to improve the family mealtime environment, to bolster asking skills toward healthy behavior, to self-monitor healthy behavior, and to set goals for healthy behavior.</description>
