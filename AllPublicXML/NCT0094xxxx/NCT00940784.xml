  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel (Plavix) and aspirin are two antithrombotic agents (blood thinners) commonly used
      in patients with previous thrombotic events (stroke or heart attack). Thrombosis is the
      formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. Patients with polycythemia vera are routinely
      treated with aspirin which has been shown to be effective in reducing their thrombotic risk.
      However, in polycythemia vera patients with previous thrombosis, a further benefit might be
      obtained by using the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel which is routinely used in
      patients with recent acute myocardial ischemia (reduced blood supply to the heart muscle).
      The study will assess whether this combination therapy greatly increases the risk of bleeding
      versus aspirin alone, if clopidogrel reduces biological factors that might lead to a stroke
      or heart attack, and whether a high number of patients with polycythemia vera are resistant
      to clopidogrel.

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled to the Myeloproliferative Disorders-Research
      Consortium (MPD-RC) study in Europe and the United States with participation expected to last
      for 7 months (6 months of receiving study medication plus a 30 day follow-up visit).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:

          1. A documented diagnosis of polycythemia vera established within 5 years of
             registration. There must be documentation that the patient has met the revised WHO
             criteria for the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Patients must meet the 2 major
             criteria and 1 of the minor criteria. To verify that the criteria have been met, the
             appropriate laboratory or pathology reports must be submitted demonstrating that the
             patient has documentation of these diagnostic criteria.

             Major Criteria:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;18.5 g/dl in men, &gt;16.5 g/dl in women or other evidence of increased
                  red cell volume.

               -  Presence of JAK2V617F or other functionally similar mutation such as JAK2 exon 12
                  mutation

             Minor Criteria:

               -  Bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth
                  (panmyelosis) with prominent erythroid, granulocyte, and megakaryocytic
                  proliferation.

               -  Serum erythropoietin level below the reference range for normal.

               -  Endogenous erythroid colony formation in vitro.

          2. High cardiovascular risk due to having experienced a prior vascular event such as an
             ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or venous thromboembolism. Objective
             documentation of these events must be accurately reviewed and registered. Stroke and
             pulmonary embolism must be documented by an imaging study, deep vein thrombosis by
             ultrasound or other objective methods, myocardial infarction by typical ECG changes
             and/or an increase in serum troponin. Minor thrombotic events such as transient
             ischemic attacks, superficial thrombophlepitis or atypical microcirculatory
             disturbances alone or in combination are considered to qualifying events.

          3. No contraindication to aspirin use such as allergy, a history of a previous
             hemorrhagic stroke or a major gastrointestinal bleed in the previous three months.

          4. Use of hydroxyurea as a cytoreductive agent.

          5. Signed informed consent: Patients must have signed consents for both the ISCLAP
             protocol and for the mandatory correlative biomarker MPD-RC 107 protocol in order to
             be eligible.

          6. Serum bilirubin levels less and or equal to 2 times the upper limit of the normal
             range for the laboratory (ULN).

          7. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels and
             serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less and or equal 2 x ULN.

          8. Serum creatinine levels less and or equal 1.5 x ULN.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             prior to clopidogrel treatment and should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Women
             of childbearing potential must practice effective methods of contraception (those
             generally accepted as standard of care measures). Women of child bearing potential are
             women who have not been menopausal for 12 months or who have not undergone previous
             surgical sterilization. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she must
             use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study period and for 30
             days thereafter.

         10. Age greater than or euql to 18 years to 81 years of age. Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects are excluded from participating in this study if 1 or more of the following
        criteria are met:

          1. Therapy with clopidogrel within the last 12 months.

          2. Any history of prior treatment with aspirin which has resulted in a significant
             clinical adverse event requiring the discontinuation of aspirin therapy (e.g.
             bleeding, GI intolerance, etc. or intolerance to aspirin.

          3. Patients requiring anticoagulation treatment with warfarin, heparin or low molecular
             weight heparin for any medical condition.

          4. Nursing and pregnant females. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her physician
             immediately.

          5. History of a major bleeding event (requiring blood transfusion or hospitalization,
             bleeding at a critical site, or life-threatening).

          6. Clinical indication for the use of clopidogrel and/or a different antithrombotic
             regimen.

          7. History of active substance or alcoholic abuse within the last year.

          8. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to study treatments.
