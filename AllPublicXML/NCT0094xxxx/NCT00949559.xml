      This study is being done to:

        -  Test the safety of EP-100 and see what effect (good and bad) it has on the patient and
           their cancer;

        -  Find the highest dose of EP-100 that can be given without causing bad side effects;

        -  Examine how much EP-100 is in the blood at certain times after it is given and how
           quickly the body gets rid of it;

        -  Observe whether there is any effect of EP-100 on the size and activity of cancer in the
           patient's body.

          -  Acceptable liver function

          -  Acceptable renal function

          -  Serum creatinine within normal limits, OR calculated creatinine clearance greater than
             or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional
             normal.

          -  Acceptable hematologic status:

          -  No clinically significant abnormalities

          -  Acceptable coagulation status:

          -  For men and women of child-producing potential, the use of effective contraceptive
             methods during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV, cardiac disease, myocardial infarction
             within the past 6 months, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia on ECG

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic
             therapy

          -  Pregnant or nursing women. NOTE: Women of child bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy or investigational therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             Day 1. Had received chemotherapy prior to study entry equivalent within 3 to 5
             half-lives of that chemotherapy agent or 4 weeks prior to study entry (whichever is
             shorter) with resolution of any side effects from that previous therapy (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C).

          -  Subjects with a history of CNS metastases will be eligible if they have been treated
             and are stable without symptoms for 4 weeks after completion of treatment, with image
             documentation required, and must be off steroids.

             compression) whose disease may acutely progress if EP-100 administration causes a
             flare reaction.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol

          -  Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C

             mastocytoma, mast cell leukemia, asthma, hay fever, and other allergic disorders and
             disorders that increase mast cell numbers).

          -  Patients under chronic treatment with corticosteroids.

             class 1A or class III antiarrythmic agents.

          -  Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other
             conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or the sponsor

          -  Subjects who are currently receiving any other investigational agent

          -  Subjects should not be using any LHRH agonists (such as leuprolide [Lupron, Eligard],
             buserelin [Suprefact, Suprecor], nafarelin [Synarel], histrelin [Supprelin], goserelin
             [Zoladex], deslorelin [Suprelorin, Ovuplant], Triptorelin and others) or antagonists
             (such as Abarelix [Plenaxis], Cetrorelix [Cetrotide], Ganirelix [Antagon] and others)
             prior to study treatments. If LHRH agonists are being used, a 4-week washout period is
