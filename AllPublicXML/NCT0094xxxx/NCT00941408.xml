      This protocol aims to create a tissue bank of breast tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis
      for the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication, and prediction of
      treatment response in breast cancer. While tissue banks now exist in major hospitals in
      Singapore to collect tumor specimens at the time of surgery, specimens collected at surgery
      from patients who had undergone pre-operative treatment represent a post-treatment sample and
      not a baseline, untreated sample. Such samples are intrinsically different from untreated
      samples, and have to be analyzed separately from untreated samples. However, they remain
      valuable samples, particularly if a pre-treatment sample has been obtained, providing paired
      pre- and post-treatment samples, which could provide valuable information on
      treatment-related tumor biomarker changes. A tissue bank comprising of samples collected
      during the diagnostic core biopsy thus represents a valuable supplement to existing tissue
      banks.

      Approximately 10-20% of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer will require
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, future clinical trials may include
      'window-of-opportunity' studies during which biological therapy is administered for a short
      period (2-3 weeks) while an operable breast cancer patient is awaiting definitive surgery.
      The majority of early-stage breast cancer patients would be eligible for such trials,
      allowing the rapid recruitment of breast cancer patients. When coupled with analysis of
      surrogate markers of response (eg apoptosis, anti-angiogenic effects, etc), these unique
      clinical trials could provide valuable insights into the biological effects of new
      therapeutic agents in evaluation.

      Abstract of Research Proposal:

      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with various subtypes demonstrating differing
      biological behavior, prognosis, and response to therapeutic agents. Improving the
      understanding of the biology of breast cancer can result in better prognostication and
      therapy in individual patients, and has important clinical implications. While valuable
      scientific knowledge is generated from studies of breast cancer cell lines or animal models,
      such information generated in vitro may not fully reflect the in vivo model. Direct analysis
      of patient samples is important to validate in vitro findings, and represents a step closer
      to clinical application. Studying patient tumor samples for genetic and protein markers and
      correlating these analyses with clinical characteristics and outcomes could provide valuable
      insights into tumor biology in vivo, and leads to better understanding of tumor biology and
      resistance mechanisms. This is a single-centre study of biomarker analysis in breast tumors.
      A total of 400 patients with breast lesions for whom a diagnostic core biopsy is planned will
      be enrolled over 2 years. During the diagnostic tumor core biopsy, 3-4 additional tumor
      samples will be obtained through the same needle track for the purpose of this study. The
      tumor cores will be stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent histopathological analysis; DNA,
      RNA and protein will be extracted from tumor cores for genetic, gene expression and
      proteomics studies. The patient's clinical progress will be tracked through the clinical case
      files. For patients in whom the clinical diagnostic biopsy yields a benign result, the
      samples obtained from them will serve as control specimens. For patients in whom the clinical
      diagnostic core biopsy confirms the diagnosis of breast cancer, the samples will be
      considered cases, and the following information will be tracked: histopathological
      characteristics of the tumor including ER/PR/c-erbB2 status and other known prognostic and
      predictive immunohistochemical markers (e.g., Ki67, p53, etc), anti-cancer treatment,
      progression-free and overall survival.
