  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroids are benign tumors that might results in bleeding. Surgery is their definitive
      treatment. Some medical therapies have been tried for women who wish to preserve their
      uterus. Recent reports have demonstrated a role for a new category of drugs called aromatase
      inhibitor (such as Femara) in the treatment of fibroids. This study is conducted to assess
      the effect of Femara (letrozole) on the size of fibroids in women around menopause.

      Fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors that originate in the musculature of the uterus. They
      are the most common cause for removal of the uterus in women. Surgery is the final definitive
      treatment of fibroids. However, surgery is relatively risky. Hence, a few medical therapies
      have been tried for women who wish to preserve their uterus. However, most of those therapies
      have side effects that prohibit their routine use. Recent reports have demonstrated a role
      for a new category of drugs called aromatase inhibitor ( such as Femara) in the treatment of
      fibroids. To the best of our knowledge, this drug has not been studied yet in the management
      of fibroid of the uterus apart from one case report.

      The objective of the current study is to assess the effect of aromatase inhibitors,
      specifically Femara (letrozole) on the size of fibroids in women around menopause. We are
      hoping that by decreasing their size, we could avoid having patients undergo surgery. The
      data generated is invaluable in that sense.
