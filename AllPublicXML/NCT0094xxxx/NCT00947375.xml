      Abstract:

      OBJECTIVE: The current paper reports on a double-blind, randomized study of the role of

      patient's schizophrenia with verbal resistant hallucinosis.

      METHOD:A structured clinical interview, for DSM-IV Axis I Disorder, Patient Edition, was used
      to diagnose schizophrenia according to DSM-IV. Three hundred fifty patients were studied. The
      patients were then randomly divided into two groups on 175 subjects in each group. First
      group patients received either haloperidol deaconate 50 mg in weekly intramuscular and
      lamotrigine 150-200 mg in day per so for 12 weeks. Second group patients were given
      haloperidol deaconate 50 mg in weekly intramuscular and placebo per os for 12 weeks. Data for
      clinical assessments were collected at weeks 0, 6 and 12 weeks. The expressiveness of
      psychopathology was estimated on PANSS. Test response in both groups was defined as a
      reduction in the PANSS by using analysis of variance and chi-square tests.
