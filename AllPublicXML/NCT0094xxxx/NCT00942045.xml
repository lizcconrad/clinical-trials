  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized multi-center study to compare the use of Osteocel Plus
      in subjects who receive ACDF surgery at one or two levels. These subjects will present with
      degenerative conditions in the cervical spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and
      will be screened prior to study enrollment. Subjects will receive Osteocel Plus, without any
      other biologic product, during their ACDF operation. The ACDF procedure will be conducted
      with a radiolucent graft containment device such that progression of fusion can be adequately
      assessed via radiograph. Subjects will be followed for 24-months following surgery to
      determine the number of study subjects that are solidly fused at or before 24 months
      postoperatively, and to determine the mean time to fusion. This data will be compared to
      published and/or retrospective data for autograft, synthetic ceramics and Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein (BMP).

      A total of 175 subjects will be selected for enrollment in this study from multiple centers.
      The subjects will have degenerative conditions in the cervical spine and will be undergoing
      ACDF surgery as treatment at one or two levels. The following eligibility criteria are
      designed to select subjects for whom protocol treatment is considered appropriate. All
      relevant medical and non-medical conditions should be taken into consideration when deciding
      whether this protocol is suitable for a particular subject.

             weeks, unless clinically indicated sooner

          2. Indicated for anterior fusion at one or two contiguous cervical levels (C3 to T1)

          3. Objective evidence of primary diagnosis must be confirmed by appropriate imaging
             studies

          4. 18-70 years of age at the date of written informed consent

          5. Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history and surgeon judgment

          6. Expected to survive at least 2 years beyond surgery

          7. Willing and able to return for post-treatment exams according to the follow-up called
             for in the protocol

          8. Signed and dated Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with

             disease)

          6. Undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, or chronic use of steroids (defined as
             more than 6 weeks of steroid use within 12 months of surgery, other than episodic use
