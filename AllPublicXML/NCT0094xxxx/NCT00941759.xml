  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer. Stage
      IV means that the breast cancer has spread to another part of the body outside the breast.
      This study is important because in different parts of the country some patients are being
      offered surgical treatment for the breast tumor and some are not. The doctors do not know if
      surgery for the breast tumor is helpful in patients with stage IV breast cancer. The doctors
      will collect information about the patient and their treatment to learn more about how
      patients and doctors make treatment decisions. The doctor will also collect blood samples and
      tissue samples for laboratory studies to learn more about tumors that have spread to other
      parts of the body.

    <description>Pt will be asked to undergo a research core needle biopsy of the primary tumor. If pts are not agreeable to a research biopsy then the original diagnostic biopsy material will be requested. They will also undergo a diagnostic biopsy of a metastatic site, if not already performed, and a blood draw as appropriate for correlative science studies. Additionally, patients will complete a general medical questions form at the time of enrollment.</description>

    <description>A blood sample will be collected and patients will complete a general medical questions form at the time of enrollment. Paraffin tissue from the prior surgical procedure will be obtained as Tissue sample. Paraffin tissue from the diagnostic biopsy of a metastatic site will also be obtained. In the event that fresh frozen tissue is available for either site this will also be requested.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        either at the time of consultation with the breast surgeon or breast medical oncologist.
        Patients will be accrued from each of the 15 participating sites.
