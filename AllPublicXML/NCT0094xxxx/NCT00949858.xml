    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop statistical and informatics tools for analyzing and
      visualizing Actical™ (actigraphy) data linked to fatigue in Sleep Medicine Center patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An Actical™ is a watch-like device attached to the wrist that uses an accelerometer to
      measure movement nearly continuously over several days. The American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine practice parameters report that actigraphy is a useful tool for detecting sleep in
      healthy individuals, assessing specific aspects in insomnia and restless legs syndrome,
      circadian-rhythm disorders, and excessive sleepiness. Concurrent with these recommendations
      is an increased interest in the use of actigraphy as a tool for objectively measuring
      fatigue. With improved high-end statistical methods for analyzing this data, actigraphy has
      the potential to become more important as an objective diagnostic tool for determining
      fatigue, sleep abnormalities and assessing response to treatment.
