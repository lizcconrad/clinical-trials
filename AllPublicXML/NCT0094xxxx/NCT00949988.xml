  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase I/II study that will investigate the combination of dasatinib and
      rituximab therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. In phase I, eligible subjects
      will take either 100 mg or 140 mg of dasatinib daily along with rituximab on day 1 of each
      cycle for 6 cycles. In phase II, eligible subjects will all receive the same dose of
      dasatinib, as established in the phase I portion, along with rituximab on day 1 of each cycle
      for 6 cycles.

      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of dasatinib and rituximab will
      demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase I, patients will be enrolled in a standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation scheme with two
      dasatinib cohort doses of 100 mg QD and 140 mg QD x 28 days/cycle with rituximab 500 mg/m2 on
      day 1 of each cycle (375 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1 only). During the first cycle of each dose
      cohort patients will receive dasatinib on days -7 to 0 to allow for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic analysis of single agent dasatinib dosing. Cohorts will be assessed for DLTs
      during the first 2 cycles. Treatment will continue for 6 cycles or until intolerable toxicity
      or disease progression. It is estimated that accrual of 3-6 patients will be completed in 4-6
      months depending on DLTs observed.

      The dasatinib dose established in phase I will move forward to the phase II setting. If there
      are no DLTs, the phase II dose will be chosen based on PD parameters. Dasatinib will be
      administered for 28 days/cycle with rituximab 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle (375 mg/m2 on
      day 1 of cycle 1 only) for 6 cycles or until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. For
      this portion of the study, up to an additional 22 patients will be enrolled over a 6-month
      period for a total of 28 patients at the chosen dose level.

      For both, phase I and II, patients will complete up to six cycles of D+R therapy and
      endpoints will be evaluated 8 weeks after treatment. Patients will be followed until disease
      progression, study withdrawal or death. Patients with a PR or CR will be eligible to remain
      on dasatinib alone.

                  interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          4. No history of allergic reaction to dasatinib.

          5. Use of Prohibited Concomitant Medications

             Subjects requiring any of the following prohibited therapies should not be enrolled:

               -  Bisphosphonates Intravenous bisphosphonates will be withheld for the first 8
                  weeks of treatment due to the risk of hypocalcemia. After the need for Ca2+
                  supplementation has been assessed and levels documented to be &gt;LLN, subjects on
                  prior bisphosphonate may be restarted with caution at the Investigator's
                  discretion.

               -  CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers/Substrates Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by the
                  CYP3A4 enzyme. Therefore, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited during
                  study; for such medications, a wash-out period of ≥ 7 days is required prior to
                  starting dasatinib. Subjects should be advised not to consume substantial
                  quantities of grapefruit juice.

               -  Drugs that may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations:

             CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of dasatinib and
             drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin,
             clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir,
             telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.

             In patients receiving treatment with dasatinib, close monitoring for toxicity and a
             dasatinib dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent
             CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided.

             -Drugs that may decrease dasatinib plasma concentration: CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs that
             induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. In patients in
             whom CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin,
             phenobarbital) are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential
             should be used. If dasatinib must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose
             increase in dasatinib should be considered and approved by the principal investigator.

             -Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by dasatinib: CYP3A4
             Substrates: CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as
             alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide,
             quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)
             should be administered with caution in patients receiving dasatinib.

               -  Less-potent inhibitors, inducers, and substrates of CYP3A4 are restricted.

               -  St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum):

             May decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving
             dasatinib should not take St. John's wort.

               -  Antacids Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH
                  dependent. Simultaneous administration of dasatinib with antacids should be
                  avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at
                  least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of dasatinib.

               -  H2 Blockers/Proton Pump Inhibitors Long-term suppression of gastric acid
                  secretion by H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (eg, famotidine and
                  omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. The concomitant use of H2
                  blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended. The use of
                  antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors
                  in patients receiving dasatinib therapy.

               -  Medications that prolong QT Interval

             Subjects enrolled in this study should not take or begin to take concomitant
             medications known to prolong the QT interval. If such medications are already being
             taken by the patient before study starts, a wash-out period of ≥ 7days is required
             prior to starting dasatinib. Medications known to prolong the QT interval and/or are
             generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes ventricular
             arrhythmia are (see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.htm):

               -  Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide

               -  Amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide

               -  Erythromycin, clarithromycin

               -  Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide

               -  Cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone,
                  halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine Should the
                  Investigator believe that beginning therapy with a potentially QT prolonging
                  medication (other than the ones explicitly prohibited) is vital to an individual
                  subject's care, the Investigator must check that the subject's prior on-therapy
                  ECG has not shown a QTcF ≥ 450 msec or an increase in QTc ≥ 60 msec over the
                  baseline value.

                    -  Anticoagulants and Medications that inhibit Platelet Function Caution should
                       be exercised if patients are required to take medications that inhibit
                       platelet function or anticoagulants.

             Subjects enrolled in this study should not take concomitant medications that durably
             inhibit platelet function. For such medications, a wash-out period of ≥ 7days is
             required prior to starting dasatinib. (Agents that inhibit platelet function
             transiently or inhibit coagulation by other mechanisms are restricted.)

             Medications that directly and durably inhibit platelet function include:

               -  aspirin or aspirin-containing combinations, clopidogrel, dipyridamole

               -  tirofiban, dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, cilostazol, abciximab,
                  ticlopidine, cilostazol

             Medications that directly and durably inhibit anticoagulation include:

               -  warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin [e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin,
                  tinzaparin, enoxaparin]

               -  Exceptions: low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis, and
                  heparin for flushes of IV lines.

          6. Women who are pregnant (including having a positive pregnancy test) or breastfeeding,
             or unable/unwilling to practice an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire
             study period and for at least 4 weeks after cessation of study drug, or men who are
             sexual partners thereof.

               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective
                  method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that
                  risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of
                  the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential
                  risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.

               -  All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving dasatinib.
                  If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive dasatinib and
                  must not be enrolled in the study.

          7. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness
