        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Require primary or secondary nerve injury repair with Hollow Nerve Conduit or AVANCE™
             in at least 1 digital nerve;

          -  Undergo End to End nerve to nerve graft coaptation on both the proximal and distal
             portion of the nerve gap in the AVANCE™ group or nerve entubulation in the Hollow
             Nerve Conduit group;

          -  Be willing to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation schedule over a
             12 Month duration; and

          -  Sign and date an IRB-approved written informed consent prior to initiation of any
             study procedures, including screening procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nerve gaps of &lt; 5 mm or &gt; 20 mm;

          -  Estimated distance of regeneration of &gt;125 mm (distance from injury site to sensory
             target)

          -  Nerve crush or avulsion injuries;

          -  Incomplete nerve transections;

          -  Injury requiring replantation of target digit;

          -  Contralateral digital injuries corresponding to the target digit;

          -  Nerve injuries in the affected limb proximal to the crease of the wrist;

          -  End to side nerve repair;

          -  Injuries with significant vascular damage which may impair adequate perfusion of the
             target limb;

          -  Subjects who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other
             know treatment which affects the growth of neural and/or vascular system;

          -  Use of bovine collagen based hollow nerve conduit in a subject with known or suspected
             bovine sensitivity;

          -  Subjects age ≤18 years or ≥70 years;

          -  History neuropathy, diabetic or any other known neuropathy;

          -  Secondary nerve repair &gt;12 weeks post initial injury;

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational study;

          -  Expected use of medications during the study that are known to cause peripheral
             neuropathy;

          -  History or Reynaud's or other disorder known to compromise circulation or sensation in
             the upper extremity; and

          -  Any subject who at the discretion of the Investigator is not suitable for inclusion in
             the study.
