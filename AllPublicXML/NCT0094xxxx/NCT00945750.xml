  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the CT formulation of famotidine taken with and without
      water is bioequivalent to the FCT formulation. The primary hypothesis is that the area under
      the concentration-time curve (AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of a single
      dose of famotidine 20 mg CT without water are equivalent to a single dose of famotidine 20 mg
      FCT with water.
