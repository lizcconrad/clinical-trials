  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent reports showed that the opioid buprenorphine is a very potent sodium channel blocker.
      Buprenorphine not only exerts a strong antinociception, but also a long lasting
      antihyperalgesic effect. This antihyperalgesic effect is not observed for other clinically
      employed opioids but is common for local anaesthetics.

      The principal aim of the study is to compare the speed of onset and the time of recovery of
      motor blockage achieved by lidocaine and buprenorphine, respectively. The investigators
      hypothesize that the blocking capacity of buprenorphine is equal to the one of lidocaine.
