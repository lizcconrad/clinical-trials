    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of overnight automated closed loop
      glucose control using a computer-based algorithm compared with conventional insulin pump
      therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes following the consumption of a moderate amount of
      alcohol at dinnertime.

      People with type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injections or continuous delivery of insulin
      using an insulin pump. Keeping blood sugars in the normal range is known to reduce the risk
      of long term complications involving the eyes, kidneys and heart. However, achieving
      treatment goals can be very difficult as the tighter we try to control blood glucose levels,
      the greater the risk of the person developing episodes of low glucose levels (hypoglycaemia).
      One solution is using a system where the amount of insulin injected closely matches the blood
      sugar levels on a continuous basis. This can be achieved by what is known as a &quot;closed loop
      system&quot; where a small glucose sensor placed under the skin communicates with a computer
      containing an algorithm that drives a subcutaneous insulin pump. This system is being
      developed in Cambridge and is undergoing trials in children and adults with type 1 diabetes.
      Results thus far show that the system is very effective at preventing hypoglycaemia and
      maintaining blood glucose levels in target range.

      We plan to test the closed loop in various challenging conditions faced by patients in daily
      life. One of these is the consumption of alcohol, which can give rise to delayed
      hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes. The studies will be done in a clinical research
      facility under supervised conditions. Subjects will attend for two study nights where they
      will receive a specific volume of alcohol with an evening meal. On one night this will be
      followed by closed loop algorithm control of their insulin overnight. On the other (control)
      night subjects will remain on their usual pump therapy regime overnight.
