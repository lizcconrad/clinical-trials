    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare intramuscular (IM) ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone)
      and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) for the treatment of an MS (Multiple
      Sclerosis) relapse (exacerbation) after sub-response to an initial 3 day course of IV
      methylprednisolone.
