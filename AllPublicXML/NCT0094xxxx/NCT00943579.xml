      This is an open-label extension study available only to subjects who completed an earlier
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sapropterin in children with autism. During this
      protocol, all subjects will be receiving brand-name Kuvan 20 mg/kg/day for 16 weeks; subject
      who complete the first 16 weeks will have the option of continuing on Kuvan at the same dose
      for up to 90 days after the last subject has completed the first 16 weeks of this protocol.
      The purpose of the study primarily is to gather additional information on safety and efficacy
      in this population.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a summary judgment made by a trained clinician based on observed and reported behaviors of the child compared to baseline. It is a 7-point scale (1) very much improved, (2) much improved, (3) minimally improved (4) no change, (5) minimally worse, (6) much worse and (7) very much worse. Chi-square analyses were used to assess change in CHI-I scores (by group, post-test)Mixed-effects regression models determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. The mixed-effects models accounted for each participant's outcome data at each time point. The mixed-effects regression model is robust to data dependency that occurs with the repeated assessments of individuals over time &amp; can handle missing data. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>

    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, 2nd Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks baseline (week 16 from CHC-0901), 8 and 16. Primary outcome assessment looked at change between baseline (week 16 from CHC-0901 and week 16 of CHC-0902).</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland-2 is semi-structured interview designed to communication, daily living, socialization and motor skills. The Vineland-2 is comprised of a total Adaptive Composite Scale; we chose to use 10 subscales that specifically address functional domains relevant for a young ASD sample - Receptive Communication, Expressive Communication, Personal Daily Living Skills, Domestic Daily Living Skills, Community Daily Living Skills, Interpersonal Relations, Play Skills, Coping Skills, Gross Motor Skills, Fine Motor Skills. The scales generate raw or sum, V-, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores were selected for use in this study. Higher subscale scores indicate more skills. Raw scores can range from 0 to 766 for the overall adaptive behavior composite. Subscales are combined to form the overall Adaptive Behavior Composite, which is essentially a weighted average of the various subscales combined.</description>

    <measure>Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8 &amp; 16</time_frame>
    <description>The C-YBOCS is a scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years. It can be administered by a clinican or trained interviewer in a semi-structured fashion. In general, the ratings depend on the child's and parent's report; however, the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. Rate the characteristics of each item over the prior week up until, and including, the time of the interview. Scores should reflect the average of each item for the entire week, unless otherwise specified.</description>

    <description>Measures expressive &amp; receptive language and total scores in ages 0 to 6 years 11 months. The scales generate raw, standard, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores for the total scale were selected for use in this study. Total is average of subscales. Minimum raw score = 0, maximum = 130. Higher raw scores indicate better language skills. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. The mixed-effects models accounted for each participant's outcome data at each time point.

    <description>This is a 58-item informant-based, factor-analyzed scale comprised of a total scale and 5 subscales that generate raw scores. Scores based on a likert scale ranging from 0-3 where 0 is not a problem to 3 where the problem is severe. Subscales include: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behaviors, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. Total maximum score is 174. Higher subscale scores indicate more symptoms. Scores are totaled to compute subscale scores. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction.

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment spanned from 08/09 - 10/11. Only individuals who completed 0901 (NCT00850070) were eligible to participate in this study thus recruitment was restricted to those already enrolled in that trial. When participants were at their 12-week visit for 0901 (NCT00850070) they were asked if they wanted to continue in the open label extension.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants who consented went straight from the randomized control trial in 0901 (NCT00850070) to entering this trial. No washout period was needed. No participants were excluded who had completed the previous trial.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>This is a summary judgment made by a trained clinician based on observed and reported behaviors of the child compared to baseline. It is a 7-point scale (1) very much improved, (2) much improved, (3) minimally improved (4) no change, (5) minimally worse, (6) much worse and (7) very much worse. Chi-square analyses were used to assess change in CHI-I scores (by group, post-test)Mixed-effects regression models determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. The mixed-effects models accounted for each participant's outcome data at each time point. The mixed-effects regression model is robust to data dependency that occurs with the repeated assessments of individuals over time &amp; can handle missing data. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>

        <description>The Vineland-2 is semi-structured interview designed to communication, daily living, socialization and motor skills. The Vineland-2 is comprised of a total Adaptive Composite Scale; we chose to use 10 subscales that specifically address functional domains relevant for a young ASD sample - Receptive Communication, Expressive Communication, Personal Daily Living Skills, Domestic Daily Living Skills, Community Daily Living Skills, Interpersonal Relations, Play Skills, Coping Skills, Gross Motor Skills, Fine Motor Skills. The scales generate raw or sum, V-, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores were selected for use in this study. Higher subscale scores indicate more skills. Raw scores can range from 0 to 766 for the overall adaptive behavior composite. Subscales are combined to form the overall Adaptive Behavior Composite, which is essentially a weighted average of the various subscales combined.</description>

It can be administered by a clinican or trained interviewer in a semi-structured fashion. In general, the ratings depend on the child's and parent's report; however, the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. Rate the characteristics of each item over the prior week up until, and including, the time of the interview. Scores should reflect the average of each item for the entire week, unless otherwise specified.</description>

          <title>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)</title>
          <description>This is a 58-item informant-based, factor-analyzed scale comprised of a total scale and 5 subscales that generate raw scores. Scores based on a likert scale ranging from 0-3 where 0 is not a problem to 3 where the problem is severe. Subscales include: Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behaviors, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech. Total maximum score is 174. Higher subscale scores indicate more symptoms. Scores are totaled to compute subscale scores. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. The mixed-effects models accounted for each participant's outcome data at each time point. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>
