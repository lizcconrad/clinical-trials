  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label randomized 2 arm study will determine the emergence of viral resistance in
      participants with seasonal influenza A infection treated with oseltamivir. Eligible
      participants less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 5 years of age will be randomized to receive
      oseltamivir at either standard dose (30-75 milligrams [mg] orally twice daily [bid]) or
      double dose (60-150 mg orally bid) for 5 days. Target sample size is greater than (&gt;) 100.
