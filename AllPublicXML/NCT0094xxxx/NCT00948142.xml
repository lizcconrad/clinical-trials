  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of CEM-102 compared to
      Linezolid in the treatment of acute bacterial skin structure infections (ABSSIs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABSSIs are common and affect all age groups. In recent years, ABSSIs caused by multi-drug
      resistant pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have
      become more common. There is an urgent need for additional antibacterial drugs with modes of
      action different from those currently available. CEM-102 is one such agent with excellent
      activity against S. aureus, including MRSA.

          -  Diagnosis of acute bacterial skin-structure infection (ABSSI) of no more than 7 days
             duration which was suspected or proven to be caused, at least in part, by a
             gram-positive pathogen.

          -  Eligible infections included cellulitis measuring at least 10 cm length and width or
             100 cm squared, with or without a focal abscess, and surgical or traumatic wound
             infections

          -  Infection which in the opinion of the investigator will require 10-14 days of
             antibacterial therapy.

          -  Have at least 3 of the following local and/or systemic symptoms and/or signs of
             infection: purulent or seropurulent drainage/discharge, erythema, fluctuance,
             heat/localized warmth, pain/tenderness to palpation, swelling/induration, regional
             lymph node swelling or tenderness, temperature &gt;=100.4 degree F, increased white blood
             cell count, or bandemia.

          -  Must not have received treatment with another systemic antibiotic for the current
             ABSSI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Superficial skin structure infections such as folliculitis, carbuncles, furunculosis,
             cutaneous abscesses, and simple cellulitis.

          -  Infections involving burns, human or animal bites, or chronic diabetic foot ulcers.

          -  Suspected polymicrobial infection involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa

          -  Anticipated need for &gt;14 days of antibiotic therapy.

          -  Infections complicated by the presence of prosthetic materials that will not be
             removed, such as permanent cardiac pacemaker battery packs, mesh, or joint replacement
             prosthesis.

          -  Known significant renal, hepatic, or hematologic impairment.

          -  Received prior potentially effective antimicrobial therapy for the acute bacterial
             skin and skin structure infection, unless they were failing therapy after 48 hours or
             had a gram-positive pathogen non-susceptible to prior therapy identified as a
             causative pathogen.
