      RATIONALE: A PET scan may help doctors learn how the cancer responded to combination
      chemotherapy and whether radiation therapy is also required.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving a PET scan to see how well it
      works in deciding whether patients who have received combination chemotherapy for stage IA or
      stage IIA Hodgkin lymphoma also need radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether patients with stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphoma who have a negative
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging after 3 courses of
           chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine, and
           dacarbazine (ABVD) require consolidation radiotherapy (to areas of previous involvement)
           in order to delay or prevent disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, bleomycin sulfate IV, vinblastine IV,
      and dacarbazine IV (ABVD) on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses. On
      day 15 of the third course of chemotherapy, patients undergo a CT scan of the neck, thorax,
      abdomen and pelvis. Patients with nonresponsive disease or progressive disease are removed
      from the study. Patients who achieve response undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET). Patients with a positive FDG-PET scan receive an additional course of
      ABVD and undergo involved field radiotherapy. Patients with a negative FDG-PET scan are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 6 weeks after completion of course 3 of chemotherapy, patients undergo
           involved field radiotherapy to disease areas.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. After completion of study therapy,
           patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6
           months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
