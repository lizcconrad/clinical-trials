      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of low dose human chorionic
      gonadotropin (HCG) in combination with clomiphen citrate to induce ovulation and its
      endocrine response in patients who had previously failed to ovulate on clomiphen citrate
      alone. The investigators will also compare the effectiveness and endocrine response of this
      approach with the regimen of adding HMG to clomiphen citrate.

      Infertile women with PCOS, who have showed resistance to Clomiphen Citrate (150 mg- 5 days)
      in a previous IUI treatment cycle at Royan Institute (Infertility and Reproductive Medicine
      Research Centre) will enroll in this prospective randomized clinical trial study and will
      randomly be divided into three groups.

      The study protocol will be assessed by an independent institutional review board and Royan
      ethics committee. All subjects will be given the written informed consent.

      Control group (CC/hMG) will receive the 100 mg CC on days 3 to 7 of that cycle but will
      receive 150 mg human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) during days of 7, 8, and 9. One of
      experimental Group (group B) will receive a 100 mg dose of CC but will receive a 200 IU Human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Choriomon; IBSA, Switzerland) intramuscular injection daily when
      the largest follicle is 12 mm or larger mean diameter. Other experimental group (Group C)
      will receive a 100 mg dose of CC but will receive a 200 IU Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG;
      Choriomon; IBSA, Switzerland) intramuscular injection daily From day 9(without attention to
      follicle size). In both experimental groups HCG administration will be continued until the
      largest follicle is 18-20 mm.

      Ultrasound measurements of follicle number and growth, ovulation, gestational sac, and serum
      hormonal levels will be recorded and compared between two groups.
