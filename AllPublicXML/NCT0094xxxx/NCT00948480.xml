  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol was conducted as a single institution trial at Hoag Cancer Center, Hoag
      Hospital, Newport Beach, California. It was a single-arm phase II trial in which patients
      with metastatic melanoma received subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of irradiated autologous
      tumor cells that had been established as short-term cell lines, in conjunction with their own
      dendritic cells (DC) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]. Eligible
      patients had regionally recurrent and/or distant metastatic cancer.

      Patients were stratified by whether they had no measurable disease [NMD] at the time of
      treatment (usually because of surgical resection of metastases), or whether they had
      objectively measurable disease (OMD) by physical examination or radiologic scans per response
      evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST criteria). Key endpoints were the results of
      delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing to their own irradiated tumor cells,
      event-free survival [death or disease progression], overall survival, and objective tumor
      regression in patients who have measurable disease at the time vaccine therapy was initiated.
      This study was activated in the fall of 2000, and closed to accrual in June 2007.
