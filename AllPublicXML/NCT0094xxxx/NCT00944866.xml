  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been associated with increased
      cardiovascular risk. The goal of the present study is to investigate the impacts of COX-2
      inhibitors on biochemical indices in cardiovascular disease. As the reviewer suggested, the
      investigators propose to study the effects of Cox-II inhibitor using experimentally induced
      hyperlipidemic rats. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride concentrations will be
      determined before and after animals treated with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.
      Biochemical markers related to cardiovascular events including prostaglandin I2,
      thromboxaneA2 and others will also be investigated. The investigators will also investigate
      these biochemical markers in patients taking Celecoxib and NSAIDs. The investigators hope
      these studies will reveal clinically useful biochemical markers for cardiovascular events in
      patients taking Cox-II inhibitor.
