    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Randomized, Active-controlled, Rater-blinded Study to to assess the
      efficacy of paliperidone palmitate compared with oral risperidone in delaying time to relapse
      in patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia who are at high risk of relapse. Recently
      diagnosed is defined as first diagnosis of any psychotic disorder within 5 years prior to
      screening. High risk of relapse is defined as having documented occurrence of 3 periods of
      breakthrough symptoms that required a change in patient care per the investigator's judgment
      (e.g., increase in dose, addition of a new drug, increase in the level of psychiatric care,
      notable increases in the frequency or intensity of patient contact required to maintain
      outpatient status, psychiatric hospitalization, etc.) within the previous 24 months,
      including 1 such period within the previous 6 months. Safety evaluations will include Adverse
      Event (AE) reporting, hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory tests, vital signs,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and evaluations of suicidality and sexual functioning. Patients will
      receive either paliperidone palmitate 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq. monthly by injection for two
      years or oral risperidone 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg tabs once daily for two years.

The clinician rates the severity of symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience with schizophrenia subjects using a 7-point scale (1=normal, not at all ill, 2= borderline ill, 3= mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5= markedly ill, 6= severely ill, 7= among the most extremely ill subjects) in response to the question &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how ill is the subject at this time?&quot;.</description>
