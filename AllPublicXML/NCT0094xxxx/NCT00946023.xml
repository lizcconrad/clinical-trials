  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide together
      with total-body irradiation and rituximab works in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma or
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are undergoing an allogeneic (donor) bone marrow transplant.
      The type of bone marrow transplant is a less intensive or &quot;mini&quot; transplant using a relative
      as the bone marrow donor. The donated bone marrow stem cells may replace the patient's immune
      system cells and help destroy any remaining cancer (graft-versus-tumor effect). Patients
      undergoing this type of transplant often have more than one relative who could be a donor.
      The trial is also studying a new way of choosing amongst possible donors which might improve
      how the rituximab works.

    <textblock>
      This phase II for relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies builds on the platform of
      nonmyeloablative, related-donor, HLA-matched or HLA-haploidentical BMT with
      post-transplantation high-dose cyclosphosphamide administered for prophylaxis of
      graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection. Rituximab is added to the transplant regimen
      with the goal of augmenting anti-tumor activity. In patients with B-cell lymphomas, specific
      polymorphisms in the immunoglobulin Fc receptor have been associated with greater sensitivity
      to rituximab or rituximab-based therapies, translating in some series into higher response
      rates and improved progression-free survival. This raises the possibility of selecting donors
      who carry this permissive polymorphism. This trial identifies and selects donors who have the
      favorable polymorphism at FcgammaR3A-158, thereby potentially conferring greater sensitivity
      to rituximab in the host after BMT.

    <description>Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total body irradiation on day -1.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo donor bone marrow infusion on day 0.
Post-transplantation therapy: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4. Beginning day 30, rituximab IV is administered once per week for 8 weeks.
Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Beginning on day 5, patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil until day 35 and tacrolimus (IV then changing to orally) until day 180.</description>
