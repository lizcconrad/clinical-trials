      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two different non-energy
      restricted controlled carbohydrate programs with the American Diabetes Associations' diet on
      glycosylated hemoglobin and other diabetes risk factors in obese adolescents with metabolic
      syndrome, a constellation of symptoms associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two different non-energy
      restricted controlled carbohydrate programs with the American Diabetes Associations' diet on
      glycosylated hemoglobin and other diabetes risk factors in obese adolescents with metabolic
      syndrome, a constellation of symptoms associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease.

      We plan to address the following issues:

        1. To test the hypothesis that a controlled carbohydrate nutrition plan will be superior to
           the standard ADA diet in controlling blood sugar (as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin
           [HbA1C]), decreasing cardiovascular risk factors (Serum Lipid Levels, Blood Pressure)
           and decreasing weight in adolescents with metabolic syndrome

        2. To evaluate the tolerability of a non-energy restricted very-low carbohydrate diet in
           these patients as measured by the SF-10 for Children, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)
           and a scaled questionnaire regarding side effects.

        3. To compare two different maintenance programs in the group who receive the non- energy
           restricted very-low carbohydrate diet and compare each group to the group

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescents and young adults ages 13-18 with a BMI&gt;95% for age or over 30 for young
             adults, with pre-existing metabolic syndrome

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects on any chronic medication other than antihistamines, asthma medications, oral
             contraceptives or diabetes medications, smoke more than 5 cigarettes/day, suffer from
             alcoholism or drug abuse or have any significant abnormality not associated with
             metabolic syndrome on screening labs will be excluded from randomization.

          -  Subjects currently taking Byetta will be excluded from the study, as a side effect of
             the drug is weight loss.

          -  Subjects with familial hypercholesteremia may be excluded if the investigator
             considers the history to be severe. The data collected from subjects with a HBA1C
             greater than 12.5 will be analyzed in a separate group, although they will still be
             randomized to one of the three treatment groups. This is due to the fact that past
             experience has shown that these individuals run a high risk of being non-compliant
             with medication use, diet, and exercise plans. Results from this group will be
             reported separately.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or those desiring pregnancy will be excluded, as the safety
             of this intervention in pregnancy has not been established.
