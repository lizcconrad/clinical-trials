  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, and strokes.
      Potassium lowers blood pressure and may help prevent heart disease and strokes in the general
      population, but has not been well-studied in people with kidney disease. This study will look
      at the benefits and safety of two levels of potassium intake in patients with kidney disease.
      We expect that a higher level of potassium intake safely lowers blood pressure compared to a
      lower level of potassium intake. We hope that this and other research projects will help us
      to learn more so that guidelines can be created for potassium intake in patients with chronic
      kidney disease

    <textblock>
      In individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD), potassium (K) lowers blood pressure (BP)
      and may help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. In animal models, K prevented
      kidney injury and decreased kidney inflammation. CKD patients may especially benefit from
      higher K intake, due to their high prevalence of hypertension, CVD, and stroke, and the
      possibility that K may retard CKD progression. Despite these potential benefits, there is
      great uncertainty about the optimal K intake in CKD patients. K is often restricted in these
      patients due to concerns about elevating serum K. However, renal K excretion does not appear
      to be substantially impaired until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is severely decreased
      (&lt; 10-20 mL/min/1.73 m2). In this randomized feeding study with a two-period crossover
      design, the benefits and safety of 4 weeks of 100 mmol versus 40 mmol K/day in 26
      non-diabetic adults with stage 3 CKD (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be evaluated.
      After a one-week run-in period, all participants will be randomized to receive either a diet
      containing either 40 mmol K/day or 100 mmol K/day (within the current K/DOQI recommendations
      for K intake for stage 3 CKD) during period 1 (they will receive the other during period 2).
      The primary outcome variable is 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are other
      measures of peripheral BP, central BP, inflammatory markers, and serum K. We hope that this
      study will lead to a larger trial with sufficient power to examine the effects of increased K
      intake on clinical outcomes such as CKD progression. The ultimate goal of this effort is to
      develop the scientific basis for guidelines on K intake in CKD.
