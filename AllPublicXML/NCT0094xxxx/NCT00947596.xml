  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroDose Defense Products, LLC is developing an atropine dry powder inhaler (ADPI). This
      pilot study compares the pharmacokinetics (PK) of inhaled dry powder atropine as delivered by
      the ADPI to atropine delivery from the AtroPen autoinjector.
