    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to : 1) determine if vaccenic acid (trans-11-octadecenoic, a
      naturally occurring trans fatty acid isomer from ruminant animal products) raises LDL
      cholesterol in a quantitatively comparable manner as mixed trans fatty acid isomers from
      partially hydrogenated vegetable oils at 3% of energy intake, 2) determine if cis-9, trans-11
      conjugated linoleic acid (a naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acid from ruminant
      animal products) raises LDL cholesterol compared to a control diet, and 3) demonstrate that
      mixed trans fatty acid isomers from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil raises LDL
      cholesterol compared to a low trans fatty acid diet.

          -  Total plasma cholesterol &lt; 280 mg/dl

          -  Fasting triglycerides &lt; 300 mg/dl

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of prescription or over-the-counter medications or supplements that alter lipid
             metabolism.

          -  History or presence of kidney disease, liver disease, gout, certain cancers, thyroid
             disease, gastrointestinal, other metabolic diseases, or malabsorption syndromes.

          -  Type 2 diabetes requiring the use of oral antidiabetic agents or insulin.

          -  History of eating disorders or other dietary patterns which are not consistent with
             the dietary intervention (e.g., vegetarians, very low fat diets, high protein diets).

          -  Women who have given birth during the previous 12 months, pregnant women, women who
             plan to become pregnant or who become pregnant during the study or lactating women.

          -  Volunteers who routinely participate in heavy exercise or volunteers who initiate an
             exercise program during the study.

          -  Volunteers who have lost 10% of body weight within the last 12 months or who plan to
             initiate a weight loss program during the next 10 months.

          -  Use of prescription or over-the-counter antiobesity medications or supplements (e.g.,
             phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine, caffeine, during and for at least 6 months prior to
             the start of the study) or history of a surgical intervention for obesity.

          -  Active cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or procedure within the past three
             months or participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program within last three months,
             stroke or history/treatment for transient ischemic attacks in the past three months,
             or documented history of pulmonary embolus in past six months).

          -  Smokers or other tobacco users (during the 6 months prior to the start of the study).

          -  Unable or unwilling to give informed consent or communicate with study staff.

          -  Self-report of alcohol or substance abuse within the past twelve months and/or current
             acute treatment or rehabilitation program for these problems (long-term participation
             in Alcoholics Anonymous is not an exclusion).

          -  Other medical, psychiatric, or behavioral factors that in the judgment of the
             Principal Investigator may interfere with study participation or the ability to follow
             the intervention protocol.
