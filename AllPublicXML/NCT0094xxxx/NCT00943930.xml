  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the associations among marijuana's discriminative
      stimulus, reinforcing, subjective (e.g. craving) and physiological effects, and to assess the
      relative ability of oral THC to block these effects.

      Volunteers will be asked to live on a research unit for up to twenty-six (26) consecutive
      nights and will participate in a total of 38 study sessions held on 19 weekdays. Each session
      will last approximately four hours and there will be two sessions per day, therefore each
      study day will last approximately eight hours. In addition to these study sessions, an
      orientation session will be conducted on the Friday prior to admission to the inpatient unit,
      and a lottery session will be held on the last day of the study.

      During each study session participants will be asked to smoke a cigarette. The cigarette may
      contain marijuana or it may contain placebo (a blank). Participants will also be asked to
      swallow a capsule 2-hours prior to smoking the cigarette. The capsule could contain placebo
      (a blank), THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the active ingredient in marijuana
      responsible for its mood effects), or d-amphetamine. We will have participants answer
      questions about how the drugs make them feel and measure their vitals signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate, and oxygen saturation) will be measured using a non-invasive (external) vitals
      monitor.

    <measure>To test the ability of oral THC to alter the discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of smoked marijuana.</measure>
    <time_frame>Multiple Choice Procedure Questionnaire (MCP-Q) will be administered after each drug administration sessions and participants will choose between the drug and various amounts of money.</time_frame>
    <description>Three hours after each smoked marijuana dose the participant will complete the MCP-Q to make 15 independent choices between the drug dose sampled and various money amounts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective effects: Self-report questionnaires regarding subjective drug effects, craving, withdrawal symptoms, and marijuana choice will be assessed. Physiological effects: Heart rate, skin temperature, and blood pressure will be monitored.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken throughout a total of 40 sessions (i.e., two sessions per day) conducted over 20 weekdays. Total duration of the stay will be up to 30 days, as sessions will not be run on weekends.</time_frame>
