  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers propose to investigate the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide to
      prevent ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) hepatocyte injury in patients who receive extended donor
      criteria(EDC)liver grafts based on changes in proteomic and metabolomic markers following
      revascularization of the donor graft.

      In reviewing the literature, no uniform extended criteria donor classification exists. The
      characteristics most associated with liver graft failure appear to be cold ischemia time
      greater than 10 hours, warm ischemia time greater than 40 minutes, donor age &gt; 55 years of
      age, donor hospitalization &gt; 5 days, a donation after cardiac death (DCD) graft, and a split
      graft. The researchers will exclude warm ischemia time as this is impossible to predict prior
      to the transplantation. Any donor meeting at least one of the other criteria will be
      classified as an EDC donor.

      Hypothesis 1: Inhaled nitric oxide will improve overall outcome of liver recipients after EDC
      liver transplantation

        -  Suppression of oxidative injury will improve graft function postoperatively as measured
           by International Normalized Ratio (INR) bilirubin, transaminases, and duration of
           hospital stay.

      Hypothesis 2: The mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide is based on
      reduction in post-reperfusion oxidative injury as readily measured by the detectable changes
      in the protein and metabolic profiles in plasma of patients treated with inhaled-NO

        -  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based metabolic markers (xanthine end-products,
           lactate, and hepatic osmolytes) that are consistent with acute liver injury will be
           decreased in NO-treated recipients.

        -  Protein markers of reperfusion injury (argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) and estrogen
           sulfotransferase (EST-1) will be greater in the plasma of patients who are not treated
           with inhaled-NO

        -  Reduced oxidative injury will be reflected by a decrease in the number of mitochondrial
           peroxiredoxins isoforms and the number that are oxidized in NO-treated liver recipients.
