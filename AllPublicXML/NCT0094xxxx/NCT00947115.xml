  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the necessary cause
      of cervical cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and
      safety of the GSK Biologicals' 580299 HPV vaccine up to 10 years after administration of the
      first dose of HPV vaccine (Month 0) in primary study NCT 00196937. This protocol posting
      deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase from Year 5 to Year 10. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase and extension phase up to year 4 are
      presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT 00196937).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were aged 15-55 years at the time of entry into the primary study (NCT00196937). No
      vaccine will be administered in this extension study.

      Results on outcome measures describing analyses on other studies are not reported in this
      record. Please refer to the records mentioned in the respective outcome measure titles.
