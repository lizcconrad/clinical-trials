  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study why some people do not respond to the benefits of
      aspirin therapy. The benefit of aspirin is cardioprotection, or decreasing the risk of heart
      attack and/or stroke. Aspirin works by disabling the platelets, part of the blood cells used
      in clotting, from sticking together and forming blood clots, thus protecting the heart. It
      has been observed that failure to respond to aspirin therapy occurs in about 10% of the
      general population and that despite taking aspirin everyday, this group of non- responders is
      not getting protection for their heart. The investigators would like to determine why and how
      this happens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18 - 55

          -  Subjects must be in good health as based on medical history, physical examination,
             vital signs, and laboratory tests.

          -  All subjects must be non- smoking volunteers

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must be using a medically acceptable method
             of contraception (oral contraception, depo-provera injection, IUD, condom with
             spermicide, diaphragm, cervical cap, progestin implant, abstinence, tubal ligation,
             oophorectomy, TAH) throughout the entire study period. All female subjects must
             consent to a urine pregnancy test at screening and just prior to the start of each
             treatment phase of the study, which must be negative at all time points.

          -  Subjects must be within 30% of their ideal body weight.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing a child.

          -  Subjects, who have received an experimental drug, used an experimental medical device
             within 30 days prior to screening, or who gave a blood donation of ≥ one pint within 8
             weeks prior to screening.

          -  Subjects with any coagulation, bleeding or blood disorders.

          -  Subjects who are sensitive or allergic to aspirin as well as any of their components.

          -  Subjects with documented history of any gastrointestinal disorders, including bleeding
             ulcers.

          -  Subjects with any evidence of cancer.

          -  Subjects with a history of heart disease, including myocardial infarction, angina,
             coronary artery disease, any evidence of coronary artery stenosis, arrhythmias, heart
             failure, having had a CABG

          -  Subjects with renal, hepatic, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic, hematopoietic or
             neurological disorder.

          -  Subjects with any abnormal laboratory value or physical finding that according to the
             investigator may interfere with interpretation of the study results, be indicative of
             an underlying disease state, or compromise the safety of a potential subject.

          -  Subjects who have had a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 6 months.
