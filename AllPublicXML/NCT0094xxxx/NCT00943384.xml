  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronOS Strip is a synthetic bone void filler manufactured from chronOS beta-tricalcium
      phosphate (β-TCP) granules and a resorbable polymer [poly(lactide co-ε-caprolactone)]. The
      chronOS Strip, combined with autogenous bone and/or bone marrow or autograft, is intended to
      be used in the spine for posterolateral fusion.

      The purpose of this prospective, multi-center clinical case series was to evaluate
      posterolateral fusion rates in a prospective series of patients with degenerative disc
      disease. The surgical procedure consisted of instrumented posterolateral fusion with
      interbody support. The chronOS Strip, combined with bone marrow aspirate and local bone, was
      applied to the posterolateral gutters.

    <measure>Posterolateral Fusion Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for posterolateral fusion status was a composite endpoint incorporating posterior bridging bone status, intersegmental motion (angular and translational motion) and posterior hardware status. To have successful posterolateral fusion, a subject had to be successful in all four components at all levels under investigation. Failure to meet any one of the four components indicated failed posterolateral fusion status.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was self-administered to each subject preoperatively and at each clinical follow up examination. Each of the ten questions had six ordered responses coded on a scale from zero to five. The scale ranges from 0-100. A higher score indicates a higher level of disability, and a negative percent change (post surgery minus baseline) indicates improved function.</description>

    <measure>Short Form 12 (SF-12v2) Physical Component Summary (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12v2, comprising 12 questions related to health and wellbeing over the prior four weeks, was administered to subjects preoperatively and at all follow up visits. SF-12v2 represents overall subjective health status by measuring eight health-related parameters (each scored from 0 [poor health] to 100 [better health]): body pain, general mental health, perception of general health, physical functioning, role limitations caused by mental condition, role limitations caused by a physical condition, social functioning, and vitality. First, the eight scales were standardized using means and standard deviations (SD) for the general US population. Second, PCS was scored by aggregating the eight scales using a standardized algorithm. Finally, PCS was standardized using a linear t-score transformation to have a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 in the general US population (expected range: 13-69).</description>

          <description>The subjects completed questionnaires assessing the intensity of pain experienced in the back at the preoperative visit and at all visits postoperatively. Pain intensity was rated on a scale where zero indicated no pain, and 100 represented the worst possible pain. A negative change (post surgery minus baseline) indicated an improvement. Percent change was calculated as: [(Month 24-Baseline)/Baseline]*100%.</description>
          <population>Back pain was assessed in the per-protocol population. Of the 55 subjects who were evaluated at the Month 24 visit, two were missing data related to back pain.</population>

        <description>The SF-12v2, comprising 12 questions related to health and wellbeing over the prior four weeks, was administered to subjects preoperatively and at all follow up visits. SF-12v2 represents overall subjective health status by measuring eight health-related parameters (each scored from 0 [poor health] to 100 [better health]): body pain, general mental health, perception of general health, physical functioning, role limitations caused by mental condition, role limitations caused by a physical condition, social functioning, and vitality. First, the eight scales were standardized using means and standard deviations (SD) for the general US population. Second, PCS was scored by aggregating the eight scales using a standardized algorithm. Finally, PCS was standardized using a linear t-score transformation to have a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 in the general US population (expected range: 13-69).</description>
