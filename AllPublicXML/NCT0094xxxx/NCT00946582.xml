      The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effects of Barkley's parenting
      management program for Taiwanese school-aged children with ADHD. The investigators
      hypothesized that Barkley's parenting management program might empower the parents'
      competence to manage their school-aged children's ADHD-related disturbing behaviors as its
      previously-proven effects for parents and their preschool-aged children with ADHD.

      Participants will be recruited from the child psychiatric clinics of NTUH-Yunlin branch and
      will include 30 school children with ADHD, their parents and teachers. The Kiddie-Schedule
      for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-epidemiology version will be adopted to confirm the
      diagnosis of ADHD. The child participants will received assessments of the Conner's
      Continuous Performance Test, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th edition. We
      use ADHD symptoms, children't wellbeing, parent-child relationship, parent's competence and
      parenting stress as the outcome indices of therapeutic effects.Research instruments employed
      include CBCL, SNAP-IV, Parental Bonding Instrument, The Family Adaptability and Cohesion
      Evaluation Scale, Chinese Health Questionnaire, Parenting Stress Index, Short Form,
      Multidimensional student's life satisfaction scale and Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control
      Scale for Children.
