        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females 18 years of age and older.

          2. If female and of childbearing potential, patients must have a negative pregnancy test
             within 24 hours of study drug administration. In addition, all female patients of
             childbearing potential must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception
             throughout the study.

          3. If deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator, patients entering the
             pharmacokinetic population must be willing to be housed within the investigational
             facility for a minimum of 24 hours following drug administration.

          4. Patients (when able) or legally authorized representatives must have the ability to
             understand the requirements of the study and provide written consent to participate
             and agree to abide by the study requirements.

          5. Patients must have tumor localization by conventional imaging methods prior to
             enrollment (i.e., CT, MRI, US, angiogram).

          6. Patients referred for scintigraphy of solid tumors with a high suspicion of containing
             somatostatin receptor positive tissue.

          7. Patients with first-time tumors must be scheduled for a tissue biopsy. A tissue sample
             will be sent to the core laboratory for conventional histology and
             immunohistochemistry analysis.

          8. Patients with recurrent tumors or progressive tumors must have previous biopsy results
             documented, with previous biopsy tissue obtainable for immunohistochemistry analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving Sandostatin LAR &lt; 21 days prior to dosing or Sandostatin Immediate
             Release (IM) &lt; 24 hours prior to dosing.

          2. Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days of admission into
             this study or plan to participate in a clinical study prior to the end of this study's
             monitoring period (patients on a research protocol using an approved drug are
             accepted).

          3. Patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding or lactating.

          4. Patients with a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating
             circumstance that would significantly decrease study compliance, including all
             prescribed follow-up.

          5. Patients scheduled to undergo any scintigraphy within 7 days prior to study
             participation or PET scanning within 24 hours prior to study participation.
