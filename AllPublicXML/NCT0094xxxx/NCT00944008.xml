      The primary objective is:

        -  To determine the efficacy and safety of DepoCyte®, as the only intrathecal (IT)
           prophylaxis of neuromeningeal relapse for patients between 16 and 30 years old diagnosed
           with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of standard risk treated with the PETHEMA LAL-RI-08
           Protocol Chemotherapy schedule.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of IT DepoCyte® as CNS prophylaxis of CNS via IT for
           patients between 16 and 30 years old with ALL of standard risk.

        -  To compare the frequency of relapse in CNS for patients between 16 and 30 years old with
           standard risk ALL treated with the PETHEMA LAL-RI-08 Protocol Chemotherapy schedule and
           receiving DepoCyte® as the only IT CNS prophylaxis, with that observed in an historic
           group of patients of identical risk that were treated with the PETHEMA LAL-RI/96
           protocol (same systemic chemotherapy and double administration of triple intrathecal
           chemotherapy)

        -  To evaluate the frequency of systemic relapses of standard risk ALL patients between 16
           and 30 years old treated with the PETHEMA LAL-RI-08 Protocol and who receive DepoCyte®
           as the only IT prophylaxis of CNS involvement and to compare with those observed in the
           identical risk patients treated with PETHEMA LAL-RI/96 protocol (same systemic
           chemotherapy and double administration of triple IT chemotherapy)

      A total of 85 patients between 16 and 30 years old with ALL of standard risk will be included
      in the study. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the
      administration of DepoCyte® as the only IT prophylaxis of the neuromeningeal relapse in
      patients between 16 and 30 years old diagnosed with ALL of standard risk.

      The study is divided in:

      Screening: 2 weeks before treatment Treatment: 2 years of systemic treatment according to
      PETHEMA LAL-RI-08 Protocol (Induction, Consolidation 1 and 2, Maintenance-1 with reinductions
      and maintenance 2 with no reinductions). Patients will receive DepoCyte® in Induction,
      Consolidation 1 and 2 and Maintenance 1 (first year). Patients will not receive DepoCyte® in
      Maintenance-2 (second year).

      Follow-up: Patients in the study will be followed up for one year
