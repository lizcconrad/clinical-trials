      The current project will examine the effects of aerobic exercise on cognition among a group
      of veterans who have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that a large number of individuals who experience TBI will
      demonstrate life-long deficits in cognitive or social functions. An estimated 80-90,000
      Americans with TBI suffer life-long impairment of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial
      skills to the degree that they are unable to return to school or work. Research on
      rehabilitation for mTBI has been minimal and typically has focused on speech, pain
      management, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, and sensory disorders. The results of the few
      studies that have examined long-term cognitive effects of mTBI have offered conflicting
      results. The current research will investigate the efficacy of an aerobic exercise
      intervention among individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This project will
      examine changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) values and cognitive functioning among
      individuals diagnosed with mTBI in a monitored aerobic exercise regimen, versus a low impact
      stretching and toning control group.
