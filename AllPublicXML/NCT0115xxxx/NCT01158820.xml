  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol hopes to determine whether the use of dexmedetomidine-ketamine can reduce the
      use of standard of care fentanyl-midazolam sedation during bronchoscopy. This may result in
      less respiratory depression while providing better compliance with the procedure.

    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in the study will be undergoing bronchoscopy, which is typically
      performed with sedation. All procedural sedation carries some risk. Several features of the
      study may lower the risk of sedation relative to that of conventional sedation. An
      anesthesiologist will be present throughout the procedure. Continuous monitoring of
      respiration with RIP will be employed. Administration of sedation will be via a volumetric
      syringe pump. Benefits specific to dexmedetomidine-ketamine include the lack of respiratory
      depression and greater hemodynamic stability.

    <description>Nebulized lidocaine 2% (maximum dose 200 mg) will be administered for 20 minutes.
Following nebulization, syringe A (placebo) will be given at a rate of 1 µg/kg (based on a concentration of 4 µg/ml) for 10 minutes. Supplemental topical anesthesia will be administered by the pulmonologist during this time.
After step 2, syringe B (midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 µg) will be administered by the anesthesiologist. The infusion rate of syringe A (placebo) will be decreased to 0.7 µg/kg/hr. Syringe C (placebo) will be infused at 4 µg/kg/min (based on 10 mg/ml concentration)
Boluses of 0.5 mg midazolam and 12.5 µg fentanyl will be administered by the pulmonologist from syringe D as needed for patient comfort. Syringe E (benadryl 25 mg) will be administered in entirety by the anesthesiologist after the 6th and 16th bolus of midazolam/fentanyl.</description>
