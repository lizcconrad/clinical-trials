      Introduction:

      With the rapid development in technology telemedicine has become a tool with the potential to
      improve and optimize the treatment of different diseases and to make diagnostics, treatment
      and counseling possible over shorter or longer distances.

      Home based telemedicine is a new method that leads to a series of important questions that
      needs to be answered. This study is designed to answer questions concerning patient safety in
      telehomecare, the patients´ quality of life, efficiency and a cost benefit analysis of
      implementing this technology.

      This study is about patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are
      admitted to the hospital with an acute exacerbation. Approximately 24 hours after admission
      half of the patients are randomized to be admitted to their own home supported by telemedical
      equipment while the other half remain admitted at the hospital (typically between 5-7 days).

      Primary Aim:

      To investigate if telemedical surveillance and treatment in the recovery period of an acute
      exacerbation is just as safe as conventional admission of patients with COPD measured on
      treatment failure.

      Secondary Aims:

      To evaluate if telemedical surveillance and treatment in the recovery period of an acute
      exacerbation compared to conventional treatment of COPD:

        1. Is comparable in reestablishing Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1).

        2. Demands the same number of treatment days/time before discharge/cessation of telemedical
           surveillance.

        3. Is comparable in quality of life in the two groups of treated patients.

        4. Have comparable adverse event profiles.

        5. leads to a lower total cost in health services (health economical analysis)

        6. Is possible to do for the patients (drop-outs because of the technical equipment or the
           patient does not know how to use the equipment.)

      7 Is better seen from the physician's perspective when it comes to:

        1. The virtual patient contact / communication

        2. Technology

        3. The work process compared to the conventional work process

        4. Time spent with the patient

        5. Usability

        6. Improvement potentials (&quot;the doctors view&quot;)

           8. The equipment is satisfactory for the patient to use

           Method

           For this study a telemedical platform has been developed on which it is possible to
           treat patients in their own homes. The platform consists of a videoconference part that
           allows the patients to make contact to qualified medical staff and a technology part
           that can transfer vital indicators of the patients´ health condition (lung function,
           oxygen saturation, pulse etc.) 175 patients will be included with an expected drop-out
           of 20 % or 35 patients. The patients will be equally recruited from two hospitals
           (Frederiksberg and Herlev Hospital). All patients must have an exacerbation in their
           COPD that requires hospitalization to be included in this study. Each patient
           participates in the study for 6 months after discharge with follow-up at 1, 3 and 6
           months.

      In addition to the main study, two sub studies will be conducted, using the same intervention
      and subjects as the main study;

        1. COPD patients´ self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital admission -
           implications for clinical practice

        2. Cognitive function and daily life after virtual admission compared to conventional
           hospital admission in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

           Ad. 1: COPD patients´ self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital
           admission - implications for clinical practice

           Background:

           In order to transfer the patient from the hospital to the telemedicine based homecare
           treatment regimen, the patient must be able to perform tests and treatments and also
           contribute to identification of problems and changes in the physical condition. However,
           so far it has not been investigated whether patients using telehomecare have or acquire
           the necessary skills to cope with the problems entailed by COPD, in interaction with
           healthcare professionals and relatives.

           Aim:

           The primary aim of this sub study is to describe what characterizes COPD patients´
           self-efficacy after virtual admission compared to hospital admission.

           Method:

           Self-efficacy will be measured using &quot;The COPD self-efficacy scale&quot;, developed by Wigal
           et al (Chest 1991). The mean score will be compared between the two study arms, and
           furthermore the changes within the two groups will be assessed. Data will be collected
           at baseline, and also three days, six weeks and three months after discharge.

           In addition, analyses will be conducted to explore the association between
           self-efficacy, readmission and the use of bed days during a three month follow-up
           period.

           Ad.2: Cognitive function and daily life after virtual admission compared to conventional
           hospital admission in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

           Background:

           COPD affects distant organs and causes several complications, including cognitive
           dysfunction. The impairment forms a significant clinical problem with consequences for
           the patients such as dependency on help for basic daily activities, increased symptom
           experience and poor compliance with medical treatment.

           Aim:

           The aim of the study is to investigate cognitive function and daily life after virtual
           admission compared to conventional hospital admission in patients with COPD. The study
           is a part of a randomized multicenter trial, investigating the feasibility and safety of
           a telemedicine based treatment regime in COPD patients, compared to conventional
           hospital treatment (Telemedicine technology makes it possible to communicate with the
           patient using a video conference system connected to a telemedicine communication
           platform).

           Method:

           For this sub study, we consecutively include 150 patients from the multicenter trial.
           The primary outcome will be cognitive function evaluated by a neuropsychological test
           battery (ISPOCD), including verbal learning, memory capacity and attention, at
           discharge, and six weeks after discharge. The secondary outcomes is daily life evaluated
           by questionnaires including self-reported cognitive function, self-efficacy, activities
           of daily living, health related quality of life, anxiety and depression, at discharge,
           six weeks and three months after discharge.
