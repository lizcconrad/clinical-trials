  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of elimination of inhalation agent is directly proportional to the degree of
      alveolar ventilation. Using Isocapnic Hyperpnoea (IH) device, it is possible to maintain
      constant end-tidal CO2 with increased minute ventilation. This is achieved by passively
      adding a flow of CO2 to the inspirate in proportion to increases in ventilation above the
      baseline. In animal and human studies IH shortens the time of awakening from isoflurane and
      sevoflurane anesthesia when manual positive pressure ventilation is applied. IH device could
      be used for spontaneous hyperpnoea as well. The investigators want to compare recovery times
      from sevoflurane anesthesia in patients with application of hypercapnic spontaneous
      hyperpnoea (HSH) versus the standard anesthesia protocol (controls). 44 patients ill be
      randomized to either HSH facilitated recovery, or conventional recovery (controls).The time
      intervals from the end of anesthesia (turning off the vaporizer) until recovery milestones
      will be recorded.

    <description>Patient will be disconnected from the anesthetic circuit and connected to the resuscitation bag attached to the IH system. With O2 flow of 2 L/min patient will be gently ventilated until recovery of the spontaneous ventilation. After starting spontaneous ventilation basal O2 flow will be adjusted to keep ETCO2 in range of 50-60 mm Hg or minute ventilation of 15-17 L/min, whichever occurs first.</description>
