  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload, which can be defined operationally as too much iron in the body, develops as a
      consequence of too many blood transfusions given, or due to genetic defects hereditary
      hemochromatosis). Iron accumulates in several organs in the body, such as the heart, liver,
      endocrine glands (pancreas, thyroid, etc.), and spleen. Excessive iron can damage organs and
      may even cause death. Iron overload needs to be appropriately monitored and treated to avoid
      unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

      The present study, GENIOS, proposes to test prospectively the hypothesis that genetic
      modifiers influence the iron overload status of patients receiving transfusions. To test this
      hypothesis, the study will perform genetic studies to investigate possible genetic influences
      for iron accumulation in the body and will study iron accumulation not only in the liver, but
      also in the heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. In addition: the study will investigate if
      these same genes have any role during treatment of iron overload, in other words, if certain
      genetic mutations will influence how iron exits the body. This study will also investigate
      how substances that are known to control the trafficking of iron in and out of the body and
      its damaging effects to the tissues (hepcidin and non transferrin-bound iron) are linked to
      the accumulation of iron in the heart and liver. Iron in the body will be measured by R2*MRI
      and no liver biopsies will be required. Genetic studies will be done by specialized tests
      using peripheral blood DNA.

      Iron accumulates differently in different people and in different organs of the body. Some
      people accumulate iron faster than others, even when receiving the same number of blood
      transfusions

      This study will focus on the following primary objective:

        -  To investigate the association of GSTM1 gene deletion and liver iron concentration in
           patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.

      The Secondary Objectives of the study are:

        -  To explore the role of other iron metabolism-associated candidate genes on liver iron
           concentration of sickle cell patients with transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate
           genes on maintenance and decline of liver iron concentration of patients with sickle
           cell disease and transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 genotypes and other iron metabolism-associated candidate
           genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the heart,
           pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional
           iron overload.

        -  To explore the role of GSTM1 gene deletion and other iron metabolism-associated
           candidate genes on increase, maintenance, and decline of iron concentration in the
           liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen of non-sickle cell patients with
           transfusional iron-overload.

        -  To explore the relationship between Non-Transferrin Bound Iron (NTBI), hepcidin, organ
           function, and iron increase, maintenance, and decline in the liver, heart, pancreas,
           kidneys, and spleen of patients with transfusional iron overload.

      The total volume of blood transfused (in ml/kg) will be collected and stored in the study
      database. Cumulative transfused blood volume (in ml/kg) will be captured. Serum samples will
      be stored frozen at -20°C until the time of analysis. In addition to the protocol-specific
      testing of specimens, study participants will be offered the option of allowing any leftover
      purified DNA, serum, or blood cells to be saved or shared for future analyses. Leftover
      purified genomic DNA, serum, and blood cells from subjects enrolled in the GENIOS protocol
      will be de-identified prior to storage or any future testing and/or sharing.

        Study participants will be patients who receive medical care at St. Jude Children's
        Research Hospital and have developed iron overload secondary to multiple transfusions.
        Patients will be approached during regular outpatient visits and will be invited to
        participate in this study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to
        participate in the study. Non-sickle cell patients with transfusional iron overload
        includes patients with thalassemia, bone marrow failure syndromes, and patients who have
        received multiple blood transfusions due to marrow aplasia secondary to the use of
        chemotherapeutic agents. About 40 participants with sickle cell disease are targeted. About
        10 participants with non-sickle cell disease are targeted.
