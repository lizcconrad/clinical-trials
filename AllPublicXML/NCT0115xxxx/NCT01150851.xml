    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to improve understanding of how metabolic pathways that
      contribute to adiposity also amplify risks of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular
      disease in subjects with moderate to severe CKD. In order to achieve this goal, we propose
      the following aims through a randomized 2x2 factorial design trial in subjects with moderate
      to severe CKD: (a) To assess the feasibility of implementing aerobic exercise and caloric
      restriction interventions, and (b) To examine the effects of aerobic exercise and caloric
      restriction on a metabolic risk profile, including systemic measures of oxidative stress,
      inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that implementation of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise is
      feasible and can improve the metabolic milieu (as assessed by measures of oxidative stress,
      inflammation, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction) in subjects with moderate to
      severe CKD.

      Interim analysis may be performed (no specific plan at this time).
