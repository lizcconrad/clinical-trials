    <textblock>
      Ankle sprain is the most occurring sport related injury. In addition, 40% of the people who
      sustain such an injury display residual symptoms under the general denominator functional
      ankle instability (FAI). In literature, there is already given a lot of attention to
      extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors of FAI. Furthermore, there is a major focus on the
      possible interventions which may be able to reduce the chance of developing chronic
      instability. At this moment there is a lack of unequivocality.

      In this study the investigators address the question of what is the effect of a balance
      training programme on the movement strategy. Therefore kinematics, kinetics, plantar pressure
      measurements and muscle activity are taken in consideration The purpose of this study is a
      better insight in the effect of treatment on the residual symptoms related to FAI.
