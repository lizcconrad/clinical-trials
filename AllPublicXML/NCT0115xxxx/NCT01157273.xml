      Objective: To assess whether the anxiety caused by a task considered anxiogenic, Simulated
      Public Speaking (SPS) test, would change the responses of healthy individuals regarding
      physiological and vocal parameters. Method: The sample comprised 30 participants of both
      genders, 19-42 years old, with no history of psychiatric disorders. The score in the
      STAI-Trait enabled investigators to assign participants to two groups: LOW ANXIETY (LA) and
      HIGH ANXIETY (HA). The investigators evaluated physiological parameters (heart rate, skin
      conductance, temperature in the extremities, electromyogram of the frontal muscle and
      salivary cortisol) and vocal parameters (vocal self-evaluation, quality of life in voice and
      vocal symptoms and signs) BEFORE, DURING and AFTER the SPS.

        Thirty individuals participated in the study, being 18 (60.0%) female and 12 (40.0%) male.
        They were between 19 and 42 years old and their schooling ranged from fundamental school
        (primary and middle school) to post-graduation.

        All the volunteers were in good health, had no history of psychiatric problems or alcohol
        and/or drug abuse, and did not report any vocal problems. Subjects excluded from the sample
        were chronic smokers; had paralysis or neurological diseases; had problems in the upper
        airways or allergic rhinitis at the moment of the experiment; used stimulant, psychotropic,
        anxiolytic, phytotherapic or antidepressant substances, and those who had ingested alcohol
        or coffee on the day of the experiment.
