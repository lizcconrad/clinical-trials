    <textblock>
      In response to the European regulatory authorities, GSK is conducting a post-marketing
      observational study to assess the efficacy of Relenza when used as prophylaxis against
      influenza.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. Determine the frequency of patients who received Relenza from October 2006 through April
           2009, and among them the number who have no concurrent diagnosis of influenza, i.e.,
           those receiving Relenza for prophylaxis, and among these the number who have a family
           member with a medical visit for influenza within three days preceding the above
           indentified patient's dispensing of Relenza. This is to determine the feasibility of
           conducting detailed analysis.

        2. If analysis is feasible then tabulate the frequency of influenza-like-illness and
           respiratory outcomes in users of prophylactic Relenza and their family members and in
           family members of persons using Relenza for the treatment of influenza (i.e., index
           cases).

        3. If analysis is feasible then estimate the direct effect of prophylactic Relenza on the
           occurrence of influenza-like-illness and respiratory outcomes, the secondary effect of
           Relenza treatment of influenza on susceptible family members, and the total effect of
           Relenza (treatment plus prophylaxis).

      METHODS Overview of Study Design This is an analysis of the 30-day risk of influenza-like
      illness and respiratory outcomes in persons for whom some household members (index cases)
      have had a medical visit associated with a diagnosis of influenza. The exposed individuals to
      the index case will be categorized into one of four cohorts according to whether the exposed
      person received prophylactic Relenza or no antiviral treatment and by whether the index
      family member with a diagnosis of influenza received antiviral treatment.

      Estimates of the direct effect of Relenza prophylaxis, the indirect effectof preventing
      disease in susceptible family members, and the total effect of disease reduction when both
      index cases and susceptible family members are treated will be obtained from different
      comparisons between cohorts, as outlined below.

      The research will cover the first three influenza seasons during which Relenza has been
      indicated for prophylactic use in the United States. These will be from October through April
      of 2006-2009.

      ***Patients were not recruited for nor enrolled in this study. This study is a retrospective
      observational study. Data from medical records or insurance claims databases are anonymised
      and used to develop a patient cohort. All diagnoses and treatment are recorded in the course
      of routine medical practice.***

      This analysis will use the i3 Ingenix proprietary National Health Information (NHI) database,
      containing claims and enrollment data back to 1993, with the opportunity to link patient and
      physician survey data to pharmacy and medical claims, and clinical laboratory results. These
      data are use for a wide range of pharmacoepidemiologic, healthcare utilization, and economic
      analyses. In addition to data derived from affiliated health plans, data from large, national
      employer groups are also stored in the database. The data undergo regular audits and quality
      control procedures. The accessible information includes demographics, pharmacy use, and all
      medical and facilities claims, which provide data on services, procedures, and their
      accompanying diagnoses. Underlying information is geographically diverse across the US, and
      is updated frequently. The insured population from which the database draws the data
      comprises approximately 4 percent of the US population. The data used for analysis is
      de-identified.

      Study Cohorts From October 2006 through April 2009, we will count patients receiving
      prophylactic Relenza, defined as a dispensing of Relenza to a person who meets two criteria:
      (1) not having had a diagnosis of influenza associated with medical care on the day of
      dispensing or in the preceding three days, and (2) a household member has had a diagnosis of
      influenza associated with medical care on the day of the index dispensing or within the
      preceding three days. &quot;Household members&quot; will be defined operationally as persons within the
      RDM sharing a common family identifier and address.

      We will assemble the study cohorts for the 3 influenza seasons running from October 2006
      through April 2009. Cohort membership is based on the treatment an individual receives and
      the nature of household exposure.

      Exclusion criteria include:

        -  Sex unknown

        -  Year of birth is missing or where the date of dispensing or service date preceded the
           year of birth

        -  Age at index date is less than 5 years

        -  Not enrolled in the health plan for 6 months prior to the study entry date

      Observation begins for the prophylaxis and treated patients on the day following Relenza
      dispensing and for the non-prophylaxis and untreated patients on the third day following
      their medical visit, and continues for a total of 30 days.

      Covariates For each individual we will identify age, sex, medical conditions requiring care
      in the six months preceding cohort entry from insurance claims for health services. Medical
      conditions requiring care will be defined at the 3-digit ICD9 diagnostic level.

      Outcomes We will identify medical visits and hospitalizations with influenza-like illness and
      respiratory disease in the 30 days following cohort entry.

      Analysis

      Within categories of age of 5-14, 15-44, 45-64 and 65+ years, we will tabulate:

        -  the number of individuals in each of four cohorts (cohorts defined below)

        -  the number of medical visits for influenza-like illness and respiratory illness in the
           30-day follow-up period

      For each outcome we will estimate the following antiviral efficacy measures detailed in
      Halloran's analysis of clinical trials data [Halloran, 2007]. The first two effects below
      will be standardization to the age distribution of all persons receiving prophylactic
      Relenza;

        1. Direct Effect of Relenza Prophylaxis: Risk in Cohort 1 is less than Risk in Cohort 3
           Prophylaxis patient with untreated index case vs patient without prophylaxis with
           untreated index

        2. Total Effect of Relenza Prophylaxis and Treatment: Risk in Cohort 2 is less than Risk in
           Cohort 3 Prophylaxis patient with treated index case vs. patient without prophylaxis
           with untreated index

           We will calculate the following effect estimate with standardization to the age
           distribution of untreated persons.

        3. Protective Effect of Relenza Prophylaxis on Susceptible: Risk in Cohort 2 is less than
           Risk in Cohort 4 Prophylaxis patient with treated index case vs. patient without
           prophylaxis with treated index

      Using binomial regression and a linear risk model, we will obtain adjusted estimates for
      Direct Effect, Total Effect, and Protective Effect, defined as above, adjusted for age group,
      sex, and any diagnosis with a prevalence of at least 10 percent in the cohorts combined.

        The study will use data from the NHI database which includes only those individuals who
        have both medical and pharmacy benefits, and therefore captures most outpatient
        prescription drug exposures and health provider encounters. From October 2006 through April
        2009, we will count patients receiving prophylactic Relenza, defined as a dispensing of
        Relenza to a person who meets 2 criteria: (1) not having had a diagnosis of influenza
        associated with medical care on the day of dispensing or in the preceding 3 days, and (2) a
        household member has had a diagnosis of influenza associated with medical care on the day
        of the prophylactic dispensing or within the preceding 3 days. Household members will be
        defined as persons within the NHI database sharing a common family identifier code.
