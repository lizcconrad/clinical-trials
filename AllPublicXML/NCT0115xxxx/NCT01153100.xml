  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate that the use of Glargine will decrease the duration of an
      insulin drip, the dose of short-acting insulin in the drip, hospital and ICU (intensive care
      unit) length of stay, improve glycemic control, and prevent rebound hyperglycemias when the
      insulin drip is discontinued.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             hyperglycemia with severe illness, pre- and postoperative states, nothing by mouth
             (NPO), as well as gastric (tube feeding) and parenteral nutrition requiring insulin
             drip.

          -  Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) will be included.

          -  Patients with both types of diabetes will be among those treated with the insulin drip
             while being NPO, having severe concomitant illness or receiving enteral and parenteral
             nutrition.

          -  Patients will be of age 19 to 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to consent for the study for any reason including cognitive impairment
             secondary to hyperglycemia, presence of severe medical conditions requiring
             intubation, severe sepsis, hypothermia, and anticipated length of insulin drip 2 weeks
             and longer, pregnancy, Lantus allergy, and concurrent sulfonamide treatment
