      The current study is set up to chart clinically and laboratory findings in Norwegian patients
      with symptoms attributed by themselves or their doctor to ongoing chronic Bb infection.
      Objectives is to assess laboratory findings in relation to established diagnostic criteria
      and to form a picture of the burden of symptoms and illness perception in this group of
      patients. The study is essentially exploratory, and is supposed to raise rather than to test
      hypotheses.
