    <textblock>
      This Study is looking at whether high blood glucose levels after a meal affect arterial
      stiffness more or less than low blood glucose levels, and whether certain cardiovascular
      markers influence the outcome of this.

    <measure>Change in Pulse Wave Amplitude (PWA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 mins (pre-breakfast), 60, 120, 180 and 240 mins (post-breakfast)</time_frame>
    <description>The PWA measured systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index). PWA was reported as a percentage of systolic peak and calculated as the difference between second and first systolic peak in an ascending aortic pulse pressure waveform divided by the first systolic peak then multiplied by 100.

    <description>The PAT device is a pneumatic plethysmograph that applies uniform pressure to the surface of each finger tip and measures digital pulse amplitude. The PAT was reported as a percentage of pulse amplitude and expressed as the ratio of post deflation to baseline pulse amplitude in hyperemic finger divided by the same ratio in the contralateral finger that served as a control. The change in PAT from baseline [30-minute (min) pre-breakfast] is reported.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomized to either a high to low blood glucose sequence or a low to high blood glucose sequence dependent upon whether they received insulin lispro or not in the first study period.

Normal UAER was defined as &lt;20 micrograms per minute (mcg/min) of albumin in the overnight urine collection or &lt;30 milligrams per 24 hours (mg/24h) of albumin in the 24-hour urine collection.</description>

Normal UAER was defined as &lt;20 micrograms per minute (mcg/min) of albumin in the overnight urine collection or &lt;30 milligrams per 24 hours (mg/24h) of albumin in the 24-hour urine collection.</description>

          <title>Change in Pulse Wave Amplitude (PWA)</title>
          <description>The PWA measured systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index). PWA was reported as a percentage of systolic peak and calculated as the difference between second and first systolic peak in an ascending aortic pulse pressure waveform divided by the first systolic peak then multiplied by 100. The change in PWA from baseline [30-minute (min) pre-breakfast] is reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Peripheral Artery Tonometry (PAT)</title>
        <description>The PAT device is a pneumatic plethysmograph that applies uniform pressure to the surface of each finger tip and measures digital pulse amplitude. The PAT was reported as a percentage of pulse amplitude and expressed as the ratio of post deflation to baseline pulse amplitude in hyperemic finger divided by the same ratio in the contralateral finger that served as a control. The change in PAT from baseline [30-minute (min) pre-breakfast] is reported.</description>
