  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that distraction cards used by the caretaker along with a
      vibrating cold pack placed proximal to the site of immunization will decrease the pain of
      routine pediatric immunizations when compared to a placebo device or standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Needle pain is the most common and the most feared source of childhood pain, resulting in
      needle phobia for 10$ of adults. Current standard of care for immunizations in the US is no
      pain relief. An inexpensive, immediately effective form of needle pain control could reduce
      needle phobia or vaccine refusal in the long term if demonstrated to be effective for
      immunization pain.

      Distraction can decrease procedural distress in children by 50%. The effect of using a
      multi-modal pain and distraction relieving approach has not been rigorously studied.

    <description>&quot;Buzzy&quot;, the vibrating cold pack, is held in place with a velcro strap or pressed by caretaker or nurse immediately prior and during immunizations. The vibration is activated and the device remains in place during the shot, moving locations if multiple shots are given. Distraction cards with pictures on one side and questions on the other are shown to the child while the caretaker asks the finding and seeking questions on the back.</description>
