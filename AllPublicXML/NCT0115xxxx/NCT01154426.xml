    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving ABT-888 together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. ABT-888 may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving ABT-888
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the
      combination of ABT-888 and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of ABT-888 and gemcitabine in
      patients with solid tumors.

      II. Determine the effects of ABT-888 and gemcitabine treatment on DNA damage response by
      analysis of markers such as Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 and gemcitabine when administered in
      combination.

      IV. Determine the generation of gemcitabine triphosphate in PBMCs. V. Document any evidence
      of antitumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily on days 1-14 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21* days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.

      NOTE: *Patients previously enrolled on a 4-week schedule (ABT-888 twice daily on days 1-21
      with gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15, and courses repeating
      every 28 days) will continue on the 4-week schedule.

    <description>Plasma concentration versus time data will be analyzed non-compartmentally using PK Solutions 2.0. Data may also be analyzed using compartmental methods as implemented by the ADAPT computer program or a suitable commercially available software package. Relationships between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will be explored and evaluated using the ADAPT computer program or a suitable commercially available software packages.</description>
