      Aim of present study is to inspect, if the removal alone of sentinel lymph nodes in women
      with early Cervix Carcinoma lead to, at equal length, overall survival like entire systematic
      dissection of lymph node and at the same time is accompanied with a considerably reduction of
      associated intra and post operative complications of lymph node dissection.

      For this purpose were randomized about 1200 patients with histological assured cervix
      carcinoma in stages FIGO 1a1 L1 V0, FIGO 1a2 L0 or L1 V0, FIGO1b1 L0 or L1 V0= 2 cm
      randomization. In the branch A takes place exclusively dissection sentinel lymph node, in the
      branch B takes place entire pelvic lymph node dissection. Afterwards takes place in tumor
      free lymph nodes the removal of uterus by a radical hysterectomy or, in presence of the wish
      of children, radical trachelectomy. In affected tumoural lymph nodes takes place systematic
      pelvic and peri aortic lymph node dissection followed by primary Radiochemotherapy.

      Primary end point is overall survival; this for both groups must be equal. Secondary end
      point is peri- and postoperative morbidity inclusive quality of life, the benefits for women
      must be evident with sentinel- lymph node dissection, don't have to show for both groups any
      significant difference.

      After randomization and assignment to experimental or control group lymphadenectomy is
      carried out.

      Four different techniques can be used: 1) laparoscopic transperitoneal 2) laparoscopic
      retroperitoneal 3) open extraperitoneal 4) open transperitoneal. Radioactive labeling of
      sentinel-lymph nodes with 99technetium-marked colloid and/or patent blue is carried out. On
      the day prior to the operation 50mBq 99technetium or on the day of operation 10 mBq
      99technetium is injected subepithelially in the cervix at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.
      Preoperatively 4 cc patent blue are injected in the same manner subepithelially. At the
      beginning of surgery parametrial tumor involvement, intrabdominal tumor dissemination,
      invasion of vesica-cervical and recto-vaginal septum are excluded. A lavage of cul-de-sac for
      cytological analysis is performed. The retroperitoneum is opened lateral of iliac vessels and
      blue colored lymph or radioactive nodes are removed. Sentinel- lymph node's radioactive
      signal is documented in counts per second (cps).

      If no sentinel-lymph node is detected, complete pelvic lymph node dissection is carried out.
      If tumor involved pelvic lymph nodes are shown, paraaortic lymph node dissection is carried
      out. If sentinel- or pelvic lymph nodes are quoted as tumor free at frozen sections, radical
      hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy is performed. Radical hysterectomy follows in an
      extension a type-2 variation. In patients with positive lymph nodes in frozen section or in
      definitive histo-pathology primary chemoradiation is performed.
