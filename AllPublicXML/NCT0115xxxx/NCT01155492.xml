  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut may be a portal of entry for agents that cause or contribute to the causes of
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators are studying changes in the normal population of
      gut flora and in intestinal permeability and their associations with early PD.

    <textblock>
      Clinical and pathological data suggest Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from an
      inflammatory process beginning in the intestinal wall that initiates alpha-synuclein
      aggregation, which then spreads from neuron to neuron, reaching the central nervous system.
      Bacteria living within the intestinal tract produce lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, a toxin
      known to induce parkinsonism in animal models. We hypothesize that exposure to LPS, either
      from excessive production or excessive absorption may be the cause of this inflammation. This
      study aims to: (1) describe differences in the population of gut bacteria in PD compared to
      control subjects; (2) assess leakiness of the gut wall by differential absorption of
      non-absorbable sugars; (3) measure plasma levels of endotoxin and inflammation; and (4) study
      characteristic PD pathology and evidence of inflammation in biopsy samples of the colon
      obtained by sigmoidoscopy.
