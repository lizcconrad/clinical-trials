  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two dose
      levels of an investigational drug-delivery system (LiRIS) in patients who have moderate to
      severe symptoms of interstitial cystitis.

      Approximately 20 female patients with interstitial cystitis will be enrolled in this study at
      multiple centers in Canada. LiRIS is being developed to provide drug therapy directly into
      the urinary bladder. LiRIS contains Lidocaine, a marketed drug (approved by Health Canada)
      which is commonly used for local (skin or oral)anaesthesia. LiRIS is designed to release a
      controlled amount of lidocaine while in the bladder over a 2 week period.

      Two dose groups of approximately 10 patients per group will be enrolled into the study; the
      first group of patients will receive low dose LiRIS, and the second group will receive high
      dose LiRIS. All patients receive LiRIS treatment for 14 days, and clinic follow-up at 7 and
      14 days after treatment. Additional telephone follow-up occurs at approximately 6 and 10
      weeks after LiRIS treatment. The maximum duration of participation, including a screening
      period of up to 14 days, will be 104 days.
