    <description>Participants randomized to this study arm receive an introduction to the study website. Each person utilizes the website to track their daily physical activity steps. Goals are given on a weekly basis to increase steps by 10% per day per week over baseline values. The website channels each participant through a series of motivational messages designed to increase compliance with recommended physical activity targets</description>

          3. Sufficient physical function not to have limitations to participate in physical
             activity demonstrated by:

               -  Habitual gait speed ≥ 1.5 mph, AND

               -  No use of a cane or walker, AND

             examination(&gt;23 score).

          5. Be able to read and write in English

          6. Sedentary behavior, demonstrated by no regular activity / exercise for previous 6
             months and/or a Stage of Change 2 and 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a rapidly progressive or terminal illness condition that is expected to
             result in significant functional decline during the course of the proposed studies.

          2. Significant uncontrolled cardiovascular disease and conditions, e.g. unstable or new
             onset angina, unrepaired aortic aneurysms, critical aortic stenosis or CAD without
             bypass, persistent moderate to severe uncontrolled hypertension.

          3. Significant uncontrolled metabolic disease, e.g. hemoglobin A1c levels greater than
             8.0 and/or glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dL.

          4. Fracture of lower extremity within three months.

          5. Amputation other than toes.

          6. Current history of severe arthritis or orthopedic condition precluding physical
             activity.

          7. Participation in any regular structured exercise (resistance training, Tai Chi, high
             intensity walking, jogging, cycling, stair climbing, stepping, within the previous 6
             months.

          8. Individuals that start a new medication that can impact health variables examined
             during study period (e.g., beta blockers, glucose or cholesterol altering
             medications), or individuals who alter medication dose that can impact health
             variables examined within study period.
