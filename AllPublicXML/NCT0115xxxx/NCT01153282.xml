      Determine the characteristics of symptoms and functional impairment associated with
      chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.

      Taxanes, a type of chemotherapeutic agent prescribed to breast cancer patients, have a known
      physical side effect of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The purpose of
      this qualitative study is to understand the experience and physical functional side effects
      of taxanes. This is the first of a two phase study. The overall goal is to identify existing
      objective physical performance measures to assess functional side effects of taxanes.

        The semi-structured interviews will be conducted with breast cancer patients of the Rena
        Rowan Breast Center of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. A
        purposive sampling strategy in which study participants are recruited based on a particular
        characteristic of experience of interest, will be used to select breast cancer patients
        (N=30). Participants will be recruitedwith the goal of having a balanced sample of women
        who experience documented CIPN (per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE -
        grading criteria, details below) and those who received a taxane but did not have
        documented CIPN.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women 21-70 years old (Women over 70 are offered chemotherapy less frequently because
             of their risk benefit ratio. Including them would be a selection bias because of their
             differential underexposure).

          -  Initiated taxane-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or previously
             untreated metastatic setting.

          -  The range of exposure to taxane-based chemotherapy will include women on active
             treatment having received two cycles, to women who are within three months of their
             last infusion.

          -  Documented symptoms of CIPN per CTCAE grading criteria (half of sample) or NO symptoms
             (half of sample) Grade 0 = no CIPN symptoms Grade 1 = mild symptoms Grade 2 = moderate
             symptoms - prescribed Gabapentin (Neurontin) Grade 3&amp;4= severe symptoms - treated with
             Gabapentin (Neurontin), treatment plan altered

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical disabilities - defined by use of assistive devices to complete functional
             tasks (wheelchair, crutches, prosthetic limbs) prior to starting chemotherapy.

          -  Current exposure to neurotoxic agents (Navelbine, platinums or other taxanes)

          -  Pregnancy during chemotherapy treatment

          -  Diabetes - diagnosed 3 or more years , or insulin dependent, or with clinically
             established neuropathy

          -  Previous exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy

          -  HIV positive (high risk for neuropathy)

          -  Other neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis

          -  Other pre-existing neuropathy
