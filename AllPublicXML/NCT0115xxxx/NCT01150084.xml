  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing rates of sedentary living, often complemented by obesity, among large segments of
      the adult population are associated with costs to individual health and well-being and
      thereby to society as a whole. Although some workplaces offer physical activity
      opportunities, those employees who tend to need it the most (i.e., the health needy) are
      often not attracted. In this project, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate a
      programme that is targeted to the sedentary health needy employees. The investigators will
      work with the corporate partner (a large university) to attract such employees through an
      extensive social marketing driven campaign. A 16-week lunchtime walking programme is proposed
      in which walking groups are offered followed by support and motivational strategies for
      longer term independent walking. The investigators will examine the effects of the programme
      on total amount of walking (including a follow-up assessment 4 months later) and will use
      innovative technology (Smartphones) to also examine the effect of lunchtime walks on
      well-being and work performance within and between participants.
