    <measure>Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Investigator for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 millimeter (mm) in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]). To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required at Week 12 if an initial response was seen at the Week 6 scan. Initial responses (CR/PR) that occured at Week 12 or later were required to be confirmed not less than 4 weeks and not more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. The analysis was performed on Primary efficacy Population which comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of GSK2118436 (All Treated Participants Population) and had a BRAF V600E mutation.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator and an Independent Reviewer for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose of study medication and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. The length of this interval is estimated as the date of death or progression minus date of first dose plus 1 day. Kaplan-Meier model was used to estimate the median and 95 percent confidence interval (CI). For participants who received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was censored at the last adequate assessment. For participants who did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs including systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions as well as local site injection-related reactions were counted throughout treatment phase and follow up phase. Systemic allergic reactions included facial paralysis, flushing, hypersensitivity and rash pruritic. Injection related reactions were considered as systemic non-allergic reactions. Local site reactions included injection site bruising, erythema, pain and reaction. The analysis was performed on All treated Population which comprised of all participants that receive at least one dose of dabrafenib.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Toxicity Grades</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in toxicity grades in clinical chemistry and hematology parameters. The clinical chemistry parameters included alkaline phosphatase, Alanine amino transferase (ALT), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), total bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, potassium, magnesium, sodium and phosphorus. The hematology parameters included hemoglobin, total neutrophils, platelets and white blood cells (WBC). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus Baseline value and was presented in the form of worst case post-baseline value which was the maximum toxicity grade for a participant after the first dose of study drug over the treatment period. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 millimeter (mm) in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]). To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required at Week 12 if an initial response was seen at the Week 6 scan. Initial responses (CR/PR) that occured at Week 12 or later were required to be confirmed not less than 4 weeks and not more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. The analysis was performed on Primary efficacy Population which comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of GSK2118436 (All Treated Participants Population) and had a BRAF V600E mutation.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator and an Independent Reviewer for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose of study medication and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. The length of this interval is estimated as the date of death or progression minus date of first dose plus 1 day. Kaplan-Meier model was used to estimate the median and 95 percent confidence interval (CI). For participants who received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was censored at the last adequate assessment. For participants who did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs including systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions as well as local site injection-related reactions were counted throughout treatment phase and follow up phase. Systemic allergic reactions included facial paralysis, flushing, hypersensitivity and rash pruritic. Injection related reactions were considered as systemic non-allergic reactions. Local site reactions included injection site bruising, erythema, pain and reaction. The analysis was performed on All treated Population which comprised of all participants that receive at least one dose of dabrafenib.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs including systemic allergic and non-allergic reactions as well as local site injection-related reactions were counted throughout treatment phase and follow up phase. Systemic allergic reactions included facial paralysis, flushing, hypersensitivity and rash pruritic. Injection related reactions were considered as systemic non-allergic reactions. Local site reactions included injection site bruising, erythema, pain and reaction. The analysis was performed on All treated Population which comprised of all participants that receive at least one dose of dabrafenib.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Toxicity Grades</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for evaluation of change from Baseline in toxicity grades in clinical chemistry and hematology parameters. The clinical chemistry parameters included alkaline phosphatase, Alanine amino transferase (ALT), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), total bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, potassium, magnesium, sodium and phosphorus. The hematology parameters included hemoglobin, total neutrophils, platelets and white blood cells (WBC). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus Baseline value and was presented in the form of worst case post-baseline value which was the maximum toxicity grade for a participant after the first dose of study drug over the treatment period. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Temperature and Pulse Rate</title>
        <description>Number of participants with change from Baseline in temperature and pulse rate were evaluated from the first dose of study treatment till discontinuation due to any reason. Change from Baseline in worst-case post Baseline value was presented as decrease to &lt;=35, change to normal or no change and increase to &gt;=38. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus Baseline value and was presented in the form of worst case post-baseline value which was the maximum toxicity grade for a participant after the first dose of study drug over the treatment period.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with increase from Baseline in SBP and DBP were evaluated from the first dose of study treatment till discontinuation due to any reason. Change from Baseline in worst-case post Baseline value was presented as any increase to &gt;=80 and increase to &gt;=100 for DBP and as any increase to &gt;=120 and increase to &gt;=160 for SBP. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. The change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus Baseline value and was presented in the form of worst-case post Baseline value which was the maximum toxicity grade for a participant after the first dose of study drug over the treatment period. One participant out of the 92 participants (76 BRAF V600E patients + 16 BRAF V600K patients) did not have SBP and DBP collected after baseline.</description>
