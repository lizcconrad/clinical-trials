  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most countries of the world, including the USA are making preparations for a possible
      influenza pandemic. Such an event will constitute a global public health emergency, but it is
      impossible to predict when this will happen. Up to 80 million people could die worldwide, so
      as much as possible needs to be done in advance to find ways of how the impact can be
      reduced. Although the investigators know that medical interventions such as anti-influenza
      drugs and antibiotics will be important, even in well resourced countries these might be in
      short supply. Vaccines will also be important but these will not be available until at least
      4-5 months after the pandemic has started. This means that other non-pharmaceutical measures
      could well be important such as social distancing, school closures and the use of face masks.
      Guidance also needs to be developed so that families can care for each other whilst
      minimizing the spread of infection. To do these things, the investigators need to know how
      influenza is transmitted from person-to person. This is poorly understood at present. The
      investigators also need to know if face masks work before recommendations for public use can
      be made. The best way to study influenza transmission and the effectiveness of masks is to
      perform a study using healthy adult volunteers. The investigators will do this by giving some
      volunteers normal influenza via nasal drops. When they get symptoms the investigators will
      create an 'experimental household' by getting them to live with other non-infected volunteers
      for 48 hours, in a specially designed quarantine isolation unit. Some of the non-infected
      volunteers will be unprotected; others will be selected randomly to wear either face masks or
      a special plastic 'cloak' so that they do not touch their faces; another group will wear
      both. The investigators will then measure the rate at which the different groups get 'flu'.
      From these data the investigators can work out whether it is touching the face or coughing
      and sneezing that spreads flu most or whether both are important; the investigators can also
      deduce how well face masks work to prevent spread. The investigators need almost 2000
      volunteers for this study, it will take at least 2 years to complete and it will be very
      costly, however, the results will be of global importance. If the study is successful, the
      investigators can tell governments around the world whether face masks work to prevent
      influenza and be clearer about the guidance that should be given to families.

             ability to attend scheduled study visits, and willingness to participate in the
             inpatient challenge.

          -  Willingness to provide written consent for participation after reading the Subject
             Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form and after having adequate opportunity to

          -  Good general health status as determined by a screening evaluation no greater than 160
             days prior to the quarantine challenge phase.

          -  Subjects shall be registered with a general practitioner who will confirm a subjects'
             past medical history and their suitability to participate based on this. Consent will
             be obtained to receive this information.

          -  For female subjects, provision of a history of reliable contraceptive practices
             [hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, oral or implanted contraceptive use,
             intrauterine device, barrier method plus spermicide, history of a single male partner
             with vasectomy and documentary evidence confirming sterility (negative sperm counts at
             the recommended post-operative intervals) or a history of abstinence deemed credible
             by the Investigator]. The provision of this history does NOT replace the requirement
             to perform, and obtain negative results in, pregnancy tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric
             illness, including but not exclusive to the conditions listed in Appendix 7, that in
             the view of the Investigator is associated with increased risk of complications of
             respiratory viral illness [subjects with uncomplicated chronic diagnoses stable and
             treated for 3 months (e.g. mild hypertension well-controlled with medication may be
             enrolled) provided the condition and its therapy are not known to be associated with
             an immunocompromised state or increased risk of complications of respiratory viral
             illness].

             professionals) anticipated to have patient contact within two weeks of viral
             challenge. Healthcare workers who volunteer should not work with patients until 14
             days after challenge or until their symptoms are fully resolved (whichever is the
             longer). Health care workers who work in units housing severely immunocompromised
             patients (e.g. bone marrow transplant units) will be excluded from the study.

             antibody.

          -  Evidence of drug abuse or a positive urine Class A drug or alcohol screen.

          -  Female subjects, who are known to be pregnant or who have a positive urine pregnancy
             test prior to challenge.

          -  Acute (within 7 days of challenge/exposure) or chronic use of any medication or other
             product (prescription or over-the-counter), for symptoms of rhinitis or nasal
             congestion or for any nasopharyngeal complaint, or use of any intranasal medication
             for any indication (this includes any corticosteroid or beta agonist containing nasal
             spray).

          -  Any history during adulthood of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or any
             other condition requiring bronchodilator therapy. A history of childhood asthma until
             and including the age of 12 is acceptable.

          -  Smokers unwilling/unable to desist for the quarantine phase duration of the study and
             any smoker who has a &gt;10 pack year history of smoking. A nicotine test will be done at
             study specific screening and must be negative prior to admission to the quarantine
             unit.

          -  Subjects who have type I or type II Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  Body Mass Index &gt; 30.

             respiratory tract within 1 year prior to challenge.

          -  History of adverse reaction to neuraminidase inhibitors e.g. oseltamivir

          -  Presence of any febrile illness or symptoms of upper viral respiratory infection:

             i. On the day of challenge/exposure or between admission for Influenza
             challenge/exposure and administration of the challenge inoculums (Donors) or exposure
             event (Recipients). Such subjects may be re-evaluated for enrollment in later studies
             after resolution of the illness; ii. Within 2 weeks prior to challenge or if challenge
             is set to occur during November, December, January, February, or March if there are

             medications; (d) any person undergoing or soon to undergo cancer chemotherapy within
             28 days of challenge; (e) any person who has diagnosed emphysema or COPD, is elderly
             residing in a nursing home, or with severe lung disease or medical condition including
             but not exclusive to the conditions listed in Appendix 4; or (f) any person who has
             received a transplant (bone marrow or solid organ).

          -  Any laboratory test which is abnormal and which is deemed by the Investigator to be
             clinically significant. (This includes blood chemistry, haematology, cardiac
             iso-enzymes, or urinalysis).

          -  Known IgA deficiency, immotile cilia syndrome, or Kartagener's syndrome.

          -  History of seasonal hay fever or a seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), including the use
             of symptomatic prescription only medication and non prescription medication.

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical exam, or screening investigations, the
             Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  Those employed or immediate relatives of those employed at Retroscreen Virology Ltd or
             the study site.
