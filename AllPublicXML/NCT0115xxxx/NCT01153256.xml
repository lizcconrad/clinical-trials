  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium had an inhibitory effect on neuromuscular transmission and caused a decrease in
      muscle fiber membrane excitability. It reduces the amount of acetylcholine that is released
      at the motor nerve terminal by decreasing the calcium conductance of presynaptic
      voltage-dependent calcium channels. After pre-treatment with magnesium, an increased speed of
      onset and a prolongation of the recovery period of neuromuscular blockade have been observed
      with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) such as atracurium,
      vecuronium and rocuronium. Rocuronium is the currently preferred NMBA used as an alternative
      to succinylcholine for rapid tracheal intubation. As an alternative to succinylcholine, high
      doses of NMBA have been tested for rapid sequence intubation. This excessively high dose of
      rocuronium, however, prolongs the duration of the neuromuscular block and this may not be
      warranted in every surgical setting.

      The reduction of onset time of rocuronium by magnesium pre-treatment can make intubation
      condition more rapid and much better clinically. It will thus be interesting to compare
      intubation conditions of a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium
      pre-treatment with high dose of rocuronium or standard dose of rocuronium.

    <description>The patients of group M receive 50 mg/kg of magnesium sulphate in 100 ml of isotonic saline over 10 min immediately before anaesthesia induction. After induction of anesthesia with alfentanil (10 μg/kg) and propofol (2 mg/kg), rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg is given over 5 s in a running infusion.</description>
