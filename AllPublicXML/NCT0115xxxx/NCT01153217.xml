      Most of studies have not found any consistent drug-specific association with bone loss and
      controversial data with respect the effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) have been published.
      The more evident finding with respect to this issue is the more pronounced decrease of bone
      mineral density (BMD) in patients during the first weeks of receiving a tenofovir
      (TDF)-containing regimen, probably by the effect of TDF on phosphorus balance and vitamin D
      metabolism.

      The prevalence of osteoporosis in HIV-infected patients could be more than three times
      greater compared with HIV-uninfected subjects, according to the results of a meta-analytical
      review of cross-sectional published studies. The analysis includes data from 884 HIV-infected
      patients and 654 HIV-uninfected controls. Sixty-seven percent of HIV population had reduced
      bone mineral density (BMD), of whom 15% had osteoporosis (OR of 6.4 and 3.7, respectively,
      compared with HIV-uninfected controls).

      In the same meta-analysis, when authors evaluated the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on
      BMD, comparing 202 antiretroviral-naive with 824 ART-treated patients, patients on treatment
      had a 2.5-fold increased odds of prevalent reduced BMD and osteoporosis. And finally, when
      410 non-protease inhibitor (PI)-treated HIV patients were compared with 791 patients
      receiving a PI-containing regimen, those on PIs had increased odds of reduced BMD and
      osteoporosis.

      As well, other studies support data of an impaired BMD in HIV-infected patients after
      starting antiretroviral therapy. These results let us confirm that HIV itself and
      antiretroviral therapy contribute to decrease the BMD.

      However, most of studies have not found any consistent drug-specific association with bone
      loss and controversial data with respect the effect of PIs have been published. The more
      evident finding with respect to this issue is the more pronounced decrease of BMD in patients
      during the first weeks of receiving a tenofovir (TDF)-containing regimen, probably by the
      effect of TDF on phosphorus balance and vitamin D metabolism.
