      The study seeks to gain knowledge about new and of alternative ways of organizing ostomy
      training based on informants' own experiences of life with a stoma.

      The study is designed and conducted as qualitative focus group interviews with three
      different groups of patients with enterostomas (5-8 in each group): a) people with permanent
      enterostoma due to cancer, 2) people with permanent enterostoma due to non-cancer and 3)
      people with a temporary ileostomy.

      The study is investigating the perspective of the patients who have actually experienced
      having surgery and living with an enterostoma.

      By applying this method it is possible to gain access and in depth knowledge of complex
      issues including sensitive data. The dialogue with peers can lead to experiments and
      associations which might stimulate the informants to produce new insights within the
      individual and in the group.

      The interviews will be transcribed in full and analyzed with qualitative content analysis
      with a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach
