  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this SAMMPRIS-affiliated study is to understand the mechanisms the
      mechanisms that underlie ischemic stroke recurrence in high-grade intracranial
      atherosclerotic disease in order to determine predictors of recurrent stroke. MoSIS will
      evaluate 6 specific mechanisms of stroke in the medically-treated SAMMPRIS cohort: decreased
      antegrade flow, progression of stenosis, decreased proximal collateral flow, decreased distal
      collateral flow, impaired cerebrovascular reserve, and artery-to-artery embolism.
