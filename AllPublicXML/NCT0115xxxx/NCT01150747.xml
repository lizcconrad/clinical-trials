  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to prospectively follow 200 women with or at risk of cervicitis to
      determine the chlamydia-specific cellular responses that correlate with protection against
      incident infection. The hypothesis is that a positive IFN-y response by peripheral CD4+ T
      cells responding to stimulation with HSP60 will be significantly associated with protection
      from incident C. trachomatis infection.

  <detailed_description>

      A total of 200 women with or at high risk of having cervicitis will be prospectively followed
      for correlations between chlamydia-specific cellular responses and protection against
      incident infection.

      At enrollment participants will undergo a history and physical examination; blood draw; and
      pelvic examination including collection of vaginal and cervical samples, STD testing and
      endometrial biopsy.

      Participants will have follow up visits conducted at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months following
      enrollment. At the follow-up visits, participants will undergo a repeat history and physical,
      blood draw and pelvic examination including collection of vaginal and cervical samples and
      STD testing.

      The study design will allow comprehensive identification of the antigen-specific cell
      mediated immune responses most strongly associated with protection against C. trachomatis
      infection.

      The primary objective is to prospectively follow 200 women with or at risk for cervicitis to
      determine the chlamydia-specific cellular responses that correlate with protection against
      incident infection.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Women 15-35 years of age. Note: Minors must have written informed consent from her
             parent/legal guardian to participate.

          2. At least one of the following:

               1. Current , untreated endocervical C. trachomatis infection.

               2. Mucopurulent cervicitis: defined by the presence of yellow or green endocervical
                  mucopurulent discharge and/ or easily induced endocervical bleeding (bleeding
                  when the first swab is placed in the endocervix).

               3. Sexual contact with a male partner (regardless of condom use) recently diagnosed
                  (within the past 3 months) with C. trachomatis and/or non-gonococcal urethritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing a baby. Note: a urine pregnancy test will be done at enrollment.
             Result must be negative to participate in the study.

          2. Gynecologic surgery or surgical abortion in preceding 2 months of enrollment.

          3. Allergy to any of the study medications and/or derivatives (cephalosporins,
             azithromycin, erythromycin, any macrolide or ketolide antibiotic) or Type 1
             hypersensitivity allergic reaction to penicillin.

          4. Systemic or vaginal antibiotic therapy in preceding 7 days of enrollment.

          5. Prior hysterectomy.

          6. Menopause.

             participant's safety or with study outcomes.

          8. Participation in any study involving an investigational product in the past 30 days or
             anticipation of participation in any study using an investigational product in the
             next 30 days.
