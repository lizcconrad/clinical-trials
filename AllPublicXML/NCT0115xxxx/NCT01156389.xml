  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyronaridine/ artesunate (Pyramax) is an antimalarial therapy which has been demonstrated to
      be a safe and effective treatment in patients with Plasmodium falciparum and vivax malaria.

      This drug interaction study is intended to investigate if there is any interaction between
      Pyramax and the protease inhibitor ritonavir in healthy subjects using ritonavir as a probe
      substrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I, randomized, study to determine any drug interaction between
      Pyramax (pyronaridine/artesunate) and the protease inhibitor ritonavir in healthy volunteers.
      A total of 34 healthy volunteers (17 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study to have
      at least 30 (15 per treatment arm) completed, and they will be randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either ritonavir (100 mg bid) for 17 days from Day 1-17 plus
      pyronaridine/artesunate (180:60 mg) once daily for 3 days from Day 8-10 in arm A or
      pyronaridine/artesunate (180:60 mg) alone once daily for 3 days from Day 1-3 in arm B.

      Subjects will come to the clinic the evening before first dosing of Pyramax / ritonavir. If
      enrolled, and according to the treatment arm subjects will stay in the clinic and attend
      subsequent visits as follows:

      Arm A:

        -  Inpatient day -1 (evening) to day 17

        -  Ambulatory clinic visit once daily (morning) on day 22, 29, 36, 43 and 50 (end of study
           visit)

      Arm B:

        -  Inpatient day -1 (evening) to day 4 (morning),

        -  Ambulatory clinic visit once daily (morning) on Day 5, 6, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.(end
           of study visit) The subjects will be evaluated for pharmacokinetic parameters and
           safety/tolerability.
