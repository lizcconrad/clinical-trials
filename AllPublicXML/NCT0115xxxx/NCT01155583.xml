  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving azacitidine together with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when
      given together with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Define the highest tolerated low dose (HTLD) and safety of azacitidine given at low but
      increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 twice a week concurrently with GFR-adjusted lenalidomide and
      low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Response according to international response criteria (≥PR) and clinical benefit
           response (≥minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria)

        -  Correlate response with plasma activity of the azacitidine inactivating enzyme cytidine
           deaminase (CDA)

        -  Progression-free survival and overall survival

        -  Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (CD34+) yield and time to neutrophil and
           platelet recovery in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation

        -  Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation in myeloma cells and hematopoietic
           progenitors treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level after cycle 1

        -  Changes in global gene expression in myeloma cells treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level
           after cycle 1

      OUTLINE:

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once or twice weekly and oral dexamethasone once
      weekly starting on day 1. Patients also receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses. Patients then continue to receive lenalidomide
      as maintenance therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
