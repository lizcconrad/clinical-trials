      Atopy patch test in normal population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial diagnostic work up of suspected food allergy includes patient's history, skin
      prick test (SPT), measurement of food specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) with serological
      assays, and more recently the atopy patch test. A positive SPT seems to reflect early
      reactions to food challenges, whereas the atopy patch test has a high diagnostic efficacy for
      late phase clinical reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate atopy patch test
      reaction in non-atopic population.
