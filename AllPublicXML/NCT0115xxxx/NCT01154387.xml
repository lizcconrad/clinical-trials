  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction therapy with antibodies is administered during transplant surgery and for a short
      period of time following transplant surgery in an effort to render the immune system less
      able to mount an initial rejection response. In general, induction therapy is associated with
      better outcomes compared to the absence of induction therapy. However, currently used
      induction agents, some of which are not labeled or indicated for induction therapy in
      transplantation, have drawbacks related to long-term immune system suppression increasing
      susceptibility to opportunistic infections or malignancies, and other immune-mediated side
      effects.

      An unmet medical need exists for a more specific approach to prevent acute organ rejection,
      without unnecessarily exposing the patient to non-specific or open-ended immune suppression,
      which may exacerbate the risks of infections and malignancies. TOL101 is a novel antibody
      that targets a very specific immune cell type that is critical in the acute organ rejection
      response. In this two-part study, TOL101 will be evaluated for the prophylaxis of acute organ
      rejection when used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen that includes steroids, MMF, and
      tacrolimus in first time kidney transplant recipients.

      This study will test the hypothesis that a more specific approach (with TOL101) to prevention
      of acute organ rejection may provide similar or better efficacy than the currently used
      induction antibodies (such as Anti-Thymocyte Globulin or Thymoglobulin) while carrying fewer
      risks in terms of opportunistic infections, malignancies and adverse effects.
