    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      To evaluate the effects of online based mentoring program on the blood glucose and
      satisfaction score in type 1 diabetes patients. Peer group mentoring will be as effective as
      guidance by the doctors.

      Methods:

      80 type 1 patients will be randomly divided into two groups (e.g. mentoring program group and
      control group). All patients will receive routine check up and blood test for ordinary type 1
      patients. In addition, program group patients should register their SMBG, exercise, food
      intake and insulin dose on the website designed for this study and receive advices of mentors
      from peer group. Every patient will submit questionnaire on the first day of the study and
      the last day(after 12 weeks) of the study.

      Subjects with T1DM on intensive insulin therapy and with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) â‰¥8.0% were
      randomized to mentored (glucometer transmission with feedback from mentors) or control
      (glucometer transmission without feedback) groups and were examined for 12 weeks. Five
      mentors were interviewed and selected, of which two were T1DM patients themselves and three
      were parents with at least one child diagnosed with T1DM since more than 5 years ago.
