      The purpose of this post-marketing study is to evaluate the incidence of autoimmune diseases
      (AIDs) following females who have received at the least the first dose of Cervarix® as part
      of their routine health care.

    <description>New onset of cases for endpoints of interest in the targeted population will be identified from ambulatory and inpatient electronic administrative data and will be confirmed by blinded review of the medical record by an Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) that will confirm the AID case and will assess whether the onset of disease falls within the observation period. Fibromyalgia and psoriasis, for which a high number of cases are expected, will be identified from the electronic administrative data only.</description>
