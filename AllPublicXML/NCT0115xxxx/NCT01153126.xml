      This project evaluates the impact of CHESS-Mammo by assessing participants' health
      information competence, psychological distress, and satisfaction with their doctor as
      measured by previously validated survey questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>

      The study consists of two parts. Part 1 (focus groups) interviewed 11 women in total (6
      diagnosed with breast cancer and 5 diagnosed with benign breast disease) reinforced the need
      for online information during the breast diagnostic process. The focus group reviewed online
      CHESS-Mammo module and suggested minor changes to content. Part 2 (Evaluation) will enroll
      130 women in study and compare one group (65 participants) who receives access to CHESS-Mammo
      to another group of women (65 participants) who receive an email message containing screening
      mammography information. Both groups in Part 2 will be evaluated for health information
      competence, psychological distress, and patient satisfaction with physician through
      questionnaires. An evaluation of the group that accesses the CHESS-Mammo website will be
      done. The reason for conducting part 2 of this study is to allow greater insight into the
      clinical application of a novel Interactive Cancer Communication Systems (CHESS-Mammo) early
      in the diagnostic workup of breast cancer. By doing this project, we may achieve an important
      new way of implementing CHESS-Mammo in the clinic.

    <description>This is a randomized controlled trial in which half of the participants will receive access to CHESS-Mammo during their diagnostic workup of an abnormal screening mammogram, and the other half will receive basic information in addition to usual care. This design will allow us to compare the health information competence, psychological distress, and patient satisfaction with their doctor among the two groups.</description>
