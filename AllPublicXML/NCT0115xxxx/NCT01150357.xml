  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind 8 week study will evaluate dose response, efficacy (blood pressure lowering
      effect) and safety of aliskiren in children 6 - 17 years old with hypertension at low, mid
      and high weight-based doses. The low dose ranges from 6.25 mg to 25 mg of aliskiren, the mid
      dose ranges from 37.5 mg to 150 mg of aliskiren and the high dose ranges from 150 mg to 600
      mg of aliskiren. This study is being conducted to support monotherapy registration of
      aliskiren for the treatment of hypertension in children 6-17 years of age.

    <description>Sitting blood pressure was measured using a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer after the participants remained in sitting position for 5 minutes at clinic during the visit. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 1-2 minute intervals and the mean of three sSBP measurements were used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (Week 4 or LOCF)</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) was performed over a 24-hour period using an automatic ABPM device to record the blood pressure as per study defined criteria. The participants who were selected for this evaluation wore the ABPM device for 24 hours, returned to the clinic upon completion of the 24-hour monitoring period for removal of device and BP assessments. The ABPM device was pre-set to collect readings every 20 minutes. Mean hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure were calculated for each participant at post dosing 1 - 24 hours.</description>
