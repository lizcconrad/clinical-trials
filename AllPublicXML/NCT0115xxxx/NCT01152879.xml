      This study is being done to examine the effect of Parenteral (intravenous) nutrition support
      in the home setting on quality of life in cancer patients. In addition, this study is being
      done to examine the effect of home parenteral nutrition on the use of pain and anti-nausea
      medication.

      This is a prospective descriptive non-randomized clinical study to examine quality of life
      outcomes and use of pain and anti-emetic therapy for patients receiving HPN support. The
