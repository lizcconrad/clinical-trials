  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of a national, community-based after-school program
      promoting physical activity (America SCORES) on obesity, fitness and important cardiovascular
      risk factors among minority children. The investigators central hypothesis is that
      established community-based programs, such as America SCORES, can reduce obesity and
      cardiovascular risk among participants. The 1-year study followed 158 children from 6 public
      schools, 3 of which were randomized to have SCORES and 3 to &quot;usual care&quot; after-school
      program. Primary outcomes are change in body mass index (BMI), physical activity (measured by
      accelerometer), and fitness (aerobic capacity assessed with the 20-meter shuttle test).
      Cardiovascular outcomes include blood pressure, body composition (assessed using
      bioelectrical impedance) and waist circumference. The investigators will also measure
      academic outcomes.

      Baseline measures were collected in September 2009; midpoint measures were collected in
      January 2010; and final measures were collected in May 2010. Repeated measures analyses will
      compare trajectories for BMI, physical activity, and fitness between students in the SCORES
      and the usual care arms.
