  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to conduct a systematic comparison of post traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes for veterans receiving exposure therapy via telemedicine
      versus in-person care. The primary aim is to determine feasibility: whether telemedicine can
      be used as a tool to extend effective, specialized mental health services, such as Prolonged
      Exposure therapy (PE; a therapy designed to help clients face fears related to a traumatic
      event), to veterans with limited access to care. A secondary aim is to determine if therapy
      delivered by telemedicine affects the quality of care in terms of clinical outcomes and the
      quality of patient-therapist interaction. A tertiary aim is to examine whether results from
      neuropsychological testing predict treatment outcomes.

      The objective of the proposed study is to conduct a systematic comparison of post traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes for veterans receiving exposure therapy via telemedicine
      versus in-person care. Specifically, prolonged exposure therapy (PE) was conducted with
      veterans individually, either in person or via videoconferencing technology. PE is designed
      to help clients face fears related to a traumatic experience by guiding individuals through
      exposures to the memory of the event (called &quot;imaginal exposure&quot;) and exposures to feared
      situations (called &quot;in vivo&quot; exposures).

      The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of whether telemedicine can be used as a tool
      to extend effective, specialized mental health services, such as PE to veterans with limited
      access to care. This is measured in part through patient and therapist satisfaction ratings
      in each condition.

      A secondary aim is to determine if therapy delivered by telemedicine affects the quality of
      care in terms of clinical outcomes and the quality of patient-therapist interaction. This is
      measured by relative changes in symptoms, primarily in PTSD, depressive symptoms, and anxiety
      symptoms.

      A tertiary aim is to examine whether results from neuropsychological testing predict
      treatment outcomes across conditions. This includes seven measures of executive functioning.
      The hypothesis is that poorer performance on these measures may be associated with less
      improvement on measures of symptom severity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis of chronic PTSD due to combat; comorbid mood and anxiety disorders
             are expected, and will be permitted (to maximize generalizability) if PTSD symptoms
             are judged to be predominant based on primacy and severity of symptoms

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  English literacy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unmanaged psychosis or manic episodes in past year

          -  Concurrent psychotherapies targeting PTSD or depression or that entail exposure
             therapy [veterans who are engaged in treatment for non-PTSD symptoms (e.g., 12-step
             programs for substance problems) will be eligible]

          -  Severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease that would make it difficult to ensure
             regular attendance at psychotherapy sessions

          -  Probable dementia; OR

          -  Head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness longer than 20 minutes. Potential
             participants who have had changes in the type and dosage of psychotropic medications
             in the preceding two months will be asked to wait until their medication regimen has
             stabilized to minimize treatment confounds.
