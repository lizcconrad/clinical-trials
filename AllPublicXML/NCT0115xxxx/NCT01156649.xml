  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a problem for a large number of children and can result in
      problems with thinking patterns, behaviors and sleep if left untreated. Little is known about
      how positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy might help children who need treatment for
      obstructive sleep apnea. We will investigate how PAP therapy might be able to improve
      thinking patterns, behavior and sleep problems in children with obstructive sleep apnea.

    <textblock>
      Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment which can
      improve neurocognitive performance and sleep patterns in adults with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA). However, the effect of PAP therapy on neurocognitive, behavioral and sleep patterns in
      school-aged children with OSA is not well known. The goal of this innovative study is to
      conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, trial which will determine the
      effects of PAP therapy on neurocognitive and behavioral patterns and sleep architecture in
      children with OSA. A battery of neurocognitive tests and parent behavioral rating assessments
      will be given to school-aged children with OSA before, after 3 months and again after 6
      months of treatment with PAP therapy only; or 3 months of PAP placebo use followed by 3
      months of PAP therapy. Full polysomnography and PAP titration sleep studies will be performed
      following a night of adaptation sleep in a sleep laboratory at all three time points.
      Compliance to PAP therapy will be monitored on a daily basis with a remote internet-linked
      communicator that is attached to the participant's PAP pressure generator. The hypothesis of
      this ground-breaking project is that 3 months of continuous compliance to a regimen of PAP
      therapy will result in significant improvement in neurocognitive and behavioral patterns and
      that sleep architecture will be positively changed to become more reflective of normative
      values for school-aged children. The results of this innovative and ground-breaking study
      will have far-reaching effects for sleep clinicians and other health care providers in
      support of the continued use of PAP therapy as a treatment for OSA and to inform the
      health-care community about the efficacy of PAP therapy on neurocognition and behavior
      patterns in school-aged children with OSA.

          1. Age between 6.0 and 11.9 years

          2. Nocturnal PSG (polysomnography) shows an apnea/hypopnea index of at least 1.5-10
             events on average per hour of sleep and an apnea index of less than 1 per hour (mild
             to moderate OSA group), or, PSG shows an apnea index of 1 or greater PLUS an
             apnea/hypopnea index of 10.0 or greater (severe OSA group).
