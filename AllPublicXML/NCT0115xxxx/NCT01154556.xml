      An observational retrospective study of NNRTI experienced patients who have virologically
      failed. The study aims to assess resistance profiling and subsequent prescription patterns of
      patients on NNRTIs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study involving retrospective review of HIV-1 positive patient
      records who began treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and
      subsequently failed. Patients who have virologically failed previous NNRTI treatment, or have
      resistance to 1 drug in the NNRTI class are examined further. Such patients will have
      attended the clinic every 3-6 months for routine medical care. The data source for variables
      collected is the patient's electronic medical records. This database is located at Holdsworth
      House Medical Practice (HHMP), Sydney.
