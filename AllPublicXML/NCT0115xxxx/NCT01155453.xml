  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose finding, phase Ib clinical trial to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and /or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule for the PI3K
      (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase) inhibitor BKM120 given in combination with the MEK inhibitor
      GSK1120212 in patients with selected, advanced solid tumors. The focus will be on tumors with
      RAS/RAF mutations and on triple negative breast cancer.

      Both study drugs will be administered once daily orally on a continuous schedule, a treatment
      cycle is defined as 28 days.

      Cohorts of at least 3 and up to a maximum of 6 patients eligible for the dose-determining set
      will be enrolled per dose combination below the MTD. The MTD is defined as the highest drug
      dosage not causing in the first cycle of treatment medically unacceptable, dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) in more than 33% of the treated patients.. At least 12 patients will be
      required at MTD and 6 patients at RP2D level to allow the evaluation of the combination's
      safety and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.

      Upon declaration of MTD and/or RP2D, patients will be enrolled to an expansion part of the
      study, to further assess safety, as well as to learn more about the efficacy of the study
      drug combination.

        -  Expansion Arm 1 will consist of approximately 15 patients with RAS or BRAF mutant
           advanced NSCLC

        -  Expansion Arm 2 will consist of approximately 15 patients with RAS or BRAF-mutant
           ovarian cancer

        -  Expansion Arm 3 will consist of approximately 15 patients with RAS or BRAF-mutant
           pancreatic cancer
