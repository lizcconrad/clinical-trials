  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home bi-level positive pressure ventilators are equipped with built-in softwares which
      measure and record specific items such as tidal volume, total ventilation, leaks, respiratory
      rate, cycles triggered by the patient. These items have not to date been described in a large
      group of patients under home mechanical ventilation.

      Observational study of patients under home positive pressure mechanical ventilation, in a
      stable condition.

      Data recorded by ventilator software is downloaded by specialized nurses during elective home
      visits, as well as spirometry, results of recent pulse oximetry, ventilator settings,
      diagnosis, and basic anthropometric data.

      Items recorded by ventilator software are: tidal volume, total ventilation, apnea and
      hypopnea index, leaks, percentage of inspiratory cycles triggered by ventilator, spontaneous
      and back-up respiratory rates.

      Results are reported by diagnostic group. Statistical analysis (univariate and multivariate)
      aims to determine which variables are related to unintentional leaks, and whether ventilator
      settings differ significantly between diagnostic groups.

    <description>Analysis of data provided by ventilator software during elective home visits by specialized nurses in stable patients under home ventilation. Data includes all ventilator parameters, leaks, tidal volume, total ventilation, respiratory rate, % of cycles triggered by the patient, apnea-hypopnea index, and compliance. Age, gender, BMI, spirometry, type of mask and pulse oximetry are also available. The analysis will describe ventilatory patterns and ventilator settings as a function of diagnosis, as well as factors related to importance of leaks (age, interface, ventilator settings).</description>
