  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on pilot patient observations, and experience from the prior study KTS-1-2008, the
      investigators anticipate that chronic fatigue syndrome patients may benefit from B-cell
      depletion therapy using Rituximab induction with maintenance treatment.

      The hypothesis is that at least a subset of CFS patients have an activated immune system
      involving B-lymphocytes, and that prolonged B-cell depletion may alleviate symptoms.

    <description>The primary endpoint is defined as major response of the CFS symptoms, of at least six weeks duration, independent on when during 36 months follow-up the response period(s) occurs. Single such response periods, and the sum of these, are recorded.</description>

Approved amendment: for patients with gradual improvement in CFS/ME symptoms after 12 months follow-up, but not having reached a clear response, up to 6 additional Rituximab infusions (500 mg/m2, max 1000 mg) may be given during the following 12 months period.</description>
