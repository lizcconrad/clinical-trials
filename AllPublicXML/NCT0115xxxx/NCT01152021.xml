  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label randomized study. The purpose of this study is to compare
      propofol with dexmedetomidine for pediatric monitored anesthesia care for MRI, specifically
      identifying important patient demographics and looking at important outcomes including
      adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to either arm of the study. Throughout the sedation and recovery
      period, all study patients will have careful, routine documentation of hemodynamics (blood
      pressure, heart rate, plus oximeter, respiratory rate) as well as sedation depth. Patients
      will remain in recovery room until they have maintained discharge criteria for 30 minutes.

    <description>Dexmedetomidine given as 2mcg/kg bolus over 10 minutes followed by 1.5mcg/kg/hr infusion for duration of scan. The bolus may be repeated up to 2 times at any time during the sedation in the event that adequate sedation conditions (minimum Ramsay Sedation Score of 4) are not achieved. In the event that dexmedetomidine is unable to achieve motionless conditions, after a total of 3 boluses, 0.5 mg/kg IV pentobarbital may be administered at q1 minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg, per established protocol.</description>

    <description>Propofol bolus at an initial dose of 1 mg/kg over 1 minute then up to two additional 1 mg/kg boluses may be administered (total 3 mg/kg) - each over a one (1) minute interval, waiting 30 seconds after completion of each bolus to reassess sedation level. Once a minimum Ramsey Sedation Score 4 is achieved, an infusion at 125 mcg/kg/min is initiated. It may be titrated to 300 mcg/kg/min. If there is movement or awakening the patient may be rebolused with no more than 2 doses of Propofol at 1 mg/kg over 1 minute, in the same dosing manner as described above, waiting 30 seconds between doses. If adequate sedation is not achieved, 0.5 mg/kg IV pentobarbital may be administered at q1 minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg.</description>
