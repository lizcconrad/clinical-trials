      Few studies analyzed the referral time to nephrologists and its impact on the patient outcome
      in a large cohort. The investigators described the incidence and determined the outcome with
      respect to renal function recovery, renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement and
      in-hospital mortality of Hospital Acquired Acute Kidney Injury (HA-AKI) without nephrology
      referral (nrHA-AKI) and late referred HA-AKI patients to nephrologists (lrHA-AKI) compared
      with early referral patients (erHA-AKI). The patients included were admitted to the tertiary
      care academic center of Lausanne (Switzerland) between 2004 and 2008, in the medical and
      surgical services and in the intensive care unit (ICU).

        This study population consisted of patients who were hospitalized in the medical and
        surgical departments as well as in the intensive care untis (ICU) of the University
        Hospital of Lausanne (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois [CHUV]) that is a tertiary
        care academic medical center. Patients with AKI coming from ICU in the medicine or surgery
        wards, and patients from medicine or surgery wards, who required a transfer to ICU during
        the hospital stay, were also included whatever the cause of the transfer.
