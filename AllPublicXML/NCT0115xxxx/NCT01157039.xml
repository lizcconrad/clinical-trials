  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that glutamine significantly reduces the incidence and severity
      of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer,
      decreases the need for dose reduction of oxaliplatin, and it does not impair oxaliplatin
      efficacy or pharmacokinetics.

      This is a phase II , open-label, non randomized study of oral glutamine administration to
      evaluate oxaliplatin pharmacokinetics, and to prevent oxaliplatin neurotoxicity in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        Study Population: The target population is patients with metastatic colorectal
        adenocarcinoma who are sufficiently robust to undergo at least 3 cycles of oxaliplatin
        based chemotherapy (mFOLFOX or XELOX) Sampling Method: Probability Sample.

             eligible for this trial

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (EGOC) performance status 0
             to 2.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function of creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dL and a creatinine
             clearance &gt; 45mL/min; patients must have adequate hepatic function with a bilirubin &lt;
             1.5mg/dL and AST (normal range 0-14 U/L) and ALT (normal range 0-49 U/L); and patients
             must have adequate bone marrow function with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥
             1,500/цL and platelets ≥ 100,000/цL and a hemoglobin ≥ 10g/d.
