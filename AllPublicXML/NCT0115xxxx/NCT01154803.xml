  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 14 days nutritional supplementation with
      Ready to use therapeutic Food (RUTF) or micronutrients alone to children having an infection
      will prevent malnutrition and reduce the frequency of morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia due to infection might lead to weight loss. In many settings total recovery is
      problematic what might result in a permanent lower weight. A short period high quality food
      supplementation could improve weight gain after an infection.

      A complete high quality food will be tested, but also micronutrients alone as there is no
      information on what children with an infection exactly need as a supplement.

      Children aged 6-59 months presenting with diarrhoea, malaria or lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) are provided for 2 weeks with

        -  RUTF supplement (Plumpynut®) of 500 kcal/day

        -  Multi-micronutrient powder (MNP)

        -  Placebo to MNP

      The followup period is 6 months. Anthropometric indicators and morbidity are assessed
      monthly. Participants are invited to attend the study clinic if any signs of disease are
      noticed.

    <description>The incidence of a negative nutritional outcome will be defined in two different ways according to the baseline nutritional status.
i) for children with no malnourishment at time of entry into study, &quot;negative nutritional outcome&quot; is defined as progression to moderate or severe malnourishment ii) for children with moderate malnourishment at time of entry into study, &quot;negative nutritional outcome&quot; is defined as loss of ³10% of baseline weight or progression to severe malnourishment, whichever is reached first.</description>
