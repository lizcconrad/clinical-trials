      Long-term, observational, prospective, multicenter registry following patients who have been
      implanted with the SUPERA Interwoven Self-Expanding Nitinol Stent for treating stenosis in
      the superficial femoral and/or femoropopliteal arteries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This registry follows up to 200 patients for at least 5 years.

      The STRONG Data Registry will follow patients under real world conditions, evaluating
      restenosis rates, periprocedural/postprocedural complications, patency, target lesion
      revascularization, walking distance, stent fractures, and adverse events/serious adverse
      events.

    <measure>Target Limb Ankle Brachial Index (at Rest)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms. A doppler probe is used to monitor the pulse while a sphygmomanometer is inflated above the artery. The cuff is deflated and the pressure at which the pulse returns is recorded.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure
The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.</description>

        <description>In-Stent Restenosis is re-narrowing within the margins of the stent following the reduction of a previous narrowing. It is defined as the presence of a hemodynamically significant restenosis (≥ 50%), as determined by duplex ultrasonography (DUS) or arteriography. A peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) of 2.4 and 2.5 will be used to calculate duplex restenosis.</description>

        <title>Target Limb Ankle Brachial Index (at Rest)</title>
        <description>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms. A doppler probe is used to monitor the pulse while a sphygmomanometer is inflated above the artery. The cuff is deflated and the pressure at which the pulse returns is recorded.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure
The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.</description>

          <title>Target Limb Ankle Brachial Index (at Rest)</title>
          <description>Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a measure of the fall in blood pressure in the arteries supplying the legs and is used to detect evidence of blockages in the peripheral vessels. It is calculated by dividing the higher systolic blood pressure in the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) of the one leg by the higher of the two systolic blood pressures in the arms. A doppler probe is used to monitor the pulse while a sphygmomanometer is inflated above the artery. The cuff is deflated and the pressure at which the pulse returns is recorded.
ABI=Highest Ankle Systolic Pressure/Highest Brachial Systolic Pressure
The ABI is the ratio of the ankle to arm pressure, and an ABI between 0.9 and 1.3 is considered normal. A reduced ABI (less than 0.9) is consistent with peripheral artery occlusive disease, with values below 0.8 indicating moderate disease and below 0.5 severe disease.</description>
