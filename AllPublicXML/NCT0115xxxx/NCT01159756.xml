      This study is a multi-site, unmasked phase IV study. Travacom(R) is a combination topical
      ocular agent, containing travoprost and timolol, which lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by
      complementary mechanisms of action. The safety and efficacy of both travoprost and timolol
      have been established as single and adjunctive therapy in well-controlled clinical studies in
      thousands of patients diagnosed with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension. The
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of changing to Travacom from
      prior pharmacotherapy in uncontrolled patients with open-angled glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension across India.
