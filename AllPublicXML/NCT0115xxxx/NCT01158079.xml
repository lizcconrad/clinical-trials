    <textblock>
      This study provides a mechanism for continued administration of ALN-VSP02 therapy to patients
      with cancer who completed participation in another ALN-VSP02 clinical study. The primary
      objective of this study is to collect long term safety data.

      Study ALN-VSP02 is an extension study for previously conducted ALN-VSP02 studies. The study
      is being conducted to allow for continued ALN-VSP02 therapy for patients who completed
      participation in an ALN-VSP02 clinical study, achieved clinical benefit with ALN-VSP02 (i.e.,
      disease response of stable disease or better), and, in the Investigator's opinion, may
      benefit from continuation of ALN-VSP02 therapy.
