  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine any differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of
      darapladib when dosed to people with moderate liver disease as compared to when dosed in
      normal healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, non-randomised study to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      safety/tolerability of repeat oral 40 mg doses of darapladib in subjects with moderate
      hepatic impairment (as defined by a Child-Pugh score of 7-9) in comparison to matched healthy
      volunteers.

      The hepatically impaired and healthy volunteer groups will receive repeat oral doses of
      darapladib for 10 consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of darapladib and its metabolites
      will be evaluated. The effect of liver impairment on the plasma protein binding of darapladib
      and metabolites will also be determined as data permit. Safety will be assessed by clinical
      laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure and
      heart rate measurements), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and monitoring for adverse events
      (AEs).

      Subjects will be housed in the clinical unit from the evening before first dose until 24
      hours after the final dose of 10 days of repeat dosing. A follow-up period will include 2
      visits, one of which will be conducted approximately 10-14 days from the last dose of study
      drug and the second visit will be 35 days +/- one week after the last dose of study drug
