        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female volunteers at age of 65 years or older with suitable veins for
             cannulation or repeated venipuncture, in good health (based on medical history and
             physical examination and clinical laboratory tests) as judged by the investigator.

          -  Female volunteers must be postmenopausal (cessation of regular menses for 12 months
             and a follicle stimulating hormone level of more than 40IU/L abd estradiol of less
             than 20ng/mL.

          -  Male volunteers should be willing to use barrier contraception, ie, condoms, from the
             day of dosing until 3 months after dosing with the investigational product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate

          -  History or presence of GI, hepatic, or renal disease or any other condition known to
             interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs as judged
             by Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
