      This protocol (a supplement to 805466) is to test whether our telephone continuing care model
      can be implemented successfully by &quot;real world&quot; publicly funded programs. Participants will
      be recruited from Philadelphia's Department of Behavioral Health - run drug programs. The
      investigators will train city telephone care managers to deliver our telephone continuing
      care intervention to patients in this program. The investigators will randomize 200 to
      receive this intervention or usual care and follow them for 12 months.

    <description>Telephone based recovery support provided by paraprofessionals at the City of Philadelphia's Behavioral Health Department. Calls are once weekly for 8 weeks, then step down to every other week for the remainder of the year of study participation. Call frequency can be increased as a result of a rise in risk factor/protective factor ratio.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) qualify for a DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence, with cocaine use in the 6
             months prior to entrance into the City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health
             facilities or controlled environment;

          -  (2) 18 to 75 years of age;

          -  (3) no current psychotic disorder (as assessed with the psychotic screen from the
             SCID) or evidence of dementia severe enough to prevent participation in outpatient
             treatment;

          -  (4) no acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment;

          -  (5) no current participation in methadone or other modes of Drug and Alcohol
             treatment, other than an Intensive Outpatient Program;

          -  (6) willingness to be randomized and participate in research.

          -  (7) Finally, because of study follow-up requirements, subjects will be able to provide
             the name, verified telephone number, and address of at least two contacts who can
             provide locating information on the patient during follow-up. We will include patients
             with dependence on other substances, provided that they are cocaine dependent and meet
             other inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current dependence on opiates is an exclusion as those participants may be better
             served as part of a methadone program rather than a telephone based therapy protocol.
             Also, if patients are court-ordered to treatment, or otherwise considered prisoners,
             they will not be included in the study.
