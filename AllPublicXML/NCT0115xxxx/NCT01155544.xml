  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project focuses on the under-researched group of individuals who develop psychotic
      episodes of short duration (less than four weeks) while using substances. This includes
      individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (PNOS) or
      substance-induced psychotic disorder (SIP) AND substance abuse or dependence. Very little is
      known about the most appropriate maintenance/relapse prevention management of these subjects.
      These individuals are not diagnosed with a primary psychosis because psychotic symptoms are
      too short-lived or non-specific, the onset of substance use precedes the onset of psychotic
      symptoms and the subject has not experienced sufficient psychotic symptoms in the absence of
      substance use. However, previous studies have shown that they are at high risk of recurrence
      of psychotic symptoms. Thus, this project will assess the efficacy of the second-generation
      antipsychotic aripiprazole for maintenance treatment of subjects who had a recent psychotic
      episode of short duration associated with substance use. The investigators will compare
      aripiprazole and placebo for preventing the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and decreasing
      substance use during a 6-month maintenance phase.
