  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to measure the effectiveness of a new intervention to decrease use of
      services of primary care frequent attenders (FA).Among the secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of the new intervention compared with usual
      care.

      METHODS: There will be a randomized controlled trial with cluster assignment. It will take
      place in the field of primary care in the city of Malaga.It will be evaluated a new
      multicomponent intervention called &quot;7H&quot; (7 Hypothesis). This intervention will be applied on
      the FA by their family doctors in the intervention group. In the control group will be
      developed usual cares.

      The main outcome is the total of visits of FA at 12 months of the follow-up. The secondary
      outcomes include changes happened in biopsychosocial health, satisfaction, and quality of
      life measurements. The investigators will assess the dependent and independents (from FA,
      general practitioner [GP] and health centres) variables at baseline, and 12 months. At
      baseline it will be include a random sample of 450 FA (225 for each arm), belonging to 30
      family doctors of 10 health centres. It will be performed linear regression multilevel models
      with 4 levels (time, patient, doctor and health centre) to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      intervention. . Moreover will be undertaken multivariate gamma and quantile regressions to
      assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility respectively of the new intervention versus
      usual cares, estimating their standard errors by bootstrap calculations.

      The &quot;7H&quot; intervention

        1. Hypothesis generation: analysis of available informationGPs analyze all the available
           information about possible reasons for frequent attendance from clinical charts using a
           standardized questionnaire designed to facilitate analysis of this information. This
           questionnaire prompts analysis of the following: (1) category of visits and their
           frequencies; (2) type of frequent attender according to the first point; (3) family and
           personal history, and biopsychosocial problem list that needed follow-up; (4) searching
           for common factors for frequent attendance from the previous points; (5) feelings and
           thoughts questionnaires, 'In most interviews with this patient I think ...' (11 items),
           'I feel ...' (13 items); (6) rethinking issues of GP capacity (and processes) to resolve
           the frequent attendance in this patient; and (7) analyzing the different professionals
           who intervened in patient care and their contribution to resolving or continuing
           frequent attendance.Finally, GPs indicate the type of hypothesis from a list of seven
           that they believe made the patient a frequent attender: biological, psychological,
           social, family, cultural, administrative-organizational, or related to the
           doctor-patient relationship.

        2. Hypothesis confirmation: the decision to accept or refute each hypothesis is based on
           the GP's interpretation of the data (cognitive component) and the self-perception about
           feeling sure (emotional component). When necessary, the GPs can try out the hypothesis
           with one or more of the following strategies: another interview with the
           patient,biological and psychosocial tests, and/or asking for the opinion of other
           professionals.

        3. Planning: the GP makes plans for each frequent attender based on the confirmed
           hypothesis and available resources. There are many possible plans, examples of which
           include: making longer intervals between medical revisits for stable chronic patients,
           and asking for collaboration with nurses; looking for possible causes of the unstable
           physical chronic illness and intervening accordingly; scheduling an interview to search
           for a psychological, family or/and, social diagnosis; suppressing unnecessary
           face-to-face medical revisits for repeat prescriptions in stable chronic patients, and
           asking the health centre administrative staff for collaboration; asking the social
           worker at the health centre for help; referring to community resources if necessary; and
           being more realistic about the type of doctor-patient relationship expected. These plans
           are then commented on at the group meeting, after which the GP negotiates the plan with
           the frequent attender. The GP should never suggest to the patient: 'You have to attend
           less frequently'. This would be too aggressive and the patient might react with anger or
           guilt. It is better to offer a search for solutions to the patient's health problem from
           both points of view.

    <description>The GPs in the intervention group will undertake an interactive workshop training session (15 hours) on the '7 hypotheses' (7H) intervention. In short, this intervention encourages GPs to select from a list of seven possible hypotheses for why the patient is a frequent attender: biological, psychological, social, family, cultural, administrative-organisational, or related to the doctor-patient relationship.</description>
