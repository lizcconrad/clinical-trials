      The purpose of this study is to test an online psychoeducational intervention for men and
      women with sexual difficulties after surgery for colorectal (men and women) or gynecological
      (women only) cancer. A psychoeducational intervention is a brief, educational treatment that
      encourages participants to also pay attention to, and modify, their thoughts, feelings, and
      behaviour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing a diagnosis of cancer may dramatically alter the way a person feels about
      themselves, their body, and their significant relationships at sexual and intimate levels1.
      Cancer and its treatments affect the physiological, psychological, and sociological realms of
      a survivor's life and his/her ability to experience sexual health. Sexual health is
      recognized as an integral aspect of quality of life (QOL) during cancer and is increasingly
      receiving research and clinical attention. Sexual changes following the treatment of
      gynaecologic (i.e.: ovarian, endometrial, cervical) and colorectal cancers are common though
      often not discussed. Moreover, cancer survivors express dissatisfaction that sexual concerns,
      and treatment of them, are not discussed in the context of their cancer care. Oncologists
      frequently are faced with patients inquiring about sexual changes with cancer treatment, but
      are usually not equipped with accurate and comprehensive data on the precise sexual symptoms
      to expect or where to refer patients with sexual concerns.

      The aims of the study are to assess the efficacy of a 12-module online psychoeducational
      intervention for sexual health (OPES) on (1) the primary endpoint of sexual distress in male
      and female cancer survivors with sexual problems; (2) the secondary sexuality-related
      endpoints of sexual desire, arousal (women) or erection (men), orgasm, and sexual pain; (3)
      on mood, relationship satisfaction, and quality of life; and (4) to assess gender differences
      in the proportion of survivors improved on sexual distress.

    <description>The online psychoeducation contains 12 modules which will be administered once per week over the course of three months. The content of each module is as follows:
Important of sexuality to quality of life. &amp; Definitions of sexual desire and arousal.
Consideration of the predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors in his/her sexual difficulties.
Sexual beliefs.
Mindfulness.
Genital anatomy and physiology.
Body Image.
Relationship satisfaction and communication.
Body-oriented mindfulness exercises (focusing and self-observation).
Using Thought records.
Mindfulness and the thought stream.
Sexual aids to boost arousal.
Moving on.
In addition to these weekly modules, all participants will have access to a moderated and password-protected bulletin board to which participants can post questions and the PI will respond.</description>
