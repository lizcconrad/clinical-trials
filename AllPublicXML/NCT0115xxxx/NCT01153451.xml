      Specific Aims: (Study #1, funded by AHRQ, completed May 2011)

        1. To create an automatic notification system to prompt physicians of test results
           finalized after discharge.

        2. To evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of test results finalized
           after discharge.

      Hypothesis: Automatic email notification will improve physician awareness of test results
      finalized after discharge compared to usual care.

      Specific Aims: (Study #2, funded by CRICO, completed July 2012)

        1. To identify a cohort of discharged patients with potentially actionable results of tests
           pending at discharge (TPAD).

        2. To determine if automated email notification of the finalized results of potentially
           actionable TPADs affects the rate of post-discharge actions taken as documented in the
           electronic medical record (EMR).

      Hypothesis: Automated email notification of the finalized results of potentially actionable
      TPADs increases the rate of actions taken post-discharge.

      Failure to follow up on abnormal test results is a critical problem and is more likely to
      occur in the case of tests that are performed in the hospital but whose results are not
      available or not finalized until after discharge (i.e., pending test results). Responsible
      inpatient and ambulatory providers may not be aware of these test results. In a prior study,
      Roy et al. determined that 41% of patients were discharged before all laboratory,
      microbiology, and radiology test results were finalized (31% were collectively hematology,
      chemistry, and pathology tests, 27% were radiology studies, and 42% were microbiology
      results). Of these results, 9.4% were considered potentially actionable by independent
      physician review and could have altered the post-discharge patient care plan. Physicians were
      only aware of 38% of these test results. Failure to follow-up on these test results can lead
      to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and
      subsequent patient harm. In a hospital the size of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) with
      44,000 annual admissions, physicians would be unaware of almost 2000 actionable test results
      per year. Automated systems can mitigate this problem by ensuring prompt notification of
      relevant test results finalized after discharge to responsible inpatient and ambulatory
      providers. Using internal BWH funding, we have developed an automated email notification
      system to facilitate management of tests pending at discharge (TPADs).

      In study 1 (funded by AHRQ), we will prospectively evaluate the impact of this intervention
      on physician awareness of TPAD results. In study 2 (funded by CRICO), we will perform a chart
      review to determine the impact of the intervention on downstream actions taken by physicians
      and acknowledgment of TPAD results as documented in the electronic medical record.

    <description>BWH inpatient clinical information systems will automatically file all non-finalized chemistry, hematology, pathology, and radiology tests, as well as inpatient and ambulatory provider email addresses for all study patients discharged. This process will be initiated using a time stamp most proximate to actual discharge time. At midnight on every day, all tests filed at time of discharge will be updated if final results have become available. An email with all finalized and pending test results for each patient discharged will be sent to the inpatient and primary care provider at this time. For patients discharged with more than one pending test, subsequent email notification(s) will be sent out until all pending tests are finalized (no more than one email per day).</description>
