    <description>Overall satisfaction was assessed by the patient on a questionnaire. The patient was instructed to select a single response to the statement, &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with your current eye allergy medication?&quot; A 5-point scale was used: very satisfied, satisfied, undecided, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied. Results are reported as the percentage of patients who responded, &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;satisfied.&quot;</description>
