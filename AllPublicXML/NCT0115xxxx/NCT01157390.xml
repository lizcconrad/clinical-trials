      Objective: To demonstrate the well-being of Chinese term infants fed with Wondersun formula
      with high proportion of palmitic acid in the sn-2 position.

      Design &amp; setting: A single-center, open label study. A breast fed group will serve as
      reference. The study will be conducted in Guangzhou from 2010.1~2010.12.

      Participants: 0-14 d whole formula-fed infants and whole breast-fed infants, 30 infants in
      each group. They are required to be healthy, term-infant, and with normal birth weight, and
      have no medications known to affect their growth and development.

      Intervention: The formula-fed infants will be fed Wondersun formula with high proportion of
      palmitic acid in the sn-2 position; and breast-fed groups will be fed using breast milk for
      at least 3 month.

      Outcome measures: Tolerance and efficacy will be assessed by body measurement, stool
      characteristics questionnaire, general health examination, and behavior and habit
      questionnaire at baseline (0-14d), 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Safety will also be evaluated.

      Statistical analysis: t-test, rank test and chi-square test will be used to examine the
      significance of change from baseline to follow-up visit between the formula-fed and
      breast-fed groups for effectiveness measures
