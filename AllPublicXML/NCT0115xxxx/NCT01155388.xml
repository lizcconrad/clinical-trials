      Study evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ferumoxytol compared with oral
      iron for the treatment of pediatric participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol in
      pediatric participants with nondialysis-dependent CKD. Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 (NCT01155375)
      was a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol in pediatric participants
      with dialysis-dependent CKD. Due to significant challenges with enrollment for both studies,
      Study AMAG-FER-CKD-252 was combined with Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and enrollment continued
      under Study AMAG-FER-CKD-251. The enrollment number (n=14) includes the number of
      participants for both AMAG-FER-CKD-251 and AMAG-FER-CKD-252 studies, combined.

      Participants were enrolled by age cohorts in a stepwise manner following a safety review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Board of 1 age cohort prior to enrollment of a subsequent age
      cohort, with progression from oldest to youngest. Randomization was stratified by the
      following age cohorts: 12 to &lt;18 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;6 years, and 6 months to &lt;2
      years.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean changes in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were to be presented. Despite efforts to complete the studies as designed, several factors contributed to significant challenges in enrollment and led the sponsor to discontinue the combined AMAG FER-CKD-252 and AMAG FER-CKD-251 studies. Blood samples were collected, but not run through an analysis to obtain outcome measure data. As such, the data set for this primary outcome measure cannot be summarized nor can the statistical analysis, as described in the protocol, be provided in a way that will provide any significant data based upon the limited study datasets.</description>

    <description>Ferumoxytol concentrations were to be determined using a drug-specific nuclear magnetic resonance assay. Blood samples were to be collected at specified times predose and postdose at the time of the first dose from 6 participants in each age-dose group. Sampling for participants &lt;6 years of age will be minimized to the fewest number of time points required for population PK analysis based on preliminary PK data from the first 2 age cohorts. Blood samples were collected, but not run through an analysis to obtain outcome measure data. As such, the data set for this secondary outcome measure cannot be summarized in a way that will provide any significant data based upon the limited study datasets.</description>

        <title>Mean Change In Hemoglobin From Baseline To Week 5</title>
        <description>Mean changes in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 were to be presented. Despite efforts to complete the studies as designed, several factors contributed to significant challenges in enrollment and led the sponsor to discontinue the combined AMAG FER-CKD-252 and AMAG FER-CKD-251 studies. Blood samples were collected, but not run through an analysis to obtain outcome measure data. As such, the data set for this primary outcome measure cannot be summarized nor can the statistical analysis, as described in the protocol, be provided in a way that will provide any significant data based upon the limited study datasets.</description>
