  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with the combination Avastin
      (bevacizumab) 5mg/kg iv every 2 weeks, Xeloda (capecitabine) 1000 mg po b.i.d. on Days 1-14
      of every 28-day cycle and oxaliplatin 40mg/m2 iv weekly in patients with inoperable locally
      advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. The anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months to progression of disease or end of study (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with OR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) diameters of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months to progression of disease or end of study (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression. Based on assessment of CR, PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), according to RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: ≥30% decrease under baseline of the sum of the LD diameters of all target lesions. CR and PR persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Reference is the smallest sum LD. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With an Event by 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months to progression of disease or end of study (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of overall response (CR or PR) was calculated only for participants of the ITT population whose best overall response was CR or PR based on RECIST criteria. Duration of overall response was defined as the time from the date of the first assessment of CR or PR status until the date of progression or death. Data for participants who were alive without any objectively documented disease progression at the end of the study were censored as of the date of last contact.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with OR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) diameters of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</description>

        <description>Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression. Based on assessment of CR, PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), according to RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: ≥30% decrease under baseline of the sum of the LD diameters of all target lesions. CR and PR persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Reference is the smallest sum LD. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
