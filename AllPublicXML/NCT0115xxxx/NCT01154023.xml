      The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of single interventions
      (stimulus control instructions, sleep restriction therapy) and multi-component intervention
      (stimulus control instructions and sleep restriction therapy) for chronic insomnia in
      community dwelling older adults. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of four
      conditions: stimulus control instructions, sleep restriction therapy, multi-component
      treatment (stimulus control instructions and sleep restriction therapy), or measurement
      control.
