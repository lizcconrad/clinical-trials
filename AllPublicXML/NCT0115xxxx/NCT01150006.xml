  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory state and composition of atherosclerotic plaques are considered the main
      contributing factors responsible for acute cardiovascular events, rather than the degree of
      stenosis. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) has
      been suggested as a promising novel imaging technique to identify the inflammatory state of
      atherosclerotic plaque. Recently, a few clinical studies showed that circulating A-FABP level
      had a close relation with the development of atherosclerosis in human. Therefore, in the
      present study, the investigators examined the relationship between circulating A-FABP and
      vascular inflammation of carotid arteries measured using FDG-PET in healthy male subjects.
