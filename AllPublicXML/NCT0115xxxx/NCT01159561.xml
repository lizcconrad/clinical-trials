    <description>The primary endpoint used to measure immunogeniciyt of the WEE vaccine, the 80% plaque-reduction neautralization titer (PRNT 80), will be evaluated for subjects in the per protocol population.
The secondary endpoint will be GMT, with 95% CI, of the PRNT 80 for WEE-specific antibodies at each scheduled timepoint.</description>
