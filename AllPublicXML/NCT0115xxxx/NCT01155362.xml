  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the treatment effect of 3 different doses
      of PDA001 versus placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe Crohn's Disease. The secondary
      objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PDA001 versus placebo in
      the above-mentioned patient population.

    <measure>A reduction from baseline by 25% and/or &gt; 100 points in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores at both Week 4 (Day 29) and at Week 6 (Day 43).</measure>

    <description>Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) responders are subjects achieving either clinical response (a reduction in CDAI score of ≥100 points from Week 0), or remission (CDAI ≤150). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ages 18-75 years

          2. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent

          3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          4. Minimum weight of 50 kg

          5. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at screening (Visit 1) and immediately prior to all doses of IP. In addition, sexually
             active FCBP must agree to use two of the adequate forms of contraception methods for
             the duration of the study and the follow-up period. A FCBP must agree to have
             pregnancy tests at least every 4 weeks during the study. Males (including those who
             have had a vasectomy) must agree to use barrier contraception (latex condoms) when
             engaging in reproductive sexual activity with FCBP for the duration of the study and
             the follow-up period.

          6. Subject must have inflammatory CD 6 months prior to treatment and have confirmation of
             ongoing disease activity by colonoscopy or (other method) at screening

          7. Subject must have a CDAI score &gt; 220 and &lt; 450 as assessed between Visit 1 and Visit 2

          8. The Subject must have failed, i.e., had an inadequate response or lost response
             (recurrence of symptoms) to an agent, or documented intolerance to an agent at any
             time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study

          2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study

        A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who:

          1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

          2. has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has
             had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
