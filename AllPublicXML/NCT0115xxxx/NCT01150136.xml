  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal, inherited disorder among Caucasians. Choline
      is an essential vitamin and as a methyl donor is critically needed to support the normal
      metabolism. Our previous studies have demonstrated that children with CF have depleted levels
      of choline. The purpose of this study is to gather data on the status of choline and related
      metabolites in children with Cystic Fibrosis by age and gender. The hypothesis for this study
      is that in children with CF, deficiency of choline and related metabolites will increase with
      increasing age.

      The objective of this clinical project is to determine the status of choline and related
      metabolites in a large group of children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Based on the results it
      will be possible to determine which children are deficient or at risk for choline deficiency,
      and might benefit most from supplementation to sustain improvement in the plasma choline, and
      its metabolites. This will be a cross-sectional study that will, over a 6 month period, look
      to enroll as many patients as possible from 140 children with CF who are seen regularly at
      the CF Clinic at B.C.'s Children's Hospital. The study will involve the collection of blood
      and urine at the time of a scheduled appointment. All procedures for enrollment, collection
      of chart data and blood samples will follow procedures used in our previous studies. Body
      weight and height will be measured and routine blood work including liver enzymes,
      hematology, serum zinc, selenium and vitamins A and E will be completed as part of the clinic
      appointment. CF genotype, gender, birth date, hematology, clinical chemistry, anthropometric
      and nutritional measures, liver ultrasound, biopsy reports where available, pancreatic
      function (elastase, chymotrypsin/secretin-CCK) and all medications including mineral, vitamin
      and nutritional and enzyme supplements will be recorded from chart data. Blood samples will
      be used for analyses of choline and its metabolites and various biomarkers in redox pathways.
      A urine sample will be collected and used to assay excretion of related metabolites. Creatine
      will be analyzed to avoid the need for quantitative 24 hour urine collection.
