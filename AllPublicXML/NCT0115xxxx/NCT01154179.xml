      During patients' stay in the hospital, some of the patients may require artificial feeding
      for various reasons either through a vein or through a tube going directly to the gut.
      However, the amount of feeding that can be considered 'adequate' is unclear due to lack of
      research data. The current evidence the investigators have suggests that doctors might be
      giving patients more than they require, which might carry some risks. This hasn't been proven
      until now and there is no evidence as yet to show investigators exactly how much the doctors
      should feed patients.

      The aim of the study is to see whether feeding patients less than what they are currently
      been feed is associated with better outcome.

      The patients will be randomly (like tossing a coin) allocated into 2 groups. One group will
      get 100% of the current amount; the second group will get 60%. The investigators will then
      compare the groups to decide if feeding patients less than the current practice is associated
      with better outcomes.

      Aims:

      The primary aim of this study is to assess whether hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving
      artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic morbidity
      compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support. Secondary end points will include the assessment
      of metabolic, physiological and clinical responses to the different feeding protocols.

      ENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES

        1. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic
           morbidity compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        2. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in the inflammatory response
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        3. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in metabolic response compared
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        4. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in nutrition status compared
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        5. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving enteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with differences in systemic complications
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        6. To undertake a cost benefit analysis in patients receiving enteral artificial
           nutritional support, with the assumption that patients receiving hypocaloric feeding
           will not necessarily manifest lower feeding costs.

      PARENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES

        1. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with reduced septic and non septic
           morbidity compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        2. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in the inflammatory response
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        3. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in metabolic response compared
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        4. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with changes in nutrition status compared
           to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        5. To investigate whether or not hypocaloric feeding in patients receiving parenteral
           artificial nutritional support is associated with differences in systemic complications
           compared to &quot;standard&quot; nutritional support.

        6. To undertake a cost benefit analysis in patients receiving parenteral artificial
           nutritional support, with the assumption that patients receiving hypocaloric feeding
           will not necessarily manifest lower feeding costs.

      Study Design and Study Group:

      This will be a single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. All patients requiring
      adjuvant nutritional support will be included in this study. The need for nutritional support
      and the method of administration (enteral or parenteral) will be decided by the hospital's
      nutrition team as is present practice.

      Clinically, patients requiring supplemental nutrition fall into two clinical groups. Those
      with a functional gut are fed enterally; the other group, whose gut, for whatever reason, is
      not functional are fed parenterally. This is the rationale of studying two groups of
      administration.

      Please see Flowchart for exact details. Patients will enter into the parenteral or the
      enteral component of the stud y in a mutually exclusive manner with no crossover or
      randomisation occurring at this point. Thereafter, patients in either arm of the study
      (enteral or parenteral) will be randomised to one of two groups. Comparisons will be done
      within, but not across, each of the enteral and parenteral arms.

      Enteral feeding details:

      Enteral control group: patients will receive energy and protein intakes as recommended by the
      use of Schofield equations (TER=total energy requirements), as is current practice.

      Enteral intervention group: patients will be prescribed 60% of recommended (by Schofield)
      requirements.

      Parenteral feeding details:

      Parenteral control group : the control group, will receive energy and protein intakes as
      recommended by the use of Schofield equations, as is current practice.

      Parenteral intervention group: patients will be prescribed 60% of recommended (by Schofield)
      requirements.

      Data analysis will be on an &quot;intention to treat&quot; basis. Enteral and parenteral study arms
      will be analysed separately.
