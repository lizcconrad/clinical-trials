  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Acute diarrhea (AD) is still a significant morbidity-mortality problem worldwide.
      Although oral rehydration therapy is the cornerstone, its anti-diarrheal effect is a
      controversial subject. Since ten years ago, Racecadotrilo´s safety and efficacy had been
      proved. However, a pharmacoeconomics analysis on this therapeutics has not been published
      yet.

      Objective: Evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and costs associated with Racecadotril
      administration in comparison to a placebo in infants up to 24 months of age with AD in a
      hospital (mildly or moderately dehydrated) and ambulatory (no dehydrated) settings at the
      National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico.

      Material and Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial (RDBCCT)
      with pharmacoeconomics analysis (cost minimization) to realize in 454 infants with AD (270
      hospitalized and 184 outpatients), 1 to 24 months of age who concomitantly will receive ORT
      and Racecadotril (1.5mg./Kg./t.i.d. doe 5 days) (ORT-Rac Group) or placebo (ORT-Placebo
      Group). The clinical outcomes in the hospitalized infants to measure will be a) Stool output
      rate at 48hs. and at the end of the study; b) duration of diarrhea; c) percentage of
      intravenous (IV) needs and d) percentage of adverse events. The outcome variables in
      outpatient infants to measure will be a) total liquid and semi-liquid bowel movements during
      the study; b) duration of diarrhea and c) percentage of adverse events. The pharmacoeconomics
      analysis will involve a cost minimization analysis (CMA). Results will be analyzed through bi
      and multivariate analysis using STATA 11.0 for Mac, considering a p value &lt; 0.05 as
      significant. The pharmacoeconomics model will made through decisions trees using TreAge Pro
      Healthcare v 1.2.0, 2009.

    <description>The pharmacoeconomics model consisted in a theoretical scheme that makes it possible to conduct simulations of health processes associated with medical care, use of medications, expenses for intravenous hydration and re-hospitalizations secondary to dehydration, through estimates obtained from the efficacy data available from our clinical trial as well as the costs and consequences. The model was prepared using the TreeAge Pro Healthcare v 1.2.0, 2009 software tool</description>
