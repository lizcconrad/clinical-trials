      The purpose of this study is to study if a patients follows an exercise program specifically
      designed for them during the time of their treatment after surgery. Their ability to follow
      the program and its influence on their weight maintenance and early post-operative lymphedema
      rates will also be studied. Lymphedema is a condition in which excess fluid collects in
      tissue and causes swelling of the arm(s).

    <description>Module I is a group of arm movements. It consists of stretching exercises coordinated with breathing exercises to restore their physical mobility, range of motion and flexibility of shoulders. Module I is to be performed daily. In Module II the exercises are a series of copyrighted, sequential movements designed to put the body in proper alignment. It is a special series of muscle movements to help establish better body alignment, as well as increased strength and flexibility of one's arms, legs, and spine, each exercise is 4 repetitions. Module III is the walking and the resistance weight training program. The walking program is whole body exercise, multi-joint, weight-bearing, low impact and for beginners to advanced.</description>
