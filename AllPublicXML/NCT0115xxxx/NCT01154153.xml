  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of a 6-week treatment with TAA-AQ (110 μg)
      and TAA-AQ (220 μg) once daily (QD) versus placebo on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis function as measured by serum cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) in children (&gt;=2 to &lt;12 years old)
      with allergic rhinitis (AR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of a run-in single-blind screening phase (prerandomization) followed by
      an approximately 6-week double-blind treatment phase (postrandomization).

      Total study duration per participant lasted from 7.5 to 13 weeks and consisted of:

        -  Screening and single-blind phases (these 2 phases ran concurrently, prerandomization)
           for 8 to 24 days. During the screening phase participants were given a single-blind
           placebo nasal spray to enable them to practice their intranasal application technique
           once daily in the morning (1 actuation/nostril).

        -  Randomization to the double-blind treatment phase. Treatment assignment was randomized
           with stratification by sex and age group (&gt;=2 to &lt;6, &gt;=6 to &lt;12 years old).

        -  Double-blind treatment phase which lasted at least 42 days and ran up to 47 days.
           Participants were administered either TAA-AQ nasal spray or placebo nasal spray.

        -  An evaluation at the end of treatment 1-3 days after completion of the double-blind
           phase.

    <measure>Ratio of Serum Cortisol Area Under Curve [AUC(0-24 hr)] at the End of Treatment to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1-3 days prerandomization and 6 weeks postrandomization</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period (at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 hours), with 0 hour being between 8:00AM to 9:00AM, immediately prior to investigational product (IP) administration. AUC (0-24hr) was calculated using the trapezoid rule, and was normalized by dividing the AUC(0-24 hr) by the actual sample collection interval between 0-hour and 24-hour blood draw times.
Ratio in Serum Cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) = (Serum Cortisol AUC[0-24 hr] at 6 weeks postrandomization)/(Serum Cortisol AUC[0-24 hr] at 1-3 days prerandomization). Log transformation was used for the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 8-24 days prerandomization up to 6 weeks postrandomization</time_frame>
    <description>Every morning, participants rated the severity of symptoms experienced over the previous 24 hours using scale from 0-3, where 0=symptoms absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe symptoms (interfere with daily living or sleep) for each symptom (nasal congestion, nasal itching, sneezing, and runny nose). The rTNSS was the sum of the individual symptom scores, ranged from 0-12 (where 12 reflected the worst symptoms).
Change from baseline in the rTNSS = mean rTNSS (double-blind treatment phase) - mean rTNSS (screening phase).</description>

    <description>Efficacy of treatment was assessed by the physician using a scale from 0-4 for relief levels, where 0 = no relief (symptoms unchanged or worsened than before), 1 = slight relief (symptoms present and only minimally improved), 2 = moderate relief (symptoms are present and may be troublesome, but are noticeably improved), 3 = marked relief (symptoms are greatly improved and although present are scarcely troublesome) and 4 = complete relief (virtually no symptom present).</description>

          <title>Tanner Classification</title>
          <description>Tanner classification distinguishes stages of puberty. Each stage represents the extent of breast, genitalia and pubic hair growth. Tanner Stage I represents the pre-adolescent stage where breast, genitalia and pubic hair growth are of the same size and shape as in early childhood and in Tanner Stage 5 breasts and genitalia are of adult shape and size, and pubic hair is adult in quantity (mature stage). Stages 2, 3 and 4 are intermediate stages.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period (at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 hours), with 0 hour being between 8:00AM to 9:00AM, immediately prior to investigational product (IP) administration. AUC (0-24hr) was calculated using the trapezoid rule, and was normalized by dividing the AUC(0-24 hr) by the actual sample collection interval between 0-hour and 24-hour blood draw times.
Ratio in Serum Cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) = (Serum Cortisol AUC[0-24 hr] at 6 weeks postrandomization)/(Serum Cortisol AUC[0-24 hr] at 1-3 days prerandomization). Log transformation was used for the analysis.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants by Relief Level as Evaluated by the Participant</title>
          <description>Efficacy of treatment was assessed by the participant using a scale from 0-4 for relief levels, where 0 = no relief (symptoms unchanged or worsened than before), 1 = slight relief (symptoms present and only minimally improved), 2 = moderate relief (symptoms are present and may be troublesome, but are noticeably improved), 3 = marked relief (symptoms are greatly improved and although present are scarcely troublesome) and 4 = complete relief (virtually no symptom present).</description>
          <population>The per protocol (PP) population included all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and had no major protocol violations. Major protocol violations were those deemed most likely to affect the interpretation of the results and included poor compliance, use of prohibited medication, missing blood samples.</population>
