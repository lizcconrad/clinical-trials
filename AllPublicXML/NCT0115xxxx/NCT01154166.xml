  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy of 6-months therapy of ropinirole Prolonged
      Release (PR) with that of placebo as adjunctive therapy to L-dopa in Parkinson's disease
      patients not optimally controlled on L-dopa. This study will be conducted in China. Subjects
      will have total 14 visits over the 26 week duration of the study.

      Following screening, eligible subjects will receive study medication during the fourteen day
      placebo run-in period which they will be instructed to take in addition to their background
      L-dopa. If subjects are still eligible at the end of the placebo run-in period they will be
      randomized (1:1) to receive once daily doses of ropinirole PR or identical appearing placebo
      tablets. Dosing will start at 2 mg ropinirole PR, or placebo equivalent. During the 24 week
      treatment phase, the subjects dose will be adjusted according to the recommended schedule to
      achieve symptomatic control. All subjects must be titrated to a minimum dose of 6 mg/day. If
      sufficient symptomatic control is not achieved or maintained at a dose of 6mg/day of
      ropinirole PR, the daily dose should be increased by 2mg at weekly or longer intervals up to
      a dose of 8mg/day.If sufficient symptomatic control is still not achieved or maintained at a
      dose of 8mg/day of ropinirole PR, the daily dose should be increased by 4mg at two weekly or
      longer intervals. Further dose titration should not be conducted within the final 8 weeks of
      the treatment phase. The maximum recommended daily dose is 24mg.

      The planned reduction in L-dopa dose will begin once subjects are titrated to Dose Level 4 or
      Dose Level 5 of study medication. For each increase in study medication, there will be a
      corresponding decrease in L-dopa. If loss of symptom control occurs with the reduction in the
      background L-dopa dose, the dose of study medication should be increased to the next higher
      dose level with no adjustment in the dose of L-dopa. If loss of symptom control persists,
      subjects should be titrated up an additional dose level. Subjects who do not experience an
      improvement in symptoms following upward titration by 2 dose levels of study medication,
      should be &quot;rescued&quot; with L-dopa.

      Subjects will be dispensed down-titration medication at the study completion/early withdrawal
      visit if the patient did not enter extension study and should be scheduled to return for a
      follow up visit 4 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication. The extension study aim
      to evaluate the safety profile of ReQuip PR during long-term treatment in subjects with
      advanced parkinson's disease.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Awake Time Spent &quot;Off&quot; at Week 24 Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (Visit 13)</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which Parkinson's Disease (PD) symptoms (lack of mobility, tremor, or rigidity) are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their &quot;off &quot; periods in 24-hour diary cards prior to each visit on two days of each relevant week. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hour period was the sum of the hours recorded on the two 24-hour diary cards. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Total Motor Score at Week 24 Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (Visit 13)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS, a clinician-based rating scale, assesses 6 features of PD impairment: (1) mentation, behavior, and mood; (2) activities of daily living; (3) motor examination; (4) complications of therapy; (5) modified Hoehn and Yahr stage; (6) Schwab and England activities of daily living scale. Assessments were conducted when participants had benefit in regard to mobility, tremor, and rigidity. The total motor score (sum of motor examination) ranges from 0 to 108: 0=normal/no symptoms; 108=worst possible case. Change from BL was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at BL.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Awake Time Spent &quot;Off&quot; (ATSO) at Week 24 Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which PD symptoms (lack of mobility, tremor, or rigidity) are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their &quot;off&quot; periods in 24-hour diary cards prior to each visit on the same 2 days of each relevant week. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hour period was the sum of the hours recorded on the two 24-hour diary cards. The percentage of ATSO=ATSO divided by (ATSO + awake time spent &quot;on&quot;) * 100. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Awake Time &quot;on&quot; Without Troublesome Dyskinesias (TD) at Week 24 Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Dyskinesias are involuntary twisting, turning movements caused by medication during &quot;on&quot; time in PD. TD is defined as those movements that interfere with function and cause meaningful discomfort. Participants were asked to record the number of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; without TD in 24-hour diary cards prior to each visit on the same two days of each relevant week. The total number of awake hours spent&quot;on&quot;without TD per 24-hour period was the sum of the hours recorded on the two 24-hour diary cards. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Responders Based on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Global Improvement Scale Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI global improvement scale allows the investigator to rate the participant's total improvement since the beginning of treatment (Baseline). Scores on the scale range from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse). Participants with a CGI global improvement score of &lt;=2 (representing much improved or very much improved) were considered to be responders.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Requiring Reinstatement of L-dopa Following a Dose Reduction Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>In the event of unacceptable side effects relative to Baseline (e.g., dyskinesias, dystonias [neurological movement disorder]) the dosage of L-dopa was reduced. If there was reduction in the side effects and there was loss of symptom control, the dose of study medication was again increased (reinstated) at subsequent visits. If symptoms could still not be controlled, then L-dopa was reinstated; however, the dose could not exceed the baseline dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Responders to Study Treatment Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which PD symptoms (lack of mobility, tremor, or rigidity) are not adequately controlled by the drug. Responders are defined as participants who had at least a 20% reduction from Baseline in awake time spent &quot;off&quot; and at least a 20% reduction from Baseline in the L-dopa dose.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Depression Scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that is completed by the investigator. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale (e.g., absent, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) or a 3-point scale (e.g., absent, mild, marked). The total HAMD-17 score (sum of the scores of all 17 items) may range from 0 (least severe) to 52 (most severe). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) Total Score Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS uses a series of 15 questions to assess sleep disturbance associated with PD. Participants completed the assessments based on their experiences in the past week by marking a cross on each 10 centimeter (cm) scale (labelled from worst to best state). Responses were quantified by measuring the distance along each line where the cross was placed. The scores for each item ranged from 0 (symptom severe and always experienced) to 10 (symptom free). The maximum cumulative score for the PDSS was thus 150 (free of all symptoms). Change from BL=value at Week 24 minus the BL value.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Scores (PDQ39) Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ39 is a 39 item self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire covers eight domains of health that are reported as adversely affected by patients with PD. Participants were asked to rate responses on a scale from 0 to 4 (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;). The overall index score is the mean of the eight individual domain scores measured on a continuous scale ranging from 0 (no problem at all) to 100 (maximum level of the problem). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 347 participants were randomized; however, 2 participants were not dosed after randomization and were excluded from the Safety Population. An additional participant had no post-baseline assessment available and was thus excluded from the Intent-to-Treat Population. Thus, only 344 of the 347 randomized participants “started” the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After the 14-day Run-in Phase with placebo, eligible participants (par.) entered the 24-week Treatment Phase (TP) and were randomized 1:1 to ropinirole PR or placebo. After the TP, all par. were down-titrated for 7 days. Those who did not enter the extension study returned for a follow-up visit 4-14 days after the last dose of medication.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants received placebo tablets identical to ropinirole prolonged release (Ro-PR) tablets once daily (OD) in the 24-week Treatment Phase (TP). The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 milligrams (mg) or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. If a loss of symptom control occurred and persisted after study medication had been up-titrated once, participants were to be &quot;rescued&quot; with open-label L-dopa, which was not to exceed the dose being taken at baseline. After the 24-week TP, all participants were down-titrated over a 7-day period. Those participants who did not enter the extension study returned for a follow-up visit 4 to 14 days after the last dose of medication.</description>

          <description>Participants initially received Ro-PR 2 mg tablets OD in the 24-week TP. The Ro-PR dose was up-titrated weekly by 2 mg for the first 3 weeks of treatment. Later, the daily dose was increased by 4 mg every 2 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 24 mg per day. The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 mg or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. Participants who did not experience symptom improvement after up-titration of Ro-PR by 2 dose levels were allowed to take L-dopa (maximum up to their baseline dose). After the 24-week TP, all participants were down-titrated over a 7-day period. Those participants who did not enter the extension study returned for a follow-up visit 4 to 14 days after the last dose of Ro-PR.</description>

        <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which Parkinson’s Disease (PD) symptoms (lack of mobility, tremor, or rigidity) are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods in 24-hour diary cards prior to each visit on two days of each relevant week. The total number of awake hours spent “off” per 24-hour period was the sum of the hours recorded on the two 24-hour diary cards. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Total Motor Score at Week 24 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The UPDRS, a clinician-based rating scale, assesses 6 features of PD impairment: (1) mentation, behavior, and mood; (2) activities of daily living; (3) motor examination; (4) complications of therapy; (5) modified Hoehn and Yahr stage; (6) Schwab and England activities of daily living scale. Assessments were conducted when participants had benefit in regard to mobility, tremor, and rigidity. The total motor score (sum of motor examination) ranges from 0 to 108: 0=normal/no symptoms; 108=worst possible case. Change from BL was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at BL.</description>

The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 milligrams (mg) or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. If a loss of symptom control occurred and persisted after study medication had been up-titrated once, participants were to be &quot;rescued&quot; with open-label L-dopa, which was not to exceed the dose being taken at baseline. After the 24-week TP, all participants were down-titrated over a 7-day period.

        <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which PD symptoms (lack of mobility, tremor, or rigidity) are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off” periods in 24-hour diary cards prior to each visit on the same 2 days of each relevant week. The total number of awake hours spent “off” per 24-hour period was the sum of the hours recorded on the two 24-hour diary cards. The percentage of ATSO=ATSO divided by (ATSO + awake time spent &quot;on&quot;) * 100. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Responders Based on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Global Improvement Scale Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The CGI global improvement scale allows the investigator to rate the participant’s total improvement since the beginning of treatment (Baseline). Scores on the scale range from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse). Participants with a CGI global improvement score of &lt;=2 (representing much improved or very much improved) were considered to be responders.</description>

The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 milligrams (mg) or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. If a loss of symptom control occurred and persisted after study medication had been up-titrated once, participants were to be &quot;rescued&quot; with open-label L-dopa, which was not to exceed the dose being taken at baseline.

        <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that is completed by the investigator. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale (e.g., absent, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) or a 3-point scale (e.g., absent, mild, marked). The total HAMD-17 score (sum of the scores of all 17 items) may range from 0 (least severe) to 52 (most severe). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The PDSS uses a series of 15 questions to assess sleep disturbance associated with PD. Participants completed the assessments based on their experiences in the past week by marking a cross on each 10 centimeter (cm) scale (labelled from worst to best state). Responses were quantified by measuring the distance along each line where the cross was placed. The scores for each item ranged from 0 (symptom severe and always experienced) to 10 (symptom free). The maximum cumulative score for the PDSS was thus 150 (free of all symptoms). Change from BL=value at Week 24 minus the BL value.</description>

        <description>The PDQ39 is a 39 item self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire covers eight domains of health that are reported as adversely affected by patients with PD. Participants were asked to rate responses on a scale from 0 to 4 (“never” to “always”). The overall index score is the mean of the eight individual domain scores measured on a continuous scale ranging from 0 (no problem at all) to 100 (maximum level of the problem). Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <title>Placebo</title>
            <description>Participants received placebo tablets identical to ropinirole prolonged release (Ro-PR) tablets once daily (OD) in the 24-week Treatment Phase (TP). The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 milligrams (mg) or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. If a loss of symptom control occurred and persisted after study medication had been up-titrated once, participants were to be &quot;rescued&quot; with open-label L-dopa, which was not to exceed the dose being taken at baseline. After the 24-week TP, all participants were down-titrated over a 7-day period. Those participants who did not enter the extension study returned for a follow-up visit 4 to 14 days after the last dose of medication.</description>

            <description>Participants initially received Ro-PR 2 mg tablets OD in the 24-week TP. The Ro-PR dose was up-titrated weekly by 2 mg for the first 3 weeks of treatment. Later, the daily dose was increased by 4 mg every 2 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 24 mg per day. The L-dopa dose was reduced after a dose of 8 mg or 12 mg of study medication had been achieved. Participants who did not experience symptom improvement after up-titration of Ro-PR by 2 dose levels were allowed to take L-dopa (maximum up to their baseline dose). After the 24-week TP, all participants were down-titrated over a 7-day period.
