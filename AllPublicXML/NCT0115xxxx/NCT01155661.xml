    <measure>Change From Baseline to 54 Week Endpoint in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Subscale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Associated with Depression (FAsD) is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The &quot;Experience Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, the &quot;Impact Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only), and the &quot;Average Score&quot; was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 54 Week Endpoint in the Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Scale</title>
        <description>The ASEX scale was used to assess sexual functioning in both males and females. The ASEX total score for the male and female version was calculated as the sum of the responses (rated from 1 [extremely] to 6 [no/never]) to the 5 items of the ASEX scale. Total scores ranged from 5 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The CPFQ is a 7-item participant-rated questionnaire pertaining to a participant's cognitive and physical well-being. It assesses motivation, wakefulness, energy, focus, recall, word-finding difficulty, and mental acuity. Each item was scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (greater than normal) to 6 (totally absent). Total scores ranged from 7 to 42. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 54 Week Endpoint in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscales. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale are considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7, 'normal.' Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 54 Week Endpoint in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Associated with Depression (FAsD) is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant’s lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The “Experience Score” was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, the “Impact Score” was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only), and the “Average Score” was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to 54 Week Endpoint in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Anxiety Subscale Score</title>
          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7, 'normal.' Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Score (total score) and Subscores were completed by the participant and were used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment [imp] score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment [imp] score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment [imp] score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for investigator, visit, baseline score, and baseline-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Meet Remission Criteria of Depressive Symptoms by Week 8</title>
        <description>Remission criteria was defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of &lt;= 10. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). The Kaplan-Meier product limit method of time to first remission was calculated. In the calculation, participants who did not meet remission criteria were considered as right-censored observations. The estimated percentage of participants who meet remission criteria by Week 8 from the Kaplan-Meier method is presented.</description>
