  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether screening of pregnant women with history of
      previous preterm delivery, once a week, for bacterial vaginosis using VA-SENSE, and treatment
      of positive women will reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. We will compare between
      the effectiveness of once a week screening and once during pregnancy screening.

    <description>The VA-SENSE contains a strip of pH indicator (color indicator) that is sensitive to the acidity level. A change in the color of the strip due to changes in the acidity level of vaginal secretions absorbed in the panty liner clearly indicates high probability of bacterial or parasitic vaginal infection. Any color change that results from contact with urine will disappear 10 minutes of drying out, and then the color of the indicator strip will fade back to the original color (yellow).</description>
