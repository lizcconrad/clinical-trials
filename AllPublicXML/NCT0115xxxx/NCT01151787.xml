  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended release (Amrix 15mg/day) for the prophylaxis of
      chronic migraine compared to a placebo medication. A second objective, is to find out whether
      there is an improvement in quality of sleep and self-reported depression in patients taking
      Amrix 15mg daily. The hypothesis is that the number of migraine days per month of patients
      treated with Amrix 15mg daily will be significantly lower than those patients treated with
      placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. males and females, aged 18 to 65, with headaches longer than 30 minutes per day for at
             least 15 days per month (28 days) meeting ICHD-IIR criteria for chronic migraine.
             Subjects must have headaches at least 8 days per month which are alleviated with
             triptans or ergots AND/OR which have at least 1 migrainous feature (unilaterality of
             headache or pain more prominent on 1 side of the head, throbbing, nausea, vomiting,
             photophobia, phonophobia, increased pain with physical exertion or avoidance of
             exertion)

          2. subjects willing and able to perform all study-related measures including accurately
             completing study diaries and instruments, maintaining stable doses of headache
             preventative medications, completing study visits and obtaining blood testing as
             indicated.

          3. women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of birth control for the
             duration of the study (oral contraceptives, IUD, injectable or intravaginal
             contraception or barrier methods combined with spermicide)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. subjects &lt;18 and &gt;65 years of age

          2. pregnancy or attempted pregnancy during the study

          3. nursing females

          4. psychiatric condition which, in the investigator's opinion will influence trial safety
             or data collection

          5. new daily persistent headache, hemicrania continua, chronic tension-type headache or
             cluster headache diagnoses.

          6. headache suspicious for and not investigated to rule out secondary headache disorder

          7. angle closure glaucoma

          8. urinary retention

          9. hepatic impairment felt by the investigator to interfere with study safety (as
             determined from history and/or prerequisite liver function testing within 1 year of
             study enrollment)

         10. within 14 days of MAO inhibitor use or discontinuation

         11. known hypersensitivity to cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride or any component of Amrix
             formulation

         12. concomitant tramadol or tricyclic antidepressant use

         13. history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure

         14. hyperthyroidism

         15. new start of daily preventative medication (which may influence headaches) less than 2

         16. dosage change or discontinuation of daily preventative medication (which may influence
             headaches) within 1 month of trial enrollment -
