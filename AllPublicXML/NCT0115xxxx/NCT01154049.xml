      This is a phase I, open-label, single arm trial, which aims to assess the safety of the
      vaccine prepared sm14 in healthy subjects. The product immunogenicity will be evaluated by
      conducting serology (anti-sm14 antibodies) and testing of cellular response to the antigen by
      the method ELI-SPOT. Each participant will remain in the study for approximately 4 months.
      The total study duration is 10 months, considering a period of 6 months for inclusion. Will
      be included in the study subjects male and female, between 18 and 49 years, that manifest
      their will to participate in the research by signing an Informed Consent Form. Eligible
      population for the study are subjects who do not present at screening significant changes in
      renal, cardiac and liver functions, complete blood count, clotting, present no acute or
      chronic illnesses, are not in the chronic use of any medication, do not have HIV infection or
      other immunodeficiency. Pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be included. Volunteers will
      receive three doses of vaccine prepared sm14, in doses containing 50 mcg of the antigen,
      associated with adjuvant GLA-SE at a dose of 10 mcg, with an interval of 30 days between each
      application. Twenty volunteers will be included in the study. This is a convenience sample,
      established for the first test of the product in humans, for the initial safety assessment.
