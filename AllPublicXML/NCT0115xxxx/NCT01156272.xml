      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ATS 3f® Aortic
      Bioprosthesis, Model 1000 (Equine Pericardial Bioprothesis) size 19mm in a patient population
      undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement of his/her native aortic valve, or replacement
      of a failed prosthesis.

      A multi-center, post market, non-randomized trial, designed to obtain safety and efficacy
      data from patients implanted with the size 19mm Model 1000 heart valve. Each enrolled patient
      will be followed until one year post-implantation. Data will be collected both
      retrospectively and prospectively, on patients who were implanted from 1-Jan-2009 to
      31-Dec-2009 with the 19mm Model 1000. The data collected will be pooled with the data
      currently collected, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IDE Number G01284 for
      submission to the U.S. FDA.

        Patients who were previously implanted with the ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000
        (size 19mm) between the dates 1-Jan-2009 and 31-Dec-2009 and who meet the eligibility

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient required isolated aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant
             procedures such as coronary artery bypass or another valve reconstruction with an ATS
             3f® Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000 (size 19mm) between the dates of 1-Jan-2009 and
             31-Dec-2009. The three remaining heart valves must be of native tissue.

          -  The patient is geographically stable and willing to return to the implant center for
             any required follow-up visits.

          -  The patient has been adequately informed and consents to his/her participation in the
             clinical study, and of what will be required of him/her, in order to comply with the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is twenty (20) or less than twenty years of age.

          -  The patient is an intravenous drug and/or alcohol abuser.

          -  The patient presented for implant with active endocarditis.

          -  The patient presented for implant with congenital bicuspid aortic anatomy.

          -  The patient had a previously implanted prosthetic valve that was not replaced by the
             study valve.

          -  The patient required mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valve replacement.
