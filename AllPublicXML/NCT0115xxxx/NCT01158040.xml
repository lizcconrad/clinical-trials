      The purpose of this study is to compare intrapartum glycemic control using insulin pump
      versus intravenous (IV) insulin administration.

    <textblock>
      Intrapartum maternal glycemic control in women suffering from pregestational diabetes
      mellitus type 1 will be evaluated and compared in the 3 study groups. Maternal and neonatal
      capillary blood glucose will be measured. All women suffering from diabetes mellitus and all
      neonates to hyperglycemic mothers are being tested for their blood glucose in our institute.
      Measurements' data will be collected. The primary outcome of the study is the number of
      neonatal hypoglycemic events (neonatal blood glucose &lt; 40mg/dL). All women participating in
      the study will be treated according to the standard accepted protocol for &quot;the treatment of
      pregestational diabetes during labor&quot; in our institute. The research will not include new
      treatments or equipment.

      The study is a cohort prospective and retrospective observational study in the tertiary
      center - Sheba medical center.
