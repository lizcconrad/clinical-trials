    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the transgene expression (synthesis of FGF-1 mRNA) in
      injected tissue, at injection site, after Intra Muscular (IM) administration of increasing
      single doses of NV1FGF.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IM administration of increasing single doses
           of NV1FGF

        -  To evaluate the transgene expression (FGF-1 protein) in injected tissues (injection site
           and remote site)

        -  To evaluate the presence of FGF-1 receptors in injected tissues (injection site and
           remote site)

        -  To evaluate the NV1FGF biodistribution in injected tissues (injection site and remote
           site), in multiple organs/tissues when appropriate, and plasma

        -  To evaluate the transgene expression (synthesis of FGF-1 mRNA) in injected tissue at
           remote site

        -  To collect data from plasma NV1FGF pharmacokinetics

        -  To evaluate healing of the amputation site

          -  Subjects who had a stroke or a neurological deficit presumably due to a stroke, within
             3 months prior to study treatment (Amendment #1)

          -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum &gt; 15 µg/l, unless liver ultrasound ruled out any
             malignant disease

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B or C, unless liver ultrasound ruled out any
