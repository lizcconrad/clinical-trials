  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no curative option exists for patients with relapsed or refractory stage IV
      neuroblastoma after previous autologous stem cell transplantation. Our preliminary results of
      RIC allo-HSCT (protocol RICE) indicate the feasability and low toxicity of allograft in
      heavily pre-treated children. Furthermore RIC SCT and immunomagnetic CD3/CD19 graft depletion
      may allow HHCT with lower toxicity and faster engraftment. CD3/CD19 depleted grafts not only
      contain CD34+ stem cells but also graft-facilitating cells, CD34- progenitors, dendritic and
      natural killer cells which may allow stable engraftment and participate to GvT effect.

      After haploidentical stem cell transplantation anti tumour activity exerted by donor derived
      NK cells could be stimulated by NK cells injections. Those effects may help to reduce the
      relapse rate and to impove the outcome of those patients. The investigators prospectively
      evaluated engraftment and immune reconstitution.

      This RICE NK protocol is a multicenter study of Haplo- HSCT using RIC with fludarabine (180
      mg/m2), Busulfan IV (3,2 to 4,8 mg/kg/d), TBI 2 grays and CD3/CD19 graft depletion. A minimum
      of 8 106 CD34+ cells/kg were infused on day 0. No post grafting immunosuppression was applied
      if the graft contained &lt; 2.5 x 104 CD3+ cells/kg. At Day 30 and 60 post-graft we perform an
      donor CD56+ cells injection. The investigators develop this strategy in an European
      collaboration working on haploidentical stem cell transplantation for childhood refractory
      and metastatic solid tumors.
