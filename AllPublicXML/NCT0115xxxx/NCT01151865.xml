  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the DahLIA trial is to determine, in patients with ICU-associated delirium
      and agitation who are otherwise pathophysiologically stable (as defined), the number of
      ventilator-free hours in the incident ICU admission in the 7 days following commencement of
      trial medication, in patients randomised to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo while
      receiving all other aspects of standard care.

      The null hypothesis assumes no difference in the median number of ventilator-free hours in
      this ICU admission in the following 7 days, between patients receiving dexmedetomidine and
      placebo for ICU-associated agitation and delirium.

    <description>Dexmedetomidine will be administered intravenously as a maintenance infusion of 0.2 to 1.5 mcg/kg/hour, commencing at 0.5 mcg/kg/hour and titrated according to effect, for as long as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Specifically, the study medication may be (as recommended by the manufacturer) continued after extubation, and if discontinued may be restarted at any time up until ICU discharge. The clinician will have the option of using a loading dose of 1.0 mcg/kg IV over 20 minutes, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Bedside nursing staff will adjust drug infusion rates as necessary, in consultation with the treating physician, aiming to achieve a Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale 20 score of 4.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for the study if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, they
        continue to require mechanical ventilation only because their degree of agitation requires
        such a high dose of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol, the only commonly used
        specific sedatives in our unit) that extubation is not possible, AND in the opinion of
        their treating intensivist their agitation is so severe as to make lessening their sedation
        unsafe.

        These criteria will be objectively quantified as follows:

          -  they have required either mechanical restraint and/or anti-delirium or sedative
             medication in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND

          -  their Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) test is positive for delirium
             in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND

          -  their Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) score is 5 or more in the 4 hours prior
             to seeking consent, confirming psychomotor agitation AND

          -  their SOFA score is less than or equal to 5 in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent,
             predicting a mortality or around 5%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years old

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Advanced dementia (in the premorbid state requiring professional nursing care)

          -  Open or closed head injury

          -  Death is deemed imminent and inevitable

          -  The patient has previously been enrolled in the DahLIA study

          -  Patients who could not be extubated, or who would be intubated within the following 48
             hours, even if delirium or agitation were corrected. This will include:

               -  Patients receiving high dose opioid for analgesia (not sedation) ( &gt; 40
                  mg/morphine/day)

               -  Patients shortly to return to the operating theatre

               -  Patients undergoing repeated invasive procedures, in whom it is desirable to
                  maintain deep sedation

               -  Patients likely to require ongoing airway protection or control, or ventilatory
                  support (for example, spinal patients with an inadequate vital capacity)

          -  Known allergy to haloperidol or alpha 2 agonists
