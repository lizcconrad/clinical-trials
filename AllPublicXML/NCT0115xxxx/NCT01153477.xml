      The purpose of this challenge grant is to conduct an initial test of a new, enhanced version
      of this protocol (telephone monitoring and counseling - enhanced, or TMAC-E), which has been
      modified to include the elements of our existing continuing care intervention plus
      patient-centered changes to boost patient involvement and community linkages. The
      investigators will recruit 150 cocaine dependent patients in publicly funded, community-based
      programs and randomize them to treatment as usual or the TMAC-E and follow them for 12
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) qualify for a DSM-IV diagnosis of cocaine dependence, with some cocaine use in the
             prior 6 months;

          -  (2) be 18 to 75 years of age;

          -  (3) have no current psychotic disorder or evidence of dementia severe enough to
             prevent participation in outpatient treatment;

          -  (4) have no acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment;

          -  (5) not be in methadone or other modes of Drug and Alcohol treatment, other than
             Intensive Outpatient Program;

          -  (6) be willing to be randomized and participate in research;

          -  (7) because of study follow-up requirements, subjects will be able to provide the
             name, verified telephone number, and address of at least one contact who can provide
             locator information on the patient during follow-up. We will include patients with
             dependence on other substances, provided that they are cocaine dependent and meet
             other inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a current psychotic disorder or evidence of dementia severe enough to prevent
             participation in outpatient treatment;

          -  have acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment;

          -  are in methadone or other modes of DA treatment, other than IOP;

          -  or cannot provide names of people who can get messages to them for follow up, in the
             event we cannot locate the participant at their original address and number. Also, if
             they are court mandated to treatment or otherwise considered a prisoner, they will be
             ineligible for the study as we have not applied for Subpart C approval.
