      The purpose of this research study is to learn if the study drug RAD001 can shrink or slow
      the growth of low-grade gliomas in children with NF1. Additionally, the safety of RAD001 will
      be studied.

      The study drug, RAD001, is a drug that may act directly on tumor cells by preventing tumor
      cell growth and development. RAD001 has been studied in participants with various types of
      cancer as a single agent (a drug that is used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination
      with a number of well known anticancer therapies. Information from these research studies
      suggests that RAD001 may help to shrink or slow the growth of low-grade gliomas.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see the response of RAD001 in
      children with low-grade gliomas and NF1 that have either not responded to treatment or have
      come back after treatment. We are also looking for the highest dose of RAD001 that can be
      given safely in this patient population.

      After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or
      procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. These tests and procedures are
      likely to be part of regular glioma care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not
      take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently,
      they may or may not have to be repeated.

      A medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you
      are taking or plan to take, and any allergies.

      A physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having.
      Additionally, your clinician will check your vital signs (body temperature, heart rate,
      breathing rate, and blood pressure) and bodily systems (respiratory, nervous, digestive,
      etc). The doctor will also evaluate your performance status, which indicates how much your
      illness affects your activity level.

      Blood tests, including tests to measure any effects of your disease. Approximately 1-2
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn for these tests.

      Urine test, which will be done to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly.

      An assessment of your tumor using scans of the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will
      be used to look at and evaluate the tumor.

      An Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of your heart

      A pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. A small amount of blood (about half a
      teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for this test.

      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able
      to participate in this research study.

          -  Evaluable or Measurable Disease: Patients must have at least one evaluable or
             measurable site of disease according to criteria described in Section 9. If the

             50% for patients 10 years of age (Appendix I). Note: Patients who are unable to walk
             because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory
             for the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  Patients must have failed or not been able to tolerate a carboplatin-based regimen.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

          -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 4 weeks of entry onto

             with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 14
             days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which
             adverse events are known to occur. These patients must be discussed with the Study
             Chair on a case-by-case basis.

          -  CYP3A4 inducers: Patients must also avoid St. John's Wort, an inducer of CYP3A4

          -  Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants: Patients may not be taking enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsants, and may not have received these medications within 1 week prior to

             knife that includes all target lesions (i.e., there is no restriction if a new lesion
             arises outside the radiation field or a non-irradiated lesion progresses);

          -  6 months must have elapsed if the patient has received craniospinal XRT.
