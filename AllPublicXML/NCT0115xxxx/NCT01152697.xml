  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychotropic medications are a cornerstone of treatment for individuals with schizophrenia
      and schizoaffective disorder, however rates of full or partial non-adherence can exceed 60%.
      Inadequate adherence is associated with poor outcomes such as relapse, homelessness,
      hospitalization, and increased health care costs. Studies have shown a direct correlation
      between non-adherence and rates of relapse in schizophrenia; on average, non-adherent
      patients have a risk of relapse that is 3.7 times greater than their adherent counterparts. A
      major obstacle to good outcomes in the maintenance treatment of patients with severe mental
      illness is difficulty with medication routines on an on-going basis. For this reason,
      long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication is a particularly attractive treatment option
      for populations with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, although it is unlikely that
      medication treatment alone is likely to modify long-term attitudes and behaviors.

      This prospective study is a pilot analysis of a combined approach which merges a psychosocial
      intervention to optimize treatment attitudes towards psychotropic medication (CAE) and
      long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication (L) in recently homeless individuals with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are known to have on-going difficulties with
      treatment non-adherence. It is expected that this combined approach (CAE-L) will improve
      illness outcomes among the most vulnerable of populations with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.

    <measure>Change in Serious Mental Illness Severity Score as Measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at 25 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS, developed by Overall and Gorham (1962), is a widely used, relatively brief scale that measures major psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms in individuals with SMI. The 18-item BPRS is well-validated and is perhaps the most researched instrument in psychiatry. Reliability coefficients are reported to be in the range of 0.56-0.87.
Scale Range: 18-126 Lower scores represent improved outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Global Psychopathology as Measured by the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) at 25 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global psychopathology will be measured with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) (Guy 1976) a widely used scale which evaluates illness severity on a 1 to 7 point continuum. Severity of illness ratings on the CGI have reported reliability scores ranging from 0.41-0.66 (Guy 1976) Lower scores indicate improved outcomes. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes.
Illness scale: 1 - 7 (1 = Normal/not at all ill ; 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients) Global improvement scale: 1 - 7 (1 = Very much improved ; 7 = Very much worse)</description>

    <measure>Change in Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) as Measured at 25 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Life and Work Functional status will be evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS), which is derived from the GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning). The GAF is a 100-point single-item scale which measures global functioning of psychiatric patients and is widely utilized in clinical studies involving Seriously Mentally Ill patients (Jones 1995). The reliability of the GAF ranges from 0.62-0.82. Higher scores indicate improved outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction will be measured by a seven item inventory taken by the participant.
Scale ranges from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). Lower scores indicate better outcomes, while higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The highest possible score is 35.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder Symptom Severity Scale as Measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at 25 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS (Kay, Fiszbein, &amp; Opler 1987) was created to assess both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and emotional withdrawal, respectively. The scale rates 30 symptoms on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) and has been shown to limit bias between the assessment of positive and negative symptoms, providing a broad but balanced spectrum of the illness.
There are three subscales: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology. Potential responses to Items on all subscales range from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Lower scores indicate lower symptoms and, therefore, better outcomes. Higher scores indicate more presence of symptoms and, therefore, worse outcomes.
Subscales are combined to produce a total score, which is summed from all of the subscales. Lower total scores indicate lower symptoms and, therefore, better outcomes. Higher total scores indicate more presence of symptoms and, therefore, worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>CAE targets key areas relevant to non-adherent populations with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: 1) inadequate or incorrect understanding of mental disorder; 2) lack of medication-taking routines; 3) poor communication with care providers; and 4) substance use which interferes with adherence and healthy behaviors that promote recovery. CAE is delivered based upon initial assessment of reasons for non-adherence and only those components of CAE that are determined to be indicated for that individual are delivered (psychoeducation, modified motivational interviewing, assistance with medication routines, coaching in communication with providers).</description>

        <description>The BPRS, developed by Overall and Gorham (1962), is a widely used, relatively brief scale that measures major psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms in individuals with SMI. The 18-item BPRS is well-validated and is perhaps the most researched instrument in psychiatry. Reliability coefficients are reported to be in the range of 0.56-0.87.
Scale Range: 18-126 Lower scores represent improved outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change in Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder Symptom Severity Scale as Measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at 25 Weeks</title>
        <description>The PANSS (Kay, Fiszbein, &amp; Opler 1987) was created to assess both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and emotional withdrawal, respectively. The scale rates 30 symptoms on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) and has been shown to limit bias between the assessment of positive and negative symptoms, providing a broad but balanced spectrum of the illness.
There are three subscales: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology. Potential responses to Items on all subscales range from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Lower scores indicate lower symptoms and, therefore, better outcomes. Higher scores indicate more presence of symptoms and, therefore, worse outcomes.
Subscales are combined to produce a total score, which is summed from all of the subscales. Lower total scores indicate lower symptoms and, therefore, better outcomes. Higher total scores indicate more presence of symptoms and, therefore, worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>Life and Work Functional status will be evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS), which is derived from the GAF. The GAF is a 100-point single-item scale which measures global functioning of psychiatric patients and is widely utilized in clinical studies involving Seriously Mentally Ill patients (Jones 1995). The reliability of the GAF ranges from 0.62-0.82. Higher scores indicate improved outcomes.</description>
