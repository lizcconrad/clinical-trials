  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a capsule (SmartPill~)
      measuring pH, pressure and temperature from within the entire GI tract to determine gastric
      emptying time, combined small and large bowel transit time and total transit time. In
      addition, the Capsule will characterize pressure patterns and provide motility indices for
      the antrum and duodenum. It is believed that the condition of your digestive system can have
      a large impact on your overall physical health. Therefore,the investigators would like to
      assess whether using the pill device helps to determine any functional problems in patients
      in the ICU. The investigators are studying ICU patients because any change in their condition
      can have a large impact on their recovery.

    <description>Qualifying patients were assigned to the study within four days of hospital admission. They all received a gastro-duodenal tube and capsule. The motility capsule (SmartPill®) was placed into the capsule delivery device (AdvanCE™, US Endoscopy) and advanced blindly into the stomach and released</description>
