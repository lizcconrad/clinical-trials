    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a medical device (ActiPatch) that emits a low
      frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) will benefit patients with anterior uveitis.
      Anterior uveitis (aka iritis) is an inflammatory disease involving the front segment of the
      eye. This is a common cause of a painful red eye, and ActiPatch has been shown to be
      effective in treating tissue inflammation. The conventional treatment of iritis typically
      involves frequent administration of topical steroids which have their own inherent risks
      (development of cataracts and/or glaucoma). The purpose of this study is to determine if
      ActiPatch therapy can be used to shorten the length of time and/or quantity of steroids
      administered.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iritis is an inflammatory disease focused in the anterior chamber of the eye. The
      inflammation inside the eye can lead to a number of conditions that ultimately effect vision.
      These can include glaucoma, posterior synechiae, cystoid macular edema, and cataract. The
      standard treatment for the disease is drug therapy centered around the administration of
      corticosteroids. These are administered in the form of eye drops, and if necessary
      periocular/intraocular injections, or/and by systemic oral/IV administration. Unfortunately,
      the treatment with corticosteroids can similarly induce severe side effects including
      glaucoma and cataract formation. ActiPatch is a medical device that emits a low frequency
      pulsed electromagnetic field. This device has been shown to reduce inflammation and pain in a
      number of conditions, eg blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). ActiPatch is FDA approved for use
      after blepharoplasty to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. The treatment is not
      invasive, does not require additional medication, and side effects from ActiPatch and other
      PEMF devices have not been reported. The potential benefit of treating uveitis with ActiPatch
      is the potential to reduce the time and/or amount of steroid administration. This would
      benefit patients by reducing the risk of unwanted side effects of the corticosteroid
      treatment.

      The benefit to society would be an improved treatment for anterior uveitis.

    <description>Degree and grade of ocular inflammation based on Standard Uveitis Nomenclature will be assessed at initial visit, Day 3, and Day 7 of use of the PEMF device to assess if the PEMF device decreases the duration and severity of ocular inflammation when used as an adjunctive therapy for anterior uveitis. The results posted here are from day 7. The Standard Uveitis Nomenclature scale ranges from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating a minimal level of ocular inflammation and 4 indicating the maximal level of corneal inflammation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Human subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis (iritis) but
             are in otherwise in good health will be recruited for the study. The age requirement
             will be a minimum of 18 yrs. We will recruit 24 patient for this study. Subjects will
             only be included who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis
             (noninfectious). Eligibility will be determined by the treating Ophthalmologist
             (principal investigator) for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable subjects, as defined by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), will not be
             recruited for participation (This includes individuals under 18, pregnant women,
             prisoners, fetuses, patients mentally or physically unable to provide written informed
             consent).

          -  Other groups excluded include: patients with pacemakers and patients with
             ferromagnetic metal implants since these devices may be effected by the pulsed
             electromagnetic field.
