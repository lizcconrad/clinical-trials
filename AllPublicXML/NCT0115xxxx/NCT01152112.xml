      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the MyoSure Tissue
      Removal System when used by community gynecologists in an office setting for the treatment of
      patients with symptomatic intrauterine polyps and submucosal fibroids.

      Approximately one hundred subjects will be enrolled in a randomized, comparative setting
      study conducted at 10-15 investigational sites. Sixty subjects will be randomized to undergo
      treatment in an office setting, and 40 subjects will be randomized to undergo treatment in a
      hospital or ambulatory surgical center (ASC) setting. Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic
      tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids.
      Saline infused sonohysterogram images (SIS) obtained at three months post treatment will be
      compared to pre-treatment images, to determine the percent reduction in target pathology
      volume. Additionally, subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale) will
      compare pain occurring during the treatment procedure to the average pain level experienced
      during a PAP smear. Economic data will be collected and compared between the two treatment
      settings.

             within 30 days of the planned index procedure

          -  Subject exhibits intrauterine polyps and/or submucous myomas which, in the opinion of
             the treating physician, are compatible with office-based treatment (e.g. 15 minutes or
