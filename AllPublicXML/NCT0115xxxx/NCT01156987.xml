  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's medical imaging methods have insufficient specificity for reliable differentiation
      between benign and malignant breast lesions in patients. Pathologic evaluation is currently
      the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This research will use a novel method of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Sweep Imaging with Fourier Transform (SWIFT), at a very
      high magnetic field (4 Tesla) to distinguish malignant from benign breast lesions. This
      research will reveal whether the SWIFT sequence bears new capabilities in medical imaging for
      breast cancer diagnosis.

      Patients will be asked to come to the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the
      University of Minnesota. Researchers will interview the patient and describe procedures and
      risks. An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in an upper extremity for infusing magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) contrast dye. Baseline MRI scans will be done. These MRI measurements
      will be compared with clinical, radiological and pathological findings (the gold standard).

      Follow-up contact will occur within one year after the MRI to determine whether a pathology
      report is available.

    <description>Patients and healthy volunteers will be first screened for MRI contraindications. The SWIFT MRI workflow will be performed as follows:
an IV line is placed by nurse,
patient is placed in the 4 T MRI scanner at CMRR,
initial scout images and manual linear shims are adjusted,
Pre-contrast SWIFT T1 weighted images and T1 map are obtained,
continuous SWIFT acquisition begins immediately before contrast injection,
contrast injection,
continuous SWIFT acquisition continues for 12 min after contrast,
late enhancement images may also be obtained.
10 and 30 patients will be scanned in the first and second year, respectively. Thresholds will be set for prospective analysis. SWIFT-DCE diagnostic performance will be compared to prior FLASH-DCE methods.</description>

          <description>Healthy women will be screened for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contraindications, and then undergo contrast injection, and SWIFT acquisition.
Magnetic resonance imaging: Patients and healthy volunteers will be first screened for MRI contraindications. The SWIFT MRI workflow will be performed as follows:
an IV line is placed by nurse,
patient is placed in the 4 T MRI scanner at CMRR,
initial scout images and manual linear shims are adjusted,
Pre-contrast SWIFT T1 weighted images and T1 map are obtained,
continuous SWIFT acquisition begins immediately before contrast injection,
contrast injection,
continuous SWIFT acquisition continues for 12 min after contrast,
late enhancement images may also be obtained.
10 and 30 patients will be scanned in the first and second year, respectively. Thresholds will be set for prospective analysis. SWIFT-DCE diagnostic performance will be compared to prior FLASH-DCE methods.</description>
