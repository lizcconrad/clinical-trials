  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people who have a SPECT scan (nuclear imaging of the blood flow to the
      heart muscle) ordered by their medical doctors. As part of the SPECT scan, they will have
      been given a drug called regadenoson to widen and expand the blood vessels bringing blood to
      the heart muscle. The SPECT pictures of the heart are taken about an hour after the
      regadenoson is put into an arm vein through an IV. In this study, additional echo pictures
      will be taken and compared to the SPECT pictures.

      The aim of the study is to see if the echo pictures work as well as SPECT to measure the
      blood flow to the heart muscle.

      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, comparative, same-setting study of
      Lexiscan MPI SPECT versus state-of-the-art echocardiography. Lexiscan SPECT MPI will be
      performed per routine clinical protocol with Lexiscan administered as per package insert (0.4
      mg in 5 ml IV push over 10 seconds followed by a 5 ml saline flush). Simultaneous
      echo/Doppler will be obtained immediately before (baseline), during and immediately post
      (peak vasodilation) using conventional techniques.
