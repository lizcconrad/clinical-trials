  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of GSK
      Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A when administered either as a booster
      dose or as a two dose catch-up vaccination in the second year of life to the Nigerian
      subjects previously enrolled in the primary vaccination study NCT00678301.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00678301).

Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling.
Solicited general symptoms assessed were drowsiness, fever, irritability and loss of appetite.

Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL).
Pneumococcal serotype specific total imunoglobuline G (IgG) antibodies were measured by 22F-inhibition Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cut-off of the assay was 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

    <description>Cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 6A and 19A. Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL).
The antibody concentrations against the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A were determined by 22F-inhibition Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cut-off of the assay was 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

    <description>Vaccine pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F.
Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay using a HL 60 cell line. The results were presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titre) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions.

        <description>Vaccine pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F.
Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL).
Pneumococcal serotype specific total imunoglobuline G (IgG) antibodies were measured by 22F-inhibition Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cut-off of the assay was 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

        <title>Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Cross-reactive Pneumococcal Serotypes.</title>
        <description>Cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 6A and 19A.
Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay using a HL 60 cell line. The results were presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titre) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions. The cut-off of the assay is an opsonic titre of 8.</description>

This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one pneumococcal vaccine serotype or protein D for the blood sample taken one month after vaccination.</population>
