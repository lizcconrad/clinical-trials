    <textblock>
      Graft vs. host disease represents the most formidable problem following allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematological diseases. Chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (cGVHD) is the most serious and common long-term complication of this treatment in
      patients surviving more than 100 days. Some patients are requiring immunosuppressive therapy
      for years. cGVHD is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality and remains a
      major cause of late death. When standard treatment with steroids is ineffective or poorly
      tolerated, effective therapeutic options are limited. Patients with uncontrolled cGVHD with
      initial therapy including systemic steroids respond poorly to second line options. Recent
      studies have demonstrated Bortezomib safety in the prophylaxis, and improvement of GVHD
      suggesting its efficacy.This study is done to evaluate the potential of bortezomib in
      treating refractory cGVHD.

    <time_frame>19 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total time frame including treatment and follow up is 19 months(Maximum of 6 cycles during initial treatment phase, 6 cycles in maintenance phase, and follow up phase for 6 months). Subjects will be assessed for signs and symptoms of cGVHD on day 1 of every cycle using standardized criteria for diagnosis of cGVHD, new clinical scoring system, and new guidelines for global assessment of chronic GVHD severity per NIH consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic GVHD. Safety will be assessed in terms of adverse events for 30 days following the last dose to a maximum of 6 months. Adverse events will be recorded through out the trial and will be followed by investigator until resolution.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  ≥18 years old.

          -  Able to understand and sign informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of steroid-refractory cGVHD is defined as either failure to improve after 2
             months or progression after 1 month of standard steroid based therapy.

          -  No previous treatment with Bortezomib for cGVHD

          -  ECOG PS&lt;3

          -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3months.

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study and through a minimum
             of 30 days after the last dose of bortezomib.
