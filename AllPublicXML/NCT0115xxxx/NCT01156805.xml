      ABSTRACT Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention on food habits and physical
      activity in school-age children.

      Methods: a two-year cluster-randomised prospective study with two parallel arms was used to
      evaluate an intervention programme in children in their first year of primary schooling (5-6
      years of age) in schools in the city of Granollers. The intervention consisted of the
      promotion of healthy eating habits and physical activity by means of the educational
      methodology Investigation, Vision, Action and Change (IVAC). At the beginning and at the end
      of the study (2006 and 2008) the weight and height of each child was measured in situ, while
      the families were given a self-report physical activity questionnaire and the Krece Plus
      quick test.

      Results: two years after the beginning of the study, the BMI of the children in the control
      group was 0.89 Kg/ m2 higher than that of the intervention schools. The intervention reduced
      by 62% the prevalence of overweight children. Similarly, the proportion of children that ate
      a second piece of fruit and took part in an after-school physical activity increased in the
      intervention group. In the control group, the weekly consumption of fish was reduced.

      Conclusion: the educational intervention in healthy eating habits and physical activity in
      the school environment together with the involvement of the family could contribute to lessen
      the current increase in child obesity in our setting.
