  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of thrombolytic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke who present
      with stroke symptoms upon awakening.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ischemic stroke are currently only eligible for the treatment with intravenous
      thrombolysis if the stroke is diagnosed within 4.5 hours from known onset of symptoms.

      Many patients awaken with stroke and are excluded from this therapy, following current
      guidelines.

      Patients who suffer from a stroke just before or after waking up may be candidates for
      thrombolysis and our study will use advanced neuroimaging to select those patients.
