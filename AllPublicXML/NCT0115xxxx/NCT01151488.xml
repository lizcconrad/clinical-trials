  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of resistance training on the reasons
      (mechanisms) underlying the development of fatigue, muscle weakness and wasting (sarcopenia),
      and impaired physical functioning (poor balance and walking) associated with breast cancer
      survivorship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, representing 26% of all
      female cancers. It is also the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US for
      women. Side effects of the cancer and treatment therapies may result in inactivity and
      inadequate intakes of various nutrients, including protein and vitamin D, associated with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes. High concentrations of systemic and local
      inflammation correlate well with CVD and diabetes risk. There is substantial evidence to
      support that incorporating physical activity and nutrition into one's lifestyle can reduce
      inflammation and, ultimately, the progression to CVD and diabetes. Understanding the role of
      exercise and diet management in the health of breast cancer survivors will allow us to
      translate these findings into therapy guidelines.
