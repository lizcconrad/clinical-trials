  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective registry of patients with intermediate coronary lesions
      defined as a stenosis of 40-80% by angiography. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled
      into the study at sites in the United States and Europe. There will be no follow up beyond
      hospital discharge in this study. A sub-group of 30 patients will undergo Adenosine MRI. The
      investigators hypothesize that Intravascular Ultrasound Radiofrequency (IVUS RF) anatomical
      criteria, such as minimal luminal area, plaque burden and virtual histology plaque type, can
      predict physiological ischemia by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).

      Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization must meet clinical inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and sign an informed consent. At the time of catheterization the patients will be
      further analyzed for eligibility using angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Patients who fulfilled the clinical and angiographic criteria will undergo further imaging
      evaluation using an IVUS RF catheter (Volcano Therapeutics) and FFR wire (Radi or Volcano).
      The decision for treatment of any lesion will be at the operator's discretion. For patients
      enrolled at Washington Hospital Center and do not undergo percutaneous coronary intervention,
      an assessment with non invasive perfusion adenosine MRI also be performed.

    <description>Diagnostic device: FFR
Diagnostic device: IVUS RF
At participating centers, FFR and IVUS are standard of care diagnostic procedures for patients with intermediate (40-80% angiographic stenosis by visual estimate). Both modalities were used regularly for such patients whether or not they are participants in this clinical study. In FIRST, the decision to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was left to the discretion of the investigator, and was not dictated by the clinical protocol.</description>

        Patients required to have an intermediate coronary lesion (stenosis 40-80% by visual
        estimate) in one or more native, major epicardial coronary artery with reference diameter
        ≥2.5mm (visual estimate)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Clinical indication for coronary angiography for stable or unstable angina

        Specific Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients required to have an intermediate coronary lesion (stenosis 40-80% by visual
             estimate) in one or more native, major epicardial coronary artery with reference
             diameter ≥2.5mm (visual estimate)

          -  The vessel(s) with the intermediate lesion must have no flow limiting lesions and must
             be available for imaging and must be considered safe for imaging evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had a documented acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within
             the past 24 hours

          -  Decompensated heart failure or hypotension requiring intubation, inotropes,
             intravenous diuretics or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation.

          -  Renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2)

          -  Prior participation in this study or patient is currently enrolled in another
             investigational use device or drug study that has not reached its primary endpoint. If
             the patient is enrolled in another study that is not investigational, required visits

          -  Ostial lesion
