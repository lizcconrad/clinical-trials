    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety profile
      of recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII) assessed by the occurrence of adverse events in healthy
      Japanese subjects. In addition pharmacokinetic parameters will be investigated.
