    <textblock>
      We, the investigators, hypothesise that there are distinct gene profiles in
      rhinovirus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma. We further hypothesise that these changes
      in gene expression involve both known mediators of the asthma phenotype as well as other
      molecules not previously associated with asthma.

      The primary objective of this study is to use gene array analysis to determine differentially
      expressed genes in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from normal and
      asthmatic subjects before and during rhinovirus infection in vivo. A secondary objective is
      to determine whether any altered expressions are related to symptom severity, virus load,
      lung function or airway inflammation in vivo.

      We plan to recruit 45 subjects: 15 healthy volunteers, 15 asthmatics naïve to inhaled
      corticosteroid therapy, and 15 asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids who will undergo two
      bronchoscopies, one prior to infection with rhinovirus and the second 4 days post
      inoculation. Bronchial brushings, biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be
      performed. RNA will be extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified
      by passage through RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Exon 1.0ST array chips (Affymetrix,
      Santa Clara, CA) will be used to analyse changes in gene expression. These are the most
      powerful genome expression tools available with 1.4 million probe sets and over 5.5 million
      features per array. Genes found to be significantly upregulated will be confirmed by
      quantitative RT-PCR.

      Using a novel method of collecting undiluted bronchial epithelial lining fluid
      (bronchosorption) large numbers of proteins will be measured with a MesoScale Discovery
      multiplexed array system (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md) allowing further
      confirmation of the gene array results as well as providing in vivo evidence of dysregulated
      protein production in asthmatics. Gene expression and protein levels will be correlated with
      viral load, symptom scores, lung function and airway inflammation in vivo.

      This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation of changes in bronchial epithelial
      gene expression during rhinovirus infection in vivo and therefore has the potential to
      provide significant insights into the host response in asthma and identify potential novel
      targets for further evaluation.
