             insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

          -  Weight: ≥ 45.5 kg and ≤ 150 kg at Visit 0 (Screening Visit)

          -  White blood cells ≥2,500/mm3 and &lt;11,000/mm3 at Visit 0

          -  Absolute neutrophil count within normal limits at Visit 0

          -  Platelets within normal limits at Visit 0

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study related
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clinical manifestation of any flavivirus infection (Yellow Fever, Dengue
             Fever, JE, Tick Borne Encephalitis (TBE) and West Nile Fever/Neuroinvasive Disease)

          -  Vaccination against JE (including study participation in any previous or current
             IC51/IXIARO® clinical study), Yellow fever, Dengue Fever or West Nile Fever at any
             time prior or during the study

          -  Vaccination against TBE within 30 days prior to first IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1
             (Day 0) and until Visit 3 (Day 70)

          -  Use of any other investigational or non-registered medicinal product within 30 days
             prior to IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and throughout the entire study period

          -  Immunodeficiency including status post-organ-transplantation or immuno-suppressive
             therapy, and a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency

          -  Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, a negative test result within 30
             days before screening is acceptable), Hepatitis B virus (HBV, Hepatitis B surface

          -  Administration of chronic (defined as longer than 14 days) immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 30 days prior to IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0)
             and during the study until Visit 3 (Day 70). (For corticosteroids this means
             prednisone or equivalent &gt;= 0.05 mg/kg/day; topical and inhaled steroids are allowed).

          -  Periodic steroid injections, e.g., intra-articular, are not allowed within 30 days
             prior to first IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and until Visit 3 (Day 70)

             completed more than six months ago and the malignancy is considered to be cured, the
             subject may be enrolled. Subjects with history of skin cancer must not be vaccinated
             at the previous site of the malignancy.

          -  Any other malignancy in the past 5 years. If treatment for cancer was successfully
             completed more than 5 years ago and the malignancy is considered to be cured, the
             subject may be enrolled.

          -  Clinically significant hematological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, central nervous,
             cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disorders, which are not adequately controlled by
             medical treatment within the last 12 weeks before IXIARO® vaccination at Visit 1 (Day
             0) as judged by the site's Principal Investigator

          -  Clinically significant mental disorder not adequately controlled by medical treatment

          -  History of Guillain-Barré-Syndrome (GBS).

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions, in particular to a component of the
             IXIARO® vaccine (e.g. protamine sulfate), anaphylaxis or severe cases of atopy
             requiring emergency treatment or hospital admission

          -  History of urticaria after hymenoptera envenomation, drugs, physical or other
             provocations, or of idiopathic cause

          -  Drug addiction within 6 months prior to Visit 0 and throughout the entire study period
             (including alcohol dependence, i.e. more than approximately 60 g alcohol per day, or
             conditions which might interfere with the study conduct)

          -  Inability or unwillingness to avoid more than the usual intake of alcohol (&gt; 60 g
             alcohol/day) during the 48 hours after each vaccination

          -  Any condition which might interfere with study objectives or would limit the subject's
             ability to complete the study in the opinion of the investigator
