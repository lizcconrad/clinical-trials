      This study will assess the effect of in-home tele-health monitoring on health outcomes for
      LSUHCSD chronic disease, overweight or obese patients diagnosed with type II diabetes or
      hypertension. Primary emphasis will be on assessing the effect of tele-health home monitoring
      combined with motivational telephone coaching on weight loss and waist circumference as
      compared to self-directed, home monitoring alone, and telephone coaching alone. Secondary
      outcomes such as blood pressure, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol
      will be examined as well.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement or comparable changes in weight loss and waist circumference.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>After 5 months, individuals randomized to the home monitoring plus the telephone intervention aimed at promoting improved physical activity and dietary habits will have a greater average improvement in weight loss and waist circumference than patients on home monitoring alone, telephone intervention alone, or self-directed. After 5 months, individuals randomized in the home monitoring intervention will have comparable changes in weight and waist circumference to those individuals in the telephone intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluating effects on resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, and metabolic measures including serum cholesterol and triglyceride.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the primary aims, we will evaluate the effects of home monitoring, telephone intervention, home monitoring plus telephone-based coaching, and self-directed on several important secondary outcomes, including resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, and metabolic measures including serum cholesterol and triglyceride. In addition, we will evaluate daily weight measurements during the interventions using the home monitoring device.</description>
