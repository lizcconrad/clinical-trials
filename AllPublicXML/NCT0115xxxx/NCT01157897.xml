  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-humans safety, immunogenicity and efficacy study with recombinant
      proteinVMP001, a Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (CS) protein based vaccine. This open
      label study will be performed in malaria-naïve adults in the United States. Three doses of
      VMP001 formulated in AS01B will be given intramuscularly at different intervals followed by a
      challenge with P. vivax infected mosquitoes. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy parameters
      will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, non-randomized, open label, dose escalation study in healthy,
      malaria-naïve adults aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive). The vaccine will be administered with
      GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' adjuvant system AS01B. This is a first-in-human study of VMP001;
      therefore the study design will incorporate a dose-escalation phase evaluating 15 µg, 30 µg,
      and 60 µg doses of VMP001 in 500 µL of AS01B. A total of 30 volunteers, divided into 3 groups
      (10 in each group), will receive 3 doses of the VMP001/AS01B vaccine. Group 1 will receive 15
      µg of VMP001, Group 2 will receive 30 µg of VMP001, and Group 3 will receive 60 µg of VMP001
      at each immunization. The dose of AS01B will be 500 µL for all groups. The first and second
      dose in each group will be separated by 28 days. The third dose in the three groups will be
      given at intervals scheduled to normalize the time to challenge between the last immunization
      and challenge. The second and third dose in Group 1 will be separated by 56 days, Group 2 by
      42 days and Group 3 by 28 days. The challenge will occur 2 weeks following the third
      immunization. A group of 6-12 infectivity controls will begin participation in the study at
      the challenge stage. They will not receive any immunizations or placebos prior to challenge.
      All volunteers will receive a standard treatment regimen consisting of chloroquine and
      primaquine on the day that parasitemia is detected. Volunteers who do not become parasitemic
      will also begin the same treatment regimen on day 28 following the challenge (study day 126).

      Safety and immunogenicity will be evaluated during the study through the final study visit 6
      months after challenge (study day 280).
