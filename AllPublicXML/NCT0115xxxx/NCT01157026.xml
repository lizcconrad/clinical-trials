    <textblock>
      Tocotrienol Rich Fraction (TRF) in combination with Tamoxifen will improve breast cancer
      specific survival and recurrence free survival, in women with early breast cancer and
      estrogen receptor positive tumors.

      We conducted a, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial of TRF plus tamoxifen versus placebo
      plus tamoxifen in women with primary breast cancer for five years. Both the TRF and placebo
      drugs were prepared and supplied by Hovid Sdn Bhd, Malaysia. Hovid Sdn. Bhd. absolutely did
      not have any influence in the trial designing, patient recruitment, data collection, analysis
      and reporting. The placebo drug which contained soy oil without tocotrienols had similar
      appearance and taste as the TRF drug. A total of 240 women breast cancer patients were
      assigned to two groups by minimization method that balanced treatment groups. The
      intervention group was given TRF plus tamoxifen, (n = 120) while control group was given
      placebo plus tamoxifen, (n = 120). The primary end point was breast cancer specific survival,
      defined as the time from minimization to death due to breast cancer. The secondary end points
      included disease free survival, biochemical parameters, liver function and plasma levels of
      vitamin E.
