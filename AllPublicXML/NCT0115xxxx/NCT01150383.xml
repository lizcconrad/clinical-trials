  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is number four of the leading causes of death in
      the USA and Europe. Moreover, among the top five causes of death, this disease is the only
      one with increasing mortality rates. Physical training has become an evidence based
      therapeutic intervention in these patients.

      In this study the investigators aim to establish if supplemental oxygen during strength and
      endurance training improves exercise tolerance. Furthermore, the investigators want to
      research, if supplemental oxygen has the ability to increase training intensity, which would
      lead to a greater training effect with respect to respiratory, vascular, inflammatory and
      anthropometric parameters, as well as quality of life.

      SCOPE is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over trial. The
      investigators aim to enroll 40 patients suffering from COPD aged &gt;30 years. Inclusion
      criteria are FEV1 30-60%, and PO2 at rest &gt;55 mmHg. At baseline, patients will undergo
      pre-tests including pulmonary, exercise physiological and medical investigations. Prior to
      the exercise training, an intervention-free control period with usual care is planned. This
      will be followed by 2 x 6 weeks with physical training (ergometer based endurance training
      and strength training, using weight lifting machines) with either supplemental oxygen or
      usual room air (e.g.: first 6 weeks of exercise with oxygen supplementation followed by 6
      weeks of room air). After the initial control period and between these two exercise periods,
      patients will be tested as described in pre-tests, and at the end of the second exercise
      training period. In addition, the investigators will assess changes in lung function and
      symptomatic dyspnoea, as well as in quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire).

      Within this study, the investigators hope to improve rehabilitation programs for COPD
      patients.
