      The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to lower the nighttime blood
      pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by shifting the administration of
      antihypertensive drugs from morning to nighttime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years several studies have shown that high nighttime blood pressure is associated
      with increased cardiovascular risk independently of the average 24 hour blood pressure. As a
      consequence there has been increasing focus on nighttime blood pressure and how to lower it.
      One way of addressing the problem is to shift the administration of antihypertensive drugs
      from morning to nighttime. Studies on non-diabetic patients show that by doing this the
      nighttime blood pressure can be lowered with 3-5 mm Hg without negative effect on the 24 hour
      blood pressure.

      Only recently a study was made on diabetic patients. This showed similar results as for
      non-diabetic patients.However this study was based on diabetic patients who did not receive
      any antihypertensive drugs before.

      This study will investigate the effects on nighttime blood pressure when shifting
      administration of antihypertensive drugs from morning to nighttime. The population is
      diabetic patients who are already in antihypertensive treatment.
