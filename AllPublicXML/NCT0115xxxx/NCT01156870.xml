      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR566658

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the safety profile of SAR566658

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR566658

        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR566658

        -  To assess preliminary antitumor activity

        -  To assess the effect of SAR566658 at recommended dose on CYP3A enzyme activity using
           midazolam

        -  To assess safety in the alternative schedules of SAR566658 administration

      The duration of the study for one patient in the dose escalation phase of the study will
      include a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a 3-week treatment cycle(s) and a 2-week
      treatment cycle(s). The patients may continue treatment until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up. If
      a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohorts, continues to benefit
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study
      treatment and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the study flowchart. Such
      patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP administration.

             allowed within 2 weeks before midazolam administration and up to the end of
             pharmacokinetic sampling following the last midazolam administration.

          -  Any contra-indications to midazolam, according to the applicable labeling.
