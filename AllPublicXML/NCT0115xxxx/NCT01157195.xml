  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constraint-Induced Movement therapy, also known as CI therapy, is an approach to physical
      rehabilitation derived from basic behavioral and neuroscience research. It has been shown to
      be efficacious for rehabilitating use of the more-affected arm in individuals more than one
      year after stroke with mild to moderate motor impairment. The first component of the therapy
      is intensive training in use of the more-affected arm on functional tasks for 3 hours daily
      for 10 consecutive weekdays. The second is wearing a protective safety mitt on the
      less-affected hand for all waking hours of the approximately 2-week treatment period that it
      is safe to do so. The purpose of the mitt is to discourage use of the less-affected arm. The
      third is a group of behavioral techniques designed to transfer gains from the treatment
      setting to the real world, which takes a therapist, on average, 30 minutes to implement on
      each treatment day.

      The purpose of this project is to develop and test a method for automating the delivery of
      this efficacious treatment in a way that the therapy can be provided in stroke patients'
      homes. After developing an automated CI therapy workstation that has tele-health
      capabilities, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      whether CI therapy delivered in the home using this workstation with remote supervision by a
      therapist via an Internet-based audiovisual link provides outcomes that are just as good as
      CI therapy delivered by a &quot;live&quot; therapist.

    <description>CI therapy is a behavioral approach to physical rehabilitation that has three components: 1. intense training of the more affected arm for several hours daily for multiple consecutive days, 2. restraint of the less affected arm during training hours and afterwards during the treatment period, 3. A package of behavioral techniques designed to transfer gains from the treatment setting to daily life. In this trial, CI therapy will be administered for 3 1/2 hours per day for 10 consecutive weekdays.</description>
