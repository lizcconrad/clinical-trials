      Selecting acupoints along meridians is the predominant principle in acupuncture treatment,
      and it is also considered to ensure acupuncture efficacy. This experiment is to investigate
      whether specific brain networks gradually come in formation in accordance with this kind of
      acupoint selection methods.

      Every participants in the four intervention groups will go through functional magnetic
      imaging (fMRI) scan four times: the 1st scan will be performed at their baselines; the 2nd
      scan will be done after 2 courses (10 times) acupuncture treatment; the 3rd scan will be
      performed when the 4 courses end; the 4th scan will be operated after three-month enrollment.

      Volunteers in waiting list group will undergo the above scans at the same time points in
      exception of acupuncture treatment.
