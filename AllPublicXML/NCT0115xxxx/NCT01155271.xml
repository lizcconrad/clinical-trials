      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:

      In obese patients with OSAS, the benefit of the combination of exercise training + continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be higher than CPAP alone in term of functional
      capacity, metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular and sleep parameters and quality of life.

      In obese patients with OSAS, the benefit of training using ventilatory assistance (NIV)
      during cycloergometer [cycloergometer with NIV] or respiratory muscles training (spirotiger)
      in addition to cycloergometer [cycloergometer + spirotiger] will be higher than
      cycloergometer training alone [cycloergometer] in term of functional and exercise capacities.

      Dyspnea during walking test and respiratory muscle strength at baseline could influence the
      response to combined exercise training such as [cycloergometer + NIV] or [cycloergometer +
      spirotiger]

      Background: Obesity and sleep apnea syndrome lead to metabolic troubles and increasing
      cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, both diseases are associated with reduced exercise
      tolerance. We hypothesized that exercise training could be complementary to nocturnal
      ventilatory treatment in restoring metabolic disturbances, exercise tolerance and sleep
      parameters in obese patients with SAS.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of training on exercise tolerance (walking distance and
      dyspnea during walk)(main objective), systemic inflammation, vascular endothelial function,
      insulin resistance, quality of sleep and quality of life in obese patients treated by CPAP
      for OSAS (secondary objectives)

      Methods: We proposed to conduct a controlled, randomized clinical trial comparing the
      efficacy of 3 different modalities of training in obese patients with SAS. After a 6-week
      control pre-inclusion period, patients are included in either [cycloergometer] vs.
      [cycloergometer with ventilatory assistance] vs. [cycloergometer + respiratory muscle
      exercises]. Before and after the control period, and both immediately and 9 month after
      training, patients perform walking test, maximal incremental test on cycloergometer, blood
      sampling and cardiovascular function, body composition, muscle function, quality of sleep and
      quality of life assessments as well as spontaneous physical activity measurement. During the
      5 years following inclusion in the training program, the number of cardiovascular event is
      recorded every year.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 30 will have completed the third evaluation
      session (after the training program). The Peto's method will be used to correct the p-values.
