  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety of RAD001 in Chinese
      patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who are intolerant of or have progressed despite
      treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapies. All patients
      will be treated with RAD001 10 mg daily until tumor progression (determined according to the
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death
      or discontinuation from the study for any other reason. At least 60 patients will be enrolled
      in the study. Screening and baseline evaluations will be performed within 28 days of the date
      when the patient signs the informed consent form. Baseline evaluations will be performed
      within two weeks of the first dose of RAD001. Screening and baseline evaluations will be
      performed to determine if patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible
      patients should be enrolled in the study and will receive the first dose of RAD001 (10 mg
      daily) on Day 1, Cycle 1. Subsequently, patients will be asked to come to the clinic every
      month to complete the protocol-specified evaluations. A treatment Cycle consists of 28 days.
      After discontinuation of treatment with RAD001, patients will have a safety follow-up
      performed 28 days after the last dose of RAD001. Patients must continue with survival
      assessments which will be performed every 3 months from the last dose of RAD001 until up to 2
      years after the last patient's first visit date.

      An interim analysis focusing on safety data and a final analysis of all data are planned. All
      patients still receiving the study drug at the time of the final analysis will be given the
      option to continue treatment with RAD001 until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of Chinese origin who are ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic renal cell
             carcinoma.

          -  Patients who are intolerant of or who have progression on or after stopping treatment
             with VEGF-targeted therapies within 6 months. Note: Prior treatment with vaccine
             therapy in the adjuvant setting and prior treatment with cytokines (i.e., IL-2,
             Interferon) or chemotherapy is permitted.

          -  Patients with at least 1 measurable lesion determined according to the RECIST Criteria
             Guidelines.

          -  Patients with history of brain metastasis who are clinically judged by the
             investigator as neurologically stable following definitive radiation or surgery and do
             not require corticosteroids may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70%.
