      -  Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on
           mTOR inhibition by RAD001 has been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

        -  In phase I study of RAD001, 2 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma show some response
           to RAD001 (unpublished data).

        -  So the investigators design this phase II study of RAD001 in adenoid cystic carcinoma to
           evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this orphan disease.

      Although the histologic appearance of adenoid cystic carcinoma is low grade, management of
      this malignancy is a distinct therapeutic challenge because of its insidious local growth
      pattern, propensity for perineural involvement, tendency for distant metastasis, and
      pronounced ability to recur over a prolonged period.

      In prospectively performed clinical trials, objective responses to any cytotoxic agent or
      regimen are infrequent, whereas stabilization of disease was observed more commonly.

      In adenoid cystic carcinoma, the study focusing on PI3-K/AKT/mTOR pathway is rare.

      According to Younes MN et al's study, adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines have increased pAkt
      activity when EGF-stimulation is added. And when treated with EGFR/VEGFR TK dual inhibitor,
      the phosphorylated form of Akt decreased despite of total level of Akt is remained unchanged.

      When the investigators consider that the increased pAkt activity is one of possible predictor
      to mTOR inhibitor, the mTOR inhibitor might have an activity in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      Although mTOR is clearly an attractive therapeutic target in tumor, no clinical study on mTOR
      inhibition by RAD001 has been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      In phase I study of RAD001, 2 patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma show some response to
      RAD001 (unpublished data).

      So the investigators design this phase II study of RAD001 in adenoid cystic carcinoma to
      evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 in this orphan disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma

          -  2. Local, locally-advanced or metastatic disease documented as having shown
             progression on a scan (CT, MRI, MIBI scan) taken 2 to 12 months prior to baseline
             compared to a previous scan taken at any time in the past. Progression must be
             documented according to RECIST criteria.

          -  3. Disease that is not amenable to surgery, radiation or combined modality therapy
             with curative intent and who is previously treated with chemotherapy or local
             treatment (e,g transarterial chemoembolization)

          -  4. Presence of at least one measurable target lesion for further evaluation according
             to RECIST criteria

          -  5. 18 years or older

          -  6. ECOG performance status 0, 1

          -  7. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, loco-regional therapy (e.g chemoembolization)
             are permitted providing that toxicity has resolved to ≤grade 1 at study entry and that
             last treatment was at least 4 weeks prior to baseline assessment.

          -  8. Adequate organ function
