  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability for patients with COPD to exercise is limited due to the deterioration of their
      lung function. NVA237 is being developed to treat COPD. This study is designed to look at how
      well NVA237 improves the ability to exercise in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

    <measure>Exercise Endurance Time During a Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks (Day 21) of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>SMETT is an exercise procedure where the patient cycles at 80% of the maximum workload (Wmax )value achieved at the Incremental exercise test. During this test, the patient will cycle at a constant load. Exercise endurance time was from commencement of loaded pedaling to stopping exercise. The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Isotime Inspiratory Capacity (IC) During Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Isotime is the last matching timepoint in the submaximal exercise tolerance test (SMETT) at which for both periods the patient has a test result. The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory Capacity (IC) at Rest (1 Hour Post Dose) and at Peak (End of Exercise) During Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>IC at peak was observed using spirometry. However, two different methodologies (whole body plethysmography (Bodybox) and spirometry) were used to observe IC at rest.
The analysis of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak and Trough (24 h Post Dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards.
FVC is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration and is used in spirometry tests.
The trough effects of Day 1 treatment are derived from values prior to morning dosing on the next treatment day (Day 2 of the corresponding period).
The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) and Total Lung Capacity (TLC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Vital Capacity is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after a full inhalation. Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) test is performed by having the patient slowly and completely blow out all of the air from their lungs.
Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is the best vital capacity plus residual volume. Whole body plethysmography (Bodybox) was used to measure SVC and TLC. The trough effects of Day 1 treatment are derived from values prior to morning dosing on the next treatment day (Day 2 of the corresponding period).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific Airways Conductance (SGaw)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>SGaw is a measure of how hard it is to get air into the lungs, measured by (Sec(-1)*kP). Whole body plethysmography (Bodybox) was used to measure SGaw.
The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exertional Dyspnea (Borg CR10 Scale) During Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg CR10 Scale consists of 12-point score that the patients pointed to so as to indicate their level of dyspnea before and during exercise testing (where 0 indicates no breathlessness at all and 12 indicates maximum breathlessness).
A reduction in this score indicates an improvement. The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Discomfort (Borg CR10 Scale) During Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Borg CR10 Scale consists of 12-point score that the patients pointed to so as to indicate their level of leg discomfort before and during exercise testing (where 0 indicates no breathlessness at all and 12 indicates maximum breathlessness).
A reduction in this score indicates an improvement. The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards.
FVC is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration and is used in spirometry tests.
The trough effects of Day 1 treatment are derived from values prior to morning dosing on the next treatment day (Day 2 of the corresponding period).
The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

          <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards.
FVC is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration and is used in spirometry tests.
The trough effects of Day 1 treatment are derived from values prior to morning dosing on the next treatment day (Day 2 of the corresponding period).
The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>

          <title>Leg Discomfort (Borg CR10 Scale) During Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) After 3 Weeks Treatment</title>
          <description>The modified Borg CR10 Scale consists of 12-point score that the patients pointed to so as to indicate their level of leg discomfort before and during exercise testing (where 0 indicates no breathlessness at all and 12 indicates maximum breathlessness).
A reduction in this score indicates an improvement. The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>
          <population>Pharmacodynamics (PD) set consisted of participants who completed at least one treatment period, had an evaluable PD assessment on Day 21 of this period and had no major protocol deviation impacting the primary PD assessment.</population>

        <title>Exercise Endurance Time During a Sub-maximal Constant-load Cycle Ergometry Test (SMETT) on Treatment Day 1</title>
        <description>SMETT is an exercise procedure where the patient cycles at 80% of the maximum workload (Wmax )value achieved at the Incremental exercise test. During this test, the patient will cycle at a constant load. Exercise endurance time was from commencement of loaded pedaling to stopping exercise.
The analysis-of covariance model included the sequence, period, and treatment as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate and the patient as a random effect.</description>
