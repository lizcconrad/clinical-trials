    <textblock>
      The goal of this study with SCB01A is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of SCB01A in
      patients with advanced solid tumors that have failed previous therapy.

      This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation, safety and tolerability study. Eligible
      subjects will be assigned to a SCB01A dose level at the time of study entry and scheduled to
      receive two treatment cycles with SCB01A for the observation of DLT. A treatment cycle is
      defined as a three-hour infusion of SCB01A given every 21 days. Unless any off-study criteria
      are met, the study period of each subject can be up to two cycles.
