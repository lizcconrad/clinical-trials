      Premature infants fed with a protein hydrolyzed formula will have better tolerance needing
      shorter time to achieve full feeds when compared to those fed with an intact protein formula.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study formula is a 100% whey protein partially hydrolyzed (vs 60/40 Whey:Casein ratio of
      regular premature formulas) Because the tolerance and availability of breast milk is not
      predictable at the time of enrollment all the eligible premature infants will be randomized
      and assigned to the study or control group. Infants will receive formula, either because
      breast milk is not available or because indicated by the attending physician and switched to
      formula, They will be fed, depending of the group to what they are assigned, with either the
      PH formula for the study group or regular premature formula for the control group.

      Randomization and blinding All eligible infants with parental consent will be randomized to
      either the study group to receive protein hydrolyzed formula (PH group) or to the control
      group to receive standard premature formula. Randomization will be stratified by 2 birth
      weight categories (500-1000 g and 1001-1500 g). The purpose of such stratification is to
      avoid imbalance between groups for factors that may influence outcome and is based on the
      different morbidity in different birth weight categories.

      Masked randomization will be performed in a way that avoids the possibility of knowledge of
      treatment assignment at the time that eligibility is assessed and consent is sought. Only the
      person in charge of preparing the control or study formula will be aware of the infant's
      assignment group. Caregivers will remain masked to treatment group.

      Study population Preterm newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a birth
      weight 500-1500 g and who survive more than 3 days.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Birth weight between 500 -1500g and &lt; 32 weeks GA who survive more than 3 days.

          -  Has not yet started enteral full feeds.

          -  Study explained and parent/caregiver demonstrating understanding of the given
             information.

          -  Informed consent signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chromosomal anomalies.

          -  Major congenital anomalies (complex cardiac anomalies, congenital hydrocephalus, renal
             dysplasia).

          -  Congenital (e.g. jejunal atresia) and acquired (e.g. GI perforation) gastrointestinal
             pathology precluding oral feed and/or requiring major surgical or medical
             intervention.

          -  Parental refusal.

          -  Prior enrollment into a conflicting clinical trial. Conflicting clinical trial will be
             those in which the intervention could modify the outcome of the present study, for
             example studies aimed to accelerate feeds and or improve tolerance.
