  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite modern medical advances, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a significant
      problem in neonatal intensive care units (ICUs). Although research has shown NEC to be an
      inflammatory necrosis of the bowels, to date no study has examined the effect of
      anti-inflammatory therapy on this dreaded disease once it is diagnosed. The investigators
      propose a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded pilot study to examine
      the effect of hydrocortisone in infants diagnosed with stages II and III NEC. The
      investigators will follow C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a marker of systemic
      inflammation for the primary outcome in this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the extensive inflammatory response inherent to NEC, anti-inflammatory treatment may be
      of benefit, to both reduce inflammation and as a potential therapy to improve outcome. To
      date, there is no specific therapy for NEC that has been found to improve outcome, but
      corticosteroids have yet to be investigated in that capacity. Therefore, we propose to
      examine the effect of hydrocortisone for treatment of NEC in a randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled pilot study, focusing on a primary outcome of C-reactive protein levels at
      3 and 7 days of therapy as a measure of inflammation. In addition, we will follow several
      secondary outcome measures to determine the possibility of improved outcome in those infants
      assigned to hydrocortisone.

      The investigators hypothesize that infants diagnosed with NEC who receive hydrocortisone will
      have significantly lower C-reactive protein levels at 3 and 7 days of treatment versus
      infants who receive placebo.

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study was terminated due to low enrollment. We had a drop in our incidence of NEC, so there were very few eligible infants.
