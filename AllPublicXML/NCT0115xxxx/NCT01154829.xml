  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to relate disturbances in first-episode schizophrenic patients in
      (dopaminergic) D2 receptors, brain structure, brain function, and information processing to
      each other and to psychopathology. Additionally, the investigators want to examine the
      influence of D2 receptor blockade on these disturbances. The investigators expect
      disturbances in the dopaminergic system at baseline to correlate with specific structural and
      functional changes and with disruption in information processing as measured with
      psychophysiological and neurocognitive methods - and investigators expect D2 receptor
      blockade to reverse some of the functional and cognitive impairments.

      The study is designed as a 6 week case-control follow-up study of 70 AN FE pt. with SCZ and
      70 controls matched with regard to age, gender, and parental socio-economic status. All
      subjects will be examined with a diagnostic interview (SCAN, Schedule for Clinical Assessment
      in Neuropsychiatry), medical and family history, and physical examination before inclusion.
      At baseline all subjects will be examined with single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT), MRI, fMRI, psychophysiology, neurocognition. In addition, they will be screened for
      drugs, genetic testing, and ECG. Patients will further be examined with clinical validated
      rating scales to measure psychopathology, subjective well-being, and side-effects. After a
      period of 6 weeks all assessments are repeated. During that period patients will be treated
      with amisulpride, while healthy controls will receive no treatment at all. Efficacy of
      antipsychotic treatment will be evaluated after this initial period of 6 weeks. Based on this
      evaluation it will be decided to either continue the current (amisulpride) antipsychotic
      treatment, or to switch to aripiprazole. Efficacy of aripiprazole is evaluated on a monthly
      basis, if the patient does not respond well enough, than the treatment will be adapted
      individually. Regardless of treatment, all subjects will be re-assessed in the same test
      battery as mentioned above, except for SPECT and fMRI, after a period of 6, 12, and 24
      months. The developement in specific disturbances and the relationship between these will be
      analysed.
