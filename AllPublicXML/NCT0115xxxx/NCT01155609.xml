      This pilot clinical trial studies L-lysine in treating oral mucositis in patients undergoing
      radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. L-lysine may lessen
      the severity of oral mucositis, or mouth sores in patients receiving radiation therapy with
      or without chemotherapy for head and neck cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate, decrease in severity, and time to complete
      response of oral mucositis related to head and neck cancer irradiation and chemotherapy after
      using L-lysine supplementation daily.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the functional impact of use of L-lysine for oral mucositis on daily life as
      measured by the Functional Life Index-Cancer (FLIC) Questionnaire total score.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive L-lysine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until completion of radiotherapy and
      resolution of mucositis in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly until mucositis
      resolves.

    <description>Complete Response will be documented by complete resolution of oral mucositis, as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading scale. If the true percent of patients that respond is 20%, we will have a 90% chance of seeing at least 1 patient in 10 with a response. If none of the 10 patients show significant improvement in time to response, then we can be 90% confident that the true rate of significant improvement is less than 20%.</description>
