  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of clinician-focused health IT-based decision support,
      family-focused health IT-based decision support, and a combination of both efforts, in
      increasing HPV and other adolescent vaccine rates among adolescent girls. We hypothesize that
      a combination of clinician-focused clinical decision support and family-focused decision
      support will be most effective.

      -  Clinician-focused intervention includes an electronic health record-based decision
           support mechanism including reminders, education, audit and feedback on vaccination
           success.

        -  Family-focused intervention includes vaccine reminders and informational telephone calls
           prompted by the electronic health record.
