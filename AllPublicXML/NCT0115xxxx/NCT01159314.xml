      This research is being done to compare the safety and effectiveness of two sizes of the
      Baerveldt glaucoma implant.

      A Baerveldt glaucoma implant is one of the most common types of glaucoma operations
      performed. This procedure works by providing a route by which fluid can drain out of the eye
      to decrease the intraocular pressure. The Baerveldt implant does this by placing a tube into
      the eye which shunts aqueous fluid to a silicone plate which is attached to the sclera (white
      portion of the eye). It is this plate that comes in two different sizes (250 square
      millimeters and 350 square millimeters).

      Earlier studies have shown that larger plate sizes produce lower eye pressures but that they
      may also result in more complications. While both Baerveldt devices are currently in use and
      have been shown to be safe and effective, it is unclear if one is superior to the other. The
      purpose of this study is to see if one size of device works better with fewer complications.

    <description>Visual acuity is an important outcome variable in the BPAC. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity testing will be employed at the Qualifying Assessment and at every follow-up visit.The patient starts are the top of the chart and begins to read down the chart. The patient reads down the chart until he or she reaches a row where a minimum of three letters on a line cannot be read. The patient is scored by how many letters could be correctly identified. ETDRS visual acuity is required at the Qualifying Assessment and at the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year follow-up visits</description>
