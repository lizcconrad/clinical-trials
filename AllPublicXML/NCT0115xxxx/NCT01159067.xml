      RATIONALE: Low dose deferasirox may be safe and effective in treating patients who have
      undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant and have iron overload.

      PURPOSE: This pilot clinical trial studies safety and tolerability of deferasirox in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who have iron overload. Effect of low dose
      deferasirox on labile plasma iron is also examined.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine labile plasma iron (LPI) levels in iron overloaded patients after allogeneic
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

      II. To determine safety and tolerability of low dose deferasirox in the post allogeneic HSCT
      setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine ability of deferasirox to suppress LPI in allogeneic HSCT patients with serum
      ferritin over 1500 ng/ml.

      II. To determine prevalence of elevated LPI in allogeneic HSCT recipients with serum ferritin
      over 1500 ng/ml.

      III. To determine ability of low dose deferasirox to lower serum ferritin during the
      treatment period.

      IV. To correlate LPI with serum ferritin in allogeneic HSCT recipients with serum ferritin
      over 1500 ng/ml.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive deferasirox at 10 mg/kg once daily for 6 months in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Labile plasma iron will be measured at baseline and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 24. Side effects of deferasirox will be recorded.
