          2. Refractory disease - Progressive cGVHD manifestations despite treatment with a
             glucocorticoid dose &gt;= prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day (1 mg/kg po qod) for at least 4 weeks.

        5.1.2 Any previous treatments for cGVHD (except nilotinib). Participants may have received
        nilotinib for other reasons besides cGVHD such as leukemia or solid tumor.
