      The primary objective is to assess safety and efficacy of two different doses of NV1FGF as
      compared to placebo.

      The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics of NV1FGF and FGF-1 protein.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age&gt;40 years

          -  History of typical intermittent claudication lasting for at least 3 months, showing no
             improvement and consistent with treadmill test findings

          -  Objective evidence of Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease. After 10 minutes of rest,
             either by Ankle brachial index measure (ABI) &lt;0.8 or Systolic ankle pressure (AP) &lt; 50
             mmHg or Systolic toe pressure &lt;50 mmHg

          -  Patent femoral inflow above the level of injections recently (&lt;2 weeks) documented
             either with Doppler ultrasonography or Magnetic Resonance Angiography or Angiography

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Evidence of other causes for leg pain other than intermittent claudication.

          -  Illnesses limiting subject exercise capacity (angina pectoris, heart failure,
             respiratory disease, orthopaedic disease, neurological disorders…)

          -  Pain at rest

          -  Buerger's disease

          -  Positive serology for HIV 1 or 2, positive serology hepatitis B or C.

          -  Active proliferative retinopathy defined by the presence of new vessel formation and
             scarring.

          -  Subjects who had a stroke or neurologic deficit presumed to be due to stroke within 3
             months prior to the first administration of study treatment

          -  Previous treatment with any angiogenic growth factor

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women or who disagree to practice a medically accepted
             method of birth control. Men and women who do not agree to use condoms as the only

          -  Serious concomitant medical conditions not adequately controlled.

          -  Current alcohol or drug abuse
