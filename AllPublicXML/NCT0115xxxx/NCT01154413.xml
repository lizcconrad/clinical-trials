      To asses the effectiveness of implementing a diabetes management protocol (early
      insulinization, avoiding use of SSI) in a hearth hospital's non-intensive care unit.

    <textblock>
      Management of diabetes in patients admitted to non-intensive unit of a cardiology hospital in
      order to reduce the number of episodes of hypo-and hyperglycemia, improve glucose control and
      reducing the number of hospital days.

      Eligibility criteria:

      Patients with previous history of diabetes mellitus type 2, or are in use of oral
      antidiabetics or insulin or having fasting glucose or less 126 mg / dL or random blood
      glucose greater 200 mg / dL in both sexes, aged greater 18 years.
