    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition of the lungs which results in
      breathing difficulties due to the lungs becoming inflamed and the airways narrowed. Current
      treatments have focused on opening up the narrowed airways but, in addition, we know there is
      increased inflammation in the blood and these patients are at increased risk of heart
      disease. Statins, simvastatin being one of them, are drugs used to lower cholesterol in the
      blood but may also reduce inflammation and lower the risk of heart disease. This study will
      explore whether simvastatin reduces one of the risk factors in patients with COPD in a short
      term proof of principle study. The key purpose is to determine whether simvastatin improves
      the pressure and stiffness of the main blood vessels namely the arterial stiffness measure of
      aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). In parallel, we will describe changes in airways and / or
      blood inflammation and change in breathing ability
