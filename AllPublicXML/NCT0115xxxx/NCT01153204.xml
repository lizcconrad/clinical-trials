      Context and Objectives: Erectile dysfunction severely compromises not only sexual
      satisfaction, which is well known to be closely linked to overall life satisfaction but is
      also associated with a lower quality of life, lower self-esteem, depression, anxiety and
      adverse effects on interpersonal relationships. The objective was to assess the efficacy of
      psychotherapy and/or sildenafil for psychogenic erectile dysfunction.

      Design and Settings: randomized controlled single-blind trial performed at Institute of
      Psychiatry of the Medical School of at Universidade de S達o Paulo, S達o Paulo, Brazil Methods:
      Thirty patients with mild and moderate psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) were randomized
      to receive for six months: group psychotherapy (GP) plus 50mg sildenafil on demand, or 50mg
      sildenafil exclusively, on demand, or GP exclusively. Changes in score from baseline for
      three questions of the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) were
      evaluated at end-point and after 3-months follow-up.

      Results: satisfaction with the treatment, confidence and naturalness increased in GP plus
      sildenafil and GP exclusively groups (p=0.001) from baseline to endpoint. The
      treatment-by-time comparison was not significant at end point versus 3-month follow-ups, in
      the three groups. No difference was observed in the sildenafil group in the three study
      periods (P &gt;0.05) Conclusions: Patients with mild and moderate psychogenic ED had higher
      treatment satisfaction, confidence and naturalness in engaging in sexual activity when
      receiving GP plus sildenafil or GP exclusively, when compared with sildenafil exclusively, as
      assessed by these three EDITS questions after 6-months treatment

    <description>Time-limited group psychotherapy is a technique based on psychodrama, an in-depth method of group psychotherapy. Active methods are used to enable past, present, and future life events to be explored. Sexual issues and their possible solutions are enacted rather than simply discussed. Time-limited group psychotherapy focuses on a central or core issue or a circumscribed area of conflict (psychogenic erectile dysfunction) as the only or major object of intervention efforts.</description>

    <description>Participants took sildenafil citrate 50 mg as needed for sexual activity (on demand), no more than once daily, according to psychiatric prescription. Sildenafil citrate was taken with a glass of water on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours after eating). Participants met with a psychiatrist every month for 30-minutes to report adverse effects and to obtain the following month's dosage of four pills.</description>
