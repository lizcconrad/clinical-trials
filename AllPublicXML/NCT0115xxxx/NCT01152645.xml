    <textblock>
      A phase II open-label study with ARQ 197 administered orally and twice daily as monotherapy
      in patients with previously treated advanced/recurrent gastric cancer. The primary endpoint
      is disease control and the secondary efficacy endpoints include antitumor effect (tumor
      response), progression-free survival and overall survival. The pharmacokinetic profile and
      the safety profile are also evaluated.
