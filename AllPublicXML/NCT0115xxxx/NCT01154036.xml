  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of switching to
      co-administration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin versus treatment with atorvastatin or
      rosuvastatin in high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia who have not
      achieved specified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The primary hypothesis
      is that the co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg will be superior to
      both atorvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 10 mg with respect to the percentage reduction in
      low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 6 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 18 week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study composed of
      a 6 week screening/run-in and 12 week double-blind treatment period (composed of 2 phases;
      each 6 weeks in duration). Only those participants who do not meet low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals at the end of Phase I (Week 6), were eligible to
      continue into Phase II (Week 12).

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants in the Atorvastatin 20mg and Rosuvastatin 10mg arms who did not meet low density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals during Phase I were eligible for Phase II. Approximately 25% of participants in the ezetimibe 10mg+atorvastatin10mg arm continued to Phase II regardless of LDL-C control but were not included in any of the statistical analyses</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Hs-CRP (Phase II)</title>
          <description>hs-CRP measured at Baseline (Week 6; end of Phase 1) and after 6 weeks of study drug administration (Week 12; end of Phase II). Baseline was defined as the average of the values at Visits 5 and 6. Baseline and post-baseline measurements were log-transformed in the response vector, with fixed effects for treatment, time and the interaction of time by treatment.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS). For Phase II this population consisted of all randomized participants who completed Phase I and were not adequately controlled at the end of Phase I, received at least 1 dose of study treatment during Phase II, had a baseline measurement for Phase II and had at least 1 measurement after the start of Phase II</population>
