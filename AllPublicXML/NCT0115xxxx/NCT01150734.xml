    <textblock>
      Muscle evoked potentials (MEP) are supposed to different in schizophrenic and depressed
      patients, compared to a sample of healthy volunteers. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS)-evoked MEP are measured in all three groups at baseline and after tDCS (2 mA, 20
      minutes). MEP amplitudes are supposed to normalize quickly in healthy volunteers, to stay
      diminished in depressed patients and to stay elevated in schizophrenic patients. These
      differences should disappear after regular pharmacological treatment. Outcome measures will
      be done in week 2 and week 4.

             systemic neurological illnesses, normal pressure hydrocephalus, cerebrovascular
             diseases, elevated intracranial pressure, in the last 6 months, polyneuropathies).

          -  Severe other medical conditions, like manifest arterial hypertonia, severe heart
             disease, pacemakers, respiratory failure, malignant illnesses all type, also in the
             history, active infectious diseases, skeletal disorders (like M. Paget, osteoporosis
             with spontaneous fractures, fresh fractures) Other circumstances, that speaks against
             a participation of the patient pinion of Medical Doctor at this study.
