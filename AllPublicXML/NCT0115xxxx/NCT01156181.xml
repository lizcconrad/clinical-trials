  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy rate may be affected by multiple factors such as embryo transfer techniques. Even
      small differences in embryo transfer methods may affect pregnancy rates. There is an
      inconsistency about the effect of the removal of cervical discharge on embryo transfer
      outcomes. Some studies showed that cervical mucus removal before embryo transfer can increase
      pregnancy rate, however the others could not find any significant effect about the removal of
      cervical mucus on pregnancy or live birth rates. Given to the conflicting evidences, our
      study aimed to determine whether the cervical discharge removal has positive effect on
      pregnancy rate.

      492 Infertile women who were candidate for fresh embryo transfer during IVF/ICSI cycles were
      eligible for this study if they had two or more good quality embryos. All categories of
      female or male factors infertility except uterine factor infertility were eligible for
      participation in the study. Immediately prior to embryo transfer, women were randomly
      allocated to either treatment (cleaning the cervical canal) or control groups. In treatment
      group, excess mucus and debris were cleared from the cervical canal using a sterile cotton
      swabs. The cervical discharge was scored as mucosal, bloody, combination of mucosal and
      bloody, or infected. Control group had no cervical cleaning before embryo transfer. Then, the
      embryos were loaded into the transfer catheter by the embryologist and were deposited into
      the uterine cavity by one experience physician. The primary endpoint was clinical pregnancy.
      Fertilization, Implantation, abortion, and live birth rates were the other outcomes of
      interest or secondary outcomes.
