  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) has been proposed as an effective method of reducing
      progression of both keratoconus and corneal ectasia after surgery, as well as possibly
      decreasing the steepness of the cornea in these pathologies. During the CXL procedure, the
      central corneal thickness has been shown to significantly change. The investigator's believe
      that better maintenance of corneal thickness potentially could have benefits of better
      reproducibility of the crosslinking effect with improved predictability of results.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the difference between the two riboflavin
      preparations during UV (ultraviolet) administration. Both riboflavin preparations currently
      are in general use worldwide and in U.S. clinical trials of corneal collagen crosslinking.
      The first preparation contains riboflavin in a dextran solution, which may tend to dehydrate
      the cornea and keep it thinner. The second preparation contains riboflavin in a solution
      without dextran; in this case, the relative hypotonicity may tend to keep the cornea better
      hydrated and thicker. The primary goal of the study is to see if the use of hypotonic
      riboflavin (rather than riboflavin with dextran) better maintains consistent corneal
      thickness during the CXL procedure. The second goal of the study is to determine if better
      maintenance of corneal thickness potentially could have benefits of better consistency of the
      procedure, decrease in corneal haze formation, and improved safety of the endothelial cells.
      Safety and efficacy outcomes will then be compared between the groups. In particular, we will
      compare the corneal thickness measured by ultrasonic pachymetry immediately after the CXL
      procedure in the randomized eyes. Secondary outcomes will include visual acuity, longer term
      corneal thickness changes, and corneal steepness changes. Safety assessments will include a
      tabulation of adverse events, patient symptoms, loss of visual acuity, changes in endothelial
      cell density, slit lamp examination of the cornea and lens, and contact lens tolerance for
      contact lens wearers

    <description>The change in maximum keratometry (Kmax) from baseline will be evaluated at 12 months for all eyes randomized to (Group 1 - administration of Riboflavin/dextran for the duration of UV exposure.) and (Group 2 - Administration of hypotonic riboflavin for the duration of UV exposure) groups. As a secondary analysis of this endpoint, the change in maximum keratometry (Kmax) from baseline will be evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 month for all eyes</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in manifest refraction spherical equivalent from baseline will be evaluated at 12 months. As a secondary analysis of this endpoint, a repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess the profile of the treatments across time at 1 month for the treatment groups as well as at 3, and 6 months to look at the effect of CXL timing on this variable.</description>

    <description>Change in BSCVA (best spectacle corrected visual acuity) and UCVA (uncorrected visual acuity) compared to the baseline examination will be evaluated at 12 months postoperatively. As a secondary analysis of this endpoint will be conducted to assess the profile of the treatments across time at 1 month and again at 3, and 6 months following the CXL procedure.</description>
