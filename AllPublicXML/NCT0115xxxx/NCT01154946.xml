      The aims of this study are

        -  to confirm whether detrusor after-contraction (DAC) is a true contraction or not with a
           new approach

        -  and to understand clinical implication of DAC
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The definition of detrusor after-contraction (DAC) is usually accepted as the increase of
      detrusor pressure (Pdet), whether it is sudden or not, after cessation of urinary flow. The
      amount of increase in Pdet is sometimes included in the definition of DAC (14, 15, 20 cmH2O
      or at least two times the level of the maximal Pdet during the voiding phase). However, it is
      clear that the lack of a well-established definition may induce much bias in the
      interpretation of the clinical implication of DAC. The previous studies showed a wide range
      of prevalence.1-4 DAC seemed to occur more frequently in children and the occurrence rate
      usually decreased with age in urodynamic studies.

    <time_frame>up to 2 years (2007.Jan-2008.Dec)</time_frame>
    <description>no change of Pdet when patients cough could confirm that DAC was a true contraction. Because an artifact occurred when a catheter was pressed against bladder wall or urethra, no change of intravesical pressure and increase of abdominal pressure finally induced a negative deflection of Pdet and this change of Pdet could be regarded as an artifact.</description>
