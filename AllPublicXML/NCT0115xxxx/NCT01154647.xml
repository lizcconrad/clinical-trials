  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both patients with peripheral structural pathologies, like rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA)-patients, or patients with central sensitivity syndromes (CSS) suffer chronic pain. CSS
      are characterized by an increased responsiveness of central pain neurons. An impaired
      endogenous pain inhibition is already demonstrated in CSS. In the present study the
      investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of pain inhibition in response to physical
      stressors and whether the efficacy is opioid-mediated in two chronic pain populations (RA &amp;
      CCS) compared to controls.

      Therefore a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with cross-over design will be
      performed. The efficacy of wind-up of pain and spatial summation of pain is evaluated before
      and after a submaximal exercise, while the experimental group receives a selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor. Participants are 20 RA-patients and 20 CSS-patients, more specific
      patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, and 30 healthy controls. This way,
      the investigators analyze how pain inhibition reacts on different types of physical stressors
      in different pain patients and if pain inhibition is opioid-mediated.

    <description>Temporal summation is elicited with 10 pulses of the algometer at pressure pain detection threshold intensity on the dorsal surface of the right hand middle finger midway between the first and the second digital joints, and at the trapezius. Subjects are instructed to rate the pain level of the 1st, 5th and 10th pulse according to a visual analogue scale (VAS).
To assess spatial summation an occlusion cuff inflated to a painful intensity and maintained at that level while repeated algometer pulses are administered and pain ratings are recorded again.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each study participant should be aged between 18 and 65 years. All three groups will
             be comparable for age, gender, education level and socioeconomic status; both patient
             groups will be comparable for illness duration.

          -  The Central Sensitivity Syndrome (CSS) group will comply with the diagnostic criteria
             for Fibromyalgia (FM) as defined by the American College of Rheumatology and the
             Centre of Disease Control criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

          -  At the time of study participation, healthy control subjects cannot suffer any pain
             complaints. Sedentary is defined as a sedentary job and &lt; 3 h moderate physical
             activity/week. Moderate physical activity is defined as activity demanding at least
             the threefold of the energy spent passively.

          -  Patients have to be able to cycle on a bicycle ergometer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to preclude confounding factors, participants cannot be pregnant (pregnancy
             test) or until 1 year postnatal and will be asked to stop medication two weeks prior
             to study participation, not to undertake physical exertion, and to refrain from
             consuming caffeine, alcohol or nicotine on the day of the experiment. For ethical
             reasons, Rheumatoid arthritis(RA)-patients are able to take non-opioid pain medication
             as described in the 1st step of the World Health Organization analgesic ladder
             (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and paracetamol).
