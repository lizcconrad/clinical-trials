  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study compares the outcomes of a physical activity intervention begun at
      diagnosis, continuing through active cancer treatment and into six months of survivorship
      compared to the outcomes of a control group receiving limited information on activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (with stage 0 to stage III breast cancer)receiving chemotherapy, radiation or both
      chemotherapy and radiation will be included in the study.Randomization will be stratified by
      disease stage at diagnosis, treatment modalities planned, and hormonal status. Each patient
      will have a weekly goal of 2000 calories burned and 18 MET-hours of exercise which can be
      achieved in 4 to 7 hours of physical activity per week. Resistance training, using weight
      machines and aerobic training using treadmills, elliptical trainers and stationary bicycles,
      will be utilized in the intervention group. The control group will receive basic information
      on physical activity but not be instructed. Any physical activity in this group will be
      self-reported. Change in C-reactive protein will be the primary endpoint. Changes in other
      laboratory values, DEXA measurements, and quality of life measurements will be secondary
      endpoints.
