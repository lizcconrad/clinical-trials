    <textblock>
      The clinical performance of Icare ONE Tonometer TA02 was compared to a Goldmann type
      applanation tonometer (Haag-Streit). Data was collected according to ANSI Z80.10-2003 (ISO
      8612.2) standard. Subjects were eligible for the study if they had no exclusion criteria
      specified in the ANSI/ISO standard. One eye from 260 subjects was selected for the study. The
      minimum sample size according to the standard is 150. One eye of each subject was selected
      for the study by an investigator, based on the history of the patient, results of an external
      examination of the eye with slit lamp, keratometry readings, and prior knowledge of the
      intraocular pressure (IOP) range. The Icare ONE Tonometer TA02 in comparison to the reference
      tonometer (Goldmann type tonometer).

        Subjects were eligible for the study if they had no exclusion criteria specified in the
        ANSI/ISO standard. One eye from 260 subjects was selected for the study. The minimum sample
        size according to the ANSI standard is 150. In order to aid enrollment of at least 40 eyes
        in each pressure range (7-16 mmHg, &gt;16 to &lt;23 mmHg and 23 mmHg or higher), subjects were
        invited to participate on the basis of prior knowledge of their IOP range. One eye of each
        subject was selected for the study by an investigator, based on the history of the patient,
        results of an external examination of the eye with slit lamp, keratometry readings, and
        prior knowledge of the IOP range.
