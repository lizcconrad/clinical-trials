  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical observations showed that Botulinum A toxin (BoNT/A) has also an
      antinociceptive effect and can control the neuropathic pain.

      In the urologic field, recent in in vitro and in in vivo studies demonstrated that the
      neurotoxin is able to inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters from the bladder
      afferent fibers and urothelium. These neurotrasmitters as SP, CGRP, ATP, NGF and
      Prostaglandins are involved in neurogenic inflammation. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize
      that patients with affected by painful bladder syndrome (PBS) could benefit from BoNT/A
      intravesically administered.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical and urodynamic effects of an intravesical
      treatment with BoNT/A in patients affected by PBS associated with increased urinary
      frequency, who are refractory to conventional treatments. This treatment will be compared to
      bladder over distention, which is considered a conventional therapy.

      Patients with refractory PBS will be prospectively enrolled in the study. Baseline
      evaluation: Clinical evaluation with visual analog scale (VAS) for pain quantification; QoL
      assessment with a standardized questionnaire, HAM-A and HAM-D scales for the evaluation of
      anxiety and depression; voiding diary with the recording of diurnal and nocturnal urinary
      frequency; urodynamic evaluation, 1 month before commencing the study.

      Treatment: According to a computerized randomization, patients will receive: A) one single
      injection of BoNT/A, 100 U diluted in 10 ml normal saline into the bladder, under cystoscopic
      guidance, under local anesthesia ; or B) one single bladder overdistension under local
      anesthesia. C) one single injection of placebo (NACL 0.9 % 10 ml) under local anesthesia.

      Follow up: clinical evaluation (VAS, HAM-A and HAM-D, QOL assessment, voiding diary) and
      urodynamics three months after treatment.
