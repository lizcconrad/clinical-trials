  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selenium, in the form of inorganic Sodium Selenite, may be useful for treating existing
      prostate cancer. This idea is based on data from our laboratory showing that 1) prostate
      cancer cells are more sensitive to Selenium (Sodium Selenite)-induced apoptosis than normal
      prostate epithelial cells, 2) Selenite induces significant growth inhibition of well
      established prostate cancer tumors in mice at doses that have no detectable toxicity, and 3)
      Selenite disrupts AR signaling, and that the inhibition of AR expression and activity by
      Selenite occurs via a redox mechanism involving GSH, superoxide, and Sp1. Altogether, these
      findings suggest that Selenium may be useful in a variety of potential indications in the
      natural history of prostate cancer, including both hormone sensitive and castrate resistant
      prostate cancer, as a single agent, or in combination with radiation, chemotherapy or
      conventional hormone therapy. Selenite is a potential novel inhibitor of AR expression and
      function in prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          2. Castration-resistant prostate cancer requires the following 3 criteria:

               -  A rising PSA on 3 consecutive occasions at least 1 week apart (but not limited to
                  the 30 day screening period), AND

               -  A castrate level of testosterone (&lt;50ng/dL)

          3. PSA doubling time (PSADT) &gt; 1 months

          4. Failure on docetaxel chemotherapy as defined by a rising PSA .

          5. A minimum PSA of 2 ng/mL

          6. Age &gt;=18 years

          7. Life expectancy greater than 6 months

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 or Karnofsky
