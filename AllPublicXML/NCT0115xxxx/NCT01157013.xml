    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) evaluates cancer
      cell glycolysis(Warburg effect) as a surrogate for tumor response.The hypothesis of this
      study is that early changes in FDG-PET signal can predict sorafenib response in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health issue worldwide, particularly in Asia and
      Africa, and a disease that has increased in incidence in the Western world over the past 20
      years primarily as a result of the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection, which
      predisposes patients to HCC.

      Sorafenib (a new oral potent multikinase inhibitor directed against both tumour proliferation
      and angiogenesis) can be considered standard of care for patients with advanced and
      metastatic HCC who are not candidates for curative or locoregional therapies. Clinical
      benefit has been shown in 75% of patients with advanced HCC.

      PET is a noninvasive imaging technique which might be an effective tool for evaluating
      sorafenib treatment in HCC. The aim of this study is to evaluate this new treatment with PET
      with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), since the use of only computed tomography (CT) measurements
      can be questioned. Our hypothesis is that early effects of sorafenib treatment in advanced
      HCC can be detected and quantified by PET-CT after one month of treatment. We try to reveal a
      decrease in tumour glucose uptake at one month and correlate it with other radiologic
      findings (measured by CT and diffusion-weighted nuclear resonance imaging) and the more
      clinically relevant endpoints clinical benefit and overall survival.
