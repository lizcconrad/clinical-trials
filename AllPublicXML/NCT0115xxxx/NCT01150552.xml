      The main focus of the study is:

        -  To estimate seroprevalence of AI in poultry-exposed and non-exposed human populations.

        -  To estimate the incidence of AI in poultry-exposed and non-exposed human populations.

        -  To investigate risk factors associated with AI infections in occupationally-exposed
           poultry workers.

      The secondary objectives of the study:

        -  To investigate patterns in transmission of AI to household contacts of AI clinical cases

        -  To isolate AI viruses from acute cases

        -  To monitor the pathogenicity and disease severity of AI viruses causing human infections

      This 4-year prospective cohort study to compare individuals with occupational exposure to
      poultry with non-poultry exposed adult controls for evidence of incident and previous
      infections with AI viruses. At the start of this study, study staff will obtain informed
      consent, and a blood sample will be obtained from study volunteers to establish baseline
      levels of antibodies against avian influenza types H4-H12. Subjects will be interviewed
      regarding their exposures, medical history, and behaviors using a close-ended questionnaire
      specifically tailored for this study. After one year, study subjects will be interviewed
      again to note any changes in exposure variables. At this time, another blood sample will be
      obtained and tested for any changes in antibodies' levels. The same procedures will be
      repeated at the final visit after another year. Exposed individuals will be selected from
      rural areas where poultry is commonly raised. Non-exposed controls will be selected from
      urban neighborhoods in Cairo.

      Sera will be tested for human antibodies against AI viruses (types H4-H12) using a
      microneutralization assay. Study sera will be examined for antibodies against human influenza
      types H1 and H3 using a hemagglutination inhibition procedure.

        Exposed subjects will be enrolled at the rural areas of Egypt where poultry production is
        located. Controls will be enrolled in urban Cairo. Households will be selected from
        neighborhoods without live bird markets close to the location of the NRC. All members of a
        household will be enrolled. Cohort of exposed subjects will be assembled from villages from
        3 governorates in this area as well as 2 governorates south of Cairo where human cases of
        AI were reported. Hence, 5 villages will make up 5 field sites. From each village, the team
        will enroll 150 individuals with exposure to poultry. The control group, i.e., individuals
        not occupationally exposed to poultry, will be enrolled from urban Cairo, the capital of
        Egypt.
