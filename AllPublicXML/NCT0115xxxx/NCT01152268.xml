  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known adverse effects of specific cancer treatments on fertility, only 18-26% of
      at-risk adolescents and young men cryopreserve sperm prior to cancer treatment in the US:
      These already less than optimal rates of sperm banking are even lower among adolescents who
      have increased anxiety at cancer diagnosis, are lower in age and socioeconomic status, of
      Evangelical religious orientation, or are diagnosed with leukemia/lymphoma: It is not clear
      why sperm banking is underutilized, particularly in light of the high priority that survivors
      of childhood cancer place on fertility and the high psychological distress associated with
      fertility loss. Studies addressing sperm banking among adults with cancer suggest that
      factors such as poor physician communication and the resulting lack of fertility-risk
      knowledge by patients contributes to the low frequency of sperm cryopreservation. No
      well-designed studies have examined risk factors associated with failure to bank sperm among
      adolescents with cancer, a developmentally distinct population ripe for intervention.

      This study plans to enroll 206 adolescent males and 412 parents/guardians.

      This study will identify factors predictive of sperm banking/not sperm banking in order to
      design interventions for increasing fertility preservation among adolescent males newly
      diagnosed with cancer. Specifically, this study aims to investigate psychological,
      demographic, developmental, parent/guardian, provider, and medical factors predictive of
      sperm banking outcomes among at-risk adolescents with cancer. Once these factors have been
      identified, the study will develop a novel Profiling and Referral Tool. This instrument will
      ultimately serve as an intervention for both healthcare providers and families through the
      facilitation of appropriate referrals, and tailored interventions for decreasing barriers to
      sperm banking. Finally, the feasibility of the Profiling and Referral tool will be evaluated
      based on provider and family report.

    <description>Self-report questionnaire data will be collected one time, between Days 1-7 post initiation of cancer therapy(e.g. Days 2-8 of being &quot;on-treatment&quot; for cancer) among eligible participants and their families who enroll on the study. Patients who agree to participate will be asked to complete a battery of paper and pencil questionnaires (which will also be available on-line if preferred) that assess risk/protective factors for sperm banking. When the banking recommendation is &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;further assessment required,&quot; the profiling and referral tool will be given to the family and instructions for completion will be provided. The tool will include a list of key items which will be based on the most influential barriers to banking sperm.</description>

        Male Adolescents meeting eligibility criteria will be identified by updated clinic lists
        that are available across all institutions included in this study. After the review of
        clinic lists, medical record review, and report from oncologist regarding patient risk for
        treatment-related infertility, patients meeting study criteria will be recruited
        consecutively within the time constraints of the available staff. That is, for every
        opportunity where there is staff available for recruitment, the study team will attempt to
        enroll the first available patient meeting eligibility criteria.
