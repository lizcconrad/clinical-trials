  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab has recently been authorized for active psoriasis in Peru and local experience is
      very low. The aim of this study is to obtain Peruvian data of clinical effectiveness and
      impact on health-related quality of life with the use of adalimumab in participants with
      chronic plaque psoriasis complying with the dosing and monitoring recommendations of the
      local approved label.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reaching a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI-75) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). PASI-75 responders are the participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The mean PASI improvement was calculated using a linear regression model.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reaching a Minimal Important Difference (MID) in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. MID for the DLQI was defined as a score decrease from baseline of 2.3 to 5. The mean DLQI improvement was calculated using a linear regression model.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Index Score at Baseline and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a self-reported health outcome which measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain discomfort, anxiety, and depression. An overall score is derived that measures from -0.59 (worst) to +1 (best). Improvement was defined as a mean score increase of at least 0.2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of informed consent until 70 days (5 half-lives) after the last dose of study drug (treatment was 16 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was considered an SAE if it met any of the following criteria: death of the participant; life-threatening event; hospitalization; prolongation of hospitalization; congenital anomaly; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome; spontaneous or elective abortion. SAEs included the occurrence of tuberculosis, opportunistic infection, and malignancy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Adalimumab Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was measured by how many times a participant had a discontinuation (i.e., missed a study dose) during the 16 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). The mean PASI improvement was calculated using a linear regression model.</description>

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. MID for the DLQI was defined as a score decrease from baseline of 2.3 to 5. The mean DLQI improvement was calculated using a linear regression model.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Reaching a Minimal Important Difference (MID) in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</title>
          <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. MID for the DLQI was defined as a score decrease from baseline of 2.3 to 5. The mean DLQI improvement was calculated using a linear regression model.</description>
