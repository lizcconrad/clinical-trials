      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying the role of biomarkers in endometrial cancer
      recurrence in samples from patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the association of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EA) recurrence with
           pre-operative serum levels of insulin, total and free insulin-like growth factor-I
           (IGF-I), IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and IGFB-3,
           estradiol, estrone, progesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in samples
           from patients with stage II-IV endometrial cancer evaluated on GOG-0210.

        -  To study the associations of EA recurrence with pre-treatment tumor expression of IGF-I,
           IGF-II, and IGFBP-1 and -3 mRNA in samples from these patients.

        -  To study the associations of EA recurrence with pre-treatment tumor expression of
           insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor in
           samples from these patients.

        -  To measure the correlations of serum (protein) and tissue (mRNA) levels of IGF-I,
           IGF-II, and IGFBP-1 and -3 from samples of patients with EA and participants without
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: Banked serum and tumor tissues samples are analyzed for levels of insulin, total and
      free insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3, estradiol, estrone,
      progesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1
      and IGFBP -3 mRNA; and expression of the insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor,
      and progesterone receptor by RT-PCR, IHC, and ELISA. Banked non-cancerous endometrial tissue
      and fasting serum samples from controls are also analyzed for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and
      IGFBP-3 and compared with the results of endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) samples.

      Clinical information associated with each EA samples (i.e., age, BMI, performance status,
      race, ethnicity, tumor stage, size, histology and grade, surgical compliance and type of post
      surgical adjuvant therapy, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, site of first
      recurrence, and biomarker values and expression) is also collected.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 815 patient specimens and 50 control specimens will be accrued
      for this study.
