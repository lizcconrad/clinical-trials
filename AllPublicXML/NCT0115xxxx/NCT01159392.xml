  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in
      patients with severe brain injury has been associated with poor outcome. The application of
      lung recruitment maneuvers (RM) for a short period of time to open collapsed alveoli and
      reverse hypoxemia in early ARDS has been recommended. However, little is known about the
      cerebral and vascular effects of RM in brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS. The aim of this
      study is to assess the effects of a single standardized RM on oxygenation and on systemic and
      cerebral hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe brain injury comprise a significant portion of admissions to critical
      care units. These patients are unable to adequately protect their airways and are usually
      intubated and mechanically ventilated. The goal of mechanical ventilation in patients with
      brain injury is to optimize blood gas exchange while minimizing intrathoracic pressure to
      avoid interference with cerebral venous drainage.Over the last 20 years, a plethora of
      experimental and clinical data have shown that mechanical ventilation can cause or aggravate
      lung damage in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS). The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effects of a single
      standardized recruitment maneuver (RM) on oxygenation and on systemic and cerebral
      hemodynamics in severe brain injury patients with ALI/ARDS.

      Only patients with brain injury, as defined by a Glasgow Coma Score &lt;13, admitted into the
      Trauma and Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) will be studied.

      After obtaining informed consent, a RM will be performed by switching the ventilator from
      assist/control ventilation to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and applying a
      pressure of 40 cmH2O for 40 sec (11). After the RM, patients have been ventilated in pressure
      control ventilation and PEEP will be gradually reduced in decremental steps every 3
      respiratory cycles starting with PEEP at 30 cm H2O, maintaining a maximum peak pressure of 40
      cmH2O during this procedure until pre-RM PEEP levels are achieved. The RM will be
      discontinued if any of the following changes developed during the procedure: (i) ≥20% changes
      in baseline systemic blood pressure, (ii) ICP ≥20 mmHg, or (iii) SaO2 ≤90%. After the RM is
      performed, respiratory mechanics, arterial and SjO2 blood samples and systemic and cerebral
      hemodynamics will be obtained at 30 min and 8 hours.
