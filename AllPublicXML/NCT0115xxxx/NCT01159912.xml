      A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled (with rescue medication),
      multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone Furoate inhalation
      powder in the treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone Furoate Inhalation Powder 100mcg once daily
      and Fluticasone Propionate Inhalation Powder 250mcg twice daily with Placebo. Subjects will
      participate in the study for up to a maximum of 29 weeks (including screening, treatment and
      follow-up contact). The primary endpoint consists of change from baseline in clinic visit
      trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the 24 week treatment period. The
      nominated powered secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the percentage of
      rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment period. Safety assessments include
      adverse events, oropharyngeal examinations, clinical chemistry and urine cortisol excretion.
      For subjects who have consented for pharmacogenetics, a blood sample will also be taken for
      pharmacogenetic analysis.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Evening (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at the End of the 24 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 measurement taken at the clinic visit at the end of the dosing interval. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 24 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods at the End of the 24-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue bronchodilator, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary). Similarly, asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered to be rescue free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 24-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Trough Evening (PM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the First 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks of the 24-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each morning and evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Trough evening PEF is the PM PEF measured approximately 24 hours after the last evening administration of study drug. Change from Baseline (defined as the last 7 days prior to randomization of the participants) was calculated as the value of the averaged daily trough PM PEF over 12 weeks and 24 weeks of the 24-week Treatment Period (at Weeks 12 and 24) minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each morning and evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Change from Baseline (defined as the last 7 days prior to randomization of the participants) was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over 12 weeks and 24 weeks of the 24-week Treatment Period (at Weeks 12 and 24) minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

A 24-hour period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 24-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (+12) Score at Week 12 and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire used to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ for 12 years and older (AQLQ [+12]) is a modified version of the AQLQ for use in asthma patients between the ages of 12 and 70. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). For the 32 items on the questionnaire, the response format consists of a seven-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates &quot;total impairment&quot; and a value of 7 indicates &quot;no impairment.&quot; The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Baseline was the total score obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Weeks 12 and 24 minus the total score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Evening (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at the End of the 24 Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 measurement taken at the clinic visit at the end of the dosing interval. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 24 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Evening (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at the End of the 24 Week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 measurement taken at the clinic visit at the end of the dosing interval. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 24 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods at the End of the 24-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The number of inhalations of rescue bronchodilator, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary). Similarly, asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour period in which a participant’s responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered to be rescue free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 24-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour (hr) Periods at the End of the 24-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The number of inhalations of rescue bronchodilator, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary). Similarly, asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the peak expiratory flow measurement. A 24-hour period in which a participant’s responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily eDiary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 24-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (+12) Score at Week 12 and Week 24</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire used to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ for 12 years and older (AQLQ [+12]) is a modified version of the AQLQ for use in asthma patients between the ages of 12 and 70. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). For the 32 items on the questionnaire, the response format consists of a seven-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates “total impairment” and a value of 7 indicates “no impairment.” The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Baseline was the total score obtained at Visit 3. Change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Weeks 12 and 24 minus the total score at Baseline.</description>
