  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retapamulin, a topical pleuromutilin antibiotic, is the first in a new class of topical
      antibiotics approved for human use. In the United States (US), retapamulin is approved for
      the treatment of impetigo in persons nine or more months of age and was launched on 12 April
      2007. This five-year study is designed to examine use of retapamulin in the pediatric
      population less than nine months of age. We will conduct an annual assessment of prescription
      sales claims for retapamulin using the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS)
      National Managed Care Benchmarked Database. For each year of reporting, the observed
      frequencies of the exposure, with or without same-day, co-prescribed sales claim of
      mupirocin, will be identified. The study objectives are to determine the frequency of
      retapamulin sales in a representative US population stratified by the designated age group
      and to determine the frequency of same-day sale of the topical agent, mupirocin.

      The IHCIS is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant with
      encrypted member and provider identifiers; date of birth is restricted to year of birth.
      Based on year of birth and the prescription sales claim date, age at the time of the
      prescription(s) will be categorized as less than 9 months (definitive) and less than 9 months
      (uncertain).
