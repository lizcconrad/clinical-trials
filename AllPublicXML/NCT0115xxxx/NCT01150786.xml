    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of selenium supplementation as an
      antioxidant on serum adiponectin, HSCRP , ferritin , transferrin, albumin and homocysteine
      level.

      After screening all of 280 patients under regular HD in Faghihi Hospital Hemodialysis Center,
      80 stable patients in the age range of 18-80 years old were found to be eligible for
      enrollment and give their informed consent to participate in this trial.The Ethics Committee
      of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences reviewed and approved the protocol of this
      study.These patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups of selenium(200µg) or
      placebo and followed for 12 weeks.Before the onset of the treatment and after the end of the
      treatment phase of the study, 10cc blood samples were taken from each patient. The blood was
      taken from the patient's arm used for hemodialysis cannulae just before the beginning of the
      HD session. The serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 g/min for 5 min and stored at
      -70°C. Serum levels of adiponectin,high sensitive C-reactive protein (HSCRP), ferritin,
      transferrin, homocysteine, calcium, phosphate, albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and
      creatinine as well as hemoglobin (Hb) levels (g/dL) were measured in all patients at the
      baseline and at the end of treatment phase of study.
