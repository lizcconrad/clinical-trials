  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) scan, performed with contrast enhancement, is one of the most
      commonly requested examinations in diagnostic imaging. In a patient with an elevated
      creatinine or an allergy to contrast agents, the scan may be performed without the benefit of
      contrast enhancement. Ultrasound (US), performed with contrast agent enhancement does not
      have any nephrotoxicity and may be performed on patients with CT contrast allergy. The
      investigators propose that US with Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is superior to
      unenhanced CT scan in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) is one of the most common investigations performed
      in any radiology department, used widely in evaluating pathology in any part of the body.

      Historically, it is well known that the use of contrast agents for CT scans may result in
      nephropathy, or renal failure. Nephrotoxicity associated with the injection of CT contrast
      agents may occasionally occur in healthy individuals and more commonly in those with
      borderline renal function. If abnormal kidney function is known to exist in a patient sent
      for CT scan, the examination is performed without the valuable assistance of contrast
      enhancement. Further, if prior hypersensitivity to the contrast agent for CT scan is known,
      again, the scan will be performed without the use of contrast agent.

      Ultrasound (US) performed conventionally in grayscale and with Doppler is able to evaluate
      most abdominal and pelvic organs and also provides vascular information related to large
      vessel blood flow. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides more precise information on
      blood flow than is available with Doppler and has been shown to be comparable to CT scan in
      some circumstances. We believe that a comparison of conventional US, with CEUS, and
      unenhanced CT scan would clearly favor ultrasound for detection of soft tissue pathology on
      the basis of its inherent tissue contrast differentiation.

    <measure>Demonstration of superiority of US with CEUS over nonenhanced CT scan (NECT) for observations and interpretation of findings</measure>
    <time_frame>January 31, 2011</time_frame>
    <description>Superiority of US over nonenhanced CT scan will be shown in a blind read by independent interpretation of each study by two experienced radiologists. All positive observations and interpretations will be documented. A comparison will be performed against a truth panel based on a compilation of the patient's entire clinical record and outcome.
We hypothesize CT will result in multiple indeterminate examinations, and that all solid organ pathology will be more optimally characterized on US with contrast enhancement than on CT. Multiple other observations will be equal between the two studies.</description>
