  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of soft occlusal splint therapy on
      the electromyographic activity of masticatory muscles (ateriors temporalis and masseter)
      before and after the application of a muscle relaxation splint. Electromyography recordings
      from the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles were analyzed quantitatively during maximal
      clench, rest and mastication usual, before and after the treatment without a splint. Ten
      patients whose chief complaint was Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) were selected for the
      study. After the initial evaluations soft occlusal splints (muscle relaxation splints) were
      applied, and the patients were instructed to use the splints for four weeks. Surface
      electromyographic recordings were taken from each patient, as clinical evaluations of TMD
      (Index of Helkimo), both evaluations before the beginning of clinical therapy and after four
      weeks of wearing splints. The data obtained were analyzed by Wilcoxon´s and Friedman´s tests.

    <description>A resilient occlusal splints (silicone 2mm) was fabricated on the maxillary arch, using a vacuum pressing machine. The occlusal splints were adjusted to eliminate the gross interferences and to obtain occlusal stability with maximum posterior bilateral contacts.
Patients were instructed to use the occlusal splints for 24 hours during 30 days. The use was interrupted only during meals.</description>
