  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease that affects nearly 13% of adults in the U.S., causing
      substantial impairment that is reflected in the tens of millions of missed days of work, and
      doctors' and emergency room visits it leads to annually. Those who have asthma are twice as
      likely to develop depression and anxiety, which are associated with more frequent and severe
      asthma symptoms, especially in those under chronic stress. The project proposed here seeks to
      understand the role of the brain in these associations and to evaluate the neural mechanisms
      through which a safe, low-cost intervention, that influences the function of body via the
      mind, may diminish the expression of asthma symptoms.
