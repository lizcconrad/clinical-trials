      population and are being considered the most common cause of death. Cardiac CT is a reliable

      Coronary artery disease are 8 times more prevalent in patients with NAFLD that the general
      population and are being considered the most common cause of death. Cardiac CT is a reliable
      non invasive method in demonstrating Coronary Plaques. However the association between
      coronary artery calcium score (CAC) and NAFLD remains controversial. AIM: the aim is to
      evaluate the association between CAC score ( CT) and NAFLD (CT). the working hypothesis is
      that Beside the traditional risk factors including age, diabetes, NAFLD is also associated
      with moderate to high risk of CAD.
