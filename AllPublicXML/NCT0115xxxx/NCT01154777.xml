  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback, a neuro-cognitive training method based on operant conditioning, will be
      employed with 90 children with the Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) over a 60 session
      training period to improve the limiting behavioral and sensory symptoms Autism presents (with
      each collaborative site working with 45 of the 90 participants). This study seeks to
      demonstrate that Neurofeedback training, a non-invasive approach based on Learning Theory,
      will mitigate presenting symptoms of Autism, and ultimately render the person with Autism
      significantly more able to interact with his/her environment successfully, independently
      function on a day-to-day basis, and improve overall mental health.

      The specific objective is to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements in
      functional and behavioral parameters in individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders
      when 60 Neurofeedback training sessions are applied. The long term objectives for these
      individuals include improvement of quality of daily functioning, better ability to integrate
      and navigate within society, and overall to decrease the limitations caused by the
      disability. Additionally, increasing awareness by the public, as well as healthcare providers
      and legislation, that Neurofeedback is a viable intervention which may contribute not only to
      a significant reduction of the level of disability for affected individuals, but also in
      reducing required lifetime costs of healthcare. Hopefully in the future Neurofeedback
      training would be incorporated as a standard of care for ASD. As of today, there are around
      1000 trained Neurofeedback practitioners in the US who are offering this intervention to a
      very limited number of individuals due to lack of recognition of NFB benefits.
