  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, it is certain that neuraxial analgesia in early stage of labor and delivery dose
      not increase the risk of Cesarean section. However, given ethical reasons, whether such a
      medical procedure could increase the Cesarean rate compared with those who did not received
      neuraxial analgesia or not is yet to be known. It is difficult to perform such a study in
      occidental countries because they have a higher rate of labor analgesia. On the contrary, the
      rate of labor analgesia in China is up to date only 1%, so it can be done easily. The
      investigators hypothesized that no neuraxial analgesia itself were a risk factor to Cesarean
      section. Therefore, the investigators design this study to compared the effect of neuraxial
      analgesia on the rate of Cesarean delivery with those who did not received neuraxial
      analgesia.
