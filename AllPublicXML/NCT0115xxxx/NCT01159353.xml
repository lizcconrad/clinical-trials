      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the effect of insulin glulisine on the post-prandial plasma glucose excursion
           during the first hour after a standard meal in comparison to insulin aspart in obese
           subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Pharmacodynamic objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of insulin glulisine on the postprandial plasma glucose excursion
           during 6 hours after a standard meal in comparison to insulin aspart.

      Pharmacokinetic objective:

        -  To assess post-prandial plasma insulin excursion after a standard meal, in each
           treatment groups

      Safety objective:

        -  To assess the safety of insulin glulisine in comparison to insulin aspart
