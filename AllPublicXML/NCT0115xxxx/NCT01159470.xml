  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is one of the most common problems in pediatrics. Differentiating between bacterial
      infections, that require antibiotic therapy, and viral infections that resolve on their own
      is an important challenge for physicians.

      C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that increases in response to inflammation and its
      level is generally higher in bacterial infections compared to viral infections. it can be
      measured by a simple blood test, however its utility as a sole marker for bacterial infection
      is limited.

      The hypothesis of the study is that measuring CRP velocity, e.g the value of CRP divided by
      the hours since the fever started will improve the utility of CRP for the diagnosis of
      bacterial infections in children.
