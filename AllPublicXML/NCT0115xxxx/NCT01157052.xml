          -  Patients must have Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (stage IV)

          -  Patients who were treated with 5FU and leucovorin in the adjuvant setting or with 5FU
             and leucovorin (LV)or/and FOLFIRI regimen for metastatic setting may be eligible for
             this trial.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years

             0 to 2

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function of creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl and a creatinine
             clearance &gt; 45ml/min. Patients must have adequate hepatic function with a bilirubin &gt;
             1.5 mg/dl and AST (normal range 0-14/L) and ALT (normal range 0-49 U/L) in the absence
             of liver metastasis or &lt;/= 5X the upper limit of normal of AST and ALT in the presence
             of liver metastasis.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function with absolute neutrophil count(ANC)≥
             1,500/цl and platelets ≥ 100,000/цl and a hemoglobin ≥ 10g/d.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the study
             duration and patients must give written informed consent prior to any study-specific
             screening procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at
             any time without prejudice.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the start of treatment. Also,women of childbearing potential
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. The investigator is requested to advise the patient
             how to achieve an adequate contraception.

          -  Life expectancy longer that 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received oxaliplatin previously

          -  Patients with known peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 according to the WHO scale

          -  Patients who have tested positive for HIV

          -  Patients with other significant medical, psychiatric disorders tha, in the opinion of
             the investigator, will exclude the patient from the study for compliance of safety
             reasons.

          -  History of known allergy to oxaliplatin or other platinum compounds,to 5-FU, to LV, or
             to any ingredients in the formulations or the containers

             activity to prevent peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN)

          -  Patients who haven't successfully completed local therapy for previously treated CNS
             metastases &amp; who haven't been discontinued with corticosteroid for &gt;4kws before
             starting chemotherapy. Patients with asymptomatic brain mets who have no evidence of
             midline shift on CT/MRI may be enrolled without initiation of local therapy for the
             CNS mets. Repeat scan must be performed &lt; 4wks to ensure no progression.
