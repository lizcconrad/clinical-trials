  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the cause for over 19 million deaths in the US
      annually with coronary artery disease accounting for most of this mortality burden.1 Despite
      major advances in the treatment of coronary heart disease patients, a large number of victims
      of the disease who are apparently healthy die suddenly without prior symptoms. For those who
      arrive alive at an emergency department, a benefit is accrued from an orchestrated program of
      live-saving therapeutics designed to preserve ischemic or infarcted myocardium and prevent
      ventricular arrhythmias. However, despite improvements in door-to-balloon (angioplasty) times
      in the past decade, reductions in in-hospital mortality have not materialized.2 Average
      30-day mortality from ST elevation MI has been shown to be approximately 7% despite the
      modern aggressive approach of utilizing acute pharmacologic and percutaneous interventions as
      well as a comprehensive approach to risk factor modification.3 Antiplatelet agents including
      aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and IIb/IIIa inhibitors represent stalwart components of the
      acute coronary syndrome therapeutic treatment program. At the same time, the safety of
      combination antiplatelet agents used acutely and chronically in individuals with an acute
      coronary syndrome is concerning as bleeding complications can result in serious,
      life-threatening consequences.4 Studies have shown that patients treated with the combination
      of aspirin and clopidogrel have a small but significant increased risk of major and minor
      bleeding compared to each agent alone.4-6 In contrast, the use of fish oil in conjunction
      with aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with cardiovascular disease followed for an average
      of 33 months has been shown to have no significant effect on risk of major and minor bleeding
      compared to those on aspirin and clopidogrel alone, with a trend toward a reduced risk of
      minor bleeding in those taking fish oil.4 In Preliminary Data it is shown that a robust
      synergistic effect between Lovaza® and aspirin on the downregulation of platelet function may
      occur. These data suggest that the most potent omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil
      (eicosapentaenoic acid {EPA} and docosahexaenoic acid {DHA}) act acutely to modulate a major
      contributor to the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes. This study will randomize 60
      patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction to treatment with Lovaza® or placebo and
      measure the differences in platelet function and electrophysiologic parameters between
      treatment arms during their acute hospitalization and 1 week after discharge.

    <description>Platelet function will be measured with PFA-100 test which has been shown to correlate with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in several well conducted studies and in a meta-analysis. The PFA-100 measures the number of seconds required for a clot to form in whole blood which is passed through an aperture in a cartridge coated with epinephrine. It is meant to imitate clotting in human arteries.</description>

        <title>Platelet Function</title>
        <description>Platelet function will be measured with PFA-100 test which has been shown to correlate with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in several well conducted studies and in a meta-analysis. The PFA-100 measures the number of seconds required for a clot to form in whole blood which is passed through an aperture in a cartridge coated with epinephrine. It is meant to imitate clotting in human arteries.</description>
