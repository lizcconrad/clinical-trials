  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the lower airways inflammatory response to
      infection/pulmonary exacerbation among children known to have Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
      (PCD) with children known to have Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as measured by the presence of
      inflammatory mediators in expectorated/induced sputum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory response to infection and pulmonary exacerbation in CF is well documented,
      as is the response to intravenous antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, the inflammatory
      response to infection and treatment in PCD has not been well characterized. Given differences
      in disease progression, we hypothesize that children with CF respond to infection with a more
      exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response than those with PCD.

    <description>Each study participant will be invited to expectorate sputum for culture, sensitivity, cytology and analysis of cytokine levels. Culture and sensitivity will be performed routinely at the beginning of a pulmonary exacerbation, as per standard of care, and will only be performed at subsequent visits if there is clinical indication. A volume of 5ml of sputum will be required at each visit for analysis. If the participant is unable to expectorate this volume of sputum, he/she will be invited to induce sputum instead as per standard protocols.</description>

    <description>The investigators will measure exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO) at each visit according to the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines using a chemiluminescence analyzer. Briefly, single breath exhalation are performed in triplicate at flows of 30, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 ml/s and eNO is measured at the end of the exhalation. The higher the flow rate the more peripheral the airways that are being sampled.</description>
