      Polymorphonuclear neutrophils, or granulocytes, are essential effector cells of the innate
      immune system against bacterial infections. Their role in sepsis has been long established as
      the primary phagocyte to clear the infectious process. In the early phase of sepsis, one
      observes a massive recruitment of immature neutrophils from the bone marrow into peripheral
      blood, the so-called &quot;band forms&quot; or &quot;left shift cells&quot;. Despite the daily clinical use of
      neutrophil band forms count in the care of septic patients and their abundance in septic
      blood, no information exists on the fate of these cells, nor on their capacity to mount an
      efficient innate immune response. It is the goal of this proposal to study the fate and the
      innate immune functions of immature neutrophils obtained in patients with early septic shock.
      Immature neutrophils will be separated from mature neutrophils. The following functions will
      be studied ex vivo in mature vs. immature neutrophils from a series of patients with severe
      sepsis and septic shock: (1) surface expression of receptors of the innate immunity; (2)
      production of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to bacterial
      agonists; (3) chemotaxis; (4) phagocytosis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; and
      (5) ex vivo viability (life span) and resistance to apoptosis. Importantly, the investigators
      have developed and mastered all in vitro assays and cell separation techniques necessary to
      address and answer these important questions. This project will undoubtedly shed light on the
      fate and function of a prominent leukocyte population circulating in patients with severe
      bacterial infections and sepsis.

      Objectives

        1. Primary objective: To determine the innate immune functions of immature neutrophils in
           comparison to those from mature neutrophils, sampled from patients with severe sepsis
           and sepsis shock and in control patients (trauma patients and healthy donors (only
           mature neutrophils in the latter case)

        2. Secondary objectives: To determine the fate and span life of immature neutrophils in
           comparison to mature neutrophils, sampled from patients with severe sepsis and sepsis
           shock and in control patients (trauma patients and healthy donors (only mature
           neutrophils in the latter case).

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (according to ACCP/FCCM standard
           definitions) with &gt; 5% immature neutrophils.

        -  Patients with a noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), e.g.
           patients with head trauma or multiple trauma with &gt; 5% immature neutrophils.

        -  Healthy donors

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Severe immunosuppression (e.g. HIV with &lt; 200 CD4/mm3), treatment with glucocorticoids
           (&gt; 300 mg hydrocortisone/day) or other immunosuppressive therapy

        -  Neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.5 G/l).

        -  Recent chemotherapy or administration of intravenous immunoglobulins within the last 4
           weeks.

      Endpoints

        -  Surface expression of receptors of the innate immunity in immature vs. mature
           neutrophils.

        -  Production by immature vs. mature neutrophils of inflammatory mediators and reactive
           oxygen species in response to bacterial agonists.

        -  Chemotaxis of immature vs. mature neutrophils.

        -  Phagocytosis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by immature vs. mature
           neutrophils.

        -  Ex vivo viability and resistance to apoptosis of immature vs. mature neutrophils.
