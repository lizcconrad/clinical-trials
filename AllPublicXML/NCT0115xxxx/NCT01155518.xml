  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low testosterone production, known clinically as hypogonadism, appears to be common
      complication of type 2 diabetes, affecting one in three diabetic men. Hypogonadism is known
      to be associated with decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass, increased inflammation and
      decreased fertility. In this grant, the investigators propose to study the effects of having
      low testosterone on 1) insulin sensitivity, the ability of the body to handle glucose 2) fat
      and muscle mass at specific areas of the body 3) expression of mediators of inflammation in
      the blood 4) semen quality. This study will compare diabetic men (with or without
      hypogonadism). This study will also evaluate the effect of treatment with clomiphene (a drug
      that increases testosterone and sperm production) or testosterone in men with diabetes and
      hypogonadism. The investigators hope that this project will help us understand the state of
      hypogonadism in young type 2 diabetic men who are in their peak fertility years and give us
      insights into treatment of this condition. With the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes in
      the young, this project may have implications for public health.

      This project will study young men with type 2 diabetes. We have shown that half of these men
      have low testosterone levels. This can lead to 1) Low muscle mass; 2) more fat mass; 3)
      insulin resistance; 4) low sperm count and 5) increased inflammation (that increases the risk
      of heart disease). This project will study these consequences in detail and also the
      possibility of reversing them with treatment. Information from this project will be useful in
      planning of future studies that will evaluate the effect of treatment of low testosterone on
      mortality, heart disease and stroke.

    <description>HH in young T2D men is associated with increased expression and protein content of mediators of inflammation and insulin resistance in MNC, muscle and adipose tissue. Treatment with T and CC decreases inflammation and the expression of proteins that decrease insulin signal transduction.</description>

    <measure>sexual function and spermatogenesis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>HH in young T2D men is associated with a decrease in testicular volume, a decrease in spermatozoal numbers, abnormal spermatozoal morphology and function, decreased sexual function and depressed mood as compared to age matched T2D men without HH and healthy lean controls. T and CC treatment will improve sexual function and mood. CC treatment can increase T concentrations, testicular size and spermatogenesis in T2D men with HH.</description>
