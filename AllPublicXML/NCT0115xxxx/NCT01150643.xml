      RATIONALE: Studying the effects of rituximab in blood and tumor tissue samples from patients
      with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the effects of rituximab on
      cancer cells. It may also help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from patients with follicular
      lymphoma treated with rituximab.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcγR) polymorphisms with response, response
           duration, and time to resistance in samples from patients with follicular lymphoma (FL)
           treated with single-agent rituximab on ECOG-E4402.

        -  Identify gene expression profiles that correlate with response, response duration, and
           time to rituximab resistance in these patients.

        -  Determine whether the FL microenvironment is predictive of initial response and duration
           of response to rituximab.

      OUTLINE: DNA and RNA from banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples are analyzed for
      immunoglobulin-receptor polymorphism, gene expression profile, and follicular lymphoma
      microenvironment by real-time PCR, microarray hybridization, and IHC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 259 PBMC samples and 300 FFPE blocks will be accrued for this
      study.
