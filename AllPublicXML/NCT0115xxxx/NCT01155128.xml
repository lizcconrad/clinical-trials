      Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now an important public health issue. While
      0.1% of the population is on dialysis, approximately 4.5% of subjects have renal dysfunction
      (glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2). These patients have a high mortality of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) with low quality of life and survival, despite high expenditure
      on their treatment. Hypertension (SAH) is both a cause and a complication of CKD. In
      addition, CKD and hypertension are risk factors for CVD. The nephropathy that are not on
      dialysis are less studied than those on dialysis. Strategies are needed to maintain renal
      function in these patients and mitigate the risk factors for CVD. A sedentary lifestyle can
      be an important determinant of morbidity of mortality. This study aims to determine the
      effect of exercise in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis.

      Methodology: A randomized clinical trial in hypertensive patients with CRF. After recruitment
      of participants and completed baseline surveys, those eligible for inclusion and consented to
      participate in the study will be randomly assigned. We use the technique of randomization in
      blocks of fixed size of six persons.

      Variables to be collected: demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, anthropometric, blood
      pressure, laboratory tests (anemia, the lipid profile, blood glucose, inflammatory markers
      and number of peripheral endothelial progenitor cells) and quality of life. These patients
      will be re-interviewed in the middle period of the study (10 weeks) at the end of the
      intervention (20 weeks) and 10 weeks after the end of the intervention. The intervention
      group will participate in two weekly sessions of exercise.

      Therefore, facing the epidemic of CKD, this study intends to fill the data gaps about the
      impact of physical activity in patients with CKD on dialysis.
