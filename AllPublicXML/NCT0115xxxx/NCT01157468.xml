    <textblock>
      -  The Martinique island (French West-Indies) is an area of high prevalence and incidence
           for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), respectively 64,2/ 100000 and 4,7/ 100000. In
           many cases, this disease concerns Afro Caribbean women, whose auto-antibodies are
           excessively high; also, organic damages are frequent. The disease can be fatal.

        -  Studies have shown that some cytotoxic auto-antibodies may have a responsibility in the
           hydrolysing of DNA. This study will focus on the DNA activity and also on the overwhelm
           hydrolase activity dealing with the Lupus disease in order to measure the link between
           the disease activity and the catalytic activity. Patients concerned by this study will
           be Martinique people.

      This study will be conducted as an case-control survey.

        -  The first group with patients: 60 SLE patients, 30 patients with a quiescent lupus and
           30 patients with an active lupus. Patients that will be included are followed by the
           University hospital of Fort-de-France.

        -  The second group is the control group: subjects will be recruited by the French
           organisation responsible for donation of blood.

      Test will be done at the UMRS 872 laboratory of the INSERM - Laboratory of Immunopathology
      and Therapeutic immunointervention - in Paris ; two catalytic activities will be tested: the
      DNase activity and the hydrolase activity.

      Means to analyse the two activities: digestion of plasmid and Affinity-linked Oligonucleotide
      Nuclease Assay for DNase activity and hydrolysis of a peptide PFR-MCA for hydrolase activity.

      -  For the &quot;case&quot; means the research will be done on a blood sample of 7 ml, reclassified
           from treatement to research, collected from the blood sampling usually prescribed by
           doctors to treat the patient come to be diagnosed a lupus or for continuing care.

           people coming to donate blood at thethe French Blood Establishment of Martinique.

      The volume does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by French regulations for blood
