      To test the efficacy of a combination chemotherapy of imatinib and 5-FU in advanced or
      metastatic cholangiocellular carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Efficacy: Tumor assessments should be performed by a CT or MRI scan, throughout the study.
      All assessments should be performed within 14 days of the scheduled day according to the
      visit schedules, and whenever clinically indicated otherwise. Radiological studies must use
      the same techniques as used at baseline. Evaluation will be based on RECIST criteria.

      Safety: Safety assessments will consist of evaluating adverse events and serious adverse
      events, laboratory parameters including hematology, chemistry, vital signs, physical
      examinations, and documentation of all concomitant medications and/or therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/Cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced / metastatic carcinoma of
             the gallbladder or bile duct, which is unresectable or metastatic and therefore
             incurable with any conventional multimodality approach

          -  Performance status 0, 1 or 2 (ECOG)

          -  Written, voluntary informed consent

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (Granulocytes &gt; 1,5 x 109/l, Hb &gt; 10 g/dl, Platelets &gt;
             100 x 109/l)

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function ( bilirubin &lt; 1,25 x upper normal limit or &lt; 1,5 x
             upper normal limit if hyperbilirubinemia is related to underlying disease, ALAT + ASAT
             &lt; 1,5 x upper normal limit, in case of liver metastases &lt; 5 x upper normal limit,
             creatinine &lt; 1,25 x upper normal limit)

             the study with a proven efficacy of &gt;99%. The contraception treatment should be
             performed for an additional six month following discontinuation from study treatment.

             non-childbearing potential. Male patients of reproductive potential must agree to
             employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to
