  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the current study is to determine whether computerized Working
      Memory (WM) training will enhance WM capacity in college students with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)/Learning Disabilities (LD). There are also three additional
      objectives. The first is to determine whether improvements in WM will generalize to secondary
      outcome tasks, such as inhibitory control and planning. The second objective is to examine
      whether WM training will also ameliorate ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The
      last objective is to investigate whether improvements will be maintained at a two month
      follow-up period.

      It is expected that the computerized WM training program will enhance WM capacity in college
      students with ADHD. In addition, it is believed that these increases in WM capacity will also
      lead to improvements in other executive functions. It is also hypothesized that WM training
      will lead to a reduction in ADHD symptomology. Lastly, these improvements should be
      maintained at three month follow-up.

    <description>The Cogmed Working Memory Training Program will be used as the experimental program because of preliminary evidence indicating its effectiveness in enhancing WM and reducing behavioural symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity in children. This software-based training program was designed to improve WM abilities, particularly in children with ADHD or severe attention problems. Training is implemented with a software program (RoboMemoÂ©). It includes a set of auditory verbal and visual-spatial WM tasks presented via computer. All tasks involve: maintenance of simultaneous mental representations of multiple stimuli, unique sequencing of stimulus order in each trial and progressive adaptation of difficulty level as a function of individual performance.</description>
