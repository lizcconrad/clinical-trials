  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, phase II trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      two different schedules of vaccination against influenza A H1N1 in HIV-infected individuals,
      in which each of the randomized groups will be compared with HIV-negative volunteers
      vaccinated with the regimen indicated by the Brazilian National Immunization Program. Will be
      included in the study HIV-infected patients, stratified by CD4 count (&lt; 200 cells/mm3 or &gt;
      200 cells/mm3) at the time of screening for the study, not receiving antiretroviral therapy
      treatment or receiving stable treatment for at least 8 weeks, with no plans to change over
      the next 6 months, eligible to receive vaccine against influenza A H1N1. The control group
      will be formed by HIV-negative individuals, confirmed by serology performed at screening,
      eligible to receive vaccine against influenza A H1N1. Patients infected with HIV will receive
      one of two possible vaccination regimens: 1) 3.75 µg in two applications 21 days apart, 2)
      7.5 µg in two applications 21 days apart. The volunteers in the control group will receive a
      single application of 3.75 µg dose of the vaccine. The study's hypotheses are: 1) The vaccine
      against the H1N1 virus promotes antibody titers above the level specified for protection
      (seroconversion), being as safe and well tolerated in patients HIV-1 infected as in non
      HIV-infected volunteers; 2) The proportion of seroconversion for H1N1 virus vaccine at a dose
      of 3.75 µg in HIV-1-infected patients is similar to the proportion of seroconversion induced
      by the same vaccine at a dose of 7.5 µg; 3)The proportion of seroconversion with one dose of
      the vaccine against H1N1 virus is similar to the proportion after the second dose.
