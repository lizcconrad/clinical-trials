      RATIONALE: Pioglitazone hydrochloride may be effective treatment for cognitive dysfunction
      caused by radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pioglitazone
      hydrochloride in preventing radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction in treating patients with
      brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and toxicity associated with two different dose regimens of
      pioglitazone administered orally as a cytoprotective agent against radiation-induced brain
      injury.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on glycemic levels and hemoglobin A1c values when
      pioglitazone is used as a cytoprotective agent concurrent with radiotherapy in normoglycemic
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fractionated external beam radiotherapy, 3-D conformal
      radiotherapy, or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Patients receive oral pioglitazone
      hydrochloride once daily before for 1 week prior to brain irradiation, during and and
      continuing for 6 months after completion of radiation radiotherapy. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed periodically.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed brain tumors of the
             following types: Group 1: malignant brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic
             gliomas, brain metastases, and other malignant brain tumors); or Group 2: low grade
             brain tumors (low grade gliomas, meningiomas, and other low grade brain tumors)

          -  All stages and grades of brain tumors are eligible

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must have agreed to be treated with fractionated, external beam radiation
             treatment (EBRT) with either curative or palliative intent (the length of the
             radiation course must at least be ten fractions)

          -  Patients must have agreed to have CT and MR imaging for purposes of radiation
             treatment planning, radiation treatment monitoring, and/or radiation treatment
             evaluation

          -  Patients must have measurable disease and/or relevant anatomic features using Magnetic
             Resonance Imaging

          -  Prior therapies (cytotoxic, surgery, and radiation) are acceptable

          -  Use of steroids is acceptable when indicated

          -  Patients who have NYHA class III or IV heart failure

          -  Patients who have elevated transaminases (AST or ALT &gt; 2.5 times normal limit)

          -  Patients who have symptomatic edema (&gt;= grade 2)

          -  Patients who are on medications that have been shown to have a drug interaction with
             pioglitazone: atorvastatin (doses &gt; 80 mg/day), systemic anti-fungals, medications

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac,
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study if their pregnancy precludes radiation
             treatment because ionizing radiation used in radiation treatment is an agent with
