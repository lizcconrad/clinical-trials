  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect epidemiological and clinical data to assess the
      vaccine impact and occurrence of confirmed acute hepatitis A cases in sentinel hospitals
      after the introduction of Havrix™ into the Expanded Program of Immunization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, multi-centre, sentinel based study in 3 hospitals in
      Panama. Hospitals are selected based on population density or hepatitis A disease burden.

      The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) definition for a possible case of acute hepatitis
      A are used for subjects aged between &gt;1 month and &lt;15 years.

      Data regarding clinical and epidemiologic information are collected and serum samples are
      collected to test hepatitis A markers and determine if infection with hepatitis A virus has
      recently occurred.

      Surveillance will be for a period of approximately 2.5 years from the date of study
      initiation.
