      The purpose of this study is to assess the Safety and Efficacy of Foam Otic Cipro (0.3%
      Ciprofloxacin Otic Foam), used once-daily for 7 days for the treatment of Acute Diffuse
      Otitis Externa, compared to commercial ear drops used twice daily for 7 days.

      Acute otitis externa (AOE) is defined as a diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal,
      which may also involve the pinna and/or the tympanic membrane. AOE is one of the most common
      infections encountered by otolaryngologists, pediatricians and family physicians. Diagnosis
      of AOE requires rapid onset (generally within 48 hours) of symptoms and signs of ear canal
      inflammation which includes: A) otalgia (often severe), itching or fullness, sometimes
      accompanied by reduced hearing or jaw pain; B) tenderness of the tragus and/or pinna; and C)
      diffuse ear canal edema with or without erythema, sometimes accompanied by ear discharge.
