  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week trial investigators administered daily doses of
      either youths with autism spectrum disorders.ARA and DHA supplementation significantly
      improved communication as well as social withdrawal symptoms. This pilot study provides the
      first evidence that supplementation with larger ARA doses added to DHA improve impaired
      social interaction in youths with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

    <textblock>
      We recruited 13 individuals who met the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of high functioning
      autistic disorder (n=1) or Asperger's Disorder (n=12),corroborated by the Autism Diagnostic
      Interview―Revised. Participants were free of any medical or comorbid psychiatric disorders.
      Other inclusion criteria included weigh of at least 16 kg, either a verbal or performance
      intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80, and a score greater than 10 on the social withdrawal
      subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist―Community.
