  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we seek to understand the effects of tolcapone and entacapone, FDA-approved
      COMT inhibitors, on reward choice and response inhibition, two measures we have previously
      shown to be altered in subjects with alcoholism. We now plan to test the hypothesis that COMT
      regulation of cortical dopamine levels is critical for regulation financial choices.
      Specifically, we propose that the lower levels of cortical dopamine present in individuals
      with the val158val COMT genotype reduces the inhibitory effect of frontal cortical areas on
      impulsive choice; an idea that extends previous hypotheses about the negative consequences of
      decreased prefrontal dopamine levels on inhibitory control. Moreover, this hypothesis
      suggests that inhibiting COMT may slow the degradation of dopamine and thereby decrease
      impulsivity.

    <textblock>
      Drug consumption despite adverse consequences is a defining feature of human addiction
      (DSM-IV-TR, 2004). Impulsivity, a tendency to choose an immediate action despite delayed
      adverse consequences, is a major risk factor for tobacco, psychostimulant, opioid and alcohol
      abuse. In humans, impulsivity can be quantified by presenting subjects with a choice between
      a small immediate monetary reward or a larger but delayed reward. We recently found that the
      val158val allele for the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which is associated with
      more rapid cortical dopamine catabolism and thus lower cortical dopamine levels correlates
      with greater impulsivity and greater fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in
      dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices.

      The first phase of the study will involve healthy controls. The second phase of the study
      will involve abstinent alcoholics matched for age, education, and gender. Subjects will range
      in age between 18 and 50 years old.
