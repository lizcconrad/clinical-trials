  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoma of the esophagus is the among the most common cancers in Indian population. While
      adenocarcinoma is more common in western countries, in India squamous cell carcinoma is the
      more frequent form. Surgery is the standard treatment in resectable lesions, but survival is
      poor. Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment therapy is used with an aim to improve the results.
      Though few randomized trials have addressed the issue of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the
      methodology was inhomogeneous and the populations studied were different. The investigators
      will be conducting a randomized controlled trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of
      the esophagus. Preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery will be compared with surgery
      alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 65 years

          2. Squamous cell carcinoma

          3. Good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] grades 0, 1 and 2)

          4. Contrast enhanced computerized tomographic (CECT) scan suggesting a potentially
             resectable lesion. The features of resectability assessed on CECT scan will include -
             no evidence of infiltration of mediastinal structures such as the aorta (angle of
             contact &lt;900, no obliteration of the triangular fat space between the esophagus,
             aorta, and spine), and pericardium20, and no evidence of tracheobronchial fistula or
             tumor extension into the airway lumen.

          5. No evidence of distant metastasis on CECT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient refused consent for the study

          2. Comorbid conditions which would preclude oesophagectomy

               -  Poor performance status (ECOG &gt; 2)

               -  American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV

          3. Metastatic disease detected on evaluation

          4. Involvement of mediastinal structures except

          5. Carcinoma involving cervical esophagus

          6. Previous radiotherapy or chemotherapy
