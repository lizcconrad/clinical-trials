      Aim: to determine the effects of DHA supplementation:

        -  on the platelet function through their aggregation and the pathway of arachidonic acid
           metabolism

        -  on redox status on cells and plasma

        -  on inflammation in 16 type 2 diabetic patients in a cross-over study comparing DHA (400
           mg/day for 2 weeks) vs Sunflower oil (placebo). Each period is separated by a wash-out
           period of 6 to 9 weeks.
