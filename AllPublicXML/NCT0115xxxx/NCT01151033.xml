      This study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter registry of approximately 50 patients
      undergoing PCI with the ProNOVA Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System according to its
      Instructions for Use.

      The purpose of this registry is the evaluation of the performance, safety and efficacy of
      ProNOVA XR DES in real-world patients. Following initial stent implantation, all patients
      will have clinical follow up at 30 days, at 6 and 12 months. Additionally all patients will
      have a angiographic F/U at 6 months to assess the late luminal loss by QCA measurements and
      the neointimal volume including stent apposition by intravascular ultrasound.

          -  Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible change in the
             electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia)

          -  Patient must agree to undergo all required follow-up examinations.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have had a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before treatment, and must not be nursing at the time of treatment.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Target lesions must be de novo lesions (no prior stent implant, no prior
             brachytherapy)

          -  Target vessel reference diameter must be between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm by visual estimate

          -  Target lesion â‰¤ 28 mm in length by visual estimate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the clinical investigation plan, confound the data interpretation
             or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year)

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, either heparin or
             bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, cobalt, chromium, nickel, or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

          -  Participation in another device or drug study or has completed the follow-up phase of
             another study within the last 30 days

          -  Patients judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty
             balloon.
