  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been identified as an independent risk factor for existing
      cardiovascular disease, preceding a major cardiovascular event by an average of about 5
      years. Are men prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor for ED more likely to have a new diagnosis of
      underlying medical conditions compared to men of a similar age not receiving PDE5 inhibitor
      treatment?

          <title>Percentage of Participants With New Diagnosis of Underlying Condition at PDE5i Establishment During the End of Study Period</title>
          <description>New diagnosis of underlying condition at PDE5i establishment was defined as any new diagnosis of interest between day 0 (index prescription) and day 91 in participants who received the index prescription between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2008 for the two-years period combined. Diagnoses of interest were coded and categorized in to vasculogenic, urologic, neurogenic, hormonal, drug induced and psychogenic disorders.</description>
          <population>Evaluable analysis population included all participants who received an index PDE5i prescription (sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil) during the study period (target population). Last observation carried forward method was used. Here, the 'N' (number of participants analyzed) is signifying those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>
