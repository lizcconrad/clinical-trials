    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of lidocaine 5% medicated
      plaster in localized chronic post-operative neuropathic pain in comparison to placebo
      plaster.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who undergo different types of surgery develop distressing and long-lasting
      pain. This pain is often characterized by signs such as: allodynia (a pain due to a stimulus
      which does not normally provoke pain), dysesthesia (unpleasant, abnormal sense of touch).
      Patients describe symptoms of burning or electrical type sensation. In some cases this type
      of chronic pain can still be present after 3 months or more following surgery.This clinical
      trial will assess the efficacy and safety profile of lidocaine 5% medicated plaster in
      comparison to placebo plaster in patients.

      This trial is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor patient will know which
      treatment was received), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial to evaluate
      topical analgesic treatment of chronic neuropathic pain after surgery. The trial will include
      a screening phase and a treatment phase, during which subjects will be treated with either 5%
      lidocaine medicated plaster, or a placebo plaster pain intensity will be assessed on a daily
      basis. Subsequently there will be a follow-up phase. Pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI)
      will be collected via the numeric rating scale and averaged. Safety evaluations include
      monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.
