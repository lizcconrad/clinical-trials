  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are very prevalent worldwide and
      carry a high morbidity rate. It has been recently shown that patients with celiac disease
      very often fail to develop immunity after standard vaccination for HBV during infancy. In
      this study, we will evaluate whether a second vaccination series with a different vaccine,
      Sci-B-Vac, results in a better immunological response in celiac patients. Eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive a 3-dose vaccination series with Engerix or Sci-B-Vac
      vaccines.. Rate of responders and level of immunity will be compared. This study will
      facilitate better protection of celiac patients to this potentially deadly virus.
