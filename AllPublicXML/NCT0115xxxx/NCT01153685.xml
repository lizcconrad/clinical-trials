             procedures for collection of safety data, expressed availability for the required
             study period, and ability and willingness to attend scheduled visits.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

          -  Participation in previous year's (2009) Fluviral registration study

          -  Administration of any influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start (35

          -  Administration of any other vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or
             during the study period. Subjects who receive such treatment after enrollment will be

Any = occurrence of any adverse event regardless of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination.
Grade 3 = an unsolicited AE that prevented normal everyday activity. Related = event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination.</description>
