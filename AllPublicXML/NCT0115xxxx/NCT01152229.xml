  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to describe and quantify levels of platelet reactivity in three different
      cohorts of patients taking thienopyridine: patients who report nuisance bleeding, patients
      who report alarming bleeding, and patients who report no nuisance or alarming bleeding. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients with nuisance or alarming bleeding events on
      maintenance thienopyridine therapy will have lower levels of platelet reactivity than
      patients without nuisance or alarming bleeding on thienopyridine therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel.

          -  Use of a glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa inhibitor within 8 hours of the blood draw.

          -  Patient known to be pregnant or lactating

          -  Any significant medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere
             with the patient's optimal participation in the study.
