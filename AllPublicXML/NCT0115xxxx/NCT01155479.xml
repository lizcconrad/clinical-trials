  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one year, 2-part study to determine the efficacy and safety of preladenant, an
      adenosine type 2a (A2a) receptor antagonist. The purpose of Part 1 (first 26 weeks) is to
      determine if preladenant is effective in the treatment of early Parkinson's Disease. The
      purpose of Part 2 (second 26 weeks) is to determine if preladenant is safe and well
      tolerated. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that at least the 10 mg twice daily dose of
      preladenant is superior to placebo as measured by the change from Baseline to Week 26 in the
      sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts 2 and 3 scores (UPDRS2+3).

    <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. The UPDRS Part 2 is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52 as determined by the physician. The UPDRS Part 3 is the Motor Examination (Total Motor Score [TMS]) and is defined as the total score, ranging from 0-108 as determined by the physician, of the tests given in the motor examination section. The combined scores of Parts 2 and 3 can range from 0-160 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Change from baseline was analyzed using a constrained longitudinal analysis (cLDA) model with treatment, time, strata and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability; it assesses 6 features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. UPDRS Part 2 is Activities of Daily Living score and ranges from 0-52. UPDRS Part 3 is Motor Examination and ranges from 0-108. The combined scores of Parts 2 and 3 can range from 0-160 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. A Responder is defined as a participant with at least 20% improvement in UPDRS2+3 from Baseline to Week 26 (End of Part 1 Treatment); a participant with at least a 20% decrease from Baseline score in UPDRS2+3 is defined as a responder. The proportion of Responders was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with treatment effect, strata and Baseline UPDRS2+3 as a covariate, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Sum of Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Parts 2 and 3 Scores (UPDRS2+3)</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. The UPDRS Part 2 is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52 as determined by the physician. The UPDRS Part 3 is the Motor Examination (Total Motor Score [TMS]) and is defined as the total score, ranging from 0-108 as determined by the physician, of the tests given in the motor examination section. The combined scores of Parts 2 and 3 can range from 0-160 with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Change from baseline was analyzed using a constrained longitudinal analysis (cLDA) model with treatment, time, strata and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the UPDRS Part 2 Score (Activities of Daily Living [ADL])</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the participant. The UPDRS Part 2 is the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score and can range from 0-52 as determined by the physician with the higher score indicating the worse condition. Change from baseline was analyzed using a cLDA model with treatment, time, strata and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.</description>
