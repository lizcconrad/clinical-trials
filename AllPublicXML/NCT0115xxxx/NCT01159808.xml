  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different dose strengths of INX-08189 in
      healthy adults. The study will also look at how rapidly the drug breaks down in the body
      (pharmacokinetics or PK). The study objectives include:

        -  To evaluate the safety of single ascending oral doses of INX-08189 in healthy subjects

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single ascending oral doses of
           INX-08189 in healthy subjects

        -  To assess the food effect on the PK of a single oral dose of INX-08189
