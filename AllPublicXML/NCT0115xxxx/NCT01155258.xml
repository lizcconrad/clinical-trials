      RATIONALE: Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine ditartrate, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving temsirolimus together with vinorelbine ditartrate may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving temsirolimus
      and vinorelbine ditartrate together in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic
      solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of temsirolimus and
      vinorelbine in advanced solid tumors.

      II. To obtain preliminary information regarding the activity of this combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and vinorelbine
      ditartrate IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
