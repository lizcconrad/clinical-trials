  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the microbiological effects of two different
      treatments: a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (IM BPG) vs. a 10-day
      daily dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis in children in low resource
      settings. This study was a prospective multi-center randomized active control treatment
      trial. The trial is a non-inferiority equivalence trial, to determine if amoxicillin
      treatment is at least as effective as the currently given IM BPG treatment.

    <measure>Eradication of Group A Streptococcus (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>21-28 days after 1st visit</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of the study was bacteriologic treatment success, which was defined as eradication of GAS from the pharynx at the follow up visit. Eradication was defined as no GAS present on the throat culture.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>21-28 days after 1st visit</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with the amoxicillin treatment regimen was assessed at the follow up visit. The primary measure of compliance was the presence of antimicrobial activity in the urine-impregnated filter paper strips. For those who did not return the filter paper strip, compliance was measured by parent/guardian report during the exit interview. Patients who did not fulfill at least one of these criteria were considered noncompliant.</description>
