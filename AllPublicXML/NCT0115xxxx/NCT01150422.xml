      This trial will compare the efficacy and acceptability of post-medical abortion follow-up by
      assigning women to either 1) alternative follow-up via routine semi-quantitative pregnancy
      test and a self-administered follow-up questionnaire, or 2) the standard of care: a routine
      follow-up visit including a bimanual exam and vaginal ultrasound.

      The goal of the study is to provide answers to the following questions:

        1. Is a follow-up protocol that employs a self-administered questionnaire and at home use
           of a semi-quantitative pregnancy test effective at identifying women with ongoing
           pregnancies?

        2. Is an innovative follow-up protocol more acceptable to women and providers than the
           current standard of care?

        3. Is an innovative follow-up protocol feasible to implement in abortion services in
           Vietnam?

    <description>Standard of care includes a routine hospital visit two weeks after mifepristone administration. At the hospital visit, the woman will undergo a bimanual and vaginal ultrasound examination. In the event the woman fails to return for the follow-up visit, each hospital will follow their standard procedure for contacting women who fail to attend their follow-up visit, i.e. three efforts to contact the woman. Form 2a will document the results of any clinical examinations, any additional medical abortion-related care given and the abortion outcome. At the follow-up visit, women will also be asked about the acceptability of current medical abortion follow-up procedures and their future preferences.</description>

    <description>At their first clinic visit, women will be asked to provide their phone number for contact purposes. Women will also be asked to complete a semi-quantitative pregnancy test in the clinic and the results of the test will be noted on a study form. After mifepristone administration, women will be provided with a second semi-quantitative pregnancy test and a self-administered checklist.
Women will be instructed to complete the checklist and perform the pregnancy test at home on an assigned date two weeks after mifepristone administration. The checklist will indicate that if the woman answers &quot;yes&quot; to any of the questions, then she should return to the clinic for a follow-up visit. On the assigned date, women will also be contacted by phone by the clinic staff. Women will be asked to confirm whether they completed the pregnancy test and checklist and asked to report on the results of both tests.</description>

Provider will review the women's responses to the checklist and confirm whether, based on the woman's responses, she should return for a follow up visit. During the follow-up phone call, women will also be asked about the satisfaction and acceptability of the alternative follow-up procedure.</description>
