  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to restore life role participation for those with TBI by
      customizing, applying, and testing integrated cognitive and motor training protocols that
      were successful in populations with impairments similar to TBI. The treatment protocols are
      based on principles of brain plasticity and re-learning, required to restore cognitive and
      motor function. The intervention targets an array of impairments that are obstacles to life
      role participation. These include cognitive attention and executive control; motor control
      for upper limb function; balance and gait; and cognitive executive control of simultaneous
      cognitive and motor tasks required by everyday tasks. The intervention utilizes training
      specificity, framing the intervention within functional task and life role activity component
      practice.

      The investigators will use an assessment and treatment decision schema that has been
      successful in restoration of life role participation for stroke survivors and a comparable
      schema used for cognitive training for TBI patients. The subject assessment and decision
      schema will be used to identify for each subject, the optimal array of impairment
      interventions. The proposed treatment will optimize outcome by customizing the intervention
      and use of technologies, while ensuring the application of the array of impairment
      interventions required to produce restoration of function and life role participation. The
      investigators will target an array of impairments preventing participation in life role
      activities, which will include dyscoordination and weakness of upper limb, impaired balance,
      gait deficits, and impaired attention and executive function. In treatment, the investigators
      will use a dual-task paradigm combining motor and cognitive training, with treatment
      extending to the every day environment. Treatment will be up to 5 times/wk, 5hrs/day for 12
      weeks.
