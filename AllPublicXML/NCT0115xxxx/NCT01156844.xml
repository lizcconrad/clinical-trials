    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) After Two Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 values were calculated as the mean of the 23.17 hours and 23.75 hours post morning dose FEV1 measurements. Analysis of covariance model was used with baseline FEV1 as a continuous covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second Standardized (With Respect to Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 0 to 24 Hours Post Dose (FEV1 AUC 0-24h) After Two Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 0-24 hours post dose week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC 0-24 hours) of FEV1 measurements taken at pre-dose to 24 hours post-dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule and was adjusted for the area per time unit using the scheduled time of measurements for FEV1. Analysis of covariance model was used with baseline FEV1 as a continuous covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second Standardized (With Respect to Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 0 to 48 Hours (FEV1 AUC 0-48h) After Two Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 0 to 48 hours post dose week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC 0-48 hours) of FEV1 measurements taken at pre-dose to 48 hours post-dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule and was adjusted for the area per time unit by using the scheduled time of measurements for FEV1. Analysis of covariance model was used with baseline FEV1 as a continuous covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 0 to 12 hours post dose week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC 0-12 hours) of FEV1 measurements taken at pre-dose to 12 hours post-dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule and was adjusted for the area per time unit by using the scheduled time of measurements for FEV1.

        <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC 0-24 hours) of FEV1 measurements taken at pre-dose to 24 hours post-dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule and was adjusted for the area per time unit using the scheduled time of measurements for FEV1. Analysis of covariance model was used with baseline FEV1 as a continuous covariate.</description>
