  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MabThera in combination chemotherapy,
      followed by maintenance treatment with MabThera. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      1-2 years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Remaining Failure-Free After 2 Years From Treatment Start Date</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 28</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who at 2 years from the start of treatment remained free from documented disease progression, relapse, or death. Failure status was based on tumor evaluation performed on Month 28. Participants who did not have a tumor evaluation at Month 28 were counted as failures.</description>

    <description>CR: complete disappearance of all symptoms/objective signs of disease (enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) for at least 3 months following definitive re-evaluation at end of therapy. For initial bone marrow involvement, clearance of bone marrow documented by biopsy, normalization of blood counts with granulocytes greater than (&gt;)1,500 per microliter (/µL), hemoglobin &gt;12 grams per deciliter (g/dL), platelets &gt;100,000/µL. CRu: disappearance of all symptoms and nearly all measurable lesions, but persistence of some radiologic abnormalities with normalization of all biologic abnormalities; normalization of the performance status for at least 3 months after the definite evaluation of therapy. PR: at least 50 percent (%) reduction of measurable and evaluable lymphoma involvement for at least 4 weeks without occurrence of new manifestations, normalization of blood counts. Participants without evaluation at end of induction/maintenance phase were considered nonresponders.</description>

Cycles 2-3 and Cycle 6 (28-day cycle): Participants received rituximab 375 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m^2 IV and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m^2 IV on Days 2, 3, and 4 followed by 24 days of rest. Cycles 4-5 (28-day cycle): Participants received fludarabine 25 mg/m^2 IV and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m^2 IV on Days 2, 3, and 4 and rituximab 375 mg/m^2 IV on Day 14, followed by 14 days of rest. Cycles 7-10 (2-month cycle): Following 2 months rest after the completion of Cycle 6, participants with complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR), received maintenance therapy with rituximab 375 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, followed by 2 months rest; cycle was repeated 4 times.</description>

          <description>CR: complete disappearance of all symptoms/objective signs of disease (enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) for at least 3 months following definitive re-evaluation at end of therapy. For initial bone marrow involvement, clearance of bone marrow documented by biopsy, normalization of blood counts with granulocytes greater than (&gt;)1,500 per microliter (/µL), hemoglobin &gt;12 grams per deciliter (g/dL), platelets &gt;100,000/µL. CRu: disappearance of all symptoms and nearly all measurable lesions, but persistence of some radiologic abnormalities with normalization of all biologic abnormalities; normalization of the performance status for at least 3 months after the definite evaluation of therapy. PR: at least 50 percent (%) reduction of measurable and evaluable lymphoma involvement for at least 4 weeks without occurrence of new manifestations, normalization of blood counts. Participants without evaluation at end of induction/maintenance phase were considered nonresponders.</description>

        <description>DFS data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. DFS was defined for all participants who achieved a complete response (CR/CRu) at month 1 after the completion of treatment of the induction phase (Month 7 of the study) and was measured from the time of CR to the date of relapse. Participants without relapse were censored at their last assessment date. Participants who died due to tumour burden were considered in relapse. Participants who died due to any other causes were censored as of the death date. The reported data refer to values up to 40 months.</description>
