      The purpose of this study is to identify approximately 100 - 150 patients who have received
      Vectibix (Panitumumab) in offices and clinics located in Tennessee, North Carolina, South
      Carolina, and North Georgia from February 2004 - April 2009. Information regarding the
      incidence and severity of hypersensitivity infusion reactions to Vectibix (Panitumumab)will
      be captured. In patients who experienced hypersensitivity reactions, the following
      information will also be collected: premedication, treatment cycle symptoms that were
      experienced during chemotherapy, changes required in subsequent Vectibix (Panitumumab) or
      chemotherapy treatment, and outcome of the hypersensitivity reaction.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  All patients treated with at least one treatment of Vectibix(Panitumumab) from
             February 2004 -April 2009 are eligible for the study. Patients may or may not have had
             an infusion reaction to Vectibix (Panitumumab). Major infusion reactions are defined
             as rapid onset airway obstruction(bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), urticaria,
             erythema, and/or hypotension, anaphylaxis. Minor infusion reactions are defined as
             transient flushing or rash, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever.

          -  Patients who have received treatment with an EGFR in the past are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  There will be no exclusions based on age, sex, medical history, or use of concomitant
             therapies. All charts will be abstracted for the same information, through completion
             of the last chemotherapy cycle.
