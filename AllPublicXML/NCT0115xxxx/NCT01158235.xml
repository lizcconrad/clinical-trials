  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study conducted to evaluate the safety, local tolerability and efficacy of
      LTX-109(Lytixar™), a lytic peptide designed to kill bacterias quickly and efficient. LTX-109
      (Lytixar™)will be applied in the anterior nares in subjects who are carriers of nasal
      colonies of MRSA/MSSA.

      The extent of systemic absorption of LTX -109 when applied to the anterior nares will be
      evaluated and the effect of Lytixar™ as to clear colonies of MRSA/MSSA during the the
      observation period and Week 2 to Week 9 after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with persistent colonies of MRSA/MSSA in the nostril will be recruited to receive
      either active treatment or placebo. This is a dose escalating study. First grout will receive
      either 1% Lytixar™ or placebo, next group 2% Lytixar™ or placebo and finally 5% Lytixar™ or
      placebo. Dose escalation will be performed after a brief safety evaluation of the
      tolerability after application of Lytixar™/placebo vehicle TID for three days.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from subjects who are willing. Subjects will be
      followed until 9 weeks after initiation of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects between the ages of 16 and 75, inclusive.

          -  Female subjects must be non-pregnant, non-lactating.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             child-bearing potential must use an adequate form of diaphragm or condom with
             spermicidal prior to entry into the study and two weeks following the completion of
             all follow-up procedures 9 weeks after treatment. Hormone contraception or hormonal
             IUDs alone are not acceptable contraception

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent by subject.

          -  Subject's medical condition is stable, with no clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  Subject's pre-study laboratory screen of haematology, clinical chemistry and
             urinalysis are normal or if abnormal, not considered clinically significant.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand the subject information and the consent form, and
             be willing to return to the study site for follow up visits, comply with requirements,
             instructions and restrictions of the study listed in the informed consent form.

          -  All family members, to a subject carrying MRSA (not applicable for MSSA positive)
             should also be screened for MRSA. Subjects that are eligible may be included in the
             study, and family members not eligible or willing to participate should be offered
             treatment for decolonization of MRSA according to standard treatment and investigators
             choice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or history of significant hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiac, nervous,
             psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, haematological, or metabolic disorder that
