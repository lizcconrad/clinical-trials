  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Prothromplex Total (Prothrombin Complex Concentrate) in Oral Anticoagulant Reversal</brief_title>

      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Prothromplex Total as a
      treatment for the immediate reversal of oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists
      in patients with acquired deficiency of prothrombin complex coagulation factors (II, VII, IX,
      X). Upon enrolment, subjects will receive Prothromplex Total for the treatment of acute
      bleeding due to oral anticoagulants or for the prevention of excessive bleeding during the
      interventional procedure (Day 1). Additional doses of Prothromplex Total may be administered
      at the discretion of the investigator. Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed
      during a period of 72 (± 4) hours after administration of the last dose of Prothromplex Total
      or until discharge from hospital, whichever occurs first.
