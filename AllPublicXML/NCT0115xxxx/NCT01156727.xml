    <textblock>
      This project added an evaluation/research component to an existing peer outreach program,
      implemented for over 1100 soldiers in the Michigan Army National Guard. The study aims were
      to: 1) evaluate the implementation of the B2B program to inform ongoing program modifications
      and facilitate future dissemination efforts, 2) assess whether the B2B program increases
      mental health and substance use treatment initiation and treatment retention among returning
      National Guard soldiers, and 3) explore whether the B2B program improves mental health
      symptoms, deceases hazardous alcohol use, and improves soldier well-being.

      The study aims were to: 1) evaluate the implementation of the B2B program to inform ongoing
      program modifications and facilitate future dissemination efforts, 2) assess whether the B2B
      program increases mental health and substance use treatment initiation and treatment
      retention among returning National Guard soldiers, and 3) explore whether the B2B program
      improves mental health symptoms, deceases hazardous alcohol use, and improves soldier
      well-being.

      The study had three components which addressed each of the three specific aims. The first
      component assessed B2B implementation using an embedded mixed methods design. This evaluation
      included real-time assessment and adaptation of the program, as well as retrospective
      evaluation of implementation process, sustainability, and potential for spread. The second
      component addressed the impact of B2B on treatment initiation and retention. Preliminary
      analyses were completed using regression analyses. Pending additional data from the DoD, an
      interrupted time series design to assess Michigan National Guard soldiers' VA and non-VA
      services use in multiple time periods before and after the date of B2B implementation will be
      conducted.. The third study component assessed the impact of B2B on MI ARNG soldiers'
      outcomes using longitudinal survey data and adjusting for baseline mental health status using
      data from the Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hazardous alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post deployment</time_frame>
    <description>Hazardous alcohol use was assessed using the AUDIT-C, a 3-item alcohol screen for hazardous drinking and active alcohol use disorders (including alcohol abuse or dependence). In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, and in women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post deployment</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL is a 17-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on the DSM-IV criteria. The PCL-M is a military version and questions refer to &quot;a stressful military experience&quot;. Total possible scores range from 17 to 85. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of PTSD and a cut-off score of 50 is used for indicating a probable diagnosis of combat-related PTSD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post deployment</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory-2nd Edition (BDI-II) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Awareness of B2B Program</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post deployment</time_frame>
    <description>National Guard soldiers were considered to be aware of the B2B program if they endorsed a survey item asking about awareness of the B2B program in the MIARNG. The question was, &quot;I am aware that the MI ARNG has a B2B program,&quot; with response items of &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Yes.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Health service utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post deployment</time_frame>
    <description>National Guard soldiers were considered to have received mental health services if they endorsed any of 14 survey items asking about the receipt of mental health services for a stress, emotional, alcohol, or family problem from either general medical or mental health providers in a variety of settings (military, civilian, VA clinics, or in vet centers) in the last year. The question format used was &quot;In the past, have you received mental health services for a stress, emotional, or family problem from: [specified provider] with response items of &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Yes, in the last year,&quot; or &quot;Yes, but more than a year ago.&quot;</description>
