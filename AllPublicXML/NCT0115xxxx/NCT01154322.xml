      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a pediatric mask in treating
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a pediatric population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition in which there is partial or complete collapse
      of the upper airway during sleep. Features of OSA include snoring to upper airway resistance,
      which could be mild to severe. While OSA has been studied extensively in an adult population,
      research indicates that OSA is prevalent in a pediatric population as well, though the
      options for treatment are not as varied as that for the adult population. The study seeks to
      determine if a mask made for a pediatric population effectively treats their OSA.

    <measure>Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI) Using the New Pediatric Mask (Pixi) Compared to the Child's Currently-used Mask</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline AHI</time_frame>
    <description>Apnea-Hypopnea index (AHI) is an average of the number of apneas and hypopneas that occur over an hour of recorded sleep. AHI quantifies the severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The higher the AHI, the more severe the SDB (mild 5-15, moderate 15-30, severe &gt;30). In clinical practice an AHI &lt;5 demonstrates efficacy of treatment. AHI was recorded during a monitored sleep study on the new Pixi mask, and compared with the AHI from a monitored sleep study on the child's usual mask. The outcome hypothesis was that the Pixi mask AHI would be equivalent or reduced compared to the child's usual mask.</description>

        <description>Apnea-Hypopnea index (AHI) is an average of the number of apneas and hypopneas that occur over an hour of recorded sleep. AHI quantifies the severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The higher the AHI, the more severe the SDB (mild 5-15, moderate 15-30, severe &gt;30). In clinical practice an AHI &lt;5 demonstrates efficacy of treatment. AHI was recorded during a monitored sleep study on the new Pixi mask, and compared with the AHI from a monitored sleep study on the child's usual mask. The outcome hypothesis was that the Pixi mask AHI would be equivalent or reduced compared to the child's usual mask.</description>
