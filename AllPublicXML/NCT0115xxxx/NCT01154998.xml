    <textblock>
      There is a rare condition causing scarring of the lungs termed interstitial lung disease.
      This comprises a group of conditions which can be divided into separate diseases. The aim of
      this study is compare a group of patients (the cases) with 2 types of this disease (fibrotic
      non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)) with
      patients without the disease. The study will look at the 2 groups and their exposures to
      factors such as medications, smoking, previous jobs, previous medical problems and
      specifically heart disease and any operations or procedures involving the heart. There have
      been previous studies showing a link between heart disease and scarring of the lungs. This
      study will look at whether this association is stronger in one or the other type of lung
      scarring diseases.
