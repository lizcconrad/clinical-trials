      Acute poisoning of paraquat which is taken either to commit suicide or by mistake has become
      a social problem in world. The present study was conducted to determine frequencies of
      histo-pathological findings in dead poisoned patients and evaluate their relationships with
      age, gender, dosage of poisoning, time of admission and time of death.
