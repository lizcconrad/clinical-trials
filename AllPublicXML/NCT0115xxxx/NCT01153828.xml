      Retapamulin, a topical pleuromutilin antibiotic, is the first in a new class of topical
      antibiotics approved for human use. In the European Union (EU), retapamulin is approved for
      the treatment of impetigo and secondarily-infected traumatic lesions in persons nine or more
      months of age. This study is designed to examine retapamulin use in the pediatric population
      less than nine months of age. We will conduct a five-year assessment of prescriptions for
      retapamulin using the General Practice Research Database. For each year of reporting, the
      observed frequencies of prescriptions of retapamulin, with or without same-day
      co-prescriptions of topical mupirocin or fusidic acid, will be identified. The five-year
      reporting period will include five years of distinct, non-overlapping, non-cumulative
      prescription use of first exposure to retapamulin, with or without same-day co-prescription
      of topical mupirocin or fusidic acid.

        The GPRD contains detailed information for a sample of patients from representative general
        practices throughout the United Kingdom. Patient data included in the GPRD were drawn from
        the computer systems used by general practitioners to maintain the clinical records within
        their practices and contain all records deemed relevant to patient care. Prescriptions of
        Altabax, Altargo, Mupirocin and Fucidin will be captured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population will consist of all registered &quot;research standard&quot; patients on
             GPRD, as evaluated annually for five years. For each year of observation, the
             denominator of persons will be patients registered for at least one month during the
             prior calendar year. Hence, the five-year reporting period for distinct,
             non-overlapping, non-cumulative prescription use and will categorize persons by date
             of birth (mm/dd/year).

        Exclusion Criteria:
