  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy affects up to 4% of the U.S. population and is most common in young children.
      Milk allergy is the most common cause of food allergy in infants and young children, and
      usually develops in the first year of life. There is no treatment for food allergy and the
      current standard of care for milk-allergic individuals is the avoidance of milk-containing
      products. Research is underway to identify potential therapeutic strategies to reduce or
      eliminate the adverse effects experienced by milk-allergic individuals when they consume
      milk-containing products.

      Several studies have suggested that milk-allergic children who receive milk protein oral
      immunotherapy (OIT) may become desensitized to milk, resulting in short term protection
      against accidental ingestion of milk products. However, these children did not develop
      &quot;tolerance,&quot; which is long term protection even after milk immunotherapy is stopped. A
      potential strategy to induce tolerance to milk uses milk in combination with Xolair®
      (omalizumab). Xolair consists of anti-IgE molecules that attach to IgE, the major antibody
      involved in allergic reactions. The goal of this clinical trial is to see whether Xolair® in
      combination with milk protein OIT is safer and more effective than OIT alone in inducing
      tolerance to milk and milk products. Participants will be administered a double blind,
      placebo controlled milk challenge at various time points in the study. If desensitization is
      achieved participants will be tested for tolerance at a certain time point after stopping
      treatment.

    <description>A milk endpoint titration is a prick skin test using 5 serial 10-fold dilutions of milk which include 1:20 wt/vol, 1:200 wt/vol, 1:2,000 wt/vol, 1:20,000 wt/vol and 1:200,000 wt/vol. The score for each of these dilutions is calculated by subtracting the diameter of the saline control wheal from the diameter of the milk wheal (in millimeters). The area under the curve is calculated by adding together the scores from all 5 milk dilutions creating a composite score.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment took place at three university-based medical centers in the United States (Mount Sinai, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University) beginning in October 2010. Accrual of randomized participants was completed in April 2012 and of untreated controls was completed in August 2012.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Omalizumab/Milk OIT</title>
          <description>Participants receive blinded omalizumab injections every 2 to 4 weeks through Month 16 and unblinded omalizumab injections thereafter until the Month 28 desensitization OFC. Participants ingest milk powder daily starting at Month 4 with a dose of 0.07 mg milk protein and escalate for 22 to 40 weeks until reaching the maintenance dose of 3.84 g milk protein (minimum required maintenance dose is 520 mg milk protein). At Month 28 participants complete a 10g milk OFC and discontinue omalizumab injections. If they fail the OFC they permanently discontinue ingestion of the milk powder; if they pass the OFC they continue ingestion of the maintenance dose of milk powder through Month 30 and then discontinue it.</description>

This score is a combination of three scores that range from 0 to 3 in the following areas: body surface area score, disease course, and disease intensity. Note: These data were only available for 12 of the 20 Untreated Control participants.</description>

        <description>A milk endpoint titration is a prick skin test using 5 serial 10-fold dilutions of milk which include 1:20 wt/vol, 1:200 wt/vol, 1:2,000 wt/vol, 1:20,000 wt/vol and 1:200,000 wt/vol. The score for each of these dilutions is calculated by subtracting the diameter of the saline control wheal from the diameter of the milk wheal (in millimeters). The area under the curve is calculated by adding together the scores from all 5 milk dilutions creating a composite score.</description>

        <title>Change in Percent of Cells Positive for Cluster of Differentiation 63 (CD63) at Month 32 in Basophils Stimulated by Milk</title>
        <description>Basophil cells isolated from blood using flow cytometry were stimulated with 5 different levels of milk and the percent of basophil cells that were CD63 positive was measured. The value for each participant obtained at Month 32 was subtracted from the value for that participant at baseline. The 5 different levels of milk stimulant were: 10 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL , 0.1 µg/mL , 0.01 µg/mL , and 0.001 µg/mL. Month 32 was the last visit on treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants receive blinded omalizumab injections every 2 to 4 weeks through Month 16 and unblinded omalizumab injections thereafter until the Month 28 desensitization OFC. Participants ingest milk powder daily starting at Month 4 with a dose of 0.07 mg milk protein and escalate for 22 to 40 weeks until reaching the maintenance dose of 3.84 g milk protein (minimum required maintenance dose is 520 mg milk protein). At Month 28 participants complete a 10g milk OFC and discontinue omalizumab injections. If they fail the OFC they permanently discontinue ingestion of the milk powder; if they pass the OFC they continue ingestion of the maintenance dose of milk powder through Month 30 and then discontinue it.</description>
