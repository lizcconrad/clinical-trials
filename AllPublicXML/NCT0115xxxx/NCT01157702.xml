        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 to 59 years of age, inclusive, at the time of screening (for Stratum A
             only)

          -  Subject is 60 years of age or older, inclusive, at the time of screening (for Stratum
             B only)

          -  Subject has given written informed consent prior to study entry

          -  Subject is generally healthy, as determined by the investigator's clinical judgment
             through collection of medical history and performance of a physical examination, such
             that the investigator would not hesitate to provide routine influenza immunization to
             the subject in the course of routine medical practice

          -  Subject agrees to keep a daily record of symptoms for the duration of the study

          -  If subject is of childbearing potential, subject presents with a negative urine
             pregnancy test, and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration
             of the study

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis

          -  Subject has an oral temperature of &gt;= 37.5°C on the day of vaccination in this study.

          -  Subject has a rash or dermatologic condition or tattoos, which may interfere with
             injection site reaction rating

          -  Subject has received a live vaccine within 4 weeks or an inactivated or subunit
             vaccine within 2 weeks of study entry

          -  Subject has received a seasonal influenza vaccine within 6 months of study entry

          -  Subject currently has or had a history of a significant neurological, cardiovascular,

          -  Subject has a disease or is currently undergoing a form of treatment or was undergoing
             a form of treatment within 30 days prior to study entry that can be expected to
             influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or
             high dose inhaled (&gt;800 µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs.

          -  Subject has a functional or surgical asplenia

          -  Subject has a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Subject is a member of the team conducting this study or is in a dependent
             relationship with one of the study team members. Dependent relationships include close
             relatives (i.e., children, partner/spouse, siblings, parents) as well as employees of
             the investigator or site personnel conducting the study.

             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study
