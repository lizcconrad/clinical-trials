      This single arm, open label study will assess the safety profile of Avastin (bevacizumab) in
      combination with paclitaxel as first-line treatment in patients with locally recurrent or
      metastatic Her2-negative breast cancer. Patients will receive Avastin, either 10 mg/kg
      intravenously (iv) every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks. Correspondingly, paclitaxel
      will be administered at a dose of 90 mg/m2 o days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle or 175
      mg/m2 on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
