  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal development of sustainable health systems must use locally relevant infrastructure.
      Mobile phone technology, driven primarily by local market forces rather than foreign
      assistance, is spreading rapidly through African communities to improve people's personal and
      business communications. Here, the investigators propose using a structured mobile phone
      communications system for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). The
      system is designed to improve antenatal linkage to care, provide reminders to take PMTCT
      medications, and improve post-natal support and follow-up, even when mothers deliver at home.
      In addition to benefits in PMTCT related outcomes, this model allows evaluation of the
      intervention in a public health setting with the ultimate goal of advancing regional health
      systems development. The overall goal of of the study is to assess if mobile phones and SMS
      text messages can be used to help improve prevention of maternal to child transmission
      (PMTCT) of HIV services by strengthening health systems.

      Specific objectives are:

      1. To determine if mobile phone SMS text messages can demonstrate an improvement in
      compliance with a known intervention ( use of nevirapine) for PMTCT, demonstrated by:

      1a) improved antenatal care attendance (greater than 4 visits)

      1b) increased usage of nevirapine in labour (from 60% to at least 70%)

      1c) earlier identification and treatment of HIV positive infants

      1d) increased postpartum care for HIV positive mothers

      1e) acceptability of cell phone SMS text messages transmission of information among HIV
      positive women

      2. To demonstrate that mobile phone technology can be used as an effective tool to strengthen
      PMTCT health information systems at the facility level by: 2a) determining factors that
      constrain or promote the use of cell phone technology to strengthen PMTCT health information
      systems from the perspective of patients, health care providers and policy makers 2b)
      determining how cell phones can be used as a tool to generate equity statistics for PMTCT
      programs and formulate equity orientated PMTCT policies 2c) determine if early involvement of
      policy makers in the study improves knowledge translation

    <description>At enrollment a study nurse will send the intervention group a weekly SMS message reminding them to attend antenatal care. Starting at 36 weeks gestational age, an automated bulk SMS management system, will send the intervention group 3 SMS text messages (using non descript slogans) each week by proxy reminding them to take their nevirapine in labor. From time of delivery to 6 weeks postpartum the women will aslo receive 3 SMS messages per week reminding them to attend their 6 week checkup and 6 week infant visit.Upon receiving these messages women in the intervention group can text back if they have any concerns or questions. These women would then receive phone calls from the study nurse triaged according to the women's needs.</description>
