      Hypothesis:

      To know the utility of manual lymph drainage (MLD) as part of the Physical Complex Therapy
      has turn out relevant because of the exclusive dedication that it supposes to the therapist.
      To date, the evidence-base for MLD is very limited and only two studies analyze its
      relevance. The first study measured the effect of compression bandage with or without MLD.
      The group receiving compression and MLD had a significant reduction in limb volume and
      decreased pain, despite the fact the MLD was given only for one week (Johansson et al.,
      1999). A further study investigated the effect of eight sessions of MLD over two weeks in 42
      women with breast cancer-related lymphoedema, and the findings suggested that MLD do not
      contribute significantly to oedema reduction, although the MLD course was relatively short
      and the study group was limited to those with mild to moderate swelling (20-30 % of
      difference). Information about the quality of life, using the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30 was
      gathered but the results were not considered in the final assessment (Andersen and Cabbage
      2000).

      Similar studies would provide comparative and enlightening information with regard to the
      previous results. The investigators could determine if the MLD, in spite of not obtaining an
      improvement in the volume of the lymphoedema, provides a benefit in the reduction of the
      symptoms related to it.

      The investigators hypothesized that MLD does not contribute significantly in volume limb
      reduction but it provides a clinical improvement regarding the quality of life according to
      the questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30.

      For the calculation of the sample size the investigators depart from the following
      assumptions:

      The effect of the standard treatment on the control group control will produce an average
      volume limb reduction of 5 %.

      The effect of the treatment in the experimental group will be an average of the 25 % (a minor
      difference of effects would indicate a discreet effect of the tested treatment). The
      investigators also assume that, the standard deviation will be similar in both groups and
      near to 25 %. With this information and for an alpha risk of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 the
      calculation of the sample size is 20 patients in every group. Considering a rate of
      withdrawal of 30 % in every group, the appropriate sample size is 58 patients assigned in two
      groups of 29 patients.

      Main aim:

      To analyze the effectiveness of Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) in the treatment of
      postmastectomy lymphoedema in order to reduce the volume of lymphoedema

      Secondary aims:

      To analyze the duration of the reduction of the lymphoedema in the time. To analyze the
      improvement in the concomitant symptomatology of the lymphoedema using the results of two
      quality of life tests validated in Spanish: EORTC QLQ-C30 version 2.0, for the cancer in
      general and EORTC QLQ-BR23 specifically for the breast cancer. In particular, the items
      refering to the upper extremity (47, 48, 49) and to the corporal image (39, 40, 41, 42) and
      in which the higher the score the worse the result.

      Methodology:

      Researching Project with methodology of randomized, controlled clinical trial. Group A or
      Control: patients with standard treatment (care the skin, exercise and measures of
      compression -bandage for one month and later a sleeve of compression).

      Group B or Experimental: patients with standard treatment (care of the skin, exercise and
      measures of compression (bandage for one month and later a sleeve for lymphoedema) and in
      addition they receive Manual Lymph Drainage Main variable: Volume reduction of the affected
      arm after the treatment expressed in percentage.

      Number of patients: 58 women.

    <description>All the patients included in the study will be analyzed and all the analyses will be performed for &quot; intention of treating &quot; except that related to the withdrawal of the treatment that will be done by protocol.
Firstly an analysis of comparability of the groups using the test of the T de Student or Mann-Withney's Test and test of Fischer´s exact test will be performed. Efficacy analysis:means differences and / or reason of medians for the quantitative variables and reason of risks and NNT for the quantitative variables.</description>

    <description>Ambulatory treatment is performed during one month. Specific exercises and prevention measures are taught. Multilayer bandage is applied daily during the first four weeks.
The tailor-made sleeve for lymphedema with gauntlet without protection at the edges and with extension to the shoulder is placed from the first four weeks of treatment. The sleeve is used during the whole day and a night interruption is allowed. Later the patient will continue domiciliary treatment realizing specific exercises for 30 minutes twice a day without fatigue carrying the lymphedema sleeve for at least 12 hours.
If after three months of treatment a good response is not obtained an ambulatory treatment will be introduced again for one month,and this time the treatment corresponding to the group B or experimental will be applied.</description>
