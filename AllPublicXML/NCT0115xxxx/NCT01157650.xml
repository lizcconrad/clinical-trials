      Primary outcome measure:

      Evaluation of viability, security and tolerance of the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      implant (ASCs) in fistulizing Crohn's disease patients, collecting the reactions and adverse
      events occurred during the study.

      Secondary outcome measures:

        1. Evaluating the Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells therapeutic effect, in particular:

             -  Fistulas healing efficiency

             -  Changes in quality of life in patients treated

             -  Changes of systemic Crohn's disease after implant

             -  Relapse rate monitored among patients who achieved Adipose-derived mesenchymal Stem
                Cells treatment success.

        2. Achieving the biological characterization of the cell product used and its correlation
           with the therapeutic effect measured with:

             -  Phenotype study

             -  Suppressor capacity study.

             -  Citoquines production analysis

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Autologous Mesechymal Stem Cells derived
      from adipose tissue in the treatment of fistulous Crohn disease.

      15 Crohn's disease patients with one or more enterocutaneous, recto-vaginal or complex
      perianal fistula, will be included.

      The trial is divided in three phases:

      I. - Selection: Patients evaluation for study eligibility will take place within two weeks
      after Informed Consent signature.

      Fistulous disease will be evaluated by MRI for perianal and rectovaginal fistulas, and by CT
      scan in the case of enterocutaneous fistula.

      Previous laboratory test and radiological studies are valid for evaluation if they were
      obtained within two and six months, respectively, prior to this evaluation, and in the
      absence of clinical changes.

      II.- Treatment phase includes:

        1. Liposuction procedure to obtain adipose tissue.

        2. Processing and production of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells from adipose tissue
           (ASCs)

        3. ASCs implant

      III.- Follow up: Study visits post-implant will take place at the 1st week (+/- 3 days), 4th
      week (+/- 3 days), 8th week (+/- 7 days), 12nd week (+/- 7 days), 24th week (+/- 7 days), and
      1 year (+/- 7 days) after implant.
