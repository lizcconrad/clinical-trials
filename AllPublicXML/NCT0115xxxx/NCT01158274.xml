    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 when
      given together with capecitabine in treating patients with refractory solid tumors. RO4929097
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving RO4929097 together with
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097 and capecitabine administered
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors. (Part 1) II. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) of combined RO492097 and capecitabine. (Part 1) III. To determine the safety of
      RO4929097 and capecitabine administered in combination. (Part 1) IV. To determine the safety
      of RO4929097 and capecitabine in subjects with metastatic CRC. (Part 2a) V. To evaluate the
      safety of RO4929097 and capecitabine in combination for subjects with HER2/neu negative MBC.
      (Part 2b)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of RO4929097 and capecitabine administered in
      combination to subjects with advanced solid tumors. (Parts 1, 2a, and 2b) II. To evaluate the
      changes in the expression of Notch1 signaling pathway members and downstream targets of Notch
      by PCR including HEs1, 3 and 5; Hey 1 and 2 after treatment with RO4929097 at the MTD

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and
      15-17 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo tumor biopsy before and after treatment for biomarker analysis and blood
      sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days (Part 1) or every 3
      months (Parts 2a and 2b).

             her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study
             participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately

                  contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding

               -  Women who have had tubal ligation

          -  Female patients may be considered NOT to be of childbearing potential for the
             following reasons:

               -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

               -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24
                  consecutive months

               -  Pre-pubertal females. The parent or guardian of young female patients who have
                  not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun. If a
                  young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be
                  considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward

          -  Patients must demonstrate an ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
             written informed consent document

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;
             if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be
             ineligible to participate in this study

          -  PART 2A (MTD EXPANSION COLORECTAL CANCER):

             fluorescence in-site hybridization (FISH) ratio must be less than 2 to be considered
             NOT amplified; any tumor for which only FISH was performed must have a ratio of less
             than 2 to be considered NOT amplified

          -  All 5 patients in this breast cancer cohort must be willing and able to have tumor
             biopsies performed as part of the correlative studies associated with this trial
