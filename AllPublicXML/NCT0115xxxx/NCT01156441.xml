  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot prospective randomized trial is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of
      enrolling patients to surgically correct residual Mitral Regurgitation (MR) following
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) for Myocardial Infarction (MI) verses ongoing
      medical management of MR. The investigators hypothesize that if moderate MR is corrected in
      this patient subset, the patients will have improved outcomes as measured by decreased number
      of major adverse cardiac events, including death, congestive heart failure requiring
      hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, deterioration of New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      functional status and improved quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent complication of myocardial infarction. Ischemic MR
      portends a poor prognosis on long term follow up. This pilot prospective randomized trial is
      a safety and feasibility trial to evaluate mitral valve repair versus surgical management in
      patients with residual MR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients
      will be screened for possible inclusion to identify those that have first MI treated with
      primary PCI. Patients with moderate MR at 6 or more weeks following first primary PCI will be
      randomized to continued medical management versus surgical mitral valve repair. Patients with
      previous or subsequent coronary artery bypass surgery and patients with severe ventricular
      dysfunction will be excluded. Patients will be followed for one year from the time of
      randomization. The safety and feasibility data will be used to design a large trial powered
      to detect a difference in mortality between treatment arms.

      Results of this study could lead to a radical change in the treatment paradigm for patients
      with ischemic MR following PCI for acute MI. In addition, insight gained from this study
      could advance our understanding of the interrelationship between LV remodeling and MR and
      shed some light into the mechanism of ventricular function deterioration following MI.
      Moreover, it may provide a framework for the development of further recommendations with
      respect to the indications for surgical intervention in this patient population.

    <description>Patient survival will be prospectively documented for all study subjects from recruitment through one year. A stopping rule for the surgical arm is a pre-specified cut-off of 5% based on the method proposed by Kramar and Bascoul-Mollevi in &quot;Early Stopping Rules in Clinical Trials Based on Sequential Monitoring of Serious Adverse Events&quot; [39]. A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) that includes five independent investigators and a statistician has been established to conduct ongoing study review to maintain safety of all participants.</description>

    <description>Mitral valve repair will be performed via median sternotomy, utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia. The mitral valve will be approached through a left atrial incision. Following inspection of the valve, mitral valve annuloplasty will be accomplished with a complete semi-rigid annuloplasty ring. Additional techniques to address residual regurgitation will be at the discretion of the surgeon. The left atriotomy will then be closed and the patient weaned off and separated from the cardiopulmonary bypass.
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography will be performed on all study volunteers.</description>
