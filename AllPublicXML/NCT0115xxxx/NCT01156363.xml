    <textblock>
      This open label, single arm study will assess the efficacy for long-term maintenance of
      haemoglobin levels and the safety and tolerability of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin
      beta [Mircera] in dialysis patients with chronic renal anaemia. Patients on regular long-term
      haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will receive monthly subcutaneous or intravenous Mircera
      for 6 months. Target sample size is &lt;200 patients.
