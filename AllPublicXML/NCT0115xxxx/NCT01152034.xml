  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop the MAPS(M,Monitoring;A,Assessing;P,Preventing or Reducing
      Relapse;S,Smart goal setting) group therapy model for bipolar disorder patients as other
      adjuvant clinical treatment and develop the instruments for evaluating the severity of
      bipolar symptoms. The investigators insist to provide the psychosocial intervention for
      bipolar patients in the general hospital and offer appropriative adjuvant intervention except
      current psychiatric biological treatment.

      This study is a one-year project. First, the investigators like to translate the Depression,
      Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and the Altman Self-Rating Scale for Mania (ASRM) to Chinese
      and finish the reliability and validity study. Second, the investigators would like to
      develop the MAPS group therapy to enhance bipolar patients' insight, increased life quality
      and decrease suicidal ideation. This study is a case control study. All cases recruit from
      the psychiatric outpatient department of one medical center. The inclusion criteria are
      diagnosed as bipolar disorder, age from 18 to 65 and agree to sign the inform consent. The
      excluded criteria are hard to communicate, with acute psychiatric feature and severe physical
      illness. The investigators plan to hold the MAPS group three times and predetermine to
      recruit totally 30 patients as the case group. As to the control group, the investigators
      also recruit from the psychiatric outpatient department and those who treat as usual by
      control their gender, age and the same diagnosis as bipolar disorder. The only one different
      factor between the case group and the control group was attending the MAPS group therapy or
      not. In MAPS group therapy, two facilitators work with ten clients with twelve weekly
      sessions and three monthly booster sessions. Self-report rating scales (DASS and ASRM) are
      completed at the beginning of each session. The investigators use DASS and ASRM to evaluate
      the severity of bipolar symptoms; BSS for suicidal ideation; SF-36 for life quality. The
      hypothesis is &quot;patients attended to MAPS group therapy have better symptoms control, lower
      suicidal ideation, better life quality and less use emergency department or admissions than
      those who didn't attend the group therapy&quot;.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main outcome measures are time to recurrence a new acute bipolar episode</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the time (days) elapsed between baseline and the emergence of a new acute episode according to DSM-IV criteria and scores above or equal to 20 on the YMRS for manic recurrence; above or equal to 12 for hypomanic recurrence; above or equal to 17 on the HRSD-17 for depressive recurrence; and above or equal to 20 on the YMRS and 12 on the HRSD-17 for mixed recurrence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of recurrences</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of recurrences, separating for type of episode (manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive) will also be recorded as a secondary outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time spent ill</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary outcome measure is time spent ill. The investigators obtain this data by prospectively registering the number of days that a participant fulfilled criteria for a specific episode.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychiatric outpatient adherence and drug compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The medication compliance questionnaire reported compliance with any prescribed mood stablizers.(Lam DH, et al. 2000, 2005) Respondents had a choice of noting whether the patient in the past month had (1) never missed taking their medication, (2) missed taking it once or twice, (3) missed taking it between three to seven times, (4) missed taking it more than seven times, or (5) stopped taking it altogether.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers and time of emergency use and hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of hospitalizations, reasons for admission and total number of days that the participant remained hospitalized will also be recorded during follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal ideation and number of suicidal attempt</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of Scale for Suicide Ideation had been translated and the excellent psychometric properties for measuring suicidal ideation in Chinese populations were done (Zhang and Brown, 2007). The BSS and the suicidal attempts will be re-assessed every 3 months or whenever a new episode was suspected by the psychiatrist in charge of the participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The life quality of bipolar patients</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months for up to 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This SF-36 Taiwan standard version was developed in 1996 following the protocol by the International Quality of Life Assessment (IQOLA) Project. The protocol includes forward and backward translation, focus group discussion, pilot testing, and extensive psychometric analysis of the translation. (Fuh JL et al, 2000; Chang DF,et al, 2000).The SF-36 Taiwan standard version will be also repeated every 3 months or whenever a new episode was suspected by the psychiatrist in charge of the participant.</description>

    <description>This program consists of 15 sessions of closed group, with each session lasting 120 minutes, each aims at improving four main issues: illness awareness, early detection of prodromal symptoms and recurrences, treatment adherence, and lifestyle regularity. The program will be in groups of 6-12, conducted by two experienced therapists. The structure of each session consists of 30-40 minutes talk on the topic of the day, followed by an exercise related to the issue and a discussion.</description>
