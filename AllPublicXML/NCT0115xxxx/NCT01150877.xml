  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effect and the safety of
      high-dose vitamin D supplementation in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. We propose to
      supplement metastatic (stage 4) colorectal cancer patients with oral doses of vitamin D to
      raise serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels to the high normal range of 200-250 nmol/L.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the metabolic consequences, including
      tolerability and toxicity, of prolonged, high-dose physiological vitamin D in patients with
      colorectal cancer. The secondary objective is to evaluate patient survival with regards to
      high-dose vitamin D supplementation.

      Hypothesis:

      Whereas low doses of vitamin D reportedly play a significant role in prevention of colorectal
      cancers, do much larger (pharmacological) doses of vitamin D have a significant therapeutic
      effect against the same kind of cancer?

    <textblock>
      Metastatic (stage 4) colorectal cancer patients who were randomly assigned to the treatment
      arm of this study will be orally supplemented with high doses of vitamin D to achieve serum
      25(OH)D concentrations of 200-250 nmol/L (80-100 ng/ml). Therefore, the supplementation
      dosage is not pre-set but will be determined on an individual basis. Vitamin D
      supplementation will be continued for 16 months, followed by a 12 month follow up period.
      Monthly monitoring of serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels will assure the safety of our
      treatment protocol. Subjects in the control arm of the study will be receiving standard
      cancer care at InspireHealth that includes supplementation with at least 2,000 International
      Units of vitamin D.

    <description>We propose to study high-dose, oral vitamin D supplementation, raising serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations to 200 -250 nmol/L, in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with safety, tolerability and survival as the main outcome measurements. The dose is not pre-set and will depend on the individual subjects' serum 25(OH)D concentration. Subjects will be supplemented for 16 months with a daily oral dose, followed by a 12 months follow-up period.</description>
