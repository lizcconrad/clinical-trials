      The survey will be conducted with regard to the following aspects of treatment with Humira
      (adalimumab) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis receiving this drug:

        -  unknown adverse drug reactions, especially clinically significant adverse reactions

        -  incidence and conditions of occurrence of adverse reactions in the clinical setting

        -  factors that may affect the safety and effectiveness of Humira.

      This study was non-interventional, open-labeled, all-cases, central registration method, post
      marketing observational study in which Humira was prescribed for patients with psoriasis
      vulgaris and/or psoriatic arthritis in routine medical practice.

      When investigators prescribed Humira to an eligible patient who provided informed consent,
      they filled out a registration form and send it to the registration center via postal mail.
      At the end of the 24-week observation period, an investigator filled out a case report form
      for each patient to describe the findings during the study period, and provided the completed
      form to medical representatives. Even if Humira treatment was for any reason discontinued,
      the investigators followed each such participant for 24 weeks after the first administration
      of Humira, and filled out a case report form for the participant at the end of the 24-week
      period.

      Some participants entered this study from study NCT00647400 (M04-702), a Phase III extension
      study of Humira (adalimumab) in Japan.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADRs), Deaths, and Discontinuations Due to AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>From study registration through Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This study was mandated by the Japanese government as an approval condition for Humira in Japan; therefore, definitions of adverse events and seriousness criteria were applicable as specified in the Japanese local standard operating procedures, based on local Japanese regulations. ADRs were defined as adverse events for which the causal relationship with Humira was other than &quot;not related&quot; (ie, &quot;probable,&quot; &quot;possible,&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot;). The count of participants with AEs presented in this table includes serious and nonserious AEs. The count of participants with discontinuations due to AEs includes those who discontinued due to an AE plus other reasons. Please see Safety section for further details regarding adverse events.</description>

          <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each question are: very much (score of 3), a lot, a little, or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. DLQI was assessed at baseline in 280 participants.</description>

          <title>Disease Activity Score 28-4, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-4 [ESR])</title>
          <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) is calculated using the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28 counted), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the patient's global assessment of disease activity via the visual analog scale (VAS). The calculated range of DAS28-4 is 0.49 to 9.07. A DAS28-4 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission, DAS28-4 2.6 to 3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28-4 3.2 to less than 5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, and DAS28-4 of 5.1 or greater indicates high disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) was assessed at baseline in 94 participants with psoriatic arthritis.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADRs), Deaths, and Discontinuations Due to AEs</title>
        <description>This study was mandated by the Japanese government as an approval condition for Humira in Japan; therefore, definitions of adverse events and seriousness criteria were applicable as specified in the Japanese local standard operating procedures, based on local Japanese regulations. ADRs were defined as adverse events for which the causal relationship with Humira was other than “not related” (ie, “probable,” “possible,” or “unclear”). The count of participants with AEs presented in this table includes serious and nonserious AEs. The count of participants with discontinuations due to AEs includes those who discontinued due to an AE plus other reasons.

        <description>The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the physician's evaluation of the participant. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 / Clear (plaque elevation=none, scaling=none, erythema=hyperpigmentation, pigmented macules, diffuse faint pink or red coloration);
1 / Minimal (plaque elevation=possible but difficult to ascertain whether there is a slight elevation above normal skin, scaling=surface dryness with some white coloration, erythema=up to moderate);
2 / Mild (plaque elevation=slight, scaling=fine, erythema=up to moderate);
3 / Moderate (plaque elevation=moderate, scaling=coarser, erythema=moderate);

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score is a participant-reported outcome consisting of a set of 10 questions regarding the degree to which the participant's skin has affected certain behaviors and quality of life over the last week. Responses to each are: very much (score of 3), a lot (score of 2), a little (score of 1), or not at all (score of 0). The DLQI score ranges from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Score 28-4, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-4 [ESR]) at Week 16</title>
        <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) is calculated using the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28 counted), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the patient's global assessment of disease activity via the visual analog scale (VAS). The calculated range of DAS28-4 is 0 to 10. A score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission, a score of 2.6 to 3.2 indicates low disease activity, a score of 3.2 to less than 5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, and a score of 5.1 or greater indicates high disease activity.</description>
