  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of the recombinant gonadotrophins, the use of human source proteins for
      the production of hormones has become unnecessary. These proteins, which are found in urinary
      preparations, have been thought to cause the local, post-injection adverse events (AEs) in
      some subjects.

      There has been a demand by physicians for an alternative to urinary products for treatment.
      Due to allergies to urinary products, or other personal reasons, subjects were not able or
      willing to be treated with proteins of human origin. This study allowed subjects to be
      treated with the recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r hCG) (free of urinary proteins),
      which otherwise would not be possible. The study sponsor used this opportunity to collect
      additional safety data on the new recombinant product, (Ovidrel, r-hCG).

      Approximately one in ten couples of reproductive age experiences infertility. Infertility may
      be caused by problems in men, in women or in both. A number of techniques can be used
      depending on the duration and type of infertility problems. The treatment of ovulation
      induction (OI) uses the help of exogenous gonadotrophins such as follicle stimulating hormone
      (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and hCG in order to stimulate follicles and release oocytes
      for fertilization in the fallopian tubes.

      Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), including in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and intra-
      cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), increases the chances of success to obtain more than one
      embryo. In order to obtain more than one embryo, it is necessary to stimulate the growth and
      maturation of several follicles. Such a multiple follicular development is obtained by daily
      administration of a follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, Gonal-F). When these follicles have
      reached a large enough size, the role of hCG is to achieve final oocyte maturation and
      initiation of follicular luteinization.

      Serono International S.A. has developed a pharmaceutical preparation of human chorionic
      gonadotrophin (hCG) for clinical use through the application of recombinant DNA technology.
      The resulting product is choriogonadotrophin alpha, a pure recombinant human chorionic
      gonadotrophin (r-hCG). The corresponding drug product is marketed under the tradename
      Ovidrel. Ovidrel (choriogonadotrophin alpha for injection) has been approved in the United
      States, in the European Union and Australia.

      OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to collect safety information in order to confirm
      the already known profile of r- hCG (Ovidrel).
