  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been an increase in ambulatory surgical procedures performed across Canada;
      ambulatory procedures account for almost 70% of all surgeries. Postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) and pain are the most frequently reported adverse events by patients prior to
      discharge after ambulatory surgery. The incidence can be as high as 70 to 80% in high-risk
      patients.

      PONV is a cause of morbidity particularly in gynecological procedures and the incidence of
      patients experiencing PONV is as high as 58-75%. Apart from delayed recovery, the occurrence
      of PONV has been linked to gastric aspiration, psychological distress and wound dehiscence.
      The occurrence of PONV delays patient discharge and further more is a leading cause of
      unexpected admission after ambulatory anesthesia

      Promethazine, is an antiemetic medication that has been widely used over the last 50 years,
      and although effective at reducing PONV, it tends to cause sedation. In this study, we are
      trying to determine if a smaller dose of promethazine, in addition to the standard treatment
      for post-surgical nausea and vomiting, will be more beneficial than the standard treatment on
      its own.

      It is hypothesized that the use of low dose promethazine (3 mg) as part of a multimodal
      antiemetic regimen will be efficacious in preventing PONV without the sedative effects of
      promethazine.
