    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that up to 150 mg of sertraline and up to 3 mg of telenzepine
      will be safe, tolerable, and have the effect of suppressing appetite, when taken in
      combination daily by mouth by healthy, overweight, adult men and women.

      In this study, up to 12 people will be assigned to one of 4 groups: A, B, C, and D, and will
      receive 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg of sertraline per day. People in Groups B, C, or D will receive
      an initial dose of 50 mg sertraline. People in Groups C and D will receive an additional 50
      mg of sertraline per week.

      Up to 10 people from each group who were able to tolerate their sertraline dose for at least
      5 days will begin taking 50 mg of sertraline plus doses of telenzepine that will increase
      from 1 mg to 2 mg to 3 mg over a 7-day period (they will receive each combination). On the
      day before they begin taking this combination of drugs, their appetite will be evaluated (on
      a visual scale of 0 to 100) before and after 3 meals.

      The appetites of each person, assessed by the visual scale, will be evaluated on the last day
      of the period (Day 7) before and after 3 meals of each combination treatment, while they are
      staying in the research unit. The amount of food they eat will be determined.

      Based on safety and tolerability assessments of individuals, and of the previous groups who
      received lower doses of the combination of drug, a decision will be made whether to further
      increase the dose of these drugs.

      Since the appetites of each person will be evaluated on the last day of the period (Day 7)
      before and after 3 meals of each combination treatment, people in this study will stay in the
      research unit for approximately 2½ days, starting on Day 6 of their previous treatment, so
      appetite evaluations can be made on Day 7 after a fixed meal in the evening of Day 6. These
      people will continue the stay in the research unit when they begin each telenzepine dose
      increase, so a 24 hour safety observation may be made immediately after the increase.

      After the final doses of telenzepine have been received, people in Groups C and D will
      continue to receive sertraline 50 mg per day for an additional 7 days or until the study
      physician decides when sertraline should be discontinued. People will return to the study
      unit for final visit, 2 weeks after they have received their last sertraline dose.

    <measure>Changes in the VAS Score From Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline was defined on day 7 of sertraline treatment with no telenzepine before and meal. Appetite VAS was measured 30 min before and 1hour after to meal</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline VAS self-assessment was completed for each subject on day 7 of each dose combination. Appetite VAS was completed in the subject's room approximately 30 min before and 1 h after each meal serving. Appetite was not assessed prior to snacks. VAS assessment was based on response to the question: &quot;How hungry are you now?&quot; The anchor points of the 100mm scale were &quot;I am not hungry at all&quot; and &quot;Never more hungry&quot; corresponding to 0 mm and 100 mm respectively. The subjects' VAS scores were measured by the clinic staff and entered into the CRF. The description listed below (VAS after meal minus and VAS before meal) refers only to the mean VAS score of each group.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Meal Calories Consumed</measure>
    <time_frame>The baseline was defined as on day 7 of sertraline treatment with no telenzepine. Food consumption was measured as calories consumed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for all treatment groups on day 7 of each dose combination.</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in the meal calories consumed was measured upon telenzepine treatment at the dose of 1 mg, 2 mg and 3 mg (i.e. end of every 7 days). The baseline was defined as on day 7 of sertraline treatment with no telenzepine for the specified meal. Food consumption was measured as calories consumed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for all treatment groups on day 7 of each dose combination.</description>

        <description>The baseline VAS self-assessment was completed for each subject on day 7 of each dose combination. Appetite VAS was completed in the subject’s room approximately 30 min before and 1 h after each meal serving. Appetite was not assessed prior to snacks. VAS assessment was based on response to the question: “How hungry are you now?” The anchor points of the 100mm scale were “I am not hungry at all” and “Never more hungry” corresponding to 0 mm and 100 mm respectively. The subjects’ VAS scores were measured by the clinic staff and entered into the CRF. The description listed below (VAS after meal minus and VAS before meal) refers only to the mean VAS score of each group.</description>
