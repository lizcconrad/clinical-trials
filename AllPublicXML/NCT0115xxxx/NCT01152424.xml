  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is diagnosed by cell count analysis of bronchoalveolar
      lavage fluid. However, the performance of bronchoscopy is not easy for patients with AEP,
      because they usually have hypoxia. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is usually elevated in the
      patients with eosinophilic inflammation such as asthma, but there is no previous studies FeNO
      in the patients with AEP. Investigators hypothesized that FeNO elevated significantly in
      patients with AEP, and FeNO can be used as non-invasive diagnostic method in patients who are
      clinically suspected with AEP, especially when the performance of bronchoscopy is difficult.
