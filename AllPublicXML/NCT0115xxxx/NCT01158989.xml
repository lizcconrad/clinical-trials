  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a video camera pill
      (PillCam) in assessing intestinal function in the small intestines of patients. It is
      believed that the condition of the subjects digestive system can have a large impact on their
      overall physical health. Therefore, the investigators would like to assess whether using the
      pill device helps to determine any functional problems in patients in the ICU. The
      investigators are studying ICU patients because any change in their condition can have a
      large impact on their recovery. The same device will be used in healthy subjects scheduled
      for elective ambulatory surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>small bowel transit times</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Small bowel transit time was calculated by measuring the difference between the start-time (i.e., placement of the capsule in the duodenum) and end-time (i.e., capsule enters the cecum). Examination of the differences between subsequent images indicates the amount of capsule movement and is proportional to the instant velocity (&quot;motility&quot;) of the capsule</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>visualization</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the visualization was determined using a three-step scale: Grade 0: intraluminal fluid disturbed visualization and significantly impaired interpretation: grade 1: intraluminal fluid present but did not impair visualization or interpretation; grade 2: no intraluminal fluid, excellent visualization</description>

    <description>Within four days of hospital admission, qualifying critically ill patients were assigned to the study and received a gastro-jejunal tube and one PillCam video telemetry capsule (Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam, Israel). In each critical care patient, placement of the video capsule was coupled with the placement of the medically necessary feeding tube. A flexible endoscope was inserted into the patient's mouth, and then advanced into the esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestine. The capsule was placed into a capsule delivery device and released into the distal duodenum after it had passed beyond the sight of the scope; a wire was placed to facilitate passage of the feeding tube. An abdominal X-ray was obtained to confirm feeding tube tip placement.</description>
