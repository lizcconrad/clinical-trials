      Purpose and design: The relationship between psychological morbidity and asthma has been
      previously recognised, however there is little evidence regarding the link between poor
      mental health and asthma control in people with severe asthma. If evidence was available
      showing that identifying and treating depression, resulted in meaningful improvements in
      people's asthma symptoms, this would be helpful in changing doctors' approach to people with
      severe asthma, ensuring that both physical and mental wellbeing were considered.

      This study will be a double blind randomised placebo controlled pilot study which aims to
      identify; if treating depression in patients with well characterised refractory asthma
      improves depression and asthma control. Forty patients who meet the inclusion criteria will
      be randomised to either a placebo or anti-depressant medication group, neither the
      participant nor the researcher will be aware of which medication they are given. Patients
      recruited will have severe asthma; will be identified as having depression using two
      validated questionnaires and will agree to take part and to take anti-depressant medication.
      Patients with poor adherence to medication, other respiratory conditions and who have had
      anti-depressant medication in previous the 6 months will be excluded. Outcome measures such
      as depression questionnaires, quality of life questionnaire, lung function, measures of
      airways inflammation and reduction in dose of oral steroids will be used to determine the
      effect of anti-depressant medication on depression and asthma control. The treatment period
      will be 12 weeks with outcomes assessed in the first and final week of treatment. The
      investigators hope to find out if the study protocol we have devised is feasible for a larger
      multi-Centre clinical trial and demonstrate some evidence that treating depression in
      subjects with well characterised refractory asthma will improve depression and asthma symptom
      control (this will be used to estimate the size of a larger clinical trial).

      Recruitment: Participants will be identified and approached by a member of their usual
      healthcare team and invited to participate. Participants will be given time to consider
      whether they wish to take part and will assured that their care will be unaffected should
      they choose not to participate or to withdraw during the study period.

      Inclusion/exclusion: All patients will be assessed using our well established systematic
      evaluation protocol. Refractory asthma will be based on the definition of the American
      Thoracic Society Consensus Workshop. Patients recruited will have refractory asthma, will be
      identified as having depression using two validated questionnaires and will agree to take
      part and to take anti-depressant medication. Patients with poor adherence to medication,
      other respiratory conditions and who have had anti-depressant medication in previous the 6
      months will be excluded.

      Consent: People who are unable to give informed consent will be excluded from the study as
      they may be particularly vulnerable. Capacity to give informed consent will be assessed by
      the participant's usual healthcare professionals.

      Risks, burdens and benefits

      There is a small risk of agitation and suicidal ideation associated with commencement of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) anti-depressants. The investigators will
      attempt to minimise this risk by:

        1. Contacting participants 1 week after commencing treatment and 1 week after any
           subsequent dose increase to ensure there is no suggestion of agitation or suicidal
           ideation. This is in accordance with the guidelines for initiation of SSRI therapy in
           adults.

        2. Participants will also be contacted weekly for 2 weeks after discontinuation of study
           treatment. If depressive symptoms worsen patients will be advised to liaise with their
           GP to consider institution of treatment on clinical grounds.
