  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reduce polycystic liver volume by treating with octreotide,
      whether or not combined with everolimus; to assess whether combination therapy of everolimus
      and octreotide gives a bigger reduction of polycystic liver volume than octreotide
      monotherapy.

      This is a single center randomized, open-label, parallel study comparing the safety and
      efficacy of everolimus-octreotide LAR treatment to monotherapy octreotide LAR in adult
      symptomatic patients with polycystic livers because of polycystic liver disease (PCLD).

      We aim to include 44 patients affected by a polycystic liver either due to PCLD, 22 patients
      in the combination group and 22 patients in the mono therapy group.The duration of the trial
      will be 52 weeks. The treatment will be 48 weeks and the last control visit will take place
      four weeks after the treatment.
