  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I trial of weekly topotecan in combination with sorafenib in treatment of relapsed
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been commenced. In the present randomized phase 2 study,
      the investigators will research whether Sorafenib maintenance prolongs progression free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with ED-SCLC who achieved CR or PR after
      platinum-based induction chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 10-15 % of all lung cancer. Despite high
      responsiveness to initial chemotherapy, its high relapse rate makes the treatment of SCLC is
      challenging. With platinum plus etoposide or irinotecan, overall response rate is as high as
      85%, however, the median duration of response is short (approximately 4 months), and median
      survival times are 9 to 11 months, with a 2-year survival rate of less than 10% [J Clin
      oncology. 2009 Oct 1;27(28):4787-92]. New and more effective agents are clearly needed
      against SCLC. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitors acting on pathways involved in tumour
      progression and angiogenesis, and is undergoing investigation for the treatment of SCLC in
      either the first- or second-line setting. The only data available so far are on sorafenib,
      which seems to be a promising agent with a median survival of 7 and 5 months in
      platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory patients, respectively (2008 J Clin oncology 26.
      Abstract 8039). This compared favourably with historical controls receiving salvage
      chemotherapy.
