  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation trial to determine the
      maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of CC-5013 (Lenalidomide)and paclitaxel in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Other purposes of the study are:

        1. Define the safety profile of the CC-5013 and paclitaxel given in combination

        2. Define the pharmacokinetics of CC-5013 and paclitaxel given in combination

        3. Define the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination by monitoring potential biomarkers
           of the different biological activities of each component of the regimen

        4. Define the optimal biological dose (OBD) and the dose recommended (RD) for phase II
           studies in selected tumor types (breast, ovary, prostate, NSCLC)

        5. Collect evidence of antitumor activity in selected tumor types

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) derivatives of thalidomide (CC-5013 lenalidomide and
      CC4047 pomalidomide) are endowed of direct antitumor activity besides the indirect effects
      attributed to antiangiogenic, antiinflammatory and T-cell co-stimulatory properties.

      Combination therapy with cytotoxic agents or other anticancer drugs could lead to additive or
      synergistic interactions and support their clinical development in tumor types in which the
      specific activities of IMiDs could be of potential value.

      Combinations with weekly paclitaxel could be of interest because of its antiangiogenic
      activity, antitumor activity in prostate, NSCLC, ovary, breast cancer, tumor types in which
      IMiD could be of clinical value because of either enhancement of tumor specific immunity
      (ovary, prostate) or inhibition of Treg function (breast, NSCLC, ovary).

    <description>Cohorts of 3 evaluable patients will initially be entered within each dose level, sequentially. In each dose level the second and third patient will enter 2 weeks after the first one. The second and third patient may be treated simultaneously, except if a DLT is reported in the first patient, in which case the second and third patient should be treated sequentially, at least one week apart.
Dose escalation will be done when all the patients included in each DL will finish the first treatment cycle. Three additional patients will be sequentially entered (separated by one week each other) if one DLT is observed in cycle 1 among the first 3 patients entered within a dose level. If a DLT is observed in a second patient at this dose level, no further dose escalation will be allowed and the dose level will be considered the MTD.
Once the RD (one level below the MTD) has been defined, additional patients (up to 12) will be treated in order to confirm the safety profile of the combination.</description>
