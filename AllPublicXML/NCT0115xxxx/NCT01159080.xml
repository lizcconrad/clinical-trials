    <textblock>
      To clarify that tacrolimus-sparing regimen with minimal tacrolimus dose together with
      mycophenolate sodium dose increment will preserve renal allograft function without rising
      adverse effects

      Primary endpoints:

        1. estimated GFR (MDRD equation) 12 months after randomization

        2. estimated GFR change from randomization to end of the study (calculated by MDRD equation
           and Nankivell equation)
