             any indication of the regular use of more than fourteen units of alcohol per week (1

             urine drug screen at screening.

          -  History of allergic reactions to heparin, nateglinide, or other related drugs.

          -  Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples of
             inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, omeprazole;
             examples of inhibitors: antidepressant (SSRI), cimetidine, diltiazem, macrolides,

             metabolism, or excretion of the drug.

          -  Any clinically significant history or presence of clinically significant neurological,
             endocrinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, immunologic, psychiatric, or

          -  Difficulty to swallow study medication.

          -  Smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day.

          -  Any food anergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the

             follows:

          -  50 mL to 300 mL of whole blood within 30 days,

          -  301 mL to 500 mL of whole blood within 45 days, or

          -  more than 500 mL of whole blood within 56 days prior to drug administration.

          -  Consumption of food or beverages containing grapefruit (e.g. fresh, canned, or frozen)
