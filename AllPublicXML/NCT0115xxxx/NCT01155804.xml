      Introduction: randomized studies on programs implemented during pre-natal care that offer
      information and physical activities preparing pregnant women for delivery are scarce in the
      scientific literature. Objective: to evaluate the effectively of the Program for Preparation
      of Pregnant Women for Delivery on the prevention of physical and psychological difficulties
      and problems during pregnancy and delivery in nulliparous women participating in the program.
      Subjects and methods: a randomized clinical single blind trial will be conducted with 192
      pregnant nulliparous women allocated to participate or not of the program activities. The
      women allocated to the study group will participate of physical and educational activities at
      each pre-natal consultation and will receive orientation on the exercises they will perform
      at their home. Participants of the non-interventional group will follow the habitual routine
      care at the service. Participants will be selected among nulliparous low risk pregnant women
      aged between 16 and 40 years old after the 20th week of gestation. Data analysis: will be
      performing by intention to treat. For the continues variables the t-Student or Wilcoxon test
      will be performing; for the categorical variables the tests x² or Fisher, and the risk
      estimate will be estimated using a Relative Risk with 95% CI. ANOVA will be use for measures
      between the groups and along time, and correlation tests for anxiety and physical activity
      with gestational and perinatal variables.

      Participants, 192 nulliparous women that receive pre-natal care, allocated according to
      randomization into two groups: group one in which the women who participate in a program with
      physical and educational activities and the non-interventional group that will not receive
      the intervention and will follow a regular pre-natal care at routine of the service. The
      designation of participants will be performed, after informed consent will be sign, by
      opening sequentially envelopes previously sealed and numbered that will contain the
      information, previously generated by a computer system.

    <description>Pregnant nulliparous women allocated to the non-interventional group will follow the routine pre-natal care. The participants of the study group will receive routine attention at the pre-natal care service and will also participate in the program of physical and educational after each routine pre-natal consultation. These activities will be organize as follow: 30 minutes of physical exercise for the prevention of pain and discomfort that may occur during pregnancy, preparation of the perineal muscles for delivery and prevention of urinary incontinence, 15 minutes for relaxation and 30 minutes for group discussion to respond to doubts that women may have and issues such as: change in posture during pregnancy and prevention of pain and discomfort; role of the perineal muscles during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium, physiology of delivery, non-pharmacological way for pain relief and breathing control during contractions of labor and delivery.</description>
