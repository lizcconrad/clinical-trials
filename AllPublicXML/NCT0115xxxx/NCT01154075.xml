  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a novel method to measure adherence to
      immunosuppressant medications in predicting rejection episodes in children who had a liver
      transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the course of their illness as many as 50% of children who had a liver transplant stop
      taking their medications. Non-adherence is the most important reason for organ rejection in
      long term survivors of pediatric liver transplantation. In order to address this important
      risk-factor effectively, the first step is to evaluate a method that would identify
      non-adherence in these children. Medication blood levels that are obtained as a part of
      clinical practice in transplant centers can be used to determine whether the patient is
      adherent or not. This multi-center observational study tests the ability of an objective
      measure of adherence to immunosuppressant medications that involves the use of routinely
      obtained tacrolimus blood levels to predict organ rejection in children who had a liver
      transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is between &gt; 1 year of age and less than 18 years of age at enrollment

          -  Guardian's consent, child assent (in accordance with each institution's IRB policies).

          -  The patient is prescribed tacrolimus (either brand or generic formulation).

          -  The patient has been seen in the enrolling center's clinic at least once in the last
             two years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient received a liver transplant less than 1 year prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has had more than one solid organ transplant (including marrow
             replacement).

          -  The patient has had biopsy-proven rejection within the past six months.

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

          -  The guardian or child (in a developmentally-appropriate manner) do not understand the
             study procedures. This will be verified by asking both guardian and child (if 6 years
             old or older) to repeat the study procedures.

          -  The patient is only seen for consultation - most or all of the child's routine care is
             provided at another center (or in a community clinic).

          -  Either the patient or the guardian is actively psychotic or severely disoriented due
             to any cause, including hepatic encephalopathy (temporary exclusion) or severely
             mentally retarded as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV).

          -  The patient is not medically stable or is hospitalized.

          -  The treating physician has instructed the participant not to obtain tacrolimus levels
             for at least one year.
