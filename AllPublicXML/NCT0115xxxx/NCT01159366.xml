  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is assumed that patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) showing an
      infero- or posterolateral occluded culprit artery (OCA) during diagnostic angiography
      frequently elude standard 12-lead electrocardiogram diagnosis. In addition, coronary
      collaterals may have beneficial effects in patients with OCA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We examined consecutive NSTEMI patients within 48 h of symptom onset. All patients underwent
      early invasive angiography plus optimal medical therapy. We compared baseline
      characteristics, procedural findings including analysis of TIMI-flow and collaterals using
      the Rentrop-classification, 30-day and 6-months major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
      patients with and without totally OCA.
