      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of an online stress management program,
      which combines stress reduction and prevention strategies with personal care products/rituals
      which have relaxation properties, on pregnancy rates and psychological distress in women
      undergoing IVF for the first time.

    <textblock>
      The relationship between stress and infertility has remained a subject of controversy for
      many years. Recent research indicates that stress has a strong negative impact on pregnancy
      rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). In addition, stress is the most
      common reason given by women who voluntarily terminate treatment.

      In a recent study, women who participated in a group mind/body treatment program had higher
      pregnancy rates than control subjects. The impact of an online stress management program has
      never been studied in the infertile population. An online intervention would be far more
      accessible for many infertility patients.
