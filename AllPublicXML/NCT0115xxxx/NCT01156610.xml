      The objectives of this project are to develop and evaluate a multi-level approach to tobacco
      treatment for low-SES and minority patients. The components of this intervention would
      include Integrated Voice Response(IVR)-facilitated systematic outreach, linkage to a tobacco
      treatment specialist, free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) directed at the patient, and
      integration of this program with both an individual's primary care physician through an
      electronic health record (EHR), as well as referral to community resources to address the
      socio-contextual barriers to tobacco cessation. To achieve these objectives, this
      intervention will test an innovative model of systematic outreach to low-SES and minority
      smokers using systematic phone outreach (including cell phones which are particularly
      prevalent among minority and low-SES groups), coordinated with the PCP, using both a
      cost-effective technology and a dedicated tobacco treatment specialist to increase smoking
      cessation in these populations. The proposed intervention will have multiple levels of
      influence (patient, PCP) and provide linkages to community resources. If successful, this
      model could be generalized to other health systems with an EHR, which are increasingly being
      promoted to improve the safety and quality of health care.

      Hypothesis 1 (Reach and Effectiveness): An EHR-linked, IVR-mediated personalized treatment
      program for low-SES and minority smokers can reach these patients to increase quit rates and
      use of tobacco treatment effectively.

      Hypothesis 2 (Adoption and Implementation): An EHR-linked, IVR-mediated personalized
      treatment program for low-SES and minority smokers can be adopted across a variety of
      practice settings and be consistently implemented across diverse patient populations.

    <textblock>
      Because 70% of smokers have seen a PCP within the past year, primary care represents a
      valuable platform for reducing disparities in tobacco use that could be made more effective.
      The current national focus on expanding the use of EHRs also makes the proposed model to
      identify smokers with the goal of reducing disparities in tobacco use particularly timely.
      The adoption of EHRs in practices serving minorities is similar to that in all practices,
      suggesting that there is not a &quot;digital divide&quot; for PCP practices. In addition, the proposed
      intervention is novel because it addresses tobacco use at multiple levels (i.e., individual,
      health care setting, community), and is designed to provide smokers with tools to address
      socio-contextual contributors to disparities in tobacco use. Finally, the intervention will
      be informed by a broad approach using community resources for tobacco cessation. Conceptual
      models and empiric data suggest that this type of broad approach is needed to reach low-SES
      and minority smokers to reduce disparities in tobacco use. Telephone outreach may be
      particularly effective for minority and low-SES populations because cell phone penetration is
      higher in these populations. While disparities in tobacco use are rooted in social and
      economic problems that extend beyond the domain of health care and traditional treatment
      models, the health care system still represents a critical opportunity to initiate
      intervention.

      Although smoking has declined over the past decades, substantial socioeconomic disparities in
      smoking prevalence, risk of addiction, and tobacco-related disease remain in the US,
      particularly among different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Despite relatively
      similar rates of tobacco use, for example, African Americans (a term used interchangeably
      with &quot;blacks&quot; throughout this proposal) suffer from a higher burden of tobacco-related
      disease, particularly lung cancer, than whites. Importantly, low socioeconomic status (SES)
      and minority smokers also have a relatively more difficult time quitting for several reasons,
      including more limited access to treatment, misinformation about the risks and benefits of
      treatment, more environmental exposure, lack of social support, and other life stressors.

      Primary care physicians (PCPs) are an important source of tobacco treatment, as the majority
      of smokers visit a PCP each year. While the US Public Health Service strongly recommends that
      clinicians identify and treat every tobacco user, such an approach is largely dependent on
      busy clinicians to provide counseling and treatment during a brief visit. Minority and
      low-SES smokers are more likely than whites to report that they did not receive counseling or
      treatment during a visit. For these reasons it is important to offer systematic opportunities
      for tobacco treatment beyond the provider's office, in addition to improving &quot;best practices&quot;
      for cessation treatment. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a phone technology that allows a
      computer to detect voice responses during a normal phone call (including calls from mobile
      phones). This technology offers a low-cost, efficient way to reach out proactively to large
      populations, independent of a visit. IVR scripts can be translated into other languages,
      facilitating systematic outreach to diverse populations. This technology can provide direct
      linkage to a tobacco treatment specialist, who can provide personalized advice for cessation,
      mood management, and stress reduction, and provide a course of free nicotine replacement
      treatment (NRT), as well as linkage to relevant community resources. Smokers who use NRT as
      part of their cessation plan are more likely to succeed than those who do not, and free NRT
      is a particularly important intervention for low-SES and minority smokers.

      Specific Aim 1: To develop an EHR-linked, IVR-mediated personalized tobacco treatment program
      for low-SES and minority smokers. To develop this program, we will first conduct formative
      qualitative research to identify the particular barriers to smoking cessation faced by these
      populations and subsequently, to create a Community Resource Guide to address socio-cultural
      barriers to cessation.

      Specific Aim 2: To measure the effectiveness of this personalized treatment program by
      conducting a randomized controlled trial of low-SES and minority smokers in 12 clinics from
      the Partners Primary Care Practice Based Research Network (PPC-PBRN). Patients in the
      intervention group will be offered three contacts with a tobacco treatment specialist over a
      12 week period, a free 6-week supply of nicotine patches, and linkage to local resources
      using the Community Resource Guide. Patients in the control group will receive visit-based
      &quot;best practices&quot; care facilitated by EHR decision support (received by both the intervention
      and the control group). The primary outcome of this trial will be the 7-day abstinence rate
      at 6 months.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate facilitators and barriers to the reach, adoption, and
      implementation of this personalized tobacco treatment program.

      This project fits well with other projects in the Lung Cancer Disparities Center (LCDC),
      complementing the other projects that seek to explain disparities in lung cancer at the
      molecular, neighborhood, and societal levels. Over 80% of those diagnosed with lung cancer
      are current or ex-smokers, supporting the critical importance of smoking cessation to
      reducing disparities in lung cancer.1 Our project adds another layer by focusing on the
      individual/ clinical interface to reduce disparities in tobacco use.

    <description>IVR System: IVR will be used for two purposes: (1) to facilitate access to treatment for low-SES and minority smokers and (2) perform six-month outcome assessment.
Tobacco Treatment Specialist Calls: A tobacco treatment specialist will make four attempts to contact the patient by phone within 14 days. On contacting the patient, the specialist will screen the patient for readiness to quit, provide brief (10 to 15 minutes) counseling tailored to the patient's readiness to quit, and provide information and support for use of medications that could be or were prescribed and about relevant community resources.
NRT: Patients who do not have a contraindication and smoke &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, will be offered a free 6-week kit of generic nicotine patches (2 weeks of 21 mg patches, 2 weeks of 14 mg patches, and 2 weeks of 7 mg patches). Individuals who smoke 5-10 cigarettes/day will be offered a 6-week course, starting with the 14 mg patch. Those with a contraindication will not get NRT.</description>

    <description>IVR Call: Similar to the initial IVR call for the intervention arms, the initial control arm call will confirm the participant's identify and provide a brief description of the study (obtaining information about health behaviors), with the opportunity for the individual to accept or decline participation. Following this introduction, the IVR script will confirm smoking status. The phone script will collect specific information about current smoking (cigarettes/day), prior quit attempts, and motivation to quit during the next month. No further contact will be made with patients in the control clinics until the outcome assessment call. In the control practices, the IVR machine will also generate a text note documenting the information obtained for the patients' EHR for use by the patient's health care providers as part of their &quot;visit-based&quot; best practices.</description>

    <description>Comparison of integrated cessation counseling tools with the normal standard of care.
Both the intervention and control clinics will be provided with tools for visit-based &quot;best practices&quot; for tobacco cessation. The LMR will provide smoking status icons and tobacco treatment reminders for the primary care physicians at the time of a visit. In addition, physicians in both arms have access to decision support around medications prescribed, including bupropion and varenicline. Physicians can refer patients to tobacco cessation groups that meet periodically at each of the sites or to the Massachusetts tobacco quitline.
Outcome Assessment: Six month IVR Call: Patients in both the intervention and control practices who have not opted-out will be called six months after completing the 12-week treatment protocol. The outcome assessment script will be largely the same for intervention and control practices (except for the questions related to satisfaction with the intervention protocol).</description>
