    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study recruiting patients with angioedema induced by ACEI.

      Open-label treatment with subcutaneous Icatibant compared to a historic group of 47 patients
      with ACE inhibitor induced angioedema which the investigators have been previously treated in
      the investigators centers with current &quot;standard&quot; therapy (250 mg methylprednisolon and 2 mg
      clemastine).

      In cases with fast progression of edema after application the study-drug, a second
      application with icatibant could be necessary. Rescue medication and intervention.

    <textblock>
      Sudden occurrence of subcutaneous or submucosal non-itchy swelling, so-called angioedema, is
      a well known side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which may become
      life-threatening if the upper airway is involved. To be note, ACEi induced angioedema were
      always located in the head and neck region.

      The pathophysiology of ACE inhibitor (ACEi) induced angioedema most likely resembles that of
      hereditary angioedema (HAE), i.e. it is mainly mediated by bradykinin induced activation of
      vascular bradykinin B2 receptors (BKR-2). In contrast to an increased bradykinin generation
      in HAE, treatment with ACEi decreases the bradykinin degradation in plasma and increases the
      biological activity of bradykinin.

      The current pharmacotherapy of ACEi induced angioedema is not satisfactory. Antihistamines
      and corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of urticaria with cutaneous edema and
      itchy, but are theoretically ineffective and hence superfluous in bradykinin induced
      angioedema. However, glucocorticoids still belong to the standard treatment of angioedema.

      We hypothesized that the BKR-2 antagonist icatibant might be an effective therapy for
      ACEi-induced angioedema.

      Patients with ACEi induced angioedema, located in the upper aero-digestive tract will be
      randomized and treated either with icatibant and plazebo or cortisone with clemastin and
      plazebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 &lt;85 years

          -  Patient is currently treated with an ACEI

          -  Patient must have acute angioedema attack caused by an ACEI

          -  Treatment should be administrated within 10 hrs after onset by an ACEI

          -  Patient with angioedema of head and /or neck (face, lips, cheeks, tongue, soft
             palate/uvula, pharynx and larynx)

          -  At least one moderate to severe severe angioedema symptom as assessed by the
             investigator, requiring a medical intervention

          -  Signed written Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of angioedema that was not caused by ACEI: e.g. hereditary angioedema
             (C1-INH deficiency), allergy, anaphylaxis, insect bite, trauma, infection, abscess,
             tumor, post-radiation or post-operative or processes related to salivary glands and
             others where it is unlikely that the ACEI is causing the angioedema

          -  Participation in a clinical trial of another investigational medicinal product (IMP)
             within 30 days

          -  Patients with acute urticaria

          -  Patients with a medical history of any angioedema before taking an ACEI

          -  Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction

          -  Acute heart failure

          -  Mental condition rendering the patients, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to
             understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study;

          -  Unlikely to comply with the protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for the follow-up visit, or unlikely to complete the study for any reason.
