  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is 25 days long. People participating in this study will be asked to brush their
      teeth two times a day. People will be assigned to a mouthwash and will rinse four times a day
      at the site for five days. A dentist or dental hygienist will look at the mouth, teeth,
      tongue and gums to make sure the mouthwash does not irritate the mouth. After Day 5 of the
      study, people will continue to brush two times a day and will return on Day 24 to have their
      mouth looked at again. People without irritation in their mouth will rinse 4 times a day at
      the clinical site. People will return to the clinical site the next day and have a final oral
      exam in which the dentist or dental hygienist will look at the mouth for irritation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, single-center, supervised, controlled,
      parallel-designed study. Approximately 90 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled so that 78 subjects (26 per treatment group)
      would reasonably be expected to complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard
      tissues assessed at Screening (visit 1), Baseline (visit 2), and Days 3, 5, 24, and 25
      (visits 4,6-8). During the first week of the study, subjects will be instructed to brush
      their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily using the provided standard
      fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon qualification with
      entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups. Qualified subjects will be
      instructed to return to the site for five consecutive days. Subjects will have four
      supervised rinses with their assigned mouth rinse for either 30 or 60 seconds using 10 ml or
      20 ml, at subsequent one-hour intervals. During the 5 consecutive days of exposure to the
      assigned mouthrinse, subjects will brush their teeth using the provided fluoride-free
      toothpaste and soft-bristled toothbrush.

      Subjects will then have an 18-day rest period (off treatment). During this time, subjects
      will follow their usual oral hygiene and dietary habits, using the standard fluoride
      toothpaste and soft toothbrush provided, and must refrain from using any unassigned oral care
      products. On the 19th day after completion of Day 5 (Day 24), subjects will return for an
      oral examination. If no pathology is present, subjects will be given a challenge treatment
      (four supervised rinses) and the final oral examination will be performed on Day 25.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females at least 18 years of age in good general and oral health without any
             known allergy to commercial dental products or cosmetics.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating the
             subject (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the trial.

          -  Willingness to use the assigned products according to instructions, availability for
             appointments, and likelihood of completing the clinical trial.

          -  Willingness to refrain from using any breath freshener products (e.g., oral care
             strips, candy-type mints, sprays, chewing gums, throat lozenges, cough drops or
             mouthwashes), whitening products and smokeless tobacco products within one week prior
             to and for the duration of the study, in order to reduce alternate sources of
             potential irritation and sensitization.

          -  A minimum of 20 natural teeth.

          -  Absence of abnormal or severe fissured tongue, geographic tongue, or any obvious
             tongue abnormalities that may interfere with the assessment of oral irritation.

          -  Adequate oral hygiene (i.e., brush teeth daily &amp; exhibit no signs of oral neglect).

          -  Absence of neglected dental health (i.e., gross calculus deposits or rampant caries
             based on visual examination), significant oral soft tissue pathology,
             systematically-related gingival enlargement or tissue damage due to ill-fitting
             appliances or restoration.

          -  Absence of orthodontic bands, appliances, bridges, extensive large restorations or
             removable orthodontic appliances.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers who report history or presence of kidney disorders or kidney stones,
             Crohn's Disease or other malabsorption syndromes.

          -  History of significant adverse effects following use of oral hygiene products such as
             toothpastes and mouthwashes.

          -  Physical limitations or restrictions that might preclude use of normal oral hygiene
             procedures (i.e., toothbrushing, mouthrinsing, etc.).

          -  History or current evidence of significant oral soft tissue pathology, excluding
             gingivitis, based on the dentist's visual examination and at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          -  Those requiring antibiotic premedication prior to dental treatment.

          -  Participation in a dental clinical trial involving oral care products within the past
             30 days.

          -  Visual evidence of Moderate/Advanced Periodontitis (ADA Type III, IV).

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant during the course of the
             study.

          -  Volunteers requiring treatment with Indinavir or loop diuretics (i.e., Furosemide).

          -  Other severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of trial result and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial

          -  Any clinical history which in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the
             safety of the subject or the clinical parameters being assessed
