    <textblock>
      Postoperative epidural analgesia (EA) is an effective and well-accepted modality of pain
      relief technique after having total knee replacement operation(1,4). Patient controlled
      epidural analgesia (PCEA) has been shown to be safe and effective in standard ward setting(2)
      and results in reduced epidural analgesic requirements(3). Besides, it also bear the
      advantage of avoidance of overdose, reduction of waiting times and involvement of patients in
      their analgesic regimen(3). Both ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are the local anaesthetic
      using in epidural analgesia which has been proven to be safe and effective(4). 0.2%
      Ropivacaine with 2ug/ml fentanyl has been used in our locality for more than 8 years. Another
      local anaesthetics, levobupivacaine, a S-enantiomer of bupivacaine has come up in Hong Kong,
      which has been proved to be safe, effective and may be better value for money. These two
      drugs has been proven to have similar analgesic potency in using as EA for postoperative pain
      relief for other operation(5,6,7) and for orthropaedics operation but in different
      concentration(4). Concerns have been raised about the introduction of the levobupivacaine in
      the departmental protocol. Objectives of this study are A)to determine the equivalence of two
      local anaesthetics regimen ; 0.2% ropivacaine with 2ug/ml fentanyl and 0.2% levobupivacaine
      with 2ug/ml fentanyl and B) to assess the cost-effectiveness of using these two regimens.

      The null hypothesis is that the difference of analgesic effect, presented with visual
      analogue score, of two patient controlled epidural analgesia regimen, the 0.2% ropivacaine
      with 2 ug/ml fentanyl and 0.2% levobupivacaine with 2ug/ml fentanyl is higher than the
      threshold of 9 mm VAS. (8,9,10)
