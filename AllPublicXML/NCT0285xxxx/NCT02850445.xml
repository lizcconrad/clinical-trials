  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular psychosocial intervention combined with antipsychotic drugs, compared with usual
      medication alone treatments, can reduce psychiatric symptoms and improve quality of life in
      patients with schizophrenia. However, it's expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
      inconvenient for patients and their family members in developing areas where the number of
      well-trained therapist remains limited in local psychiatric settings. The investigators aimed
      to establish an efficient model of integrated treatment (IT) for patients with schizophrenia.
      The procedure contains two stages: a centralized treatment during hospitalization and the
      following consolidation treatments with long intervals.
