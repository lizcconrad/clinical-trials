  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cervical spine should work as a functional unit. If hypomobility should exist in any of
      the segments it would limit the mobility of the spine as a whole. Although it is frequent
      that certain cervical segments present hypomobility, they are not always related to
      symptomatology. The effects of inhibition sub-occipital techniques on cervical mobility have
      not been evaluated.

      The objetive of this trials is to assess and compare the effects on cervical mobility, of the
      manual technique of sub-occipital inhibition by applying pressure and self-treatment by way
      of Occipivot® cushion, in subjects with no cervical symptomatology but with limited mobility
      assessed by the flexion-rotation test.

    <description>The technique applied to Manual Group was performed with the patient supine position. Physiotherapist in a sitting position at the head of the subject with forearms resting on the table . Suboccipital region was located , and flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints 90º a pressure was made ventrally , relaxing the rest of the head in the heel of the hand.
The technique was performed for 5 minutes</description>

    <description>The technique applied to the Instrumental Group was performed with the patient supine in the same position as the Manual Group . It was previously instructed the subject how to proceed with the cushion Occipivot® , indicating the installation location and method of affixing , correcting him if the application was inadequate. The subject placed the cushion Occipivot® under the suboccipital region and told him he had to stay in that position for 5 minutes. A physiotherapist warned the patient at the end of the application time so that the subject had to be aware not to control it.</description>
