      The discovery in 2003 by isolation of amoebas Mimivirus, the world's largest virus at the
      Research Unit on Tropical and Emerging Diseases in Marseille revealed fascinating information
      about the definition and evolution of viruses. Its genome encodes about 1,000 proteins. Three
      other viruses were then isolated from amoebas in this unit:Two other giant viruses, Mamavirus
      Marseillevirus then, and the first virus a virus, named virophage, which led to highlight the
      role of amoeba (Acanthamoeba spp. ) such as spawning giant viruses and compounds of bacterial
      origin or cellular proteins This project focuses on the detection and analysis of new viral
      agents (viruses and virophages giant amoeba environmental) and their involvement in human
      pathology.

      The objectives of this study are observational: detect and document the presence of giant
      viruses and virophages of amoebae in the faeces of children presenting to the pediatric
      emergency reception service of the North Hospital in AP -HM with or without clinical evidence
      of gastroenteritis.
