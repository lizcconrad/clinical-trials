    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to validate a diagnostic tool severity of these common
      non-motor manifestations, disturbing and little recognized as a self-questionnaire. This
      assessment tool used on different subgroups of patients (free from any treatment at an early
      stage of the disease and the stage of motor complications) will better understand the natural
      history of the non-motor fluctuations (FNM)
