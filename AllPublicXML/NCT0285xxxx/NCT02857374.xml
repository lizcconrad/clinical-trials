    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies intravital microscopy in identifying tumor vessels in
      patients with stage IB-IIIC melanoma undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy. By examining
      sentinel lymph nodes through intravital microscopy before they are removed, doctors may learn
      specific information regarding how melanoma may spread to lymph nodes and other sites of the
      body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of intravital microscopy in characterizing the
      microvasculature of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in melanoma patients requiring SLN biopsy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify vascular blood flow parameters and flow kinetics associated with the sentinel
      lymph node vasculature and define the utility of using commonly used fluorescent agents
      during human intravital microscopy and correlate with clinical outcomes (time to recurrence,
      survival), as a potential basis for a novel prognostic tool and/or microstaging technique.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between live microscopically-recorded images and pathology
      slides in terms of vessel density and vessel diameter.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green and fluorescein sodium injection intravenously (IV) and
      then undergo intravital microscopic observation over 15-20 minutes during standard of care
      sentinel node biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then every 6
      months for 5 years or every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for another 2 years.

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2

          -  Melanoma tumor that meets indications for a groin SLN biopsy with a &gt;= 10% risk of
             having metastasis to the draining lymph node (i.e. stage IB to stage IIIC melanoma of
             the lower body below the umbilicus)

          -  Participant must be eligible for a groin sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

             equation
