  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown geographic disparities in the detection of colorectal adenomas in
      Côte-d'Or, with an impact of the distance from the general practitioner and an ecological
      deprivation index (EDI). On the other hand, the extremely low detection rates for these
      lesions in everyday practice before the implementation of organized screening for colorectal
      cancer in the Côte-d'Or were shown. One of the aims of this screening is to reduce
      socio-geographic inequalities in access to care and prevention. Yet, participation in
      screening also varies depending on the socio-economic level. In this context, the Côte-d'Or
      Polyps Registry, the only body to have data for the pre-screening period (before 2003), will
      make it possible to determine whether the implementation of organized screening led to the
      elimination of socio-geographic disparities concerning the detection of adenomas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population will include all patients residing in Côte d'Or with a first
             colorectal adenoma (including in situ carcinomas) diagnosed between 01/01/1997 and
             31/12/2008

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of address

          -  history (or suspected history) of previously resected adenoma

          -  personal history of colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer discovered in the year
             following resection of the adenoma (because the cancer was probably not seen at the
             initial colonoscopy)

          -  familial polyposis or known HNPCC

          -  chronic inflammatory bowel disease
