      The purpose for this study is to determine safety and effectiveness of the oxyhydrogen
      generator with nebulizer through an adjuvant therapy for the severe COPD patients in the
      stable phase.

    <textblock>
      In this study, severe COPD patients in stable phase who were included in both treatment and
      control groups, administered randomly oxyhydrogen generator with nebulizer (treatment group)
      or oxygen Nebulizer Machine （control group ）for adjuvant therapy. The therapeutic outcomes in
      both treatment and control groups are analyzed and evaluated to verify safety and
      effectiveness of the test product.This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind
      study. The trial lasted for 3 months. The curative effect was observed for subjects in the
      second week, first month, second month and third month respectively as the observing time
      point. Total patients which are planned to be included are 140 cases, where, 70 cases in the
      treatment group and control group respectively are distributed in 5 clinical hospitals.
