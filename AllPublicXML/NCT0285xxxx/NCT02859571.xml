    <textblock>
      This study evaluates continuous oxytocin versus intermittent oxytocin for induction of labor
      at term. Half of participants will be taken continuous oxytocin, while the other half will be
      taken intermittent oxytocin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the continuous oxytocin group, traditional treatment of oxytocin used at a starting dose
      of 1-2 mIU/min and the dose was increased by 2 mIU/min at every 15 minutes until regular
      contractions obtained at a rate of 3-5 contractions in a 10-minute period. The maximum dose
      of oxytocin was 40 mIU/min and oxytocin was administered until delivery. In the intermittent
      group, oxytocin was discontinued when cervical dilation was 5 cm and 2 hours after
      discontinuation oxytocin was reused at a starting dose of 1-2 mIU/min and was increased as
      the same protocol used for continuation oxytocin group.
