  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, fixed dose, phase Ib trial of anti-CEA CAR-T cell infusions delivered
      via the hepatic artery or splenic vein using the Surefire Infusion System (SIS) for patients
      with CEA-expressing liver metastases or pancreas cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergo leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are purified. T
      cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      specific for CEA. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by percutaneous
      hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses. Prior to the first dose, each patient will
      undergo diagnostic angiography to verify suitable arterial anatomy. Three anti-CEA CAR-T
      doses per patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Low dose interleukin-2 will be given via
      an ambulatory infusion pump for 4 weeks. Normal liver and tumor biopsies will be obtained at
      the time of the initial diagnostic angiogram and during the final session following the 3rd
      CAR-T infusion.

      Patients with CEA+ liver metastases who exhibit in-liver control following CAR-T therapy who
      also have CEA+ primary pancreatic tumors may be eligible to receive direct intrapancreatic
      CAR-T retrograde venous infusions. A maximum of 2 infusions will be delivered. No additional
      IL-2 will be given and there will be no additional biopsies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically confirmed diagnosis of CEA+ adenocarcinoma and liver
             metastases. Patient must have either histologic confirmation of the liver metastases
             or histologic documentation of the primary tumor and definitive radiologic evidence of
             liver involvement. Measurable disease is required with lesions of &gt; 1.0 cm by CT.

             disease is acceptable if confined to the lungs or peritoneal cavity.

          -  Tumor must be CEA-expressing as demonstrated by elevated serum CEA levels (â‰¥10ng/ml)
             or immunohistochemistry on a biopsy specimen. Archived tissue is acceptable for
             determination of CEA expression.

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age.
