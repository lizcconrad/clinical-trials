  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation will evaluate, under dermatological control, the cutaneous in-use tolerance
      of E45 Eczema Repair Emollient with two or three times daily application, over a period of
      two weeks on children and babies with dry/atopic and very dry/atopic skin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is an open label, in-use cutaneous tolerance investigation in children and
      babies with dry/atopic and very dry/atopic skin, to evaluate the acceptability and skin
      tolerability of E45 Eczema Repair Emollient.

      The investigation will be an 'at home' user investigation where the test product will be
      applied by the parent/legal guardian to a pre-defined test site (arm or leg) between 2 to 3
      times daily, consecutively for 14 days.
