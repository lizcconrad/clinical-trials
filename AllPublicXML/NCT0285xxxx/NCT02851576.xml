      Fourteen patients will be included for infusion of adenovirus-specific T-cells generated by a
      clinical grade IFN-γ based immunomagnetic isolation from a leukapheresis from their original
      donor or a haploidentical donor, in case of Umbilical cord blood transplantation, in the
      event of refractory ADV infection or disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) has improved over the last decades.
      However, after HSCT and especially with matched unrelated, cord blood or haploidentical
      donors, patients often experience a deep immunodeficiency, increasing susceptibility to viral
      infections. Among them, adenovirus (ADV) systemic infection, often refractory to antiviral
      treatment, is associated with a high mortality rate up to 50% (even more in children).
      Viremia monitoring after HSCT has contributed to improve survival allowing the implementation
      of a pre-emptive anti-viral treatment before any appearance of clinical signs of ADV disease.
      Nevertheless, no anti-viral drug is authorized for ADV infections, although intravenous (IV)
      cidofovir seemed to be, up to now, the most efficient. However, nephrotoxicity, especially
      tubular dysfunction, is often described, requiring hydratation and uroprotection with
      probenecid and limiting the treatment period.

      Meanwhile, adoptive transfer of ADV-specific T cells, prepared with an immunomagnetic
      clinical grade technology, is becoming an alternative treatment that has already proved
      feasible, safe and helpful in viral clearance and immune reconstitution related to an in vivo
      expansion of ADV-specific T cells leading to clinical improvement (Feuchtinger et al, 2006,
      2015; Qazim et al, 2013). Our team proposes a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial with
      ADV-specific T cells where 14 patients, with refractory ADV infection or disease after
      unrelated Peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood HSCT, are included.

    <description>This one arm study consists in ADV-specific T cell infusion after HSCT from a (M)MUD or, for the first time, from a haploidentical donor for patients having undergone previous UCB transplantation, in the event of refractory ADV infection or disease. Specific anti-ADV immune reconstitution was observed in all patients, and viral load clearance in all but one.</description>
