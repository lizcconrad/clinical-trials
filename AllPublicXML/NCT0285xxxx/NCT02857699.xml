    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort of 250 patients with solid tumours included in phase I clinical trials
      of targeted agents will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with MTA in mono therapy or in
      association with chemotherapy or other targeted agents in 4 large phase I centers.

      Patients from trials investigating chemotherapy alone will not be included. Quality of life
      will be assessed during the treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of phase I dose finding studies is to identify the recommended phase II
      dose. The primary endpoint is the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) which is generally measured
      using the NCI common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTCAE) graded scale. This scale, developed for
      the investigation of cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a limited number of cycles
      including rest period, is well adapted to identify the drug effect on organ dysfunction and
      life threatening events. However it may be less relevant to reflect the patient's feeling
      regarding the tolerability of the treatment under study resulting in over or under estimation
      of these toxicities.

      Moreover, targeted therapies and more specifically the ones administered orally are given
      over long periods often with continuous schedules. Moderate toxic side effects lasting over a
      long period are usually not considered as DLT. The health related quality of life of patients
      as well as other patient reported outcome including symptom scale in addition to usual NCI
      CTCAE scale could be a relevant variable to detect intolerable treatments. It has not been
      studied prospectively to date in phase I trials.

      A prospective cohort of 250 patients with solid tumours included in phase I clinical trials
      of targeted agents will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with MTA in mono therapy or in
      association with chemotherapy or other targeted agents in 4 large phase I centers.

      Patients from trials investigating chemotherapy alone will not be included.

      Patients included in a phase I trial will be requested to fill in

        -  a questionnaire of health related quality of life (the EORTC PAL 15 questionnaire)

        -  a questionnaire of symptoms (MDASI)

        -  a questionnaire on symptoms specific of MTA at baseline and at each cycle of treatment
           and 6 weeks after the end of treatment.

      The sponsor of the therapeutic phase I trials will be informed that the present research is
      running and that it will not interfere with their investigational protocol. Each phase I
      center has the latitude to propose or not the health-related quality of life research to
      patients included in a given phase I trial.

    <description>Identify if some dimensions of the quality of life affected by the treatment are not captured by the EORTC PAL 15 questionaries.
Interviews will be realized on a sub sample of patients. An explorative qualitative research could evaluate patients' experience of the impact, burden, tolerability or acceptability of phase I anti-cancer drug trials addressing patients' perception of symptoms, functioning and overall quality of life. Interviews results contrasted with the PAL15 questionnaires will enable to determine whether a QoL questionnaire dedicated to phase I trials is necessary and what are the main components felt essential to the patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory solid tumor.

          -  Patient included in a dose finding phase I trial investigating at least one
             molecularly targeted agent as defined as anticancer agents that selectively target
             molecular pathways (including monoclonal antibodies) as opposed to DNA, tubulin or
             cell division machinery will be eligible.

          -  Phase I/II clinical trials with a dose finding component are also eligible. Trials
             investigating combinations of MTA with one or several cytotoxic agent(s) are eligible,
             as well as combinations of MTAs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients with malignant hematologic disease will not be eligible.

        Patients included in the following types of phase I trials are not eligible:

          -  Trials investigating hormonal therapy and biological therapeutics such as
             immunotherapy, gene therapy and vaccines alone or in combination;

          -  Trials of cytotoxic agents only;

          -  Trials investigating radiochemotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy or
             MTA

          -  Trials whose objectives do not include dose-finding. This includes pharmacokinetic
             only trials, bioequivalence trials, feasibility trials etc.
