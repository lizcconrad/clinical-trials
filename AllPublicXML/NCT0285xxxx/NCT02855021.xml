  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease. Dementia will affect 80% of these patients
      during their evolution. In addition, treatments of motor signs have a potential impact on
      these disorders and conversely.

      The purpose of this study is to show focal abnormalities in brain metabolism in the precuneus
      and posterior cingulate region are predictive of the onset of dementia within 2 years.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment and dementia have become major factors of disability induced by
      Parkinson's disease. The prediction of dementia in any given patient may be useful for
      prognosis but also for discussion of setting up heavy therapeutic techniques, especially
      surgical. Currently, known predictors are disease severity, age and existence of
      pre-cognitive disorders; other assumptions are discussed. Among these, morphological imaging
      techniques (MRI) and functional techniques (MRI, PET) are proposed.

      Use increasingly early of heavy, expensive and potentially ineffective surgical treatment in
      dementia makes it necessary to find independent, early and reliable markers of the onset of
      dementia in Parkinson's Disease.

    <description>Imaging tests and neuropsychological assessment are carried out within 60 days following patient enrollment.
Neuropsychological assessment lasts 1:30 to 2:00 hours and is conducted by a psychologist in an interview during which patient will pass several tests on memory, language, attention or orientation in space.
These tests do not require discontinuation of Parkinson's disease treatment.</description>
