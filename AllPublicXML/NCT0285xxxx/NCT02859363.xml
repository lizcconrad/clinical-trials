  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid catabolism caused by a deficiency
      of the enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which leads to a progressive accumulation of
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) in plasma and tissue lysosomes throughout the body. Lysosomal
      accumulation can result in lysosomal and cellular dysfunction, which leads to renal, cardiac,
      and central nervous system (CNS) complications.

      It is estimated that 1 in 40,000 males has Fabry disease, whereas the estimated prevalence in
      the general population is 1 in 117,000 people. Newborn screenings for both classical and
      atypical Fabry disease in Taiwan also revealed a markedly high incidence of 1 in 2,300 and 1
      in 3,000 newborns. Cerebrovascular variant Fabry disease may affect up to 4.9% of male
      patients and 2.4% of female patients with idiopathic stroke.

      The diagnosis of Fabry disease can be challenging due to the diverse signs and symptoms,
      different ages of onset, and variable timing and severity of progression. The importance of
      Fabry disease lies in the irreversible renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and neurological
      damage. An early diagnosis of Fabry disease is important for initiating symptom management
      and reducing life-threatening complications, as well as for early identification of other
      affected family members. Therefore, the present study would like to conduct further screening
      of high-risk group of early cerebrovascular involvement that is essential for the successful
      management of Fabry disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, population-based study to identify Fabry disease in patients with
      early cerebrovascular involvement. Eligible patients are age above 18 years old (&lt;=55 years
      old) with early cerebrovascular involvement and have provided inform consent. Patients who
      have been diagnosed Fabry disease are not eligible.

      The present study will use samples of early cerebrovascular involvement patients which have
      been enrolled in two previous IRB approved projects [103-3254C (origin 98-3889A3), 100-4008C
      (origin 97-0470B)], participants of both studies have consented that participants' samples
      could be further investigated if needed.

      Since, the investigators cannot ensure whether the condition of enzyme activity of frozen
      plasma sample were decayed after long-term storage and the investigators don't have available
      normal range of enzyme activity of historical plasma sample, the investigators will perform
      specific genotyping of Fabry disease for these patients according to the specific mutation
      variants which have been identified in Taiwan population previously.

      Patients will be recalled to assess Fabry related symptoms if genetic testing has mutation
      finding and family screening will be performed if applicable. Further inform consent will be
      obtained as well.
