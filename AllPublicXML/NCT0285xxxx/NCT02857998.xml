      A Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of HMPL-523
      in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Mature B-cell Neoplasms
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two stages in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion
      stage (stage 2).

      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1):

      The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add additional
      3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied for dose
      escalation and maximum tolerated dosage determination. Approximately 21 to 36 dose limited
      toxicities evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of patients depends on the
      dose limited toxicities situation as well as the maximum tolerated dosage reached at this
      stage.

      Dosing will begin at 100mg once daily. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 28 days
      of continuous dosing.

      Dose-expansion stage (stage 2):

      This phase is to further evaluate the safety, the pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of
      HMPL-523 at recommended phase 2 dosage in approximately 20patients with relapsed or
      refractory Hematologic Malignancies.

      In this stage, approximately 56 patients with Mature B-cell Neoplasms will be enrolled with
      recommended phase 2 dosage as starting dose. The tumor types of the expansion stage are
      restricted to Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Mantle cell
      lymphoma (MCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) Subjects will receive HMPL-523 with every 28-day
      treatment cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity, whichever comes
      first.
