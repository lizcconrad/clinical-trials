  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to determine the pharmacokinetics of a new tablet formulation of
      GLPG1972 and to compare it with this of the liquid solution used during the First-in-Human
      study (GLPG1972-CL-101). The impact of food intake on the oral bioavailability of GLPG1972
      administered as tablet will also be investigated in this study. A dose of 600 mg has been
      selected. The study is a phase I randomized open-label cross-over study with three single
      dose treatments:

      A) 600 mg GLPG1972 oral solution after overnight fast,

      B) 600 mg GLPG1972 oral tablet after overnight fast,

      C) 600 mg GLPG1972 oral tablet 30 minutes after high-fat high-calorie breakfast.

      A washout of at least 6 days between subsequent dosing days is respected so that no
      measurable plasma levels or biologically significant effects are remaining. There will be
      frequent assessment of adverse experiences post-dose. Twelve healthy male subjects will be
      selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 2 subjects each will be
      randomized to one of the 6 treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA)
