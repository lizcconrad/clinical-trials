  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of infrared thermal imaging in the diagnosis and prognostication of septic
      illness in adults.

      During times of severe infection (sepsis), the small blood vessels supplying oxygen and
      nutrients to the skin and other organs (called the microcirculation), become abnormal and do
      not function as they normally would in health. Monitoring these small blood vessels is
      difficult to do clinically and the investigators want to investigate a new way of doing this.

      The aim of this study is to validate a novel method of assessing the function of the
      microcirculation in healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis, by measuring the skin
      temperature profile of the leg and face with a thermal imaging camera. Thermal imaging
      cameras measure the heat given off by all objects and represents this as a picture, with
      colour used to represent the different temperatures.

      Patients will be recruited from the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Units at
      University Hospitals of Leicester in to one of two groups based on their illness severity;
      uncomplicated sepsis and severe sepsis. Healthy volunteers will be recruited in to a third
      group. Recruitment will take place over a 6-month period with follow-up lasting for 12-months
      following recruitment. 105 participants will be recruited in total.

      Temperature patterns seen on the face and leg will be investigated between the different
      groups. Changes in these temperature patterns as patients recover from sepsis (or indeed
      become worse), will also be investigated. Information from the thermal images will be
      correlated to routinely measured markers of infection, including clinical measurements (blood
      pressure, pulse, etc) and routine blood investigations.
