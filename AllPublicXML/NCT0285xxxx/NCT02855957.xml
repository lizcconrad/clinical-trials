  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project aims to assess and validate an innovative prognostic and diagnostic test in order
      to i) define a severity index of the β-thalassemia according to the free α-Hb pool for a
      better management of the patient; ii) differentiate the α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia and
      iii) follow the evolution of this pool in response to treatment of patients. In the future,
      this prognostic test based on the measurement of free α-Hb pool may be suitable for routine
      laboratory practice. To carry out this project, cohort of 85 thalassemic patients and a group
      of 50 healthy volunteers have been recruited.
