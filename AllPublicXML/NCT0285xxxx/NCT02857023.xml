  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disease-related neurocognitive deficits are common in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD).
      These deficits can significantly disrupt otherwise normal trajectories toward academic and
      vocational achievement and negatively impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite widespread
      recognition of neurocognitive deficits, there are no treatments shown to maintain or recover
      functioning once a child with SCD endures neuronal damage. Cognitive training (CT) has been a
      standard intervention used to stabilize and recover functioning in individuals with
      accidental or disease-related brain injury. Recent advances in technology have led to the
      development of computerized CT programs. This study seeks to assess the feasibility and
      efficacy of using computerized CT with pediatric patients with SCD. Children and adolescents
      with SCD between the ages of 7 and 16 years old (n = 80) will be recruited to complete a
      randomized (intervention or waitlist-control) home-based computerized CT program (Cogmed).
      Feasibility will be assessed by examining participation, retention, and program completion
      rates, as well as feedback from a feasibility and acceptability questionnaire and a brief
      qualitative interview. Participants will also complete assessments of attention, working
      memory, and academic fluency at baseline and immediately following the intervention. A final
      assessment will be conducted 6 months after the conclusion of the intervention to evaluate
      the stability of treatment effects.
