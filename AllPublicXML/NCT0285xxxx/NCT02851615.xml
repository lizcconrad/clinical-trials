  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SCThrive, a
      an innovative, technology-enhanced, group self-management intervention that uses a mixed
      in-person and online format and supported by a tailored mHealth tool, iManage. The study will
      also evaluate the initial efficacy of SCThrive for increasing behavioral activation (BA) in
      adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) ages 13 to 21. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants in the SCThrive group will show greater BA (primary outcome) at post-treatment
      than the attention control group, and that participants in the SCThrive group will continue
      to show significantly greater BA at the six week follow-up compared to the attention control
      group. Investigators will also explore whether SCThrive is associated with greater
      improvements in self-management behaviors and quality of life (secondary outcome) compared to
      attention control at the six-week follow-up assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient of CCHMC Sickle Cell Clinic.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of SCD with SS, SB0Thal or SC genotype.

          -  13-21 years of age.

          -  On or eligible for disease-modifying therapies.

          -  Caregiver (or AYA &gt; 18 years) consent that the participant will be the sole user of
             the tablet, report immediately if it is damaged or lost, return it at the end of the
             study, and log on to sessions from a private location.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  another chronic disease (which would complicate measurement of behavioral activation)

          -  Non-English-speaking (&lt;5% of the target population); or

          -  cognitive or psychiatric disorder that the physician or study therapists believe would
             impair study participation. Patients who desire participation but are not eligible
             will be referred to the SCD Clinic social worker for assistance with self-management
             as this is the usual procedure.
