  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first study with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase
      inhibitor, in subjects with moderate to severe RA who are currently being treated with
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The primary objective of the study is to
      investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral doses of GSK2982772 in subjects with
      moderate to severe RA. In addition to the PK, a number of experimental and clinical endpoints
      will be employed to obtain information on the PD, and preliminary efficacy in subjects with
      active RA. Although no formal hypothesis will be tested, these endpoints will enable a
      broader understanding of the mechanism of action and potential for clinical efficacy of
      GSK2982772 in RA. After a screening period of up to 30 days, approximately 24 subjects will
      be randomized to receive either GSK2982772 or placebo for 84 days (12 weeks), followed by a
      follow-up period (28 days). The total duration of participation in the study will be
      approximately 20 weeks from screening to the last study visit.

             that in the opinion of the Investigator put the subject at unacceptable risk or
             interfere with study assessments or integrity of the data. These medical conditions
             should be stable at the time of screening and are expected to remain stable for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis according to the revised
             2010 ACR-EULAR classification criteria.

          -  Disease duration of &gt;=12 weeks (time from onset of patient-reported symptoms of either
             pain or stiffness or swelling in hands, feet or wrists) at screening.

          -  Swollen joint count of &gt;=4 (28-joint count) and tender joint count &gt;=4 (28-joint
             count) at screening.

          -  Subject has a DAS28 CRP disease activity score of &gt;= 3.2 and CRP &gt;= 5.0 mg/liter (L)
             (&gt;=4.76 nanomole (nmol)/L) at screening.

          -  Subject must have received at least 12 weeks of non-biologic DMARD monotherapy or

             the study.

          -  Subject is naive to any biological therapies for RA or subject may have had previous
             exposure to a single anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agent which was
             discontinued for reasons other than primary non-response more than 8 weeks (or 5 half
             lives whichever is longer) from first dose.

          -  For subjects who have consented to synovial joint biopsy:

             • Subject has an involved knee, wrist, or ankle suitable for biopsy, as assessed by a
             rheumatologist at screening.

             Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or a history of attempted suicide.

          -  An active infection, or a history of infections as follows:

               -  Hospitalization for treatment of infection within 60 days before first dose (Day
                  1).

               -  Currently on any suppressive therapy for a chronic infection (such as
                  pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster and atypical

                  (antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, or antiparasitic agents) for an
                  infection within 60 days before first dose.

               -  A history of opportunistic infections within 1 year of screening (e.g.
                  pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus [CMV] pneumonitis, aspergillosis). This
                  does not include infections that may occur in immunocompetent individuals, such
                  as fungal nail infections or vaginal candidiasis, unless it is of an unusual
                  severity or recurrent nature.

                  Gold test or T-spot test. In cases where the QuantiFERON or T-spot test is
                  indeterminate, the subject may have the test repeated once, but they will not be
                  eligible for the study unless the second test is negative. In cases where the
                  QuantiFERON or T-spot test is positive, but a locally-read follow up chest x-ray,
                  shows no evidence of current or previous pulmonary tuberculosis, the subject may
                  be eligible for the study at the discretion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
                  Monitor.

          -  Electrocardiogram QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec)
             or QTc &gt; 480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block at screening.

        The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula
        (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual over read. The
        specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
        individual subject should be determined and documented prior to initiation of the study. In
        other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
        individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject
        from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula,
        or a composite of available values of QTc will be used.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35 percent) at screening.

          -  Current active or chronic history of liver or biliary disease (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Current or history of renal disease or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by
             Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI) calculation &lt;60

          -  Hereditary or acquired immunodeficiency disorder, including immunoglobulin deficiency.

          -  A major organ transplant (e.g., heart, lung, kidney, liver) or hematopoietic stem
             cell/marrow transplant.

          -  Any planned surgical procedures including surgical joint procedures (e.g.,
             intra-articular, tendon sheath, or bursal corticosteroid injections) during the study.

          -  A history of malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated
             non-metastatic cancers of the skin (basal or squamous cell) or carcinoma in situ of
             the uterine cervix that has been fully treated and shows no evidence of recurrence.

          -  Has undergone surgery including synovectomy or arthroplasty on the joint chosen for
             biopsy and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  The subject has a history of any other joint disease other than RA at the knee, wrist
             or ankle joint chosen for biopsy and/or MRI (e.g., gout, pseudogout, osteoarthritis).

          -  Has undergone intra-articular corticosteroid injection, arthrocentesis or synovial
             biopsy on any joint within 6 weeks of screening.

          -  A known allergy to lidocaine or other local anesthetics (only applies to subjects who
             consent for synovial biopsy procedures).

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning (as assessed by local MRI safety questionnaire) which
             includes but are not limited to:

               -  Intracranial aneurysm clips (except SugitaTM) or other metallic objects,

               -  History of intra-orbital metal fragments that have not been removed by a medical
                  professional.

             • Other medications (including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements) will be
             considered on a case-by-case basis, and will be allowed if in the opinion of the
             Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the ability to comply with
             the study.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study treatments, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. As
