      The goal of the study is to investigate if the active agent of Sinuclean Nebules is
      efficacious in the treatment of pediatric exudative otitis media, comparing with saline.

      Sinuclean Nebules is a solution of cucurbitacins B,D,I,E (glycosylated triterpenes) 45 mcg,
      extracted from Ecballium Elaterium.

      Eligible pediatric subjects with diagnosis of mono or bi-lateral exudative otitis media
      (obtained with otorhinolaryngologic endoscopic examination, tympanogram and tonal
      audiometry), are randomized to treatment with Sinuclean Nebules 45 or saline.

      Treatment is administered by trained caregiver with nebulizer (Rinowash Nasal Shower): one
      nebulization/nostril/day for two cycles of 10 consecutive days. Cycles are interrupted by a
      period of 7 days.

      Visits 1 Baseline T0: confirmation of eligibility, randomization, training of caregiver,
      dispensation of blinded therapy for two cycles, delivery of the clinical diary.

      Visit 2 after 10 days of therapy + 7 days of interval: phone call to check for adverse
      events, therapy adherence, concomitant diseases and treatments, and to prescribe second cycle
      of therapy.

      Visit 3 End of Study: assessment of the exudative otitis media with otorhinolaryngologic
      endoscopic examination, tympanogram tonal audiometry, verification of the subject's clinical
      diary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of mono or bi-lateral exudative otitis media, performed the day
             of recruitment or in the week before, with endotympanic effusion present for at least
             3 months, and hearing loss.

          -  The diagnostic criteria is type B tympanogram for at least one of the two ears.

          -  The criteria is integrated by a) tonal audiometry to demonstrate bilateral or
             monolateral deficit (loss of more than 20dB averaged to 0.5-1.2 and 4Khz in the best
             ear with pure tone audiometry); for 1-3 yo subjects the audiometry is behavioural b)
             otorhinolaryngologic examination in endoscopy for the otologic, rhino-sinusal and
             pharyngeal districts.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Outcomes of adenotonsillectomy
