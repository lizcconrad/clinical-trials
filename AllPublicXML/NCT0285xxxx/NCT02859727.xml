  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide long-term CDZ173 treatment, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, to
      the patients with genetically activated PI3Kδ, i.e., patients with APDS/PASLI that already
      participated to the CDZ173X2201 study. The study is open-label designed to establish the
      long-term safety, tolerability, efficay and pharmacokinetics of CDZ173 in the target
      population.
