  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human gut microbiota has become the subject of extensive research in recent years,
      particularly in regards to the role it plays in obesity. Although lifestyle factors, diet,
      and lack of exercise contribute largely to this obesity epidemic, there is increasing
      evidence that the human gut microbiota also influences weight gain.

      The investigators hope to learn more information about the change in gut microbiota,
      especially with regards to those who are successful with weight loss, versus those who don't
      lose weight, after participating in a lifestyle modification program at the Dan Abraham
      Healthy Living Center (DAHLC).

      The gut microbiome is altered in obesity and is being increasingly studied given its role in
      energy harvest and fat storage with the hopeful goal of discovering a modifiable intervention
      to affect obesity and its consequences. Mouse models have already shown that transplantation
      of an obese microbiota into germ-free mice yields increased adiposity compared to
      transplantation of a lean microbiota. In humans, initial studies looked at the relative
      proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in obese versus lean individuals and then followed
      those obese individuals who lost weight on low-calorie diets. The relative proportion of
      Bacteroidetes was decreased in obese people, and this then increased with weight loss. While
      certainly provocative, the findings were not consistently reproduced.

      Subjects will include members of the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center (DAHLC) program or the
      Healthy Living Program (HLP) at Mayo Clinic Rochester, who are seeking advice for weight
      management concerns.
