  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related depression in more than a dozen
      controlled clinical trials. Symptom reduction was greatest during long-term follow-ups after
      the completion of the therapy.

      In the current study, we will investigate the progression of PTSD symptoms and emotional
      stress before, during and after therapy. After a semi-structured interview all participants
      will be asked to report in monthly telephone interviews their core symptoms. Structured
      interviews after 6 and 12 months are used to validate the outcome. A convenience sample of
      individuals with a PTSD will be offered participation in the study.

      Participants will be recruited through the Center of Excellence for Psychotraumatology,
      University of Konstanz, with focus on refugees. All of them (approx. 100) will receive a
      structured interview and a detailed diagnosis. The interview includes questions about
      sociodemography, traumatic events, PTSD and depression symptomatology. Individuals with a
      PTSD diagnosis (up to 30) will be offered a Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET).

      Irrespective of treatment and diagnosis, respondents are asked to participate in monthly
      telephone interviews assessing trauma-related and emotional distress and changes in life.
      Interviews assessing PTSD, depression symptoms and emotional distress will be conducted 6 and
      12 months after the initial interview.

      In addition, participants receiving NET will rate their PTSD symptoms and functionality prior
      to each therapy session.
