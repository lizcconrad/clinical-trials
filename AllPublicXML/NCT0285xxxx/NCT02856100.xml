  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We intend to validate 18F-DCFPyL for imaging patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa
      (CRPC), so that it may be used to full advantage in supporting existing and emerging
      therapies for a spectrum of patients suffering from PCa. In this study we will image patients
      with CRPC undergoing second-line anti-androgen therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone) using
      18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT for detection of metastases and therapeutic monitoring, with correlation to
      standard-of-care conventional imaging modalities (CIM) (CT, bone scan) and clinical
      follow-up.
