      This is a multicenter, non-controlled, prospective study. 250 subjects (GTS standard and
      lateralized) will be recruited. Study will be conducted in centers across Europe.

      The objective of this prospective clinical study is to obtain multi-center, long-term
      (10-year) clinical data on the new GTS® femoral stem in its standard and lateralized versions
      as part of Post Market Surveillance requirements.

      The initial study assessment period will be 12 years; 24 months recruitment and the follow-up
      clinical reviews for all patients will be at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7
      years and 10 years.
