  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators sonicate the bearing components of the explanted hip
      prosthesis which allows highly sensitive detection of in vivo biofilms (qualitatively and
      quantitatively). The hip prosthesis bearing components are composed from different material.
      The purpose of this study is to analyse the resistance against biofilm adhesion of ceramic,
      metal and polyethylene prosthesis components through microbiologic analysis of sonicates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main reasons for hip prosthesis failure are aseptic loosening and periprosthetic joint
      infection (PJI). The real frequency of PJI is probably largely underestimated because of
      non-standardized definition criteria, diagnostic procedure, treatment algorithm and other
      confounders. Therefore, data from joint registries are not reflecting the frequency of PJI
      and can be misleading; particularly low-grade PJI can be frequently misdiagnosed as aseptic
      failure.

      Microbiological analysis of sonicate has in comparison with joint aspirate significantly
      higher sensitivity and specificity, which allows better detection of low grade infection.
      With aspiration only free-floating, high metabolically active, planktonic form of bacteria
      could be collected. Contrarily, the less metabolically active bacteria are hidden under the
      biofilm can remain undetected.

      Sonication of prosthetic material mechanically dislodge the biofilm from surface and expose
      the sessile bacteria for the microbiological analysis.

      All foreign materials provoke biofilm formation however, different materials showed different
      resistance for biofilm adhesion.

      In this study patients with PJI are undergoing standard one- or two- stage revision procedure
      of the hip. The removed bearing components will be sonicated and sent in microbiological
      analysis. The ceramic, metal and polyethylene prosthesis components will undergo qualitative
      and quantitative microbiological analysis. The materials will be compared regarding to the
      presence of biofilm formation.
