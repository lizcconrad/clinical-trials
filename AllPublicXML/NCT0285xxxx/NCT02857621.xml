  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a condition characterized by excess accumulation of protein rich tissue fluid
      in interstitial spaces. It is a progressive chronic disease and without appropriate
      management may result in serious complications. In Israel, patients are referred to
      physiotherapists certified in treatment for lymphedema. According to the International
      Society of Lymphology (ISL) the best treatment is a holistic, multidiscipline approach.
      Amongst the different methods of lymphedema management, the use of compression is the only
      treatment that has shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials.

      The ISL recommends that patients with lymphedema in the lower limb ought to bandage their leg
      with multi-layer bandaging on a daily basis for a period of two to four weeks. A new
      classification system for compression bandages was recommended; pressure of &lt;20 mmHg was
      categorized as mild, 20-40 mmHg as medium, 40-60 mmHg as strong and ≥60 mmHg as very strong.
      In patients with leg edema, bandages with strong pressure were shown to be the most
      effective. However, in the presence of a venous ulcer on a lymphatic leg, pressure between 35
      and 45 mmHg is the widely accepted range for sufficient and safe compression. The use of
      measurement instruments is currently the only realistic method for determining the actual
      pressure achieved beneath the bandage. However, it is neither economical nor feasib¬le nor is
      it realistic in terms of time.

      Recent studies show that many healthcare professionals use inadequate sub-bandage pressure.
      No study so far has focused on therapists that are trained in lymphatic treatment. In spite
      of correct pressure bandaging importance, the question whether physiotherapists succeed in
      correctly applying it is left unanswered. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      pressure applying efficiency in multi-layer bandaging among physiotherapists in Israel who
      treat lymphedema.

      34 physiotherapists trained in lymphatic treatment will be recruited for this research. Each
      volunteer will receive a questionnaire concerning their self-perceived competence in the
      application of compression bandages. Afterwards, two practical trials will be held a week
      apart in which the subjects will be asked to apply bandages using strong and medium pressure.
      Using PicoPress®, pressure will be measured directly after bandaging and two hours later. Our
      hypothesis is that the majority of therapists will properly apply medium or strong pressure
      on the lower limbs.
