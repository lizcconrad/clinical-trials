  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 2009 and January 2016, the investigators included 49 patients from four hospitals in
      Lyon who had a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) infection and who benefited of a knee
      arthroplasty revision with a rotating hinge prosthesis. This retrospective and descriptive
      cohort aims at studying the functional results after 2 years follow up.

        Patients having a hinge knee prosthesis following an infection on a total knee prosthesis .

        Pre-operative characteristics studied :

        Clinical characteristics : medical and surgical history on the index knee included the
        strategy of the infection treatment (one step treatment vs two steps treatment)and general
        contributing factors of infection, frontal laxity, join motions, initial constraint of the
        infected TKA, skin condition ( skin necrosis, fistula, flap need, scar condition)
        paraclinical characteristics : bone defects, condition of knee extensor system (
        continuance, height of patella, joint space height (when possible to measure)), prosthethic
        sealing or unsealing on CT-scan or scintigraphy, causal germ(s)
