    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of airway management (a set of medical
      procedures performed to prevent airway blockage and thus ensure an open path between a
      patient's lungs and the atmosphere) during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      [(ERCP), a procedure commonly used to treat conditions of the bile ducts and pancreas] and
      the effect on airway complications (problems), time to biliary cannulation (access into bile
      duct) and total procedure duration (length of time). Two methods are being compared and
      studied: 1) general endotracheal anesthesia: an inhalation anesthetic (substance that blocks
      pain) technique in which anesthetic and respiratory gases pass through a tube placed in the
      trachea (throat) via the mouth or nose vs 2) deep sedation without endotracheal intubation:
      local anesthesia together with sedation (drug that produces sleep) and analgesia (drug that
      treats pain) only.
