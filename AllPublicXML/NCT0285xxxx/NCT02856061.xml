  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study examines concurrent and predictive relationships between eye tracking and
      clinical outcomes during a 16-week behavioral intervention (PRT) for children with ASD. Eye
      tracking will be comprised of both laboratory-based measures (using a commercial eye-tracking
      system) as well as home-based measures (using tablet-based eye tracking systems). The major
      goals of this study are both to improve our understanding of the potential role of eye
      tracking in clinical trials and to advance technologies that may further improve the
      sensitivity, robustness, accessibility, and ultimate utility of eye tracking methodologies.

    <intervention_name>Pivotal Response Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>Pivotal response treatment (PRT) is an empirically validated behavioral treatment for individuals with ASD that has its foundation in principles of Applied Behavioral Analysis. It was designed to improve social communication skills by addressing core deficits in social motivation or pivotal responses. By working specifically with each child's natural motivations, PRT focuses on naturalistic, functional skills, as opposed to rote skills. In this study, participants randomized to the PRT group will receive 6 hours of direct PRT, across three sessions per week, provided by Dr. Ventola's clinical team. Parents will have an additional one-hour session per week focused on PRT parent training using a practice-with-feedback model. Specific intervention goals in our target population include: Speech to respond to inquiries, Speech to inquire, Speech to comment, Reciprocal conversation, Monitor nonverbal information, and Perspective taking.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals ages 4-7 years diagnosed previously with ASD and meet criteria for ASD
             when characterized by our research team, English is a language spoken in the family,
             and Full-scale IQ&gt;50. Participants must also complete laboratory and home-based eye
             tracking sessions, with success determined by the Principal Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals will be excluded from participation based on the presence of

               1. a physical or neurological disorder (e.g., cerebral palsy) which is likely to
                  impact development and learning, as intervention procedures for these individuals
                  may need to be modified beyond the standard approach to address more complex
                  developmental needs,

               2. hearing loss or other severe sensory impairment,

               3. history of significant head trauma or serious brain or psychiatric illness,

               4. parents/caregivers who do not speak fluent English,

               5. parents/caregivers who have previous training in PRT

               6. individuals who must be excluded from eye tracking. These families will be
                  offered the treatment clinically (i.e., fee-based), and they will be given
                  referrals to outside agencies offering the treatment as well.
