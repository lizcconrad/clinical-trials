  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators consider that there are some rising concerns about the use of isotretinoin
      by women of reproductive age with depleted ovarian reserve, hence it is important to detect
      the effect of isotretinoin on ovarian reserve.

      There has not been a well-designed study evaluating its effects on the human ovarian reserve,
      hormone levels and menstrual cycles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For this
      reasons, this study was administered to determine whether there is an effect of isotretinoin
      on the gonads and hirsutism in women with acne and PCOS.
