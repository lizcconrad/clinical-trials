  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CC-122-HCC-002 is a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-122 in
      combination with nivolumab in subjects with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who
      have progressed after or were intolerant to no more than 2 previous systemic therapies for
      unresectable HCC, or are naïve to systemic therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will have received either none or no more than 2 previous systemic therapies. The
      dose escalation part of the study will explore 1 or more dose levels of CC-122 in combination
      with nivolumab using a modified dose escalation (3+3) design, followed by an expansion part
      once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined.

      A modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to identify the initial toxicity of the
      combination. Up to six subjects will be concurrently enrolled into a dose level. Decisions as
      to which dose level to enroll a new subject will be based on the number of subjects enrolled
      and evaluable, the number of subjects experiencing DLTs, and the number of subjects enrolled
      but who are not yet evaluable for toxicity in the current cohort at the time of new subject
      entry.
