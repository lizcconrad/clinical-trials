      It is commonly accepted that the characteristics of the organ donor impact on the future post
      transplant. In lung transplantation (LP), the defining characteristics of the &quot;ideal&quot; donor
      includes an age less than 55 years. However, before the pulmonary graft shortage with a
      corresponding mortality still too high waiting list, the lung graft acceptance criteria were
      reassessed permitting criteria &quot;extension&quot; ( &quot;marginal&quot; graft). And were grafted, depending
      on the urgency and accessibility problems in the registry of potential candidate, organs from
      donors aged 55 and older with quite comparable to those obtained from younger donors .
      Nevertheless, it is common practice that the grafts from older donors are more readily
      allocated to older candidates and the most severe, as many confounding factors to assess the
      real impact of donor age on post-transplant evolution on small cohorts.

      The main goal of this study is to compare the survival of lung transplant patients depending
      on the age difference between donor and recipient.

      The study will be conducted from a broad national cohort of lung transplant patients
      registered in COLT ( Lung Transplantation COhort). Established in September 2009, promoted by
      the University Hospital of Nantes, COLT involves 11 lung transplant centers authorized on
      French territory. It provides a standardized common longitudinal monitoring of the recipient
      from his transplant. Currently more than 1,000 patients included in this study are
      transplanted.
