    <textblock>
      This study will clinically evaluate a newly developed respiratory monitor - pneuRIP. The
      pneuRIP uses Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP) bands to measure key breathing
      indices non-invasively. This study compares the pneuRIP to an existing Respitrace system
      (Carefusion, Yorba Linda CA). 10 normal children and 10 children with breathing difficulties
      will be monitored with both systems.

      Firstly, ten healthy children will participate in a trial to evaluate the pneuRIP. They will
      be fitted with the bands around their abdomen and chest. The pneuRIP will be connected to the
      bands through electrodes. Breathing is then measured wirelessly with an iPad. They will be
      asked to lie down. They are asked to breath normally then asked to breath with a resistive
      elements to place in their mouth. The resistive elements makes it difficult to breath
      (similar to breathing through a straw). They will breathe for 3 minutes for both conditions
      as we record their breathing with the pneuRIP and the Respitrace. These data will be
      compared.

      Secondly, A group of 10 subjects from the outpatient muscle clinic will be fitted with the
      chest and abdomen bands. The Respitrace monitor and the pneuRIP will record their breathing
      patterns. Data from the two systems will then be compared.
