    <textblock>
      The current study included the singleton pregnancies (without history of previous risk
      factors), had their homocysteine measured as part of a serum-screening program in addition to
      uterine artery Doppler. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values,
      for development of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes were assessed as
      follows; (1) Homocysteine cutoff level at 6.3 µmol/l; (2) Bilateral notches on Doppler with a
      mean RI &gt;0.5, all unilateral notches with a mean RI &gt;0.6, in addition, absence of notches
      with a mean RI &gt;0.7; (3) Doppler assessment combined with the homocysteine cutoff (6.3
      µmol/l).

      These participants had uterine artery Doppler investigations, as part of a routine scan
      between the 18th and the 22nd week of pregnancy. The investigators were blinded to the
      results of the biochemistry results.

      All samples of the tHcy measurement were collected between 15 and 19 weeks of gestational
      age, as calculated from the last menstrual period or from early ultrasound dates (when the
      menstrual dates differed from the specified gestation). The plasma tHcy concentrations were
      measured by means of a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (9).

      Uterine artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained using an SD 800 Doppler system (Philips
      Medical Systems, Gland, Switzerland) with a 3.5/5-MHz linear array probe. The high-pass
      filter was set at 100 Hz. One operator performed the measurements. The use of mean resistance
      index (RI) cutoff points with bilateral and unilateral notches has already been shown to
      improve the efficacy of uterine artery Doppler screening using qualitative assessment (10). A
      screen-positive or abnormal result was defined as bilateral notches and a mean RI &gt;0.55 (50th
      centile), unilateral notches and a mean RI &gt;0.65 (80th centile), and absence of notches and a
      mean RI &gt;0.7 (95th centile) (11). Women with these abnormal results were offered growth
      scans, amniotic fluid volume assessment, and umbilical artery Doppler every 4 weeks until 36
      weeks in view of the recognized increased risk of isolated IUGR (12), unless there were other
      clinical indications, which necessitated closer surveillance
