  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMB-001 is a combination of 2 drugs: the cortisol synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone
      (Metopirone®), and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, oxazepam (original trade name Serax®;
      now marketed as oxazepam (generic) only).

      This Phase 1b cocaine interaction study is being conducted in order to assess the safety and
      PK of EMB-001 and cocaine in combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, multiple-dose, PLB controlled, 2-period,
      4-sequence, crossover study design.

      After establishing eligibility approximately 16 subjects with cocaine use disorder will be
      randomized to one of four sequences.

      Treatment periods will be separated by a 7-day in-patient washout period. EMB-001/PLB will be
      orally administered for 7 consecutive days, BID for 6 days (starting on Day 1 and Day 15)
      followed on the last day (Day 7 and Day 21) by one EMB-001/PLB oral dose in the morning.
      Infusion of 40 mg IV cocaine and IV saline-to-match cocaine infusion will be administered in
      a randomized order, 2 hours apart, starting 3 hours after the last morning EMB-001/PLB oral
      administration.

      The subjects will be discharged from the research clinic 2 days after the last dose of
      cocaine, and will have a follow-up visit 7 days after last dose.

    <ipd_description>Every three months, the NIDA DSMB will convene to review the overall safety data, as well as data on safety summarized by treatment condition. As per NIH guidelines, the objective of these reviews will be to determine whether continued conduct of the trial poses any undue risk for participants.
