  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial in research participants with chronic persistent
      vascular facial erythema. All eligible research participants will receive Mirvaso® gel once
      daily for 4 weeks, and then will be followed-up for another 2 weeks.

      The study will include 4 clinical visits: before Day 1, on Day 1, Day 29 and Week 6.

      Within 5 days before Day 1, the research participant will have a screening visit for
      confirmation of eligibility.

      On Day 1 and on Day 29, the research participant will have Mirvaso® gel applied, at the
      research site, and the evaluation will be conducted before application and 3 hours after
      application; During Days 2-28, research participants will have Mirvaso® gel applied once
      daily, at home; On Week 6, the research participants will go back to the research site for
      evaluation. No Mirvaso® gel will be applied after the visit on Day 29; Unscheduled visits may
      be performed during the trial for any safety reason.
