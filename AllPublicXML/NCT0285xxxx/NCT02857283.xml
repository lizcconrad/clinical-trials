      To investigate if low level ozone exposure will cause measurable inflammation in nasal cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Air pollutants including ozone have been implicated in affecting health outcomes. In
      particular, high level ozone exposure has been shown to affect pulmonary function and cause
      pulmonary inflammation. Troubling community-based work has implicated high ozone levels as
      being correlated with increased pediatric asthma ED visits. Because of adverse health
      effects, EPA standards for safe ozone levels have been set, currently at 0.07 ppm. Still, it
      is estimated that 100 million Americans live in areas where ozone levels periodically remain
      above the EPA standard. And while this EPA standard had been set based on available data, it
      remained unclear at the time whether naturalistic low-level ozone exposure, such as
      fluctuations between 0.06-0.08 ppm throughout the day, might affect health as well.

      This group previously examined lung function and inflammatory response in adults exposed to
      low-level ozone, 0.06 ppm exposure for 6.6 hours, while undergoing intermittent moderate
      exercise. The investigators found that in response to low-level ozone exposure (0.06 ppm)
      with exercise, lung function declines and neutrophilic airway inflammation is observed. What
      remains unclear, is whether low-level ozone alone - without exercise - will cause similar
      health effects.

      To mimic exposure to ozone on a typical summer day in a polluted city, the investigators will
      expose subjects to a varying level of ozone, form 0.06 ppm to 0.08 ppm, rather than a
      constant 0.07ppm. The variation from 0.06ppm to 0.08ppm, then back to 0.06ppm will occur each
      hour.

    <measure>Change in % Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte (PMN) in nasal lavage fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be exposed to either filtered air (FA) or ozone (O3). Nasal lavage fluid will be collected from participants at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks), immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and again at 24 hours after the exposure. The change in nasal PMN counts from baseline to immediately post- and 24 hours post-exposure will be measured and compared between FA and O3.</description>

    <measure>Nasal epithelial cell gene expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>RNA isolated from nasal epithelial cell biopsies collected at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks) and immediately after exposure to either FA or O3 will be analyzed via qRT-PCR to determine the impact of O3 on inflammatory gene expression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nasal Immune mediators of cytokines</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Protein detection assays, such as ELISAs, will be used to quantitate the amount of immune mediators present in the nasal passage. Nasal lavage fluid and epithelial lining fluid will be collected from participants at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks), immediately after exiting the exposure chamber, and again at 24 hours after the exposure. The difference between the amount of protein will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on the production of nasal immune mediators.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sputum cell counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a hypertonic saline induced sputum procedure at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks) to either FA or O3, and again at 24 hours following the exposure. Sputum will be assessed for cellularity.</description>

    <measure>Change in FEV1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function of participants will be assessed via spirometry at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks), immediately after exposure to either FA or O3, and again at 24 hours after the exposure to examine the impact of O3 on lung function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Flow mediated dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo flow-mediated brachial artery dilation at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks), and immediately after exposure to either FA or O3 to assess the impact of O3 exposure on endothelial function.</description>

    <measure>Change in left ventricular contractility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular mechanics will be assessed at baseline prior to exposure (within six weeks), and immediately after the exposure by measuring global longitudinal strain using speckle tracking echocardiography. The change in global longitudinal strain will be calculated to determine the effect of ozone on left ventricular contractility.</description>
