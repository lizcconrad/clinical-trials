      The investigators will investigate the interrelationship of macrophage migration inhibitory
      factor (MIF) and free T4 in patients with PAH.

      The investigators will test our hypothesis and accomplish our objectives by pursuing three
      Specific Aims:

      To investigate the interrelationship between macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and
      free T4 in patients with PAH with a working hypothesis that an increased release of MIF into
      the pulmonary vasculature during cardiopulmonary exercise changes the normal balance between
      plasma MIF and T4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age and have confirmed pulmonary hypertension
             (PH) and interstitial lung disease (ILD).

          -  ILD was identified on high resolution computed tomography along with a total lung
             capacity (TLC) &lt;70% of predicted value on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with no
             evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram.

          -  PAH group patients were defined as patients with a mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25
             mmHg at rest and a wedge pressure of &lt;15 mmHg (millimeters of mercury), measured by
             right heart catheterization (WHO group I PAH).

          -  PH+ILD group, subjects with evidence of ILD on high resolution CT Scan and mean
             pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25 mmHg on right heart catheterization.

          -  Patient with evidence of Chronic thromboembolic disease on CT angiogram and mean
             pulmonary artery pressure &gt;25mmHg on right heart catheterization. (WHO group IV)

          -  Patient with Pulmonary Hypertension due to other conditions, such as Sarcoidosis,
             Gauchers disease, Hemolytic Anemia and Myeloproliferative disorders.

          -  Normal control group: Subjects without cardiopulmonary disease, with a normal PFT and
             ECG.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to obtain informed consent;

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Subjects with cardiopulmonary disease other than PH and ILD;

          -  Unexplained abnormal PFT, ECG, Routine blood/chemistries test

          -  History or existing other sever organ/system diseases

          -  Defined Acute pulmonary embolism
