  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to develop and validate a scale adapted to French cultural
      characteristics. It will be based on the SS-QoL scale and be simple and quick to use in
      everyday practice. It is not simply a translation. This transcultural adaptation requires
      linguistic and psychometric validation, by studying its validity, its reliability and its
      sensitivity to change, as though it were a new instrument. The investigators will then
      develop a short version by reducing the items and conduct a psychometric validation.

      The translation and validation of a short French version of the SS-QoL scale will generate a
      reliable and sensitive, easy-to-use tool suitable for use in everyday practice.

      The final objective is to use this tool as a principal judgement criterion in future
      therapeutic trials and in patients of the Dijon Stroke Registry to bring to light prognostic
      factors that affect quality of life so as to provide better management of this disease.
