  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is rising. Based on the latest
      Thai National Health Examination Survey, an estimated 3.2 million people had DM, of whom
      one-third was undiagnosed. The inexpensive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a more
      sensitive and reliable test of DM than fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1c, and is
      recommended for diagnosing DM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Although the OGTT
      provides useful diagnostic information, poor patient tolerance of glucose solutions is
      inevitable.

    <textblock>
      Regarding the diagnosis of DM, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) identifies about 2% more
      individuals than does fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Hence OGTT is the method that has high
      sensitivity compared to other methods for diagnosis of IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and
      diabetes. However, standard OGTT with 75-g glucose has poor patient tolerance and might cause
      reactive hypoglycemia. The alternatives for 75-g glucose would help for screening of DM with
      better tolerance. There were previous studies investigated substitutes for oral glucose
      solution with cookies and muffin. In the present study we hypothesized that an alternative
      food such as ice cream, a favorite dessert, can use for evaluation of the diagnosis of DM and
      IGT instead of standard 75-g glucose.

    <description>75-g glucose A blood sample will be collected when the participants arrive. This is a fasting blood glucose value. Then the participants will be asked to drink a sweet liquid containing 75 g-glucose. Blood samples will be collected at timed intervals of 1 and 2 hours after you drink the glucose. This is a standard method for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that called oral glucose tolerance test or OGTT.</description>

    <description>A blood sample will be collected when the participants arrive. This is a fasting blood glucose value. Then the participants will be asked to drink ice cream that contained carbohydrate 73.9 g.

    <description>The ice cream was made by nutritionists in Ramathibodi Hospital. It consisted of cornstarch, milk, sucrose, milk powder, egg yolk, and banana which contained carbohydrate 73.9 g, fat 27.7 g, protein 18.9 g for a total of 620.9 kcal with a cost of 35 bahts. The time for complete ingesting 75-g glucose and ice cream was 5 and 15 minutes, respectively.</description>
