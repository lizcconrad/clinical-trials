      Investigators aimed to investigate the association between over active bladder and coronary
      artery disease as demonstrated on coronary angiography.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The close relationship has been demonstrated between pelvic ischemia and overactive bladder
      (OAB) in a study involving elderly patients. In this study, it has been found that pelvic
      ischemia has triggered OAB and it has been related with cardiac ischemia. The aim of this
      study was to delineate the correlation between OAB and the degree of coronary artery stenosis
      as demonstrated on coronary angiography.
