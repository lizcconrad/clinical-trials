  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a prospective non-blinded and semi-randomized clinical investigation.
      The investigation is designed to assess the alternative sizing model which the trial mask
      concept is based on and how it compares to a conventional sizing present in the Prototype
      Full Face Mask (PFFM) mask.

      The investigation is a prospective non-blinded and semi-randomized investigation. The
      investigation is designed to assess the alternative sizing model which the trial mask concept
      is based on and how it compares to a conventional sizing present in the Prototype Full Face
      Mask (PFFM) mask. A cohort of up to 38 pre-determined current nasal and full face mask users
      will be recruited by Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare in Auckland New Zealand, Waikato DHB in
      Hamilton New Zealand, Hawkes Bay DHB in Hastings New Zealand and WellSleep Centre in
      Wellington New Zealand.

      The study will involve baseline (visit one) gathering the participants' prescribed PAP
      therapy pressure and their usual mask (to have up-to-date records). The next visit (visit 2)
      7 ± 4 days after visit 1, the participants will be fit the Prototype Full Face Mask (PFFM)
      mask or the alternative sizing based trial mask. At visit 3, which will be after 7 ± 4 days
      from visit 2, the participants will be crossed over to the mask. At visit 4, 7 ± 4 days after
      visit 3, all masks and devices will be collected from the participants.
