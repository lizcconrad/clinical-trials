  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major health concern. Weeks following psychiatric admission are a highly suicide
      risk period for those having current suicidal ideation or attempt. Recently, a pilot study
      suggested the feasibility of positive psychology in patients in suicidal crisis. Notably,
      gratitude exercises suggested improvement in optimism and hopelessness, two dimensions
      associated to suicide. Moreover, gratitude has been associated to suicidal ideation and
      attempt, independently from depression. Thus, investigators want to conduct the first
      randomized controlled study in order to assess effectiveness of gratitude exercises (vs
      control task) in suicidal inpatients, on 1) psychological pain reduction 2) suicidal
      ideation, hopelessness, optimism, depressive symptomatology, and anxiety improvement.

      Study design: monocentric randomized controlled study

      Methods:

      206 inpatients (Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post Acute Care), between 18 and 65
      years-old, having attempted suicide before hospitalisation or having current active suicidal
      ideation at the time of the psychiatric hospitalisation. Patients suffering from
      schizophrenia are excluded.

      Randomization into two groups: Positive Psychology (i.e., gratitude journal) (n = 103) or
      Control Task (i.e., food journal) (n = 103), daily exercises during 7 days (in add-on from
      usual treatment).

      Clinical assessment: 1) at baseline (the day before the intervention beginning) (V0); 2)
      short daily self-assessments (immediately before and after the exercise); 3) the day
      following the last day of the intervention (V1).

        -  V0 : socio-demographic data, treatments, psychopathology, suicidal ideation,depressive
           and anxious symptomatology, psychological pain, optimism, hopelessness.

        -  Daily self-assessments: psychological pain, optimism, hopelessness

        -  V1 : treatments suicidal ideation,depressive and anxious symptomatology, psychological
           pain, optimism, hopelessness, intervention satisfaction.
