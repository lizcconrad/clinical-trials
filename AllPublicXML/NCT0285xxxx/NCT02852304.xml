  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive storage disease linked
      to decrease enzymatic activity of LAL, responsible for intracellular accumulation of
      cholesterol esters and triglycerides.

      The accumulation of lipid is in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and macrophages leading to a fatty
      liver, hepatic fibrosis that can evolve up to cirrhosis.

      LAL deficiency is responsible for significant morbidity and early mortality in children,
      adolescents and adults in connection with a multi visceral disease reaching the liver,
      gastrointestinal tract and the vascular endothelium. The disease is caused by homozygous or
      heterozygous mutations in the gene (LIPA chromosome 10q23.2-23.3) which is responsible for
      the synthesis of the LAL.

      The disease can be diagnosed by enzymatic analysis using few drops of blood absorbed onto
      blotting paper .

      Patients with this deficiency LAL, have no or reduced activity of this enzyme. Because of its
      rarity, the deficit in LAL is under diagnosed or is diagnosed in patients with liver
      biological disturbances and / or lipid profile disturbances, steatohepatitis-hepatitis
      (NASH), the steatosis (NAFLD), the cryptogenic cirrhosis or Wilson disease.

      Inclusion period of 12 to 18 months (100 patients).

        The Assessment of the prevalence of Lysosomal Acid Lipase deficiency were performed from
        few blood drops absorbed onto blotting paper during a routine visit in patients waiting for
        a liver transplant.

        Patients will be included when they will be registered on the liver transplant waiting
        list.

        The enzymatic analysis onto blotting paper will be made during a routine visit in patients
        with cryptogenic cirrhosis, NASH (isolated or associated with other liver disease).

        Oral and written information will be given by the clinician. Only research team members
        will have access to patient data and their analysis. The patient data (age, gender, medical
        history, etiology of liver disease, liver function, lipid, glucose, radiological ...) will
        be collected and stored in an Excel file.

        The diagnosis analysis deficit LAL will be performed as described in the article by
        Hamilton.
