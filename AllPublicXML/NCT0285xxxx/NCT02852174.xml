  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for a disabled adult, particularly those with long-lasting impairment, has been
      associated with elevated levels of stress, depression and anxiety among caregivers.Recent
      studies show that veteran caregivers experience higher levels of psychological distress than
      caregivers in the general population, highlighting the psychological needs of this
      population. The Veteran Caregiver Reducing Stress Time (VetCareReST) is a randomized control
      trial designed to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness at reducing stress, depression and
      anxiety in veteran caregivers in Champaign and Danville County.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent estimates indicate that there are 275,000 to one million informal veteran caregivers.
      Caring for a disabled adult, particularly those with long-lasting impairment, has been
      associated with elevated levels of stress, depression and anxiety among caregivers. Veteran
      caregivers are especially vulnerable because of competing demands. For instance, Post 9/11
      veteran caregivers are more likely to be the spouse of a veteran, and have experienced the
      stress of multiple deployments, have a young child in their care, and work outside the home.
      Recent studies show that veteran caregivers experience higher levels of psychological
      distress than caregivers in the general population, highlighting the psychological needs of
      this population. One effective approach at reducing stress, depression and anxiety has been
      the use of mindfulness training, which has been shown to effectively reduce mood symptoms
      among professional caregivers. The Veteran Caregiver Reducing Stress Time (VetCareReST) is a
      randomized control trial designed to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness at reducing
      stress, depression and anxiety in veteran caregivers in Champaign and Danville County. This
      study builds on Dr. Lara-Cinisomo's (PI) experience with military spouses. The findings from
      this trial will serve as pilot data for a large-scale study.

    <description>The treatment groups will participate in a mindfulness intervention training that will meet for 2 hours once a week for eight weeks. The 8-week program provides participants with 2-hour weekly instruction designed to teach specific skills and how to apply them during stressful situations (e.g., when caring for or advocating for the veteran).Mindfulness training also requires that participants engage in daily home practice for 30 to 40 minutes. Participants will be required to record the duration of the meditation in log sheets.</description>
