  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancers(HNC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Xerostomia is one of
      the most common side effect of radiation therapy among patients with HNC. Mouth dryness
      significantly impairs patients' quality of life (QOL).

      HNC.Regarding to traditional use of A. digitata and M. sylvestris in addition to known their
      beneficial effects in recent studies, we decided to design a randomized, controlled clinical
      trial to try to evaluate efficacy of the these herbs in QOL of HNC patients with radiation
      induced xerostomia
