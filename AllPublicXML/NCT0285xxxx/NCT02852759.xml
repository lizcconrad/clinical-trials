    <textblock>
      Insulin resistant volunteers will choose to undergo an 8-week cold treatment, 2 hours per
      day, to selective regions of the body enriched with brown fat including neck, supraclavicular
      and interscapular regions) in combination with electroacupuncture (EA). Their insulin
      sensitivity and glucose and lipid homeostasis will be measured. The brown fat activation will
      be assessed by positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT)-scans and/or
      serum marker measurements.

    <description>The volunteers of intervention group will undergo Selective Cold treatment below 10 degree celsius to neck, supraclavicular interscapular regions for 2 hours daily for 8 weeks. The electroacupuncture is conducted by commercially available device. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, glucose tolerance test, blood parameter measurements, and PTC-CT scans will be conducted before and after the intervention. The participants will be instructed to maintain their normal behavior and calorie intake.</description>
