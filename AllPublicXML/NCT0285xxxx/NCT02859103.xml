  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anhedonia (the lack of pleasure in normally pleasurable things) is a common symptom of major
      depressive disorder (MDD), and it may impact how patients with depression experience reward.
      Understanding how anhedonia is related to the experience of reward may help improve how
      depression is treated. Computer tasks can be used to measure how reward is experienced, and
      these measures might be able to predict things like who is likely to become depressed, or who
      will respond to antidepressant medication. Studying the relationship between anhedonia and
      reward in patients with depression might also tell us something about how to improve
      diagnosis and treatment of other psychiatric disorders.This is an open label controlled
      treatment study lasting 8 weeks. The brain scans will be used to find changes in brain areas
      that may be related to how people perform on the tasks. The investigators goal is to use this
      information to help us find a reliable predictor that can be used to guide MDD treatment.

    <description>The Cued-Reinforcement Reaction Time Task (CRRT) provides an evaluation of reward-based reaction time speed as an index of incentive motivation.The EEfRT task allows analysis of the predictive value of reward probability and magnitude on effort-based decision making.
