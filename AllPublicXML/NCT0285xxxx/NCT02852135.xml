  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LMA Proseal and LMA Supreme are the third generation of LMA with potential advantages
      over the classic LMA.Several publications have reported the successful, safe use of Laryngeal
      Mask Airway devices in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. However, there have been no
      studies that have examined the application of LMA in patients during lateral positioned
      laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy when LMA
      Proseal and LMA Supreme used in lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery under general
      anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We undertook a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.The patients were
      randomized to either LMA Proseal group or LMA Supreme group by computer generated allocation.

      The patients were scheduled for elective lateral positioned laparoscopic surgery, such as
      laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, laparoscopic renal cyst decortication (LRCD) or
      laparoscopic adrenalectomy.Inclusion criteria for the patients were: Aged&gt;18 years, ASA
      physical status grade I - Ⅲ and body mass index ≤30 kg.m-2. Exclusion criteria were:
      anticipated difficult airway (e.g., Modified Mallampati Class IV, oropharyngeal pathology),
      severe cardiopulmonary disease, increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration (e.g.,
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and pregnant patients), and retroperitoneal laparoscopic
      procedures.
