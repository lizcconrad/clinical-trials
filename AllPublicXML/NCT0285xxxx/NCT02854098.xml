    <textblock>
      Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome is a group of inherited abnormalities in the structure of
      connective tissues, manifested by disturbances in the proportion of collagen. The main
      symptoms of this syndrome include: laxity of joint capsules and ligaments, hypermobility of
      the joints, as well as numerous disturbances in the functioning of internal organs that
      contain connective tissue, including the gastrointestinal tract. Hypermobility of joints
      affects approximately 10% of the population of Western countries, is more common in small
      children and female. Modified Beighton scale is the basic scale for assessing hypermobility
      of joints. The scale (as assessed using the goniometer) is a reliable tool for the evaluation
      of excessive laxity of the connective tissue in children.

      Functional constipation is a very common condition, affecting approximately 3-5% of children
      and adolescents, with peak onset between 2 and 4 years of age. The etiology of this disorder
      is multifactorial, and till day it is still exactly unknown why some children develop
      constipation, while in others we can observe the correct scheme of defecation. Suspending
      stool enhances the retention of fecal masses, which subsequently causes painful defecation.
      Diagnosis is based on history, clinical symptoms and physical examination. Increased
      susceptibility of the wall of the distal gastrointestinal tract could explain the
      predisposition of some children to retain fecal masses and the development of constipation.

      Due to the unclear etiology of functional constipation, it seems reasonable to conduct a
      study assessing whether excessive laxity of connective tissue (assessed on the basis of the
      hypermobility of the joints) facilitates the accumulation of stool in the large intestine,
      and so is the one of the reasons leading to development of functional constipation in
      children.

      Clinical question: Is there among patients with functional constipation increased percentage
      of children with Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome, compared with a population of healthy
      children? In discussion we would like to determine whether the excessive laxity of connective
      tissue can promote the development of functional constipation in children.

      Description of the study:

        1. Anamnesis and physical examination of the patient

        2. The consent of the parents and the patient (if &gt; 15 years) to participate in the study

        3. Determining whether the patient meets the criteria for inclusion in the study

        4. The exclusion of patients meeting the exclusion criteria for the study - on the basis of
           anamnesis and physical examination (including neurological) and diagnostic tests
           (biochemical and electrolyte TSH -, Na, K, Ca, P, Mg), if indicated

        5. In patients classified to the study, the degree of laxity of the connective tissue will
           be assessed in the basis of modified Beighton scale

        6. In the control group - patients without constipation in an interview - the degree of
           laxity of the connective tissue will be assessed in the basis of modified Beighton scale

        7. Evaluation of the results.

      Rome III Criteria Functional Constipation

      Diagnostic criteria must include one month in children up to 4 years of age and two months in
      older children(with insufficient criteria for diagnosis of IBS) of at least two of the
      following:

        1. Two or fewer defecations per week

        2. At least one episode/week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills

        3. History of excessive stool retention

        4. History of painful or hard bowel movements

        5. Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum

        6. History of large diameter stools which may obstruct the toilet Accompanying symptoms may
           include irritability, decreased appetite, and/or early satiety. The accompanying
           symptoms disappear immediately following passage of a large stool.

      Modified Beighton scale Hypermobility of joints indicates ≥ 4 points out of 9 possible.

      The Beighton score is measured by adding 1 point for each of the following:

        1. Placing flat hands on the floor with straight legs

        2. Left knee bending backward (&gt;10 °)

        3. Right knee bending backward (&gt;10 °)

        4. Left elbow bending backward (&gt;10 °)

        5. Right elbow bending backward (&gt;10 °)

        6. Left thumb touching the forearm

        7. Right thumb touching the forearm

        8. Left little finger bending backward (&gt;90 °)

        9. Right little finger bending backward (&gt;90 °)
