  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of footwear stiffness on a large
      cohort of high school football players during a football season. The investigators expect
      that functional athlete groups will be developed, based on subject specific assessments
      (biomechanical, morphological, performance, comfort), and lead to important translational
      findings that may impact footwear modification and recommendation to a population of American
      football players. Two standard cleats will be randomized and provided during a season of high
      school football. Ratings of comfort, performance, and injury will be collected throughout the
      season.

    <measure>Injury incidence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Athletic trainer collected athletic exposures and lower extremity injuries will be collected weekly and combined to determine overall injury rates. The unit of measure is number of injuries per 1000 athletic exposures.</description>
