  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the acute influence of artificially sweetened beverages
      consumption (as compared with sugar-sweetened beverages and water consumption) on brain
      responses to the viewing of food images, on physiological responses (gut-derived hormones and
      lipid metabolites) and on the food intake behavior.

      This study is made on a randomized controlled crossover design including three conditions
      (water, sugar, artificial sweeteners). Measurements will be performed in fasting and fed
      conditions. The test-meal will comprise either an artificially or sugar-sweetened beverage or
      water (control). The spatio-temporal brain dynamics to the viewing of food pictures will be
      assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and electrical neuroimaging
      analyses. Venous blood and urine will be collected. Blood pressure, cardiac frequency and
      bio-impedance measurements will be performed. Food intake behavior will be assessed by means
      of questionnaires and a free-choice buffet. Each tested condition (water, sugar, artificial
      sweeteners) will be preceded by a run-in period during which the participants' diet will be
      controlled (2-day isoenergetic diet).
