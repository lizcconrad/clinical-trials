  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, an Expert Panel of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute published guidelines
      on cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children; among these guidelines were
      screening recommendations for obesity and obesity-related conditions. Following publication
      of this report there was a call for caution and for increased patient (parent, child) input
      on implementing these guidelines. There are limited current studies evaluating
      patient-centered outcomes (PCO) in the well-child setting, however, given the childhood
      obesity epidemic, there is a clear need for such an evaluation. The city of Detroit, MI ranks
      first among 22 cities with data for the prevalence of overweight and obese youth (39.7%),
      making Henry Ford Health System, which is located in Detroit, MI, an ideal setting to study
      childhood obesity related research questions.

    <textblock>
      Within this patient population, our specific aims therefore are to (1) examine current trends
      in screening and management of obesity and obesity-related conditions in a real-world urban
      practice setting; (2) examine the family (patient and parent/guardian) and clinician
      preferences for the identification and management of obesity and obesity-related conditions;
      and (3) design and conduct a Phase II pragmatic cluster randomized trial (PCRT) of an
      educational intervention in providers for guiding screening for obesity and obesity-related
      conditions during the well-child visit that incorporates and leverages PCO. Staff dedicated
      solely to this project will partner with the Henry Ford Health System's proposed
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Center's Cores staff members to design, execute and
      disseminate study results in order to affect clinical care. By seeking to understand the
      current screening patterns in pediatrics and by creating an education intervention for
      providers aimed at taking a patient/family centered approach to these preventative health
      screenings, we may increase PCOs which in turn may have meaningful implications for future
      adult health.

    <description>Providers will be randomized into a patient-centered outcomes (PCO) education course or standard of care. The PCO education course will educate and test providers on patient-centered outcomes of interest and appropriate methods to deliver PCO care.
Providers randomized into the intervention arm will be required to take a brief, one-hour, webinar describing the background, problem, results from focus groups we conducted, and a training program on motivational interviewing. After completing the course, providers will be required to complete an evaluation.</description>
