  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed and refractory T-cell lymphomas have been reported to have dismal outcomes. The role
      of allogeneic stem cell transplantation have been demonstrated in these patients. This
      clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of busulfan plus fludarabine as
      conditioning therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT) in T- and
      NK/T-cell lymphoma patients who have relapsed or are refractory to previous chemotherapies
      including autologous transplantation.

      Conditioning therapy

        -  Busulfan (Busulfex®; Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, Greenville, NC 27834) 3.2 mg/kg
           + 5% DW (the diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of Busulfan, so that the
           final concentration of busulfan becomes approximately 0.5 mg/mL), intravenously for 3
           hours once daily for 3 days (days -7 to -5)

        -  Fludarabine (Fludarabine®, Zydus Hospira Oncology Private Ltd., Ahmedabad, India) 30
           mg/m2 + 5% DW 100㎖, intravenously for over 1 hour once daily for 6 days (days -8 to -3)

             -  Busulfan should be infused as soon as completion of fludarabine infusion

      Primary objective of this study I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival of this
      reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
      patients.

      Secondary endpoints I. To evaluate the response rate, engraftment rate and time to
      engraftment, 2-year overall survival, 100-days treatment-related mortality, regimen-related
      toxicities by CTCAE version 4.03, post-transplantation complications (HVOD, acute/chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,CMV disease) of this
      reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
      patients.
