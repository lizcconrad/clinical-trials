      The word chemotherapy itself, because it belongs to the secular knowledge and therefore Doxa
      is a hard word, which stores what it is stable, common and therefore impersonal. It has the
      properties of a symbol, that is to say that joint several meanings, some of which are
      contradictory.

      The objective of the research:

      To determine the perceptions and representations of chemotherapy, its physical impacts,
      psychological and relational.

      To qualitatively compare the performances of chemotherapy as it has an end as scheduled for
      adjuvant chemotherapy, or endless precise as in the palliative chemotherapy
