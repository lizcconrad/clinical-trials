    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to develop, implement, and test the effectiveness of a
      computerized clinical decision support system for hospitalized patients with heart failure.

      Aim 1: Develop an electronic health record (EHR) based search method that uses both
      structured data and natural language processing of unstructured text to identify hospitalized
      patients with heart failure while they are still in the hospital.

      Aim 2: Develop and test the usability of an electronic health record (EHR) based clinical
      decision support system (CDSS) to support delivery of evidence-based care to hospitalized
      heart failure patients using human computer interaction methods.

      Aim 3: Assess the effect of an electronic health record (EHR) based clinical decision support
      system (CDSS) on processes of care for heart failure patients who are hospitalized for other
      causes. As part of the evaluation, we will test two implementation strategies, one of which
      will introduce the CDSS as an interruptive alert to providers, the second of which will
      introduce the CDSS as part of a provider checklist that exists on the side of the screen for
      each patient.
