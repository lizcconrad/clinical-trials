  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In type 1 diabetes, adolescence is often associated with deterioration in
      glycemic control, attributed to a poorly monitored diet, little exercise, poor treatment
      compliance, risk behaviors, endocrine changes with puberty, leading to greater resistance to
      insulin. Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is the key to successful management of the
      disease and treatment for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Ten TPE programs exist in the
      Mediterranean region in France, and the care teams implementing them wish to promote joint
      reflection with sick teenagers and families to identify needs and expectations of everyone on
      priority skills to develop, to promote better management of the disease and improved quality
      of life.

      Aim: To study the needs and expectations of adolescents with type 1 diabetes for skills to be
      developed during the educational sessions, to promote self-management of their disease and
      their treatment.

      Method: Four audio-recorded focus groups will be organized in all 10 clinical settings
      (adolescents, parents and health professionals). Thematic analysis will be carried out from
      the transcript of the focus groups.

      Expected results: The results will allow a joint reflection involving the participation of
      young patients, families, health professionals and the research team to build and implement
      new educational sessions that meet the identified needs. This action resulting from the
      research is expected to pool resources in different health facilities providing therapeutic
      education programs and to harmonize practices.
