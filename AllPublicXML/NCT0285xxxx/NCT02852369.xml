      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an upper extremity, task oriented training
      program delivered at home (TOTE Home) for people who are in the subacute recovery phase of a
      stroke.

      Method: A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up to assess the effectiveness of
      TOTE Home which includes a maximum of 30, one hour sessions of training conducted in
      participants' homes. Repeated target measures of accelerometry and level of confidence to be
      analyzed throughout the study. Change scores from standardized assessments to be evaluated at
      baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.

      Hemiparesis following a stroke frequently leads to &quot;learned non-use&quot; of the weaker arm and
      hand. Task oriented training has been suggested as a contemporary neurorehabilitation
      technique. A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up was conducted to assess the
      effectiveness of a task oriented training program administered in participants' homes. This
      intervention, Task Oriented Training at Home (TOTE Home), incorporated current
      experience-dependent plasticity aspects modeled after the Acquired Skill Acquisition Program
      (ASAP) protocol parameters and principles of task oriented training as suggested by Lang and
      Birkenmeier in 2014. Repeated measures of accelerometry and level of confidence on a priority
      task were analyzed with visual analysis of changes in level, trend, and slope. Change scores
      from standardized assessments for the upper extremity, Motor Activity Log, Stroke Impact
      Scale question of recovery, Functional Test for the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity, and Canadian
      Occupational Performance Measure were evaluated on data collected at baseline,
      post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.

    <description>The intervention administered during each of the training sessions was modeled after the protocol outlined in Winstein et al. (2013) however implementation was in the participant's home setting and involved tasks in the participant's real world.
The manual entitled, &quot;Upper-Extremity Task-Specific Training After Stroke or Disability&quot; by Lang and Birkenmeier (2014) was also utilized to give a general overview of task specific training for the upper extremity and to help guide each activity the participant chose to work on.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  upper extremity hemiparesis due to a stroke but met minimal movement criteria in the
             affected arm and hand (at least 10 degrees of active movement at the wrist, elbow, and
             shoulder movement, along with 10 degrees of active movement in the thumb and two other
             fingers)

          -  minimal cognitive deficits as demonstrated by a 24 or higher on the Mini-Mental Status
             Exam

          -  able to identify at least five specific tasks participants wish to achieve with their
             affected upper extremity. This was assessed with the Canadian Occupational Performance
             Measure (COPM)

          -  at least 21 years of age

          -  able to communicate in English

          -  3-12 months after their stroke which would classify them in the subacute level of
             recovery

          -  all formal occupational therapy was completed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  upper extremity pain that interfered with activities of daily living

          -  requiring maximal assistance for mobility

          -  arm or hand injury (unrelated to the stroke)

          -  upper extremity amputations

          -  inability to participate due to any illness, social or geographical reason, and any
             other diagnosis or limiting conditions that would affect participation
