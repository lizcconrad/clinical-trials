  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent vascularitis after 50 years of age The
      investigators recently showed that GCA was accompanied by an elevation in Th1 and Th17
      response [1]. Even though a quantitative deficit in regulatory TL (Treg) was shown, there are
      to date no data concerning their precise phenotypic and functional characteristics and
      notably their ability to inhibit Th1 and Th17 polarisation. The hypothesis of the
      investigator is that, in GCA, there is quantitative and above all functional deficit of Treg.
      Recently, progress has been made in the identification of Treg with new markers (CD39), which
      will make it possible to better identify and to study their specific functions. In this study
      the phenotypic and functional characteristics of Treg in GCA will be analysed. Better
      understanding of the role des Treg in GCA should lead to better-targeted treatments for
      patients with GCA, notably via the blockage of cytokines that inhibit the differentiation
      and/or function of Treg.

      The study is classified interventional because a lot of blood samples are taken.

          -  indurated temporal artery or diminished/abolition of temporal pulse

          -  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 50 mm during the first hour (or C
             Reactive protein (CRP)&gt;20 mg/L)

          -  Positive temporal artery biopsy (TAB) showing vascularitis with infiltration by
             mononuclear cells or granulomatous inflammation with or without giant cells.
