  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single compassionate use subject is an 83 year old woman with a history of lymph node
      positive breast cancer and recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer in May. With an Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 2, it is felt that she cannot tolerate more aggressive
      chemotherapy. The investigators propose to administer FG-3019 on a compassionate pleas basis
      in combination with gemzar. The patient is currently being treated and is tolerating gemzar.

      The FG-3019 treatment will be administered over a 28-day cycle:

        -  Dose: 35 mg/kg

        -  Route: IV over one hour following completion of gemcitabine infusion

        -  Schedule:

             -  Days 1, 8, and 15

             -  Please note that Day 8 infusion will on be completed during the first treatment
                cycle

      On Drug Evaluation

      The patient will be seen prior to every FG-3019 treatment by the treating physician. The
      following procedures will be conducted at each visit:

        -  History and thorough symptom assessment

        -  Physical examination

        -  Laboratory assessments (these can be collected up to 3 days prior to treatment):

        -  Complete blood count (CBC) and differential

        -  Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (Chemistry): bicarbonate, blood, urea, nitrogen (BUN),
           calcium, creatinine, glucose, potassium, sodium

        -  Liver Function Tests: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate
           transaminase (AST), total bilirubin

        -  Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9

      ECGs will be conducted during the screening and end of treatment visits. CT scans of the
      chest and abdomen will be done every 12 to 16 weeks.

      All of these data will be recorded and stored with their source documents.
