    <textblock>
      PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody. Humanized monoclonal is an antibody that is designed to block
      the action of the receptor, PD-1.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for
      Glioblastoma but it has been approved for other uses.

               -  1 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (preferred) OR

               -  10 FFPE unstained slides (5 μm thick)

          -  Patients must be undergoing surgery that is clinically indicated as determined by
             their care providers. Patients must be eligible for surgical resection with the
             expectation that the surgeon is able to resect at least 400mg of tumor with low risk
             of inducing neurological injury.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             within 72 hours prior to registration. If the urine test is positive or cannot be
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea
             with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
             potential.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable
             of becoming pregnant, must agree to use highly effective contraception during study
             treatment and for 120 days after study discontinuation. Highly effective contraception
             is defined as either:

               -  True Abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or
                  tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when
                  the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment (as described in item 3.1.16 above).

               -  Male Partner Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the
                  vasectomised male partner must be the sole partner for that participant.

               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following:

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

                    -  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives (including any registered and marketed
                       contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent
                       - including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)

          -  Male subjects must agree to use adequate method of contraception starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Examples
             include but are not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
