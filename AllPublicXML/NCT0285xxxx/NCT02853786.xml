    <textblock>
      The Language Environment Analysis (LENA) system is a specific tool for the language
      environment analysis. Children aged from 18 months to 6 years old, with cochlear implants
      (CIs), wear an electronic device during a day and their language interactions are registered.
      Then the investigators can analyze with a specific software four different parameters (adult
      words, conversational turns, child vocalizations and media exposure) and compare them to the
      language ability of the children assessed by a speech therapist. With the results, the speech
      therapist can advise the parents how to improve the language environment to help their
      children with CIs for their language development. Parents are encouraged to follow these
      advices at home during few months (5 months +/-1 month). Then there is a new registration of
      the LENA device and another language assessment are performed, to see if there is any
      improvement. The investigators also measure the family participation.

      Hypothesis : There is an influence of the language environment measured by the LENA system on
      language development in children with cochlear implants.

      Over 24 months the investigators will recruit 90 patients with cochlear implants (CIs) in 2
      centers.

      Each patient will follow during 5 months and will have three or five visits according to the
      arm.
