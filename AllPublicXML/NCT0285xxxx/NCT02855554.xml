  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the clinical potential of fast quantitative
      myocardial tissue characterization using recently emerged Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (CMR) techniques to aid the diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of patients with myocardial
      diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and myocarditis.
