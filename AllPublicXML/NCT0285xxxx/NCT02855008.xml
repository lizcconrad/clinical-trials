  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive/challenging behaviors in individuals with intellectual disability are a major
      public health concern for them, their families, their service programs and staff, and their
      communities. This randomized clinical trial will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of
      a preventive community-based social problem solving intervention, the Steps to Effective
      Problem-solving (STEPS), delivered in group homes. The program uses residential staff
      participation and the group environment to facilitate improved social problem solving skills
      and reduce aggressive/challenging behaviors in this population in group homes and work
      settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive/challenging behaviors (AC/Bs) are a major public health problem for individuals
      with intellectual disabilities (ID) living in group homes. A leading reason for psychiatric
      hospitalizations and incarcerations, A/CBs are costly to the healthcare system, agencies and
      families. Social problem solving (SPS) training programs for individuals with ID have had
      positive behavioral results, but most were conducted in clinical or forensic settings. None
      were community-based preventive interventions, none examined whether A/CBs decreased in
      participants' group homes and work settings, and none addressed cost effectiveness. In
      preliminary work, the investigators modified an effective SPS training program, using input
      from individuals with ID and residential staff, as a preventive intervention for the group
      home setting. Steps to Effective Problem-solving (STEPS) includes residential staff and uses
      the group home environment to facilitate behavior change. The purpose of this clinical trial
      is to test the efficacy of STEPS for individuals with ID. Specific aims are to 1) Assess the
      efficacy of the STEPS intervention in group homes to improve SPS skills and reduce A/CBs of
      the individuals with ID compared to an attention-control nutrition program from baseline to
      12, 24 and 36 weeks, controlling for behavioral determinants of A/CBs (demographics,
      agency/home environment, current health). 2) Assess the mediating effect of the support
      environment for SPS (residential staff SPS skills, group home level SPS skills, and group
      cohesiveness) on the improvement of SPS skills and reductions in A/CBs. 3) Evaluate cost
      effectiveness of STEPS relative to usual care for A/CB incidents in group homes. The
      investigators expect to show STEPS to be a preventive behavioral strategy to reduce A/CBs
      among individuals with ID, improve the cost effectiveness of their care and make an important
      incremental advance in SPS research.

    <description>Compare A/CB incident costs for experimental arm vs. active comparator arm. The investigators will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of STEPS from the societal perspective, taking into account costs borne by the program, group home, health care system, public services, participant, and family. The STEPS experimental arm group will be compared to usual care (active comparator Food for Life) group costs of A/CBs excluding costs of the nutrition intervention). We will calculate the net cost (or net savings) associated with STEPS vs. Food for Life arms, such that the net cost = program-related cost - A/CB incident cost</description>

We randomized these agencies and followed the specific order. Over the past year, recruitment issues have resulted in our only being able to recruit at six of the original nine agencies. To address the issues, we compiled a list of 15 additional local agencies within a 50 mile radius and are determining whether they are willing to participate and have eligible homes. We will randomize additional agencies for participation. Within each agency we then, (1) determine homes that that meet criteria and, by gender, randomize to STEPS or attention-control condition. Individuals with ID and staff are recruited after randomization. Residential staff are consented first. Individuals with ID (or guardians if they have one) are then consented. 18 homes will participate in STEPS.</description>
