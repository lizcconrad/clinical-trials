      The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of combined Er:YAG and Nd:YAG
      laser therapy to that of scaling and root planning with hand instruments in nonsurgical
      treatment of chronic periodontitis.Twenty-ﬁve systemically healthy patients with
      moderate-to-advanced periodontal destruction were selected for this study. The quadrants were
      randomly allocated in a split-mouth design to either combined Er:YAG (160 mj/pulse, and 10
      Hz) and Nd:YAG laser (100 mJ/pulse, and 20 Hz) therapy (test group) or scaling root planning
      using hand instruments (control group). At baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment,
      clinical measurements, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (%) (BOP), were performed and
      gingival crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque samples were taken. The gingival crevicular
      fluid levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total antioxidant status (TAS)/total oxidant status (TOS)
      were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and a novel automatic colorimetric
      method. Quantitative analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf),
      and Treponema denticola (Td) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      procedures.

    <description>Combined laser therapy: An Er:YAG laser (160 mj/pulse, 10 Hz) (AT Fidelis Fotona, Ljubljana, Slovenia) with water irrigation was first used to remove subgingival calculus and infected cementum.The Er:YAG laser beam was delivered into the periodontal pockets using a chisel-shaped quartz tip in contact mode under water irrigation, from a coronal to an apical direction with the tip inclined at 10o to 15o to the root surfaces. After Er:YAG laser application, Nd:YAG laser treatment (AT Fidelis Fotona, Ljubljana, Slovenia) was performed at an energy level of 100 mJ/pulse, and 20 Hz for removing pocket epithelium and detoxiﬁcation purpose. Irradiation was accomplished with a 320 μm fiber optic delivery system. The fiber was inserted into the periodontal pocket base in parallel alignment with the root surface, and the fiber was slowly moved from apical to coronal in a sweeping motion during the laser light emission.</description>

            <description>Combined laser therapy: An Er:YAG laser (160 mj/pulse, 10 Hz) (AT Fidelis Fotona, Ljubljana, Slovenia) with water irrigation was first used to remove subgingival calculus and infected cementum.The Er:YAG laser beam was delivered into the periodontal pockets using a chisel-shaped quartz tip in contact mode under water irrigation, from a coronal to an apical direction with the tip inclined at 10o to 15o to the root surfaces. After Er:YAG laser application, Nd:YAG laser treatment (AT Fidelis Fotona, Ljubljana, Slovenia) was performed at an energy level of 100 mJ/pulse, and 20 Hz for removing pocket epithelium and detoxiﬁcation purpose. Irradiation was accomplished with a 320 μm fiber optic delivery system. The fiber was inserted into the periodontal pocket base in parallel alignment with the root surface, and the fiber was slowly moved from apical to coronal in a sweeping motion during the laser light emission.
