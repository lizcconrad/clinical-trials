    <textblock>
      National clinical trial, phase III, multicenter, single-arm, efficacy study, 80 participants
      of both sexes, aged equal or more than 12 and less than 65 years. The group will use Busonid®
      (budesonide 200mcg and 400mcg) one application (inhalation) of 200 mcg every 12 hours (400mcg
      / day). During follow-up visits if the participant has not shown an increase in forced
      expiratory volume in one second greater than 12% and greater than 0,20L or 200ml in
      spirometry compared with baseline visit, will increase the dose to 800 mcg / day (2x 400 mcg
      day).

      The study aims to revalidate by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) the
      registration of the drug Busonid® which there is a vast scientific literature on the
      pre-clinical and clinical evidence that the efficacy and safety of budesonide. Thus, outlined
      is a single-arm study, which is applied to the study of the group of participants the same
      intervention for a certain period and the participants are evaluated for response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Busonid® is composed of budesonide and has two performances of 200mcg and 400mcg. It is a
      corticosteroid hormone with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The slow and continuous
      release of budesonide in the airways due to their esterification and their short plasma half
      life increases the selectivity of the corticosteroid to the airways, in patients with asthma,
      inhaled corticosteroids have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects, such as reducing
      the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs and inhibiting the synthesis and release of
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.

    <description>It´s a capsule with inhalatoin powder composed of budesonide 200mcg or 400mcg. The experimental drug will be dispensed in a cartridge containing 60 capsules of 200 mcg or 400 mcg and an inhaler. It should be stored at room temperature (between 15 and 30°C) and protected from moisture.
Regarding the dosage, the 80 study participants will perform an inhalation 200mcg every 12 hours (400 mcg / day). During follow-up visits (V1 and V2) the attending physician will assess the need for increased PSI dose to 400 mcg every 12 hours (800mcg / day). Study participants should rinse the mouth with water and / or brush your teeth immediately after use of the drug.
The duration of treatment may be 12 weeks.</description>
