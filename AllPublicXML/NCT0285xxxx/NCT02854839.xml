      The propose of this study is evaluate the safety and efficacy of MG4101 (allogeneic Natural
      killer cells) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized, multi-center, open-labeled, Phase 2a study in patients with HCC after
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 78 patients will be randomized(1:1) into
      one of the two group, to receive adjuvant therapy using MG4101 (allogeneic Natural killer
      cells, Treatment group) or no adjuvant therapy (Control group).

      Patients who were assigned Treatment group will receive 2 cycles of MG4101 (each cycle is 3
      treatments at a frequency of once per week, between each cycle has 3 weeks of withdrawal
      period). After treatment period, patients will undergo follow up for progression and survival
      every 12 weeks (± 7 days) and follow up 1 year after the last patient`s enrollment date.

      The Control group`s patients will will undergo follow up for progression and survival every
      12 weeks (± 7 days) and follow up 1 year after the last patient`s enrollment date.
