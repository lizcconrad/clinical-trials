          -  Female participants are eligible only if all the following apply:

               1. Not pregnant (women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum
                  pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test at check-in for
                  each inpatient period);

               2. Not lactating;

               3. Not planning to become pregnant during the study;

               4. Be surgically sterile (irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy,

                  visits and commits to the use of an acceptable form of highly effective birth
                  control for the duration of the study and for 30 days after the last dose study
                  drug administration.

          -  BMI within the range of 19-30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a laboratory value at the Screening Visit that is outside the normal range, unless
             it is judged by the Investigator as not clinically significant after appropriate
             evaluation. One repeat of initial laboratory testing is allowed.

          -  AST, ALT and ALP tests in excess of 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Any gastrointestinal condition that could affect drug absorption.

          -  History of any clinically significant condition involving the bladder or urinary
             tract, including frequent urinary tract infections (e.g. &gt; 2 per year), or current
             symptoms of bladder irritation such as frequent or urgent need to urinate or burning
             with urination.

          -  History (within the last six months) of or current clinically significant psychiatric
             disorder including anxiety, psychosis or depression.

          -  Current inflammatory or ulcerative disease of the oral cavity that could impair the
             absorption of sublingual medication.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic drug-related reactions.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to ketamine or any of the excipients of Wafermineâ„¢.

          -  Intake of any prescribed or Over-The-Counter (OTC)/non-prescribed drugs, vitamins,
             supplements or herbal medicines, within 2 weeks of administration of investigational
             product (or longer if the medication has a half-life long enough to potentially expose
             the healthy participant to any significant systemic exposure). Exception: Hormone
             replacement therapy and oral contraceptives in female participants is allowed.

          -  Use of drugs with enzyme-inducing properties, such as rifampicin and St John's Wort,
             within 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater, prior to treatment period 1 and
             throughout the study, or any drug known to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 within 5
             half-lives of treatment period 1 and throughout the study.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational agent within 30 days of
             screening.

             vital signs at the screening visit or pre-dose on any treatment day.

          -  Known or suspected drug (including analgesic drugs or tranquilizers) or alcohol abuse
             or dependence, as defined by DSM-IV, and not in full remission, as judged by the

             regular weekly intake of &gt;15 units for men and &gt;10 units for women. (1 unit = 25 mL
             spirits, 125 mL wine, 250 mL beer or lager.)

          -  Positive results on the urine drug screen or breath alcohol test at screening and/or
             pre-dose. A positive result on the urinary drug screen at screening is allowed at the
             discretion of the Investigator provided the result can be reliably explained by recent
             medication and/or dietary history.

          -  Significant history of illicit drug use (as determined by the Investigator).

          -  Any alcohol use within 24 hours prior to each inpatient treatment period.

             the end of study participation.
