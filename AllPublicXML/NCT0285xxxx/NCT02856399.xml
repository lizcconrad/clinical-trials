  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The methadone is an useful opioid for the cancer pain treatment, mostly used in second or
      last line during the opioid rotation. The Methadone had an anti-MNDA effect, and clinicians
      agree that the methadone could have an effect in neuropathic cancer pain. During a previous
      study the investigators find that the pain was still improving after the week 2, but they had
      only a small number of patients still included at this stage and they cannot conclude.

      The investigators decide to follow up systematically all the patients undergoing a methadone
      treatment for cancer pain, at day 28, to study the hypothesis about the long-term pain
      improvement.
