      Objectives:

      To examine the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) combined with auricular
      acupuncture (AA) in reducing post-operative pain in patients following abdominal surgery for
      gynecological diseases.

      Hypothesis:

      Acupuncture is effective and safe to reduce postoperative pain during the first 5 days
      following surgery as compared to a sham control.

      Design and strategy:

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, subject- and assessor-blind trial. Seventy-two
      subjects will be recruited and randomized (in 1:1 ratio) to receive either acupuncture
      treatment or sham control. Subjects in both groups will undergo standard operation procedure
      and receive post-operative analgesics based on usual care.

      Study instrument:

      A 10-point pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) will be employed as a primary outcome
      assessment.

      Intervention:

      Subjects in the treatment group will receive EA combined with AA within two hours before
      operation, post-operation upon arrival to the ward and once a day for the subsequent 5 days.
      Subjects in the control group will receive non-invasive sham procedure in the same schedule.

      Main outcome measures:

      Primary outcome: NRS pain scores will be measured upon recovery, hourly at 6 hours after
      surgery, then 4-hourly until day 2, 6-hourly until day 3 and once daily until discharge.

      Secondary outcome:

      Morphine consumption, post-operative syndromes, quality of recovery questionnaire, SF-6D,
      EQ-5D-5L and adverse events will be documented and compared between groups.

      Data analysis: Pain intensity during the first 5 days will be calculated by Area Under the
      Curve (AUC) of NRS pain scores. AUC between the two groups will be compared by Student's
      T-test.

      Expected outcome: AUC of the acupuncture group is expected to be significantly lower than
      sham acupuncture group.
