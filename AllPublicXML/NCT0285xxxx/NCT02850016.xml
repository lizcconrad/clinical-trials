    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to evaluate the effects of romidepsin plus 3BNC117 or romidepsin
      alone on delaying or preventing viral rebound in ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals
      during an analytical interruption of ART.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized interventional phase 2a trial of 3BNC117 and romidepsin in human
      immunodeficiency (HIV-1) infected patients on ART, conducted as a multi-center study at the
      Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, the Rockefeller
      University Hospital, USA, and the University Hospital of Cologne, Germany.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 in a non-blinded fashion to receive one of two regimens:

      A) Two treatment cycles each consisting of one 3BNC117 infusion (30mg/kg) + three romidepsin
      infusions (5mg/m2); or

      B) Two treatment cycles each consisting of three romidepsin infusions (5mg/m2).

      ART will be discontinued 16 weeks after the start of the second treatment cycle (analytical
      treatment interruption, ATI) and subjects will be monitored weekly for safety and viral
      rebound. The targeted enrollment is 30 subjects (15 per arm).

      Leukapheresis will be performed before and after the two treatment cycles to guarantee
      sufficient material to investigate changes in the reservoir after the interventions.

      The following criteria will require resumption of ART:

        -  CD4+ T cell-count &lt;350 cells/mm³ (confirmed by repeat measurement)

        -  2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥ 200 copies/mL or above their setpoint
           viremia (if documented)

        -  Subject request

        -  Continued ART interruption will, in the opinion of the investigator or study advisers,
           pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.

      If HIV-1 RNA remains undetectable at week 36, subjects will be offered to continue off ART
      with close monitoring, in conjunction with the subject's primary medical provider, as long as
      HIV-1 viral rebound does not occur. ART resumption will follow same criteria as detailed
      above. All subjects will be followed for a total of 48 weeks from enrollment.
