  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this exploratory study is to assess the ability of two test toothpastes containing
      0.6% w/w zinc chloride stabilised with sodium citrate in a sodium lauryl sulfate
      (SLS)-containing base to reduce glycolytic metabolism and viability of de novo plaque
      bacteria using the plaque glycolysis regrowth model (PGRM).
