      The objective of the REPRISE EDGE study is to confirm the acute performance and safety of the
      LOTUS Edge™ Valve System when used with the Lotus™ or iSleeve™ Introducer Set for
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in symptomatic patients with severe calcific
      aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, single-arm study designed to demonstrate that the acute
      performance and safety of the LOTUS Edge Valve System when used with the iSleeve or Lotus
      Introducer Set are consistent with the results of the commercially approved Lotus Valve
      System used in the REPRISE II study, when delivered and deployed in symptomatic subjects who
      have severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk for surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is ≥70 years of age.

          2. Subject has documented calcific native aortic valve stenosis with an initial aortic
             valve area (AVA) of &lt;1.0 cm2 (or AVA index of &lt;0.6 cm2/m2) and either a mean pressure
             gradient &gt;40 mm Hg or a jet velocity &gt;4 m/s, as measured by echocardiography and/or
             invasive hemodynamics.

             Note: In cases of low flow, low gradient aortic stenosis dobutamine can be used to
             assess the grade of aortic stenosis (maximum dobutamine dose of 20 mcg/kg/min
             recommended)c; the subject may be enrolled if echocardiographic criteria are met with
             this augmentation.

          3. Subject has a documented aortic annulus size between ≥20 mm and ≤27 mm based on

               -  STS score ≥8%, and/or

               -  Agreement by the heart team (which must include an in-person evaluation by an
                  experienced cardiac surgeon) that subject is at high operative risk of serious
                  morbidity or mortality with surgical valve replacement.

          7. Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures, and provides written informed consent.

          8. Subject, family member and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of
             returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

          1. Subject has a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve.

          2. Subject with an acute myocardial infarction within 30 days of the index procedure
             (defined as Q-wave MI or non-Q-wave MI with total CK elevation ≥ twice normal in the
             presence of CK-MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation).

          3. Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the
             past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect prior to study enrollment.

          6. Subject has &gt;3+ mitral regurgitation, &gt;3+ aortic regurgitation or &gt;3+ tricuspid
             regurgitation.

          7. Subject has a need for emergency surgery for any reason.

          8. Subject has a history of endocarditis within 12 months of index procedure or evidence
             of an active systemic infection or sepsis.

          9. Subject has echocardiographic evidence of new intra-cardiac vegetation or
             intraventricular or paravalvular thrombus requiring intervention.

             within the past 3 months, or has other clinically significant bleeding diathesis or
             coagulopathy that would preclude treatment with required antiplatelet regimen, or will
             refuse transfusions.

         13. Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated, or has known hypersensitivity to aspirin, all thienopyridines, heparin,

         17. Subject has untreated coronary artery disease, which in the opinion of the treating
             physician, is clinically significant and requires revascularization.

         18. Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.

         19. Subject is in cardiogenic shock or has hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic
             support or mechanical support devices.

         20. Subject has severe vascular disease that would preclude safe access (e.g., aneurysm
             with thrombus that cannot be crossed safely, marked tortuosity, significant narrowing
             of the abdominal aorta, severe unfolding of the thoracic aorta, or symptomatic carotid
             or vertebral disease).

         21. Subject has arterial access that is not acceptable for the LOTUS Edge delivery system
             and its compatible Lotus or iSleeve Introducers as defined in the Directions For Use,
             or severe iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification that would prevent safe placement of
             either introducer sheath.

         22. Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.).

         23. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not
             reached its primary endpoint.

         24. Subject does not have a permanent pacemaker but has a class I or II indication for
             pacemaker implantation (based on the latest available ESC guidelines).
