  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational study on ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and abdominal compartment
      syndrome.

      the aim of this study is to assess the qualities of a predictive score on the occurence of
      this syndrome after surgery of ruptured aortic aneurysm

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improved management techniques of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, especially in
      vascular surgery, the mortality rate has not decreased these last years.

      The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) has been clearly identified as one of the main
      etiologies of mortality after ruptured aortic aneurysm. The mortality grow up with ACS in
      this population.

      So, the investigators want to screen abdominal compartment syndrome in the operative room.

      It is an observational study on ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and abdominal compartment
      syndrome.

      the aim of this study is to assess the qualities of a predictive score on the occurence of
      this syndrome after surgery of ruptured aortic aneurysm

      Later the aim of a future study will be to screen ACS and manage patient as soon as possible
      to avoid it.
