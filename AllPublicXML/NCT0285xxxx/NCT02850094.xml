  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 24 week program to provide proof-of-principle evidence that
      financial incentives stimulate Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) employees to be more
      physically active.

      Participants wear a Fitbit Flex accelerometer for at least six months. During the first two
      weeks, they are paid simply for wearing the Fitbit. After that, they are regularly paid for
      either meeting CDC guidelines for moderate physical activity (PA) or increasing their PA by
      at least 10% from the preceding week. Moderate PA is defined as walking for at least 100
      steps per minute for at least 10 minutes at a time. One minute of vigorous PA, over 175
      steps/minute, counts as two minutes of moderate PA.

      In addition to weekly bonuses, there are also bonuses for achieving all goals in 1 month, 3
      month, and 6 month intervals. In cases where all three team members received a bonus, their
      bonuses are doubled. Individuals also fill out weekly questionnaires about their work
      attendance, as well as longer questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months.

    <description>For two weeks following enrollment, subjects are monitored via their FitBit accelerometer to monitor their pre-intervention physical activity levels. For a twenty-four week period following the observational period, participants are eligible for financial bonuses based on their increased activity. Participants enroll as teams and are eligible for additional financial bonuses based on their team's performance.</description>

    <description>Each participant is eligible to receive $10 per week for increasing their minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity by 10% from the previous week, or for meeting CDC guidelines of 150 minutes/week. Participants who meet their target minutes of PA every week for one month, three months, or six months receive $15, $25, or $50 bonuses respectively. If all members of a team meet their individual PA goals, each participant's reward is doubled. In total, participants can earn up to $860 if they meet all their goals.</description>
