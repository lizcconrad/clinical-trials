  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims to compare the inflammatory status of visceral adipose tissue from obese
      patients depending on the presence and severity of periodontitis, in order to establish a
      potential causal link between the severity of the bacterial contamination and insulin
      resistance.

      Recruitment of patients will be achieved in the department of digestive surgery. It will
      involve 122 patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery scheduled within the
      digestive surgery department. Patients recruited will be examined for evaluating the presence
      and severity of periodontitis, and separated into either group 1: for patients with moderate
      or severe periodontitis, and or group 2: for patients without or with mild periodontitis. The
      day before the surgery, blood sample will be collected for the analysis of circulating
      metabolic and inflammatory markers. Collection of stimulated saliva, periodontal sample and
      faeces samples (50 g) will also be carried out for bacteria determination. During the
      surgical procedure, a sample of visceral adipose tissue (50 g) will be collected and used for
      periodontal bacteria detection and inflammatory markers analyses.
