  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in China. Intravenous
      thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) improves the outcome for
      ischemic stroke patients who can be treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. In China, in
      addition to rt-PA, intravenous urokinase within 6 h has also been recommended by the 2010
      Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke,
      and supported by evidence from two intravenous urokinase thrombolysis trials. Urokinase is
      used more frequently than rt-PA, mainly because it is cheaper. To describe Chinese experience
      with thrombolytic therapy for Ischemic Stroke within 4.5h onset, we designed a multicenter,
      prospective, registry study. The aim of INtravenous Thrombolysis REgistry for Chinese
      Ischemic Stroke within 4.5 h onset（INTRECIS）was to assess the safety and efficacy of
      intravenous rtPA, urokinase as thrombolytic therapy within the first 4.5 h of onset of acute
      ischaemic stroke.

      INTRECIS is a prospective multicenter registry using data from 60 centres in the North China.
      Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with intravenous rtPA,
      urokinase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 60 centres of the North China will be eligible
      for this registry. Patient involvement in the registry shall not influence any treatment
      decision. Patients will undergo a complete diagnostic work up including a clinical
      neurological examination using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score,
      laboratory examination, brain and neurovascular imaging, echocardiography, 24-hours ECG.
      Clinical outcome will be evaluated on day 1 and day 14 using the National Institute of Health
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, evaluated at 3 months using modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) and
      assessing adverse events. The proportion of patients with favourable outcome (mRS 0 to 2) at
      3 months after treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome
      measures will include unfavourable clinical outcome (mRS 3 to 6), NIHSS reported and
      mortality.
