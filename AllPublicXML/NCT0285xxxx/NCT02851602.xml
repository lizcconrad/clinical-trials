  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HDL in obese non-diabetic patients show major alterations in their function and thus their
      cardio-protective effects. These alterations could be explained by the quantitative and
      qualitative anomalies in the phospholipids and sphingolipids in the HDL. These molecules play
      a major role in HDL function and probably present early modifications in obesity, even before
      the onset of glycaemia deregulation.

      The aim of this study is to show the presence of qualitative and quantitative modifications
      of phospholipids and sphingolipids in HDL from obese patients compared with HDL from
      non-obese controls.
