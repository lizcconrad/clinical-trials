  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying anorexia in persons
      with Crohn's disease flare-ups. The practical spin-off from this research is potentially very
      important for the management of nutritional disorders associated with the disease by guiding
      diets towards foods that correspond to patients' preferences and/or to modified tastes. In
      addition, the results could lead to the identification of sensory markers that herald an
      inflammatory flare-up of the disease.
