    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical results of implant-retained mandibular
      overdentures in edentulous patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survival of implants,condition of the peri-implant soft tissue were evaluated. And
      patients' perceptions regarding the outcome were assessed on visual analog scales (VAS), oral
      health impact profile-14 (OHIP) and semantic differential scale questionnaires.
