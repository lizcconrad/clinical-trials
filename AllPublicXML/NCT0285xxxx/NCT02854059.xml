  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability in patients diagnosed
      with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP with low ADAMTS13 activity after receiving single
      intravenous dose of IdeS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes (IdeS) is an IgG specific
      endopeptidase which cleaves IgG molecules and efficiently neutralizes Fc-mediated activities.
      IdeS-mediated IgG degradation constitutes a novel therapeutic principle for the treatment of
      IgG-driven human diseases.

      In addition to assessing the safety and tolerability of IdeS the study will also assess the
      efficacy of IdeS to significantly increase the ADAMTS13 activity and decrease the
      anti-ADAMTS13 antibody levels in patients diagnosed with asymptomatic antibody-mediated TTP
      with low ADAMTS13 activity.
