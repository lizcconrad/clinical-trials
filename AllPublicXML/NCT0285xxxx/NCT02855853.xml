  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though cognitive-motor performances are impaired in frail elderly subjects compared with
      healthy elderly subjects, exercising cognitive-motor processes in an implicit manner can
      improve the carrying out of real actions in everyday life.

      No training programme using virtual reality and serious games oriented towards the
      perception/action system has been tested in frail elderly subjects.

      The expected results are:

        -  In the short term, greater strengthening of motor and cognitive abilities in subjects
           trained with the virtual reality and serious games, thanks to stimulation through action
           and through the underlying processes.

        -  In the long term (+1 and +3 months at the end of the training period) better
           preservation of motor and cognitive abilities in subjects who took part in the virtual
           reality and serious games programme.
