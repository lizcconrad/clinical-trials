  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study included 80 patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis treatment to
      evaluate two techniques for the determination of parathyroid hormone (PTH)

      Objective: To evaluate whether the monitoring of hemodialysis patients by measurement of PTH
      1-84 Complete (CAP =cyclase activating PTH) and the ratio (1-84 PTH (CAP)/7-84 PTH (CIP =
      cyclase inactivating PTH) with kit &quot;Duo PTH Immunoradiometric Scantibodies&quot; allows an
      improvement in the therapeutic management of abnormal calcium and phosphate, with a better
      match to the targets of current international recommendations, followed by the conventional
      intact PTH assay.

      Primary endpoint:

      For each patient, a score will be awarded based on the number of criteria (including calcium,
      phosphorus and calcium phosphate product) in the target international guidelines :0-1-2 or 3.

      The primary endpoint will be the average scores in both groups at the beginning and the end
      of the study,

      Main secondary endpoints:

        -  Changes in the number of patients responding to international guidelines for each of the
           three parameters studied (serum phosphate, corrected calcium, phosphorus product) in the
           2 groups,

        -  Evolution of Elecsys intact PTH Roche in the 2 groups,

        -  Salaries and changes in the number of drugs to normalize the phospho-calcium balance in
           each group received,

        -  cardiovascular events (morbidity and cardiovascular mortality),

        -  Total mortality.

      Statistical analysis:

      This is a randomized, two parallel arms. The investigators will compare the average number of
      criteria on calcium and phosphate in the target according to a Mann-Whitney. The analysis
      will be performed with the software Splus.

    <description>Show that patients receiving a dose of complete PTH 1-84 (CAP) and the ratio PTH 1-84/7-84 more easily reach the objectives international guidelines on the three following parameters calcium and phosphate: phosphorus, corrected calcium and phosphorus product.
For each patient, a score will be awarded based on the number of criteria (including calcium, phosphorus and calcium phosphate product) in the target international guidelines:0-1-2 or 3.</description>
