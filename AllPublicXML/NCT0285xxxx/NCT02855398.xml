  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 18-month project is to investigate how decision-making influences food
      choice and consumption in children ages 7 to 11 years old. Although several studies suggest
      that the ability to make good decisions relates to eating behaviors, no studies have looked
      at how food reward influences the decision-making process to impact actual food intake. This
      proposal will answer these questions and bridge this gap in knowledge, which could lead to
      the development of more effective interventions for childhood obesity. To accomplish this,
      the investigators have assembled a diverse team with expertise in food intake, nutrition, and
      decision sciences. First, the investigators will establish if there are differences in
      decision-making between children varying in weight status. Second, the investigators will
      determine if performance on behavioral decision-making tasks relates to food consumption in
      the laboratory. Third, the investigators will examine response functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response to various rewards (i.e. food and
      money) and determine if this is influenced by child weight status. Fourth, the investigators
      will examine differences in fMRI BOLD at rest in decision-making regions are correlated with
      food intake and weight status. Eighty-two children will participate in our study. The
      long-term goal of this project is to investigate if there are differences in brain regions
      corresponding to these behaviors in overweight children and if these differences relate to
      eating behaviors in this population. Children will undergo fMRI while playing a reward task
      as well as consume meals in our laboratory. Decision-making will also be assessed by having
      children complete various behavioral measurements of reward and inhibitory control.
