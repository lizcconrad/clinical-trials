  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia, the most common human eye disorder, is a phenomenon characterized by an unconstrained
      elongation of the eye globe There are number of theories concerning the environmental effect
      on the emmetropization process, most are related to childhood exposure to outdoor activity,
      near work and sleep with night light. Studies in lab animals found an association between
      intensity of ambient lighting and myopia development.

      In this study, the investigators will examine the ambient light in kindergarten and schools
      and their relation to refractive error. Diurnal luminance in kindergarten and school class
      room will be measured and correlated to biometric measures such as refraction, axial length
      and keratometry.
