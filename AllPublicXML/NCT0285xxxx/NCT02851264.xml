      The aims of the present study：

        1. To investigate the diagnosing value of optical enhancement technology for early
           esophageal squamous neoplasia.

        2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual

      Detection and differentiation of esophageal squamous neoplasia (ESN) are of value in
      improving patient outcomes.Optical enhancement technology can serves in the diagnosis of GI
      neoplasia. However, its performance in ESN has not yet been reported.The aims of the present
      study is:

        1. To investigate the diagnosing value of optical enhancement technology for early
           esophageal squamous neoplasia.

        2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual
           chromoendoscopy with optical enhancement technology .

    <description>After routine examination by white-light endoscopy,the imaging mode will be switched to optical enhancement.Suspicious area will be recorded in detail. Then all enrolled patients will have their esophagus sprayed with iodine solution. Suspicious area will be also recorded in detail.After that biopsy specimens will be obtained respectively by forceps from each suspicious lesion recorded for histologic diagnosis.</description>
