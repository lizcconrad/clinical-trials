      The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of BT595 in adult
      subjects with chronic ITP. The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of
      subjects with a response. A response is defined as a platelet count of ≥30×10^9/L and at
      least a 2 fold increase of the baseline count, confirmed on at least 2 separate occasions at
      least 7 days apart, and the absence of bleeding. The secondary objectives of this study, in
      addition to further efficacy assessments, are to evaluate the safety of BT595.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic ITP (&gt;12 months' duration), including diagnosis of refractory
             ITP, and as defined by the International Working Group (Rodeghiero et al, 2009), where
             ITP is described as an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia
             in the absence of other causes or disorders that may be associated with
             thrombocytopenia

          -  Treatment is indicated because of a high risk of bleeding or a need to raise the
             platelet count

          -  Mean screening platelet count of &lt;30×10^9/L from 3 qualifying platelet counts
             performed within approximately 7 to 14 days before the start of treatment, with no
             individual platelet count above 35×10^9/L. The subject may be rescreened if the mean
             screening platelet count is ≥30×10^9/L. (Note: If a subject is rescreened, all
             screening laboratory tests must be repeated.)

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary thrombocytopenia or acquired medical conditions known to be associated with
             secondary thrombocytopenia, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia; lymphoma; multiple
             myeloma; thyroid disease; or other forms of thrombocytopenia, such as drug induced
             thrombocytopenia; cirrhotic liver diseases; antiphospholipid syndrome; environmental
             thrombocytopenia; and bone marrow diseases

          -  Severe concomitant diseases that in the judgment of the investigator will interfere
             with the study, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and
             noncontrolled arterial hypertension

          -  Laboratory findings (e.g., abnormal laboratory values for hemoglobin, transaminase
             levels [alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase], total bilirubin,
             creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and immunoglobulins G, A, M) that preclude
             participation

          -  Positive Coombs test (direct and indirect)

          -  Planned invasive procedures during the time frame of the study

          -  Maintenance therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs) or infusion of IVIgs
             within 3 months before start of the study

          -  Unresponsive to previous IVIg treatment

          -  Additional therapy with high dose corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt;30 mg
             prednisone/day), thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and/or immunosuppressives and/or
             other therapies (e.g., infusion of platelets) within 1 month before the start of the
             study (Note: Subjects on stable doses of ITP active treatment must not have modified
             the dose in the preceding 2 weeks and must maintain their prestudy dose during the
             study. Corticosteroids should not be given as a premedication. Rescue therapy with
             short courses [i.e., 1 to 4 days] of high dose steroids and IVIgs are allowed up to 2
             weeks before study inclusion.)

          -  History of thrombotic events (including myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular
             accident [including stroke], pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis) 6 months
             before treatment start with BT595 or the presence of significant risk factors for
             thrombotic events

          -  Therapy with live attenuated virus vaccines 3 months before start of the study

          -  Selective, absolute immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency or known antibodies to IgA
