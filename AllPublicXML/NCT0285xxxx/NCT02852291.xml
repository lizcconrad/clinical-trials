    <textblock>
      Multisite randomized trial of a parenting intervention in Liberia for caregivers of young
      children. Two main objectives of the &quot;Parents Make the Difference&quot; program are to teach
      parents (a) skills for decreasing harsh punishments and replacing those with positive ways to
      manage children's behavior and (b) skills for having more positive interactions with their
      children, including interactions that encourage learning. As a result of positive changes in
      parenting, the investigators expect that, over time, children's behavioral and cognitive
      well-being will improve and that future abuse and poor developmental outcomes will be
      prevented in the long-term.

      This is a multisite randomized trial of a parenting intervention in Liberia for caregivers of
      young children. The &quot;Parents Make the Difference&quot; program is designed to teach parents (a)
      skills for decreasing harsh punishments and replacing those with positive ways to manage
      children's behavior and (b) skills for having more positive interactions with their children.
      As a result of positive changes in parenting, the investigators expect that, over time,
      children's behavioral and cognitive well-being will improve and that the intervention will
      prevent future abuse and poor developmental outcomes in the long-term. This study will
      randomize 816 caregivers of children ages 3 or 4 years to 1 of 3 study arms: standard group
      program, group program plus home visits, waitlist control.
