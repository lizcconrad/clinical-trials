      There is evidence demonstrating that aerobic exercise improves many symptoms of Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD) including; anxiety, depression, insomnia, and cognition. With the goal
      of using exercise as a rehabilitation therapy for Veterans with PTSD, a team of scientists
      and doctors developed a 12-week exercise program, combining aerobic and strength training
      with concentration training and mindful breathing techniques. The initial pilot study
      suggested that Integrative Exercise may improve overall quality of life, sleep quality,
      cardiovascular fitness, and PTSD symptoms. This new study will help determine the
      effectiveness of Integrative Exercise compared to health education classes. The overall goal
      is to determine if integrative exercise is an effective rehabilitation intervention for
      combat Veterans with PTSD.

    <textblock>
      Despite the considerable efforts of the VA to improve awareness of mental health problems and
      access to care, many returning Veterans still report substantial barriers to seeking
      traditional mental health care. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that aerobic
      exercise effectively improves many outcomes relevant to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      including; anxiety, depression, insomnia, cognition, and cardiovascular disease. In addition,
      there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that aerobic exercise produces an increase
      in the growth of new neurons (e.g., neurogenesis) and increases the volume of the hippocampus
      which underscores the potential value of exercise for producing broad benefits to
      psychological health. Recognizing the promise that exercise might hold for attracting more
      Veterans into care and improving overall health in Veterans with PTSD, a team of
      investigators at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SFVAMC) with
      funding from the Department of Defense developed a treatment protocol and completed a pilot
      study of Integrative Exercise (Aerobic exercise and Breath Training 3 weekly sessions over 12
      weeks) versus a waitlist control condition. Promising results from this trial have led us to
      the next step which is to conduct a definitive efficacy study of Integrative Exercise versus
      an active health education control condition: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR). The
      control condition will be matched on contact hours with treatment personnel. The goal of this
      revised proposal is to test if Integrative Exercise improves overall quality of life, PTSD
      symptoms, sleep quality, and measures of cardiovascular health in combat Veterans with
      chronic PTSD relative to the IMR condition. Another goal is to test if improvements in
      quality of life are predicted by improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by
      exercise capacity on treadmill testing. Finally, the proposal will test if Integrative
      Exercise versus IMR will produce greater improvements in additional health outcomes,
      including mood, subjective sleep quality, and PTSD symptoms.

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score comparison between subjects randomized to Integrative Exercise Treatment vs. Illness Management and Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30 item scale that provides both a dimensional and categorical measure of PTSD. The CAPS-5 items are rated with a single severity score that incorporates both frequency and intensity PTSD-related symptoms. In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization).</description>

    <measure>The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) score comparison between subjects randomized to Integrative Exercise Treatment vs. Monitor Only</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original WHOQOL-100 instrument and is more convenient for use in large research studies or clinical trials. The Psychological Domain, the investigators' primary outcome, is derived from 6 items which index body image, negative &amp; positive feelings, self-esteem, spirituality, and cognition. Each item has 5 response options with higher scores denoting higher psychological health. The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Mean scores are then multiplied by 4 in order to make transformed domain scores to a range of 4-20 comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100.</description>

It assesses five facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reactivity to inner experience which represent elements of mindfulness as it is currently conceptualized. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true).</description>
