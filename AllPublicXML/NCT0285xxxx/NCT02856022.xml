    <description>Four abdominal points are selected. The upper two points are located 2.5 cun bilateral to Guanyuan (Ren 4). The lower two points are located 1.5 cun bilateral to Zhongji (Ren 3). Four long needles are punctured obliquely 1~2 cun in depth (depending on the fat layer thickness of the patient) to the four points to make the needling sensation reaching the urethra or vulva.
After the needling sensation reach the above regions, each of two pairs of electrodes from a device are connected with the two ipsilaterally inserted needles. The parameters are continuous waves, a frequency of 2.5 Hz and intensity that the patient feels comfortable for 60 min, three times a week for at least four weeks.</description>

    <description>The patient was asked to lie on a couch in a lithotomy position after urination. A catheter was passed through the urethra into the bladder and any residual urine drained. The Cystistat 50mL 40mg (sodium hyaluronate, Bioniche Teoranta, Ireland) solution is instilled through the catheter into the bladder. The catheter is then withdrawn leaving the Cystistat inside the bladder coating the lining. It was recommended the solution was retained for as long as possible, ideally at least 30 minutes. The instillation is once weekly for at least four weeks.</description>
