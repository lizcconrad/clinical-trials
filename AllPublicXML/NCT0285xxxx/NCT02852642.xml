      Introduction: the physiological aging process induces several structural changes in the
      musculoskeletal system. These, in turn, result in functional changes that are reflected in
      the senescent dependency, determining the reduction in their quality of life. Power training
      has been identified as ideal to mitigate the effects of aging. However, there are indications
      that an intervention based on the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action is a
      better choice.

      Study hypotheses: the participants of the proposed intervention will increase their bone
      mineral density, muscle volume, functional capacity and will show some improvement in their
      gait, as well as in their quality of life. Purposes: the main objective of this study was to
      propose a training model based in the potentiation of the stretch-shortening cycle action and
      assess its effects on selected parameters of musculoskeletal morphology, functional capacity
      and quality of life of elderly women.
