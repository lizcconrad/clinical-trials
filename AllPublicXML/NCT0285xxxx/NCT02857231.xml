      This is a prospective, single-arm, observational, non-randomized clinical study that will
      enroll patients with heart failure who have had a CardioMEMS™ device implanted to monitor
      their diastolic pulmonary artery pressure. The study will recruit and enroll ten participants
      from the Scripps Clinic. Participants will be monitored 3 times a week for a period of 4
      weeks. At each monitoring visit, the patient's diastolic pulmonary artery pressure will be
      measured by CardioMEMS™ and the ImpediMed's BIS technology. Participant's vital signs and
      weight will also be taken at each monitoring visit.
