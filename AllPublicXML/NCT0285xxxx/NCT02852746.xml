  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the performance and the 3D shoulder kinematics of volleyball
      attackers with and without scapular dyskinesis and shoulder symptoms in two physical
      performance measures of the upper extremity, and correlate their outcomes with a
      self-reported measure of function of the upper extremity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volleyball attackers with clinically identified scapular dyskinesis and with/without shoulder
      symptoms will be compared with respect to performance outcomes and scapular kinematics.

      Performance will be assessed by means of the unilateral seated shot put test (USSPT), the
      upper quarter Y balance test (UQYBT), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, sports
      module (DASH). Pain measurements after completing physical performance measures will be
      assessed and rated. Relationships between physical (USSPT, UQYBT) and self-perceived (DASH)
      measures of performance, and with impairment-based measures (clinical measures and 3D
      shoulder kinematics) will be assessed.

    <measure>Side-to-side differences in the unilateral seated shot put test (normalized distance thrown, in centimeters)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The unilateral seated shot put test consists of pushing (not throwing) at shoulder height a ~3kg medicine ball as far and forward as possible while keeping the axial skeleton in contact with a wall, knees bent at a right angle, feet flat on the floor, and the non-testing arm resting on the lap.</description>

    <measure>Side-to-side differences in the upper quarter Y balance test (normalized maximal distance reached in each direction, in centimeters)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The upper quarter Y balance test is performed through the assistance of a testing device (Y-Balance Test Kit), with the subject stabilizing his/her body weight with the upper extremity being tested while performing maximal reaching efforts with the free hand in three directions: medial, superolateral, and inferolateral.</description>

    <measure>Side-to-side differences in 3-dimensional humerus angular displacement (in degrees)</measure>

    <measure>Side-to-side differences in 3-dimensional thoracic angular displacement (in degrees)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The angular displacement of the thorax in the 3 planes of orientation: flexion/extension, lateral rotation (inclination), axial rotation.</description>
