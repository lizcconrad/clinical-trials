      Prospective and multicenter study conducted in the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne area. All patients
      suffering from lung cancer admitted to a pulmonology unit in 2014 will be included. This
      document will be used if a decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment is decided.
      Investigators will assess the relationship between the planned intensity of care and those
      established when the patient develops an organ failure. Patient characteristics and factors
      associated with proposed levels and types of care will be analyzed. Patient and family
      opinions will be obtained after 3 months. The number of subjects is 468.
