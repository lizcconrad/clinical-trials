  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hirschsprung disease is a congenital abnormality due to the lack of migration of neural crest
      cells in myenteric and submucosal plexi of the bowel wall. The consequence is the absence of
      parasympathetic control of the distal bowel from the anal sphincter to various levels. The
      most common type of Hirschsprung disease alters the rectosigmoid (80%). The incidence is
      around 1/5000 live births. This anomaly requires a surgical ablation of the aganglionic
      segment.

      Regardless of the surgical complications, patients with Hirschsprung disease are exposed to
      the risk of Hirschsprung Associated EnteroColitis (HAEC). This variable risk, 4-54%, is
      responsible to a major part of Hirschsprung disease morbimortality. Its onset is more
      frequent during the first two years of life and then decrease with age.

      Its pathogenesis remains unclear but could be due to intestinal homeostasis breakdown that
      involves microbiota, intestinal barrier, immune system and enteric nervous system. This
      breakdown of the mutual benefit relation due to microbiota or bowel anomaly is known to be
      responsible of Crohn's disease onset. Some studies emphasize the role of microbiota in the
      pathogenesis of HAEC, but the techniques or the methodology with small numbers of patients
      limit any conclusion or clinical use.

      The study hypothesizes microbiota is a major factor in HAEC onset and in their functional
      bowel problems. Considering HAEC is more frequent the first two years, it's thought that
      intestinal microbiota changes with time in those patients. This project is innovative because
      it will use high throughput sequencing methods and analysis for microbiome analysis on fecal
      samples from a multicenter cohort of patients at various ages.

      Multicentre transversal study.

      This study has the potential to significantly modify clinical practice for Hirschsprung
      disease patients: a better care for HAEC and functional troubles thanks to a better
      understanding of their microbiota, targetted antibiotic treatment for HAEC, prophylactic
      treatment of patients at high risk of HAEC.

      Primary objective :

      Characterize intestinal microbiota in patients with or without HAEC.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Look for a difference in microbiota composition between patients with or without HAEC ;

        -  Study the evolution with age of the microbiota in Hirschsprung disease patients ;

        -  Study predominant taxonomic classification elements in both groups.
