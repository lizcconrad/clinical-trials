    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis can affect organs other than the lungs. Liver disease affects about 30% of
      patients: its main manifestation is the development of portal hypertension (PHT). The
      pathophysiology of this comorbidity is still poorly understood. It was previously considered
      secondary to the formation of biliary cirrhosis but another hypothesis would be that of a
      primitive pathology of venous vessels may cause the gradual emergence of portal hypertension
      without cirrhosis. Evidence indiscutly suggest that cystic fibrosis is associated with a
      specific endothelial dysfunction, especially as the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
      conductance Regulator) protein is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. The
      investigators hypothesize that liver disease related to PHT−associated cystic fibrosis is
      associated with systemic endothelial dysfunction.

      The aim is:

      To demonstrate a systemic endothelial dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis when
      associated with PHT.

      To study the correlations between measures of systemic endothelial function and serum markers
      of endothelial dysfunction and between measures of liver stiffness and systemic endothelial
      function.

      Prospective , monocentric study, with four groups of patients:

        -  Patients with cystic fibrosis and PHT

        -  Cystic fibrosis patients without PHT

        -  Patients free from cystic fibrosis with PHT from other causes

        -  Healthy controls. One study visit, no follow-up.

      During the visit the following examinations will be performed:

        -  Collection of a blood sample of 21 mL.

        -  Liver eElastography achieved through hardware FibroScan® -

        -  Measurement of endothelial function with Endopat®

        -  Contrast−enhanced tomography. Abdominal CT scan will not be performed in healthy
           volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years.

          -  Patients affiliated to a social security scheme

          -  Patients who have given their written consent

          -  Four study groups:

          -  Group A: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with liver damage and diagnosis of CF is
             based on sweat test and genetic analysis). PHT diagnosis is based on tomographic
             criteria portal vein width superior to&gt; 15 mm, portosystemic shunt and / or
             splenomegaly

          -  Group B: cystic fibrosis patients without PHT diagnosis is based on sweat test and
             genetic analysis). Absence of PHTP is predicated on tomographic of Scanner.

          -  Group C: Patients free of CF with PHT related to another cause. Patients followed for
             viral liver disease (hepatitis B or C) or idiopathic portal venous system disorder,
             with or without cirrhosis. The diagnosis of PHT is based on tomographic criteria
