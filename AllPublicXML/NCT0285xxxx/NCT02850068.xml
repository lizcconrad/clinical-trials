  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test a new treatment method, geniculate artery embolization (GAE), to reduce
      the severity of pain and disability caused by knee osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if geniculate artery embolization
      (GAE) will reduce the severity of pain as well as global disability (resulting from the
      combination of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee OA
      and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if GAE can result in the
      decreased necessity for ongoing conservative OA therapies such as medication therapy and
      joint injections.

      Participants: Twenty patients with knee osteoarthritis resulting in knee pain that is
      refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6
      months.

      Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population
      undergoing GAE to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will
      consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject
      meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate
      artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 &amp; 6 months. An MRI will be
      performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to exclude
      complication.

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index will be used to measure function.

    <measure>Patient pain (mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>

    <description>Reduction in the number or strength of previously initiated OA medical therapy (e.g. NSAIDs) at 6 months follow-up, which will be summarized using counts and simple statistics (i.e., mean number of patients with reduction in medication).</description>

    <description>Geniculate artery embolization (GAE) is a new procedure that is being used to reduce pain and disability (resulting from pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caused by knee osteoarthritis (OA). Embolization is a procedure where physicians intentionally block the blood vessels to specific areas of the body to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the decrease in blood flow will decrease the size of the area of interest. In this case, the goal is to decrease the size of inflammatory tissue around the knee, resulting in improvement of pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities from OA.</description>
