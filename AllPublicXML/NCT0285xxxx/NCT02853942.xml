      Main purpose：In the face of listening to nerve injury at early stage, utilizing autologous
      adipose stem cell transplantation in the treatment of makes the acceptance micro vascular
      decompression hemifacial spasm patients to nerve function to obtain a better recovery.

      Secondary purpose ：To clarify the efficacy of stem cells in the treatment of cranial nerve
      dysfunction, and to provide evidence for the treatment of other cranial nerve dysfunction.

      Cases in group：Appearing on the surface of microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm
      to decrease neural electrophysiological index of patients research design：Single center,
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled Observation index：Facial nerve clinical
      score, facial nerve muscle compound action potential, electrical measurement, cerebrospinal
      fluid index Evaluation of therapeutic effect：Facial nerve function evaluation
      (House-Brackmann classification, facial nerve function classification scale SFGS), facial
      nerve electrophysiology evaluation (facial nerve muscle compound action potential), electric
      measurement Safety evaluation：Clear evaluation of hemifacial spasm and micro vascular
      decompression were listening to nerve in intracranial segment wrapped around the autologous
      fat stem cell therapy overall safety and evaluation methods including adverse events,
      laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram.
