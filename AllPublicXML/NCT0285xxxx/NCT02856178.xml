      This study assesses the pharmacokinetics and safety of the new antifungal F901318 in AML
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      F901318 has potent in vitro efficacy against Aspergillus spp. including azole-resistant
      strains and consistent efficacy in in vivo mouse models of infection. F901318 is active by
      both oral and intravenous routes of administration in preclinical efficacy studies.

      Non-clinical studies and phase I clinical trials show that F901318 has a good overall safety
      profile and limited potential for drug-drug interactions. F901318 exhibits a highly promising
      profile which can potentially address the critical treatment requirements for invasive
      Aspergillus infections in a changing clinical environment in which new classes of antifungals
      are needed.

      This phase IIa study aims to confirm PK and safety information of F901318 from phase I and
      bridge them to a neutropenic AML patient population, which represents the main population for
      future efficacy trials. Coadministration of caspofungin will allow recognizing potential
      factors of suboptimal F901318 exposure without the risk of fatal disseminating infection.
