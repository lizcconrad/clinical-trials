  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choroid is a richly vascularized conjunctive tissue, providing the nutritive elements to
      the pigmentary epithelium and the photoreceptors of the retina. It drains 80% of the eye's
      blood. The choroidal thickness fluctuates according to the state of fullness of its
      constitutive vessels. The choroid and the neuroretina (separate by the pigmentary epithelium)
      are intimately linked and are subject to modifications during the ingestion of caffeine and
      taurine combined. Several authors have shown a significant decrease of the choroidal
      thickness lasting at least 4 hours after the ingestion of a small coffee. This decrease may
      be caused by caffeine's vasoconstrictor effect. Taurine is the most abundant amino acid in
      the retina. Recent studies have shown the importance of this amino acid in the physiology of
      both, retinal pigmentary epithelium and retinal ganglion cells.

      RedBull® is an energizing drink, where one single 25 cl can contains 80 mg of caffeine (the
      equivalent of a coffee mug) and 1 g of taurine.

      This pilot trial aims to study the variations of the choroidal thickness and to describe
      possible modifications within the pigmentary epithelium, due to the ingestion of caffeine and
      taurine. The results of this study will act as a reference for an ulterior trial aiming
      specific choroidal pathologies of young patients, such as the central serous chorioretinitis.
