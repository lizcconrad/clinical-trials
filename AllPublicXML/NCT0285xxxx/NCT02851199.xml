  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroencephalograhy (EEG) is used as a tool for diagnosing epilepsy/convulsions.

      During the recording, especially for childen who are suspected of having abbcence epilepsy
      the investigators will perform an EEG recording including a provocation test of
      hyperventilation in order to induce epileptic discharges.

      There is no clear instruction about the position of the child during performing this
      hyperventilation provocation.

      Clinical observations showed that this provocation is more effective when it's performed in
      the siiting position.

      No study was previously performed to investigate this issue

      The study will include 30 patients at the age of 4-10 years old of both sexes. after signing
      an informed concent, every child, suspected of having absence seizures, will undergoe an EEG
      recording including a provocation of hyperventilation.

      The study will include two groups:

        1. A group of 15 children who will undergoe an EEG recording with 3 minutes of
           hyperventilation in the prone position, followed by 5 minutes of rest, then after
           another 5-10 minutes of recording with normal breathing. Finally the participants will
           performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the sitting position

        2. A group of 15 children who will undergoe an EEG recording with 3 minutes of
           hyperventilation in the sitting position, followed by 5 minutes of rest, then after
           another 5-10 minutes of recording with normal breathing. . Finally the participants will
           performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the prone position.

      Participants who will not be able to perform all the steps of the study will be excluded The
      analysis of the study results will be performed by a specialist in pediatric neurology and
      pediatric epilepsy who will confirm whether the EEG recording show epileptic discharge (sharp
      waves, slow waves, combination of sharp and slow waves, spikes or combination of spikes and
      slow waves)
