  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using
      different remote data collection technologies to ascertain flare occurrence among gout
      patients. Two technologies will be the focus of this study: a telephone based interactive
      voice response (IVR) and a smartphone mobile application (called RheumPRO). The results of
      this study will not only guide research approaches in clinical trials, but may also have
      direct implications for monitoring patient outcomes in the context of day-to-day clinical
      practice.

      The investigators hypothesize that acceptability will be greater for RheumPRO application
      than IVR. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that RheumPRO will be associated with a
      greater frequency of patient-initiated interactions.

      Acute gout flares are a major cause of morbidity. Flares lead to substantial reductions in
      health-related quality of life, increased work absenteeism, productivity loss, and
      substantial healthcare costs. Acute gout flares are likely related to more than 174,000
      emergency department visits in the U.S. annually with corresponding charges approaching $166
      million (1).

      In recent surveys, gout patients and healthcare providers alike identified the reduction of
      gout flares as the highest priority outcome that should be examined in future comparative
      effectiveness studies of urate lowering therapy (ULT) (unpublished results). Despite
      consensus about the importance of capturing flares, clinical trials investigating ULTs (2-6)
      or anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (7) have used inconsistent flare definitions and methods of
      flare ascertainment. The inconsistency has likely been driven by the absence of a
      standardized definition or ascertainment method. These deficits limit comparisons that can be
      made across investigations.

      Recently, a group supported by the American College of Rheumatology &amp; European League Against
      Rheumatism (ACR &amp; EULAR) has attempted to define a gout flare (8-10). For simplicity, the
      group focused on defining only those flares occurring after a definitive gout diagnosis. Nine
      elements of a flare definition emerged from the first two studies (8, 9). These nine elements
      included physician reported information, laboratory data and patient self-report. In a third
      study, Gaffo et al. compared the discriminatory ability of the self-reported items against
      the gold standard of a rheumatologist's judgment of flare presence (10). Self-report of 4
      criteria had the greatest discriminatory ability with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931
      (10). These promising results indicate the important role for a standardized self-report
      definition of a gout flare.

      In addition to variability in gout flare definitions, the optimal method for obtaining
      self-reported flares remains undefined. An early study of febuxostat, for example, assessed
      flares weekly at physician visits (2). Another study counted a flare only when it was treated
      by a healthcare provider (4). Still other studies assessed flares during physician visits
      occurring at variable time points (3, 6). These inconsistent methods also pose practical
      limitations given by their time and resource intensive nature. Opportunities to increase
      efficiency have only recently become available with the validation of the self-reported
      definition for gout flares described above. Self-report can now be combined with
      technological advances in remote data collection to develop novel and highly efficient
      methods to identify gout flares. The investigators propose a study to address this pressing
      need by leveraging technological advances that facilitate the remote and real-time collection
      of patient reported flares and outcomes (PROs) in gout.

    <description>IVR will auto dial participants at a schedule time. Participants complete questions using their phone keypad. Participants can also call the IVR to complete surveys if they experience a flare. The IVR will be programmed to call the patient weekly for 26 weeks to complete a weekly Gout Flare Survey and Patient Reported Outcomes Survey. Consistent with the published gout flare self-report definition, gout flare ascertainment questions will include whether the recent flare is similar to past flares, the number of swollen joints and the number of warm joints. Pain at rest during the attack will be assessed on a 0-9 scale. Further questions will include peak pain, timing of attack and duration of attack if completed. We will capture patient reported outcome measures (e.g. pain, fatigue, sleep) using instruments from NIH PROMIS. In addition at months 1 , 3, and 6 will assess IVR ease of use, burden of use, and disruption to daily activities.</description>

    <description>RheumPRO will be programmed to notify participants weekly for 26 weeks via a scheduled &quot;pop-up&quot; to complete Gout Flare and Patient Reported Outcomes Surveys. Participants self-navigate through the survey questions using their smartphone. If participants do not complete the Gout Flare or Patient Reported Outcomes surveys RheumPro will generate 2 more &quot;pop-ups&quot; at the same time over the proceeding 2 days (eg. Tuesday 4 PM, Wednesday 4 PM). Participants can also open the RheumPro application on their smartphone and complete surveys or if they experience a flare on a day they are not scheduled to complete a survey. In addition RheumPro questionnaires at months 1 , 3, and 6 will assess RheumPro ease of use, burden of use, willingness to continue use and disruption to daily activities.</description>
