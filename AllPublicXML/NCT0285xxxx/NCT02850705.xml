  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Devic's neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is rare. Epidemiological and demographic data are poor,
      based mainly on monocentric cohorts. Moreover, NMO might be difficult to distinguish from
      multiple sclerosis and begin with atypical or incomplete clinical presentations. Therefore,
      NMO is still underdiagnosed. The constitution of a nationwide and prospective cohort,
      including not only NMO but also clinical syndromes suggestive of a first episode
      (DNMO-spectrum disorders (SDs)), should allow to gather a critical mass of cases and answer
      questions that could not have been addressed at the level of a single centre.

      Objectives: The main objective is to describe the clinical, radiological and biological
      features of NMO spectrum disorder (NMO, isolated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis
      (LETM), relapsing or not; isolated atypical optic neuritis (ON)) and their evolution. The
      second aim is to create a biobank dedicated to NMO (serum, whole blood for RNA and DNA
      extraction, cerebrospinal fluid), to promote translational research in the field. Methods:
      NOMADMUS is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of patients NMOSD and related
      disorder in France. Prevalent cases are included retrospectively and then followed
      prospectively. Incident cases are included from disease onset and followed prospectively. A
      minimal set of data has been defined and synthesized on specific paper forms derived from the
      European database for multiple sclerosis (EDMUS) forms. Patients are systematically tested
      regarding their AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG status. All the data are centralised in a EDMUS-derived
      database in Lyon, the EDEN software. All cases are validated and classified by an expert
      committee.
