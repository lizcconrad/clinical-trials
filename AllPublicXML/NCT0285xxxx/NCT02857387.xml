  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis and aging are associated to the raise of biochemical alterations of proteins
      grouped under the name of &quot; non-enzymatic post-translational modifications &quot;. They often
      correspond to the irreversible binding of glucose or other oses (glycation) or urea
      derivatives (carbamylation) on proteins and lead to the formation of complex compounds
      (post-translational modifications derived products, PTMD) that can accumulate in tissues and
      be responsible for deleterious effects. The specific role of these compounds in the
      pathophysiology of aging and atherosclerosis remains unknown, as are the molecular and
      cellular mechanisms implicated.

      This project is based on the hypothesis that non-enzymatic post-translational modifications
      may cause changes in the genesis of complication of coronary atherosclerosis and that PTMD
      could therefore constitute relevant biomarkers in this specific clinical situation.

      To explore these potential new biomarkers, the investigators designed a study in patients
      having experienced an acute coronary syndrome and followed during a year. The concentrations
      of PTMD assayed at 0, 1, 3, 12 months, will be correlated to clinical (severity and
      evolution) and paraclinical (cutaneous autofluorescence) data and the effect of cardiac
      rehabilitation will be assessed.

      This should help to identify new (and non-traditional) biomarkers of coronary heart disease
      and determine some of the implicated pathophysiological mechanisms.
