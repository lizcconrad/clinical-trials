    <textblock>
      This project studies memory and attention in healthy children aged from 5 to 17 years. The
      processes investigated are short term memory (auditory and visual) and attention.

      To characterize these processes involved in childhood, neuropsychological and
      neurophysiological assessments will be performed (using Electro-encephalography measures,
      behavioural responses and questionnaires).

    <intervention_name>Experience 2 : Passive and Active Auditory Perception</intervention_name>
    <description>Neuropsychological tests consist in listening to sounds under 2 conditions, an active or a passive one, during which different auditory stimuli will be presented: frequent stimuli (standard) and rare stimuli (deviants). These two stimuli differ in some of their feature (height, duration, …). A third, very rare (novel) stimulus will also be used (the subject's first name). Responses will be provided using a response-button and feedback will be given at each response. EEG will be recorded all along to measure Neurophysiological signals.</description>

    <intervention_name>Experience 3 : Visual Attention Training</intervention_name>
    <description>This experience aims at training visual attention through serious games. Children will play against an artificial intelligence and will focus their attention on one out of many possible targets (checkers, cards, boxes) presented on screen. Responses will be provided using a response-button, sometimes completed by an eye-tracking measure. Feedback will be given to the child after his response. EEG will be recorded all along to measure Neurophysiological signals.</description>

    <intervention_name>Experience 4 : Attention and Distractibility</intervention_name>
    <description>Neuropsychological tests consist in listening to sounds preceded by a visual cue indicating (or not) in which ear the sounds will be played. The subject Child should detect the target sound (e.g. a dog barking). In some trials, a distracting distraction will be introduced between the visual cue and the target sound. Responses will be provided using a response-button. EEG will be recorded all along to measure Neurophysiological signals.</description>

    <intervention_name>Experience 5 : Sustained Visual Attention</intervention_name>
    <description>Neuropsychological tests consist in watching visual stimuli presented in 3 blocks of 3 minutes each, with a break of one minute between each block. The child has to detect the presence of a red letter in a pattern made of four letters (the three other letters are black). Behavioral responses will be provided using a response-button. EEG will be recorded all along to measure Neurophysiological signals.</description>
