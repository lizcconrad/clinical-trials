  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacoinvasive approach after thrombolysis is the standard treatment of myocardial
      infarction when deadlines are too long for primary angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty is then
      carried out within 3 to 24 hours following thrombolysis. The adjuvant antiplatelet therapy of
      thrombolysis combines aspirin with clopidogrel (75 or 300 mg depending on age). These
      clopidogrel doses are associated with a very low anti-platelet aggregation response within 24
      hours following administration. However, the antiplatelet agregation that inhibits the
      progression of intracoronary thrombus must be optimal at the time of angioplasty to reduce
      the risk of thrombotic events. Intracoronary thrombus residual angiographic post-thrombolysis
      was associated with impaired myocardial reperfusion but coronary angiography has a very low
      sensitivity for detecting the thrombus. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) is currently
      the method of choice to visualize and quantify the intracoronary thrombus. It is used
      routinely in the presence of a thrombus to correctly estimate the size of the artery and for
      the evaluation of good stent apposition.

      The thrombectomy at the time of angioplasty improves myocardial reperfusion, particularly in
      case of major thrombotic mass. Intracoronary thrombus residual post-thrombolysis could be a
      marker for the quality of reperfusion itself correlated to the quality of the antiplatelet
      post-thrombolysis.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that the systematic use of the OCT before elective
      angioplasty (within 3 to 24 hours) after successful thrombolysis could be used to guide the
      use of thrombectomy and adequate stenting and thus improve myocardial reperfusion. Our study
      will also correlate the importance of the residual thrombus before angioplasty myocardial
      reperfusion one hand and to the inhibition of platelet activity observed other.
