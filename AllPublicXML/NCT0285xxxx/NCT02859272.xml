  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by lack of vaginal support which enables
      pelvic organs to bulge into the vaginal walls and sometimes protrude through the genital
      hiatus. POP is more frequent among women who had their uterus removed.

      We would like to investigate whether suspension of the top of the vagina during remowal of
      the uterus prevents subsequent POP.

      The purpose of the PhD project is therefore to describe validity, terminology, and operative
      performance of used suspension methods during benign hysterectomy in Denmark. Further, to
      investigate these suspension methods' possible association with pain, life quality,
      sexuality, pessary use, and POP .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2012 the investigators introduced codes of suspension methods to the Danish hysterectomy
      and hysteroscopy Database's registration chart. Consequently, validity of these codes needs
      to be ensured to enable their use in further research.

      Thereafter, the prevalence of Danish gynecologists' use of the different suspension methods
      will be investigated. A questionnaire will elucidate a possible relation between the
      suspension methods and pain, life quality and sexuality. Through a register based study in
      the National Patient Register the association between suspension methods and post
      hysterectomy POP and possible confounding will be investigated.
