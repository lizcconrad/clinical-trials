  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this time, there is no standardization for knee trauma care in children. Each physician is
      free to resort or not to radiography to verify or dispel bone fracture, depending on
      radiographic device availability. This decision is based on trauma severity, clinical
      features, and physician experience.

      Knee traumatisms are a common reason of consultation. In emergency departments, radiographic
      use is widespread for those traumatisms, but not in private practice.

      Most of those knee traumatisms includes soft tissue lesion, for which radiography gives no
      details. Yet, radiography exposes bone fracture which may require a specific orthopaedic
      care. Then, it seems beneficial to highlight simple and reproducible clinical criteria in
      order to identify severe knee traumatisms, requiring radiography to assess bone fracture.

      Those criteria should have a sensibility close to 1, and the highest specificity. Such
      criteria could significantly decrease the number of radiography thus irradiation, emergencies
      waiting time, and consultation expenses without missing bone fracture.

      Ottawa knee rules for adults are: age 55 years older, tenderness at head of fibula, isolated
      tenderness of patella inability to flex to 90°, inability to bear weight on 4 steps both
      immediately and in the emergency department. Presence of one of those criteria required front
      and profile radiography to assess bone fracture.

      However, few studies have been conducted among children, and they do not confirm the use of
      those criteria targeting fracture screening. Data are contradictory and they do not allow
      concluding that such criteria could be of benefit for children. Moreover, studies only
      consider adults clinical criteria. This study would be the first to implement specific
      paediatric criteria, which make this study original.
