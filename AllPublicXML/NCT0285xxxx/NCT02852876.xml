  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single rising doses
      of ASP2151 under fasted condition in healthy male subjects.

      The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of ASP2151 under
      fasted versus fed conditions in healthy male subjects.

      Study will be divided into two parts. Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      ASP2151 single rising doses in groups A-H in fasted condition and to determine the maximum
      tolerable dose (MTD) if possible.

      Part 2 will evaluate the effect of fasted versus fed conditions on the safety, tolerability
      and PK of a single dose of ASP2151 in two treatment cycles. The wash-out period between the
      two treatment cycles will be at least 5 days and not shorter than five times the average
      elimination half-life of ASP2151, as determined in part 1 of the study.
