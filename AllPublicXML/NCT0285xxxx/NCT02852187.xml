      Prospective randomized clinical study comparing Signus MOBIS PEEK vs SIGNUS MOBIS II ST in
      patients with Degenerative Disc Disease at one or two contiguous levels from L2-S1
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      The protocol includes skeletally mature patients both male and female, 18 to 89 years old,
      with degenerative disc disease (DDD) at one or two contiguous levels from L2-S1. DDD is
      defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history
      and radiographic studies. Patients may also have up to a Grade I spondylolisthesis or
      retrolisthesis at the involved level(s). Patient should have completed at least six (6)
      months of non-operative treatment. Patients may have had a previous non-fusion surgery at the
      involved spinal level(s) and will be followed clinically up to two years.
