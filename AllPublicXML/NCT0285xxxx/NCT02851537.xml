      EPIRMEX is a complementary study to the national cohort EPIPAGE 2 the INSERM Unit 953 is
      responsible. The objective of this study is to evaluate at the age of 5 years corrected
      executive functions in children born very prematurely in relation to structural brain
      abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (technical conventional and advanced)
      performed at the age of term. The current study is a project on a subset of the population of
      premature EPIRMEX subjects who had an advanced technique as magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS). It is a recent imaging technique for a study of the cerebral metabolism. It is based
      on the detection of cerebral metabolites, and the variations of their concentration to
      characterize different pathologies. In most cases, combinations of metabolites are informed
      creatine + phosphocreatine (CR), glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (CHO) +
      Nacétylaspartate Nacetylaspartylglutamate (NAA), myoinositol (INS) and lactate (LAC). In the
      premature newborn, the NAA / CHO ratio increases with age in all brain regions. The LAC / NAA
      ratio decreases significantly with age in the thalamus, basal ganglia, the corticospinal
      tract, and parietal white matter tends to decrease elsewhere . A number of studies show that
      proton spectroscopy term can predict the long-term newborn who presented an anoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy .These studies indicate that an increase in lactate and a decrease in NAA are
      correlated with abnormal neurological development. And decreases in NAA / CR and / or NAA /
      CHO ratios are predictive of motor abnormalities in children with anoxic encephalopathy
      presented an ischemia . These decreases were also measured in the basal ganglia, occipital
      cortex, and areas near the last. Few studies have explored the magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy of proton-term prediction of the future of large premature.

      This is a prospective cohort study on a subsample of children born prematurely (before 33
      weeks of gestation (SA) otherwise included in the national cohort EPIPAGE 2 and included in
      epirmex and who enjoys a spectrosocpie. This research project proposed in the framework of
      the AORC as ancillary study EPIPAGE 2 -EPIRMEX therefore focuses on spectroIRM voluntarily at
      the age of term (39-41 SA), and more specifically the emergence executive functions to 5
      years EPIRMEX main objective of the study. the application of our project to this tender is
      requested by the PACA region due to the high rate spectroIRM performed by our area (about
      75%) and strong involvement of Dr. C. Gire in EPIPAGE 2 and EPIRMEX. However, only
      neuropsychological assessments FE 5 years testing sub-cities will be funded EPIPAGE 2. The
      specific aspect of our study is not funded EPIPAGE 2.

      The children received conventional MRI at the age of term (39-41 SA), supplemented by
      specific sequences for single voxel analysis in microstructural analysis (white matter, basal
      ganglia and brainstem), short echo and echo time consuming. The study of the spectra will be
      done quantitatively by CEMEREM laboratory - UMR 6612 CNRS / Université de la Méditerranée /
      Division of Medical Imaging (Pr Guye).

      The relevance of the project was its ability to include quality as 550 MRI were performed,
      including 120 MRI spectrometer can be analyzed.

      These children were assessed within 2 EPIPAGE the corrected age of 2 years, 3 years (EPIRMEX)
      and 5 years (2 + EPIPAGE EPIRMEX). The balance sheet under 5 years in EPIRMEX is evaluating a
      comprehensive intellectual efficiency WPPSI III, some elements of the NEPSY and the figure of
      REY.

      So magnetic resonance spectroscopy may provide additional diagnostic value to cranial
      ultrasound and MRI in infants.

      The main objective is to assess the relation between the cerebral MRS at term-equivalent age
      of very preterm infants and the executive functions at the age of 5 years corrected.
