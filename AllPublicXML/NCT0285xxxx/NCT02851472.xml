  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to determine whether providing inhaled nitric oxide (iNO; a
      vasodilator) will improve the delivery of oxygen to the brain, kidney and intestines of
      preterm neonates during and after the subject receives a packed red blood cell transfusion
      (PRBC) for anemia vs. baseline period. The investigators will observe the effect of inhaled
      nitric oxide vs. placebo at these body sites to determine whether iNO will alter the
      fractional tissue oxygen extraction. Treatment and control groups will be compared to each
      other at equivalent epochs as will individual patients before, during and after the PRBC
      transfusion.

      Selection criteria: 1) Neonates 24 0/7 to 27 6/7 weeks gestational age (GA) 2) More than 2
      weeks postnatal age. 3) Anemia with Hct less than 28 % 4) &gt;50 % total daily fluids is enteral
      5) History of at least 1 prior PRBC transfusion ELGANs admitted to the neonatal intensive
      care unit (NICU) will be screened for the study. If patients meet the selection criteria,
      parents will be approached to obtain informed consent. Then the patient will be randomized to
      either iNO or placebo group before treatment. The treating physician will make the decision
      regarding timing of the PRBC transfusion to treat anemia for the subject.

      During the period of observation, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring will be
      performed on all enrolled subjects during which a non-invasive probe will be attached to the
      skin at 3 sites simultaneously- on abdomen below umbilicus, flank/back, and forehead for
      calculation of fractional tissue oxygen extraction ( FTOE) in conjunction with concurrent
      pulse oximetry recordings.

      Conventional vital signs, blood gas, lactate, haptoglobin and cytokines will be measured
      before and after the PRBC transfusion

    <measure>Increased NIRS oxygenation after a PRBC transfusion in iNO treated neonates vs Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>19 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that NIRS signal will be significantly higher in the iNO treated group during the 2nd hour after transfusion is concluded vs Placebo. NIRS will be measured continuously and averaged every 5 minutes to create a single hourly point for each subject before and after the transfusion for statistical analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) in iNO treated neonates after PRBC transfusion vs Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>19 hours</time_frame>
    <description>FTOE will be calculated from the 5 minute epochs of the recorded pulse oximeter and NIRS devices. The investigators hypothesize that FTOE will be significantly lower (i.e. improved) in the iNO treated group during the 2nd hour after transfusion is concluded vs Placebo. One entire hour before and another after the transfusion will be combined for each patient for statistical analysis.</description>
