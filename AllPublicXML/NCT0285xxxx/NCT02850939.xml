  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) is highly effective and appropriate for nearly all
      breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, which represent 75% of all
      breast cancer diagnoses. Long-term use of EHT reduces cancer recurrence rates and cuts the
      risk of death nearly in half during the second decade after diagnosis, research shows.
      Despite the proven benefits, about 33% of women who are prescribed EHT do not take their
      medication as prescribed (less than 80% take their daily dosage) and are thus at higher risk
      of recurrence and death.

      This educational randomized controlled study will develop and pilot-test a bilingual,
      culturally tailored, personalized, interactive mobile application (app) in combination with
      patient navigation to promote and improve adherence to endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) among
      breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed two-year study involves a 2-group randomized control trial with 3-time
      assessments (baseline, 3 and 6 months) and will enroll 120 breast cancer patients who are
      prescribed EHT and are attending the breast clinic at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center
      (CTRC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center at the University of Texas
      Health Science Center at San Antonio. The intervention group will receive two components: 1)
      a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive mobile app; and 2) support from a
      patient navigator. The control group will receive the usual care and information provided by
      the CTRC's breast clinic and pharmacy to patients undergoing oral EHT. The intervention
      components are based in Social Cognitive Theory and elements of Motivational Interviewing.

      The proposed study aims to:

        1. Develop a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive mobile application
           (app) to promote and improve EHT adherence among breast cancer patients diagnosed with
           hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The app will empower patients' self-monitoring
           and management, as well as facilitate patient education, early identification and
           reporting of side effects, delivery of self-care advice, and timely feedback through
           direct interaction between the patient and the oncology team when necessary.

        2. Conduct a 2-group randomized controlled study to assess the feasibility and
           effectiveness of a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive app +
           patient navigation (PN) to promote EHT adherence compared to usual care among patients
           diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and who are prescribed EHT.

    <description>We will review prescribing and refill records for EHT (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors -AIs) and the number of days cover by each prescription, the number of dispensed tablets and the daily dose, to calculate an adherence index across the 6-month intervention.18 In addition we will use monthly self-reporting data collected via the mobile app and a patient self-report short questionnaire (the MMAS-8). This scale has shown to have concurrent and predictive validity of medication adherence.</description>
