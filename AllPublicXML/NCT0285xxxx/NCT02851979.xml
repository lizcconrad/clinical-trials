  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apneas concern about 85% of premature newborns (NB) born after less than 34 weeks of
      pregnancy. They are considered as an important risk factor for subsequent neuropsychological
      deficiency. Current pharmacological treatments are not very effective, and have side effects
      (agitation, irritability, sleep disorders, tachycardia). Some studies suggest that in NBs
      with apneas resisting to drugs, a permanent odorisation with a drop of vanillin on the
      incubator's pillow might reduce the frequency of apneas. This latin square design study will
      test a controlled olfactory stimulation method, i.e. an olfactometer which controls the odor
      duration, intensity, and sequence using three different odors, to reduce apneic episodes
      measured using 24-registration of heart and respiratory rates.

    <description>Odors are disseminated using a portable fragrance device, a prototype developed by a research unit, CNRS UMR5292. The device is outside the incubator, the only part inside is a disposable Teflon tube. The odor flux stimulates distally the NBs' nostrils. Odoriferous compounds are placed in glass tubes. This allows the olfactometer to deliver three distinct odors (to avoid habituation) in a random scheme: spearmint odor, vanilla odor, and grapefruit odor (chemicals registered by Chemical Abstracts Service), while controlling for intensity (amount of compound), duration, and odor sequence. For the vehicle period, the glass tubes remain empty.
Stimulations occur every 5 minutes, for 5 seconds, they are mixed in medical gas to avoid infection. There are three 24-hour periods, and two 24-hour wash out periods, followed by a maximum of 3 days of surveillance.</description>
