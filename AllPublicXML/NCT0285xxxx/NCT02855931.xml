  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has become the standard of care for patients suffering of
      chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwP) who have failed medical therapy. The goal
      of surgery is now to widely marsupialize the sinus cavities in order to optimize topical
      steroid irrigation treatment in the postoperative period. With that being said, the true
      extent of surgery needed for optimal patient outcome has yet to be elucidated. More
      specifically, in the last 30 years, people have argued about the best way to manage the
      middle turbinate. Some state that it should be preserved at all times to protect the sinus
      cavities from inhaled irritants and allergens and keep this surgical landmark untouched for
      future surgeries. On the other hand, there are defenders of routine resection of this
      turbinate, whether it is affected by polypoid changes or not. Many studies have looked at the
      potential risks of resecting the middle turbinates such as iatrogenic frontal sinusitis,
      anosmia, or atrophic rhinitis but the more recent literature does not show such significant
      associations. A recent topic of debate is whether partial removal of the anterior and
      inferior portion of the middle turbinate affects nasal polyps recurrence or improves
      long-term outcomes by further facilitation of post-operative topical therapies. Some
      retrospective data has shown that its resection could prolong the time before the need for
      revision surgery and improve both endoscopic and olfaction scores. A few prospective studies
      have also been published but unfortunately none of these were randomized, thus introducing a
      significant selection bias. Thus, there is a need for a formal randomized, controlled trial
      to elucidate this question.
