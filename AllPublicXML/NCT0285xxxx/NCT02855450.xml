      An 8 Week phase Ib, monocentric, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled, parallel
      groups, study with a 24 Week follow-up period to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy
      of a 180 μg/ml recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution versus
      vehicle in patients with glaucoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a masked, randomized, single-dose, monocentric trial of 60 study participants with
      chronic primary open angle glaucoma. Participants may qualify with either progressive optic
      neuropathy despite maximal current therapy (i.e. IOP reduction), or with stabilized IOP but
      diminished vision (central or peripheral). Participants with a qualifying eye will be
      randomized 2:1 to topical recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) therapy or vehicle
      placebo control. Examinations for safety and efficacy will occur one week following
      initiation of therapy, and at 4, 8, 12 and 32 weeks. All participants in either arm will be
      followed clinically at 4 weeks after cessation of therapy.

          5. Participant has undergone lens removal in the last 3 months, with or without
             intra-ocular lens implantation, or has undergone intra-ocular lens replacement within
             3 months, or has undergone any other ocular surgery within 9 months prior to
             initiation of study drug.

          6. Participant is receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

          7. Participant is currently participating in or has within the last 3 months participated
             in any other clinical trial of a non-clinically approved drug by ocular or systemic
             administration.

          8. Participant has uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease.

          9. Participant has diabetic macular edema.

         10. Participant has a history of ocular herpes zoster.

         11. Participant is on chemotherapy.

         12. Participant has a history of malignancy, not counting basal cell carcinomas, UNLESS it
             was treated successfully 2 years prior to inclusion in the trial.

         13. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural
             medications.

         14. History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.

         15. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or post-
             menopausal for at least 1 year) are excluded from participation in the study if they
             meet any one of the following conditions:

               1. are currently pregnant or,

               2. have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening/Baseline
                  Visit or,

               3. intend to become pregnant during the study treatment period or,

               4. are breast-feeding or,

                  contraceptives - oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected and/or mechanical
                  barrier methods - spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or
                  diaphragm or IUD during the entire course of and 30 days after the study
                  treatment periods.
