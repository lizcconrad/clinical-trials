      This study highlight genetics mutations with major effect in Crohn's Disease (CD) by WES in
      individuals affected and healthy individuals from EPIMAD Inserm InVS registry families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPIMAD Registry covers a large area of Northern France (9 millions inhabitants) and
      collects all incident CD cases and data from CD multiplex families (families with 3 or more
      CD affected patients) in the Nord the Pas de Calais the Somme and the Seine Maritime. If the
      investigators could demonstrate that most CD cases from multiplex families were related to
      high frequency of NOD2 gene mutations, the investigators found some CD multiplex families
      without any NOD2 gene involvement. Thus in these families high prevalence of CD cases may
      rely on other major genetic susceptibility variant(s) that remain to be determined.

      this clinical research Whole Exome Sequencing protocol, aiming to highlight genetics
      mutations with major effect in CD has been initiated.

      This study is a familial genetic study with intra-familial controls. The genetics analyses
      are:

        -  Ascertain of no significant NOD2 mutation in the family members by Sanger DNA sequencing

        -  WES (CD patients and family controls unaffected subjects)

        -  Genotyping of all mutations found, case control and segregation analyses to validate
           their implication in CD.

    <description>One of the main inclusion criteria is the absence in the family (and thus in the proband) of any NOD2 mutation that could be related with the high occurrence of Crohn's Disease in the family. So verification of the lack of CD related NOD2 gene mutation is a prerequisite to the inclusion of the family in the protocol. This is achieved by Sanger sequencing of all exons, exon-intron junctions and search for already described intronic mutations in the family proband.</description>

    <measure>Whole Exome Sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months after recruiting</time_frame>
    <description>Whole Exome Sequencing will be performed in every subject from all families. All genetic variants will be filtered with bioinformatic tools. Genetic variants with putative biological effect, presents in affected CD patients and absents in their unaffected relatives will be further investigated (i.e. cosegregation with the disease, involvement in a given pathway....). This study remains a &quot;pilot study&quot; to identify genetic variants that may be involved in Crohn's Disease.</description>
