    <textblock>
      Considering the importance of infection control practices, Madinah Public Health Department
      launched a new license program for healthcare workers, the Basic Infection Control Skills
      License program (BICSL). BICSL has been launched to train healthcare workers all over the
      region in a scientific standardized way.

      To assess BICSL effectiveness, a non-randomized control study will be conducted in two of the
      general hospitals in Madinah. An electronic bilingual self-administrated valid and reliable
      questionnaire will be used to evaluate the workers knowledge and practices before and after
      three and six months of the intervention. The knowledge and practice answers were scored and
      the scores were categorized to facilitate the comparison. A BICSL certified trainer will be
      conducting the intervention, a one to one training session. A SPSS program will be used to
      analyze the data. Administrative and ethical approval was obtained from Madinah health
      authority. The participants will complete an electronic consent before they fill the
      questionnaire. Confidentiality and privacy as well as freedom to participate or not will be
      insured to all participants. This study will assess the license effectiveness in improve
      knowledge and compliance.
