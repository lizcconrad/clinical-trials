  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the effect of two dietary patterns, Mediterranean
      diet and the specific carbohydrate diet on clinical, inflammatory and microbial parameters in
      patients after pouch surgery and to assess the effect of a personal tailored diet, based on
      microbial profile, on disease outcomes and generate a predictive model for future
      interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence exist regarding the role of diet in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      bowel diseases. One possible mechanism for the effect of diet on intestinal inflammation is
      modification of the gut microbial composition. However, the relationship between diet, the
      microbiome and intestinal inflammation is still vague.

      The investigators plan to perform a crossover clinical trial. Seventy ulcerative colitis
      patients post restorative proctocolectomy (pouch) will be randomly allocated into two
      short-term (one week) dietary interventions, the Mediterranean diet and the specific
      carbohydrate diet, to assess which diet has the required influence (i.e. increased diversity,
      decrease in specific pathobionts and increase in &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; taxa) on the gut
      microbiome of each participant. Based on this assessment, each participant will be treated by
      a personally-tailored diet for up to one year, during which microbial composition, clinical
      parameters, and quality of life will be assessed.
