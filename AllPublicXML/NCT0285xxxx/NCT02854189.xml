      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the Oxford unicompartmental knee
      arthroplasty on two groups of patients, namely one with genu recurvatum before the procedure
      and one without. Specifically, this study compare the number of occurrences of postoperative
      genu recurvatum and the postoperative hyperextension angles among the patients. Additionally,
      the knee scores, the pain scores, and the functional scores for the two groups of patients
      are compared.

      Materials and methods: This study prospectively followed 104 patients (114 knees) who had
      been treated with cemented minimally invasive surgery unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and
      had had a minimum of 24 months of follow-up. The patients were divided into two groups: those
      without preoperative genu recurvatum (85 patients; 94 knees) and those with preoperative genu
      recurvatum (19 patients; 20 knees). The incidence of the postoperative genu recurvatum, the
      postoperative hyperextension angles, the knee scores, the pain scores, and the functional
      scores were recorded and compared between two groups..

      The patients in both groups were applied with cemented Oxford unicompartmental knee
      arthroplasty with the same surgeon. The all patients were performed surgery with minimally
      invasive surgery technique. The gender, site, range of motion, alignment of prosthesis,
      operative time, blood loss, and posterior slope of tibial component also were recorded and
      compared between two groups. The incidence of postoperative genu recurvatum, gender, and site
      were computed using Fisher's exact test. The hyperextension angle, knee score, pain score,
      functional score,range of motion, alignment of prosthesis, posterior slope of tibial
      component, operative time, and blood loss were compared with student t-test.
