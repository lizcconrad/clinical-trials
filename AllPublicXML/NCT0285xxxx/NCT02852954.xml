      Immune system suppression effect of Progesterone Induced Blocking Factor(PIBF), it could be
      questionable whether tumor cells express PIBF for escape of immune system. There are some
      studies in the literature that evaluate PIBF expression of different malign cells (e.g.
      glioblastoma multiforme as a malign central nerve system, leukemia, astrocytoma as a primary
      brain tumor, lung cancer and chorionic carcinoma). According to previous studies PIBF has
      been used as an anti-tumor immune suppressor by tumor cells. There is no data about the PIBF
      expression of endometrial tumor cells. Therefore, the investigators aim to determine the PIBF
      expression levels in the endometrial cancer cells.

      This retrospective controlled study will be conducted at both Obstetrics and Gynecology
      clinics and Pathology clinics of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital. This study will be
      conducted with the use of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks
      immunohistochemically to determine the PIBF expression levels in the samples. There are three
      groups in this study; endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and normal endometrium and
      each of the groups contained 20 paraffin embedded blocks provided form the Pathology clinic
      of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital archives.
