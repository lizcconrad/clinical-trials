  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided in 2 parts. Part 1a is being conducted to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and relative bioavailability of the 2 free base tablet formulations (related
      compound [RC] and high shear wet granulation [HSWG]) compared to the reference capsule
      formulation under fasted conditions. This is a 3-period; cross-over study that will guide
      which gepotidacin formulation will be used for future studies. Following review of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data in Part 1a, a decision will be made whether to proceed
      with Parts 1b and 2.

      Part 1b is a 2-period, cross-over study and will assess the effect of food on the PK of the
      selected gepotidacin tablet formulation from Part 1a. In Part 2, the PK of the selected
      gepotidacin tablet formulation from Part 1a in Japanese (2a) and Chinese (2b) subjects will
      be evaluated under fasted conditions.

      The duration of the study (from Screening to the Follow-up visit) will be approximately 44
      days (Part 1a), 41 days (Part 1b) and 38 days (Part 2a and 2b each), respectively. The
      approximate number of subjects enrolled in Part 1a will be 27 (9 subjects in each of the 3
      treatment sequences), 16 in Part 1b (8 subjects in each of the 2 treatment sequences) and 12
      Japanese and 12 Chinese subjects in Part 2a and 2b, respectively.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female subjects between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator based on medical history, clinical
             laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), vital sign
             measurements, 12-lead ECG results, and physical examination findings. A subject with a
             clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the
             population being studied may be included only if the investigator feels and documents
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Additional inclusion criteria for Japanese subjects (Part 2a only): the subject was a
             non-naturalized Japanese citizen and held a Japanese passport, the subject had 2
             Japanese parents and 4 Japanese grandparents who were all non naturalized Japanese
