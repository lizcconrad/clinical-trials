  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether patients hospitalized with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) exacerbation may have fewer days with prednisolone and with the same treatment effect
      by controlling the treatment by daily measurements of eosinophils.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly used treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (AECOPD) is a 5-day treatment with corticosteroids in moderate-high dose. Some
      patients receive repeated treatments, although it has been shown that corticosteroids only
      have temporary beneficial effects and no effect in relation to serious incidents or
      mortality. It has been found that the higher accumulated prednisolone dose disables patients
      due to serious side effects, including pneumonia, dysregulated diabetes, bone fracture in the
      context of osteoporosis, mental disorder and adrenal insufficiency etc. However, the extent
      of the side effects is unknown. Recent research has shown that it is presumably only a small
      subset of COPD patients who benefit from corticosteroid therapy. This group can be identified
      by the biomarker &quot;blood-eosinophils&quot; as already measured on most AECOPD patients during
      hospitalization.

      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, non-Inferiority trial evaluating the effect
      of eosinophil guided corticosteroid therapy to patients with AECOPD. The aim of the study is
      to investigate whether the accumulated dose corticosteroid treatment during admissions for
      AECOPD can be reduced, including the presumed side effects, while (still) remaining the
      optimal treatment effect.
