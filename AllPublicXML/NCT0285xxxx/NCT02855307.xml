  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is associated with many health benefits for individuals with type 1
      diabetes including improved cardiovascular fitness and vascular health, decreased insulin
      requirements, improved body composition and quality of life. However, exercise-induced
      hypoglycemia is very frequent and thus is the main limiting factor for physical activity
      practice in this population.

      The artificial pancreas is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose
      levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the
      required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. The artificial pancreas has the
      potential to reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia but the importance of
      announcing exercise to the artificial pancreas is yet to be explored.

      The objective of this study is to investigate 1) if announcing postprandial exercise to the
      artificial pancreas is beneficial in reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and 2) if an insulin
      bolus reduction is necessary when announcing the exercise to the artificial pancreas.

    <description>Variable subcutaneous insulin infusion rates will be used to regulate glucose levels. Patient's usual fast acting insulin analog (Lispro, Aspart or Guilisine) will be infused using the patient's pump. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor (Dexcom G4 Platinum, Dexcom Inc.) will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The pump's infusion rate will then be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation infusion rates.</description>
