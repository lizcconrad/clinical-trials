      Background: To investigate the immediate effects of myofascial induction on perceived pain
      and anxiety, cervical/shoulder range of motion and mood state in breast cancer survivors
      suffering shoulder/arm morbidity.

      Methods: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Twenty-one enrolled
      participants who had a diagnosis of breast cancer stage I-IIIA and had completed adjuvant
      therapy except hormonal treatment. The study consisted of two intervention sessions of 30
      minutes separated by a wash-up period of 4 weeks. The interventions consisted of a Myofascial
      Induction (experimental group) or placebo pulsed shortwave therapy (control group). The main
      outcome measures were: Visual Analogue Scale for pain and anxiety, shoulder-cervical
      goniometry for range of motion, Profile of Mood States for psychological distress and
      Attitudes Toward Massage Scale.

    <time_frame>A wash-up period of 4 weeks between the 2 sessions was established</time_frame>
    <description>A numerical rating scale that contains scores in the range of 0 to 10 (0 = 'no pain/anxiety'; 10 = 'worst imaginable pain/anxiety level'). Participants must mark the level of pain that they feel at that moment in the cervical-arm area and use the scale to indicate their anxiety level.</description>
