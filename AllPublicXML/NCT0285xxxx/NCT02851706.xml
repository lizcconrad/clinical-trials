  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Brain and spinal cord tumors are uncommon. But they contribute substantially to cancer deaths
      in the U.S. in children and adults. Little progress has been made in treating brain tumors.
      Researchers want to learn more about these tumors by studying people who have them.

      Objectives:

      To understand brain and spinal cord tumors better and uncover areas for further research.
      Also, to connect people with these tumors to doctors who can help them manage their illness
      and give them new treatment options.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3 and older who have been diagnosed with a tumor of the brain or spinal cord.

      Design:

      Participants will have an initial (baseline) visit. They will have their medical history
      taken and undergo physical and neurological exams. They will have blood tests. They may have
      scans (imaging studies) of the nervous system.

      If participants have urine or cerebrospinal fluid collected during their regular care,
      researchers may save some.

      Brain tumor tissue from a prior surgery may be studied.

      Genomic DNA testing will be done on samples. Results will be linked to participants medical
      and/or family history.

      The number of study visits at NIH will depend on the wishes of participants and their local
      doctors.

      Participants will take a brain tumor survey on a computer. They can take it all at once or in
      6 separate sections.

      Participants will answer questions about their general well-being. They will answer questions
      to learn if they have symptoms of depression or anxiety.

      Physicians will discuss test results with participants. They will recommend management and
      treatment options.

      Background:

      This protocol is designed to meet an unmet need in neuro-oncology by evaluating patients with
      CNS tumors throughout their disease course. The protocol will evaluate patients with tumors
      of the central nervous system (CNS) who appear to be probable candidates for future protocol
      entry, have disease manifestations that are of unique scientific interest, importance, and/or
      educational value, or who have understudied tumors with unknown or unclear natural history.
      Patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing CNS cancers will also be
      evaluated.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) who are probable
           future candidates for NCI Phase I and II protocols

        -  To follow patients with tumors of the CNS that are representative of important
           scientific and/or clinical principles

        -  To follow patients with CNS tumors that are understudied or have indeterminate natural
           history

        -  To evaluate and follow patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing
           CNS cancers

      Eligibility:

        -  All patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with tumors of the CNS (or a
           history of tumors of the CNS) of interest to the NOB, who may be candidates for an NOB
           trial at some point in the future.

        -  Patients with tumors of the CNS that are of particular interest to members of the NOB
           because they pose important clinical and/or scientific questions and/or shed light on
           important aspects of the disease.

        -  Patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing CNS cancers are
           eligible.

        -  Patients with rare tumors of the CNS who offer an important educational benefit to
           neuro-oncology trainees and staff.

        -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the
           willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

      Design:

        -  All patients will undergo an initial evaluation at the Clinical Center by a member of
           the NOB where past medical and oncologic histories will be obtained as well as relevant
           data such as neuroimaging and pathology review. A total of 10,000 patients will be
           accrued to this study.

        -  Patients may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center at varying intervals depending on the
           clinical situation. Data related to the natural history of their disease course and
           outcome will be collected at least every visit at the NIH Clinical Center in which
           imaging is reviewed and at a minimum of every year.
