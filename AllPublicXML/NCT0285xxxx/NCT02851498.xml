  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This controlled weight loss trial in adults at cardiometabolic risk (elevated
      triglyceride/HDL ratio) followed a randomized, cross-over design and utilized novel,
      high-protein pasta and cereal to examine the physiological impact of stealth substitution of
      dietary carbohydrate with protein derived from soy concentrates, wheat protein isolates, and
      dried egg whites. Pasta dishes were prepared using high-protein orzo and fusilli pasta (Zone
      PastaRxTM) or conventional, gluten-free pasta, and high-protein flaked cereal (ZoneTM cereal)
      was matched with conventional flaked cereal. Participants were instructed to follow an energy
      restricted diet (-500 kcal/d) and incorporate a test food into each of three meals over a
      24-hour period. The diet-induced changes in body mass and lean body mass were tracked as well
      as changes in in insulin sensitivity and common blood biomarkers.

    <description>High-protein pasta (orzo and fusilli) enriched with gluten and egg white protein (%energy: 27/30/43 for protein/fat/carbohydrate) and high-protein flaked breakfast cereal enriched with gluten (%energy: 30/35/35 for protein/fat/carbohydrate) were manufactured by Zone Inc.(Boston, MA). The study foods provided an average of 945 kcal/day (one aliquot of cereal and two pasta dishes daily). Pasta meals were prepared in a metabolic kitchen and were identical in appearance and basic taste as control meals.</description>

The study foods provided an average of 945 kcal/day (one aliquot of cereal and two pasta dishes daily).
