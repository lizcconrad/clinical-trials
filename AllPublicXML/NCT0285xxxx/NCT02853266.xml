    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitic syndrome with coronary tropism. It has
      been reported worldwide, but it is ten times more common in Asian population. It is the
      second vasculitis of the child by its frequency after rheumatoid purpura. It occurs in 80% of
      cases between 1 and 5 years, with a maximal incidence around the age of 12 months.

      KD is not well understood and the cause is yet unknown. It may be an autoimmune disorder. The
      problem affects the mucous membranes, lymph nodes, walls of the blood vessels, and the
      heart.The clinical picture of KD associate a persistent fever and an antipyretics resistance
      with mucocutaneous signs and bulky cervical lymphadenopathy usually unilateral.

      There is currently no vaccine available against Kawasaki disease so it is extremely important
      to be able to recognize symptoms before they set in and become too severe.

      Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Acute CD occurs immediately
      after infection, may last up to a few weeks or months. Infection may be mild or asymptomatic.
      There may be fever or swelling around the site of inoculation, and acute infection may result
      in severe inflammation of the heart muscle. The notion that the pathology of CD has an
      autoimmune component was initially based on the finding of circulating antibodies binding
      heart tissue antigens in patients chronically infected with T. cruzi.

      A recent study reports a possible antigen (non-cruzi-related antibody NCRA) mimicry
      characterized by a serological reactivity to a well-defined T. cruzi antigen in blood samples
      from individuals not exposed to the parasite. The measured seroprevalence of such
      cross-reactivity is in favor of a highly prevalent immunogen acquired in childhood.

      There are similarities in mechanism of CD and KD: it could be interesting to explore the
      presence of NCRA in blood samples from adults with a history of KD.

      The objective of the study is the measurement of the biomarker NCRA in serum in adults with a
      history of KD compare to a control population. This measurement and the prevalence may permit
      to associate the NCRA to a possible pathogenic agent.
