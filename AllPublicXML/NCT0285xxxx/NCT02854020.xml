  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the number of air travelers, including the elderly and passengers with an underlying
      disease, is increasing every year, the number of inflight emergency patients is expected to
      increase as well. The investigators attempted to identify the incidence and types of inflight
      medical emergencies and analyze the first aid performed by cabin crew members or medical
      volunteers in flights by an Asian airline. The investigators also investigated the causes of
      inflight deaths and aircraft diversions.
