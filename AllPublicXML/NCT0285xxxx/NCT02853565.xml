    <textblock>
      To evaluate CAN008 safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAN008 when
      administered concurrent Plus Concomitant Temozolomide During and After Radiation Therapy in
      Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme.

    <textblock>
      CAN008 is a glycosylated fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD95
      (APO-1/Fas) and the Fc domain of human IgG1. CAN008 blocks the interaction between CD95 and
      its cognate ligand CD95L. The target of CAN008 is the inhibition of CD95L. CD95L is expressed
      in glioblastoma whose cells are resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis. CD95L was shown to be a
      crucial trigger in invasion and migration of tumor cells and neutralizing CD95L abolishes the
      invasive capacity of glioblastoma cells.

      The purpose of the study is:

        1. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

        2. To determine the duration of disease free survival and overall survival associated with
           this therapy.

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety assessment will include safety laboratory (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), physical exam, vital signs and 12-lead ECG (QT prolongation). An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not is considered to be related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions worsen during a study are also to be reported as AEs. Furthermore, any side effects potentially related to the CAN008 treatment will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The RP2D will be determined based on the assessment of the observed toxicities, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum administered dose (MAD), and the overall safety profile of CAN008.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preliminary efficacy (Progression Free Survival after 6 months [PFS6])</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the event, which is the first radiologically documented disease progression (per local investigator assessment according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria) or death due to any cause. For the primary analysis, progression-free survival after 6 months (PFS6) is defined as the crude rate of patients confirmed to be free of progression at 6 months after randomization with respect to the number of randomized and exposed patients in the respective treatment arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preliminary efficacy (Overall Survival [OS])</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the first dose of CAN008 to death.</description>
