  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is lower in patients with haemophilia than in their healthy peers.
      Nevertheless, exercize is recommended for those patients and supported by evidence. Until
      2013, scientific and medical evidence to encourage physical activity for patients with
      haemophilia were listed to increase their locomotor function, their metabolic status, their
      fitness level and their well-being. In 2013, an original publication by Groen et al.
      suggested that physical activity could also interact with the specific and biological
      disturbance of the disease.

      We propose to consider that regular endurance exercize prescription should be encouraged in
      patients with haemophilia not only for a healthier lifestyle but also because it could
      positively alter the specific biological blood disturbance seen in haemophilia. Nevertheless,
      before planning a well powered intervention trial we need to determine the acceptability of
      regular exercize and the expected value of factor Factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and von
      Willebrand propeptide after an endurance training program.

    <description>Exercise intensity will be fixed to the corresponding powers for ventilatory thresholds, if applicable for pain tolerance. The endurance interval training workout is known to induce metabolic and physiological adaptations. For intermittent workout training protocol, recovery periods at moderate intensity between periods at high intensity help to sustain repeated high intensity periods of exercise. If pain disturbs exercise tolerance, power will be lowered as necessary.
A set of 3 training sessions per week of 45 minutes each for 6 consecutive weeks will be proposed (one session every two days). This scheme is usually encouraged for patients suffering from chronic diseases.</description>
