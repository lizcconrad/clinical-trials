      The 105-15-201 study is designed to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of the
      combination of heat-activated target therapy (radiotherapy + hyperthermia +
      lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin) of loco-regional relapse in breast cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Locoregional recurrence of breast cancer (LRR) after mastectomy is a clinically challenging
      problem. Between 5% and 35% of women with operable breast cancer will experience an isolated
      LRR following their primary treatment, usually within 5 years of initial mastectomy. LRR or
      LR typically causes pain, lymphedema, and/or loss of freedom of movement. Therapeutic options
      usually involve resection, radiation or, at some specialized centers, combined radiation and
      hyperthermia. However, local control remains suboptimal in previously irradiated chest wall
      patients with the combination of radiation and hyperthermia providing local control rates of
      about 65%.

      Lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) is a temperature sensitive liposome which
      is systemically administered and is engineered to selectively release its doxorubicin
      contents when exposed to temperatures ≥ 39.5°C.

      Local mild hyperthermia (40 to 44°C) is cytotoxic and is known to have an immunomodulatory
      effect along with a radiation and chemosensitizing effect in the heated tissue. Furthermore,
      mild hyperthermia enhances leakiness of tumor tissue, increases local perfusion and
      upregulates transvascular transport of doxorubicin.

      Radiation therapy will be administered in this combination therapy.

      This study evaluates the application of a tri-modal approach with LTLD to improve outcome:
      radiation, hyperthermia, and targeted release of a novel formulation of doxorubicin.

    <description>Treatment will consist of up to six cycles of LTLD combined with hyperthermia every 21 days with the first day of each cycle being Day 1. ThermoDox will be administered at a dose of 40 mg/m2. Thermal dose is a one-hour treatment at a temperature between 40 and 43°C at the target site. At Cycle 1, radiotherapy will begin and will be combined with hyperthermia. A total of 40 Gy in 20 fractions of 2 Gy per fraction will be administered. Up to 66 Gy of radiation therapy can be administered however institutional guidelines should be followed.</description>
