  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 participants enrolled in the LEARN study (NCT02488720) will be enrolled in
      the LEARN-Tau study. The study designed to evaluate the imaging characteristics of
      18F-AV-1451 in participants enrolled in the LEARN study and to expand the safety database of
      18F-AV-1451.

      The study will run in parallel to the LEARN study. In this study, participants will undergo
      up three (3) 18F-AV-1451 PET scans over a 3 year period. Imaging visits will occur at the
      start, middle and end of the participant's participation in the LEARN study (corresponding to
      LEARN Visit 1, between Visit 4 and 6, and Visit 8).

      The LEARN-Tau study will (1) look at change in the amount of tau protein in the brain over
      time, measured by the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, (2) see if tau protein in the brain of older
      individuals is associated with memory problems and (3) evaluate the safety of 18F-AV-1451 and
      any side effects that might be associated with it.

      Site investigators, participants, and study partners will not be informed of the results of
      the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan results as they relate to the study; however, any findings that may
      be of potential medical concern will be provided for appropriate follow-up.

      <textblock>
        Participants should meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for the LEARN study, and in
        addition:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female that have consented and are currently enrolled in the LEARN protocol;

          -  Participants who sign an IRB approved informed consent form prior to any study
             procedure; and

          -  Participants who in the opinion of the investigator can tolerate the PET scan
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the
             participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures,
             or interfere with analysis of the data. (For example, participants with chronic back
             pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning procedures.);

          -  Has abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory screening tests that
             suggest the participant might have a condition that could, in the opinion of the
             investigator, affect his or her response to the radiopharmaceutical and related
             testing procedures;

          -  Is deemed likely to be unable to perform all of the imaging procedures for any reason;

          -  Has a history of risk factors for torsades de pointes, including clinically
             significant findings on ECG, or is taking medications known to prolong QT interval
             such as citalopram ≥ 40 mg/day, disopyramide, dofetilide, ibutilide, procainamide,
             quinidine, sotalol, or bepridil; A list of restricted medications will be provided.

          -  Are females of childbearing potential (extremely unlikely in the LEARN eligible
             population ages 65 to 85) who are not surgically sterile, not refraining from sexual
             activity or not using reliable methods of contraception. Females of childbearing
             potential must not be pregnant (negative serum or urine β-hCG at the time of screening
             and negative serum or urine β-hCG on imaging day) or breastfeeding at screening.
             Females must agree to avoid becoming pregnant, and both females and males must agree
             to refrain from sexual activity or to use reliable contraceptive methods for 24 hours
             following administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection; Males with female partners who are
             pregnant or of childbearing potential must agree to refrain from sexual activity for
             24 hours following administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. Additionally, males must
             agree not to donate sperm for 24 hours following administration of 18F-AV-1451
             Injection;

          -  Has hypersensitivity to 18F-AV-1451 or any of its excipients.
