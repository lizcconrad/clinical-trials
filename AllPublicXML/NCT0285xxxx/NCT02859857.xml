    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the safety profile and determine the maximum
      tolerate dose (MTD) of BXQ-350, when given as a single agent at escalating doses, according
      to the investigational product (IP) related dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Secondarily to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BXQ-350 in
      solid tumors and recurrent high grade gliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in man study of BXQ-350, a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent composed
      of two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the
      phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes.
      When both the components are assembled together forming stable SapC-DOPS nanovesicles
      (clinical formulation BXQ-350), the agent exhibits the propensity to enter the body and
      brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death.

      The study is divided into 2 parts:

        1. Dose Escalation Scheme Sequential cohorts of adult patients with advanced solid tumors
           and recurrent high-grade gliomas will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until
           the MTD is established, or in the absence of a MAD, the highest planned DL.

        2. During Part 2, patients with advanced solid tumors and recurrent high-grade gliomas will
           be enrolled and administered BXQ-350 at the MTD determined in Part 1 or at the highest
           planned DL, if the MAD is not reached.
