  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study evaluates psychological and physical health outcomes for active-duty
      service members following participation in an established surf therapy program. Participants
      complete assessments before and after the surf therapy program, as well as brief assessments
      before and after each surf therapy session.

      The proposed study would evaluate whether an existing surf therapy program that is part of
      the Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Wellness Program at Naval Medical Center San Diego
      (NMCSD), significantly reduces both psychological symptoms (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety,
      negative affect, lack of positive affect) and physical symptoms (e.g., pain, sleep) among
      active-duty service members. Psychological and physical symptoms will be assessed before
      beginning the surf program and at program completion. In addition, brief assessments of mood
      and symptoms will be completed before and after each individual surf therapy session.

    <description>The NMCSD surf therapy program is approximately 6 weeks in duration. Each surf therapy session lasts 2-3 hours and occurs in a group setting that can accommodate up to 20 service members per session. Each service member is paired with a surf instructor who works with him or her each week for the 6-week session. Goals are individually-tailored to the service member (based on participant's level of comfort in the water, experience with surfing, etc.) and can incorporate both physical and psychological objectives.</description>
