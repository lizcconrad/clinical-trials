      1. - INTRODUCTION

           Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent symptoms that causes more disability in patients
           with temporomandibular disorder (TMD).

           According to various studies, the incidence varies between 19-69%, with a 2:1 ratio
           between women and men, being higher in Western industrialized countries. Frequent
           conjunction between TMJ problems and tinnitus has led to propose the existence of a link
           between these two clinical entities. However, the mechanism linking TMD and this
           otologic symptom is unknown.

           The present study postulates an association based on the anatomical relationship between
           the TMJ and the inner ear. The ligaments of the inner ear bones are close to TMJ
           ligaments so the movements of the mandibular condyle may influence on them. The
           discomallear ligaments (DML) and the anterior mallear ligament (AML) can be considered
           as intrinsic ligaments of the TMJ.

           TMJ blood supply depends on the tympanic and auricular arteries, and in its innervations
           are involved nerve branches of the masseter, lateral and temporal/ internal pterygoid,
           key muscles for the condylar movements (open and close the mouth and lateral movements).

           The hypothesis supporting the link between the TMJ and the tinnitus is that the forced
           movements of the mandibular condyle produce a ligaments stretching and muscles tension,
           being the cause of otologic problems such as tinnitus.

           Tinnitus is defined as the perception of a sound that does not exist in the environment.
           It is often described as &quot;a buzz, a beep, a noise&quot;. Most conservative treatments for
           tinnitus have focused on pharmacological treatments (particularly antidepressants),
           cognitive-behavioral treatments, medical low strength laser therapies, acupuncture,
           cranial magnetic stimulation, music therapy and environmental sounds reduction
           technologies. However, there is controversial evidence on the effectiveness of these
           techniques given the heterogeneity of protocols and of the response variables.

           Is understood as TMJ pathology, those organic or functional nosological entities
           affecting the craneomandibular system relationship. They encompass a large number of
           disorders, not only traumatic, neoplastic, autoimmune or infectious, but also those
           deriving from dysfunctional alteration of its internal structure, both muscle and
           joints.

           TMJ disorders with a myofascial or joint dysfunction origin are those whose origin is in
           myofascial muscle disorders or in joint by mechanical causes. Myofascial trigger points
           pain, described by Travell and Simons, corresponds to a noninflammatory regional muscle
           pathology that can occur in any striated muscle of the body. Its main feature is the
           presence of a hypersensitive area called trigger point, which is present in a palpable
           taut band of muscle tissue and has the ability to refer pain to distant areas. Joint
           dysfunction is defined as one in which occurs an abnormal relationship between the joint
           disk and the condyle, the fossa and the TMJ eminence.

           Many treatments have been applied to the TMJ with varying degrees of evidence: the
           prevention of bad habits and parafunctions; contract/relax muscles and mental exercises;
           heat / cold in pain or contracture areas; physiotherapy; psychotherapy; biofeedback
           techniques with self-relaxation procedures; resting splints, muscle discharge or
           recapture; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasound and drug
           treatment: NSAIDs, analgesics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, muscle relaxants and
           antidepressants.

           In most cases, the physiotherapy in patients with TMD is focused on myofascial treatment
           and massage and, at present, in manual therapy (for pain control and improving joint
           movement). All of this, usually combined with splints or bite plates (for pain control,
           bruxism and improving occlusion), although there is little evidence supporting their
           use.

           In relation to myofascial therapy, massage applied on the masticatory muscles, protocols
           of manual therapy on TMJ, as well as mobilization and manipulation techniques of the
           upper cervical spine, there is a wide and proven evidence of the improvement occurring
           in pain, mouth maximum mouth opening and in pressure pain threshold in patients with
           TMD; although systematic reviews on all manual therapy techniques present a
           controversial evidence, given the heterogeneity of the studies.

           In the literature review made, it has not been found any paper issuing a proposal or
           treatment protocol of the TMJ presenting among its main objectives the control of the
           intensity of TMJ pain and the decrease of disability that tinnitus produces.

           Only one found study proposes a treatment to reduce the intensity of TMJ pain and to
           improve the disability that tinnitus produces by using a bite splint, without performing
           a manual intervention therapy and exercises.

           The purpose of the present study is to raise a proposal of treatment with manual therapy
           and exercise aiming to reduce the disability caused by tinnitus and the intensity of
           pain and disability caused by the TMD.

        2. - JUSTIFICATION

           Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent symptoms that causes more disability in patients
           with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD).

           The frequency with which concur the problems of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and
           tinnitus, has led to propose the existence of an association between these two clinical
           entities.

           The present study postulates the possible link developing an
           anatomical-pathophysiological hypothesis based on the relationship between TMJ and inner
           ear, proposing a treatment applied to temporomandibular joint for improving TMJ pain and
           tinnitus.

        3. - HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of specific manual therapy techniques (TM) within a multimodal physiotherapy
      treatment is more effective in improving TMJ pain and disability that causes tinnitus that
      the isolated application of multimodal treatment.

      Objectives:

      General:

      Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical therapy
      in patients with tinnitus and TMD with a myofascial origin or joint dysfunction.

      Specific:

        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in reducing pain intensity and disability
           caused by TMD.

        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in reducing the intensity of tinnitus and
           disability caused by tinnitus.

        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in increasing the range of motion of the TMJ.

        4. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in the painful rise by pressuring the
           masseter, temporal and lateral pterygoid muscles.

        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in the quality of life, level of anxiety /
           depression and health.

      4. METHODOLOGY

      Type of study: randomized and controlled pilot study, multicenter, blinded randomization,
      patient assessment and data analysis. Treatment characteristics themselves prevent their
      blinded application.

      Location: 3 private consultation rooms of specialized physiotherapy in TMD. Study subjects:
      56 patients with temporomandibular dysfunction and tinnitus.

      Sample size:

      Due to the absence of findings in the literature about one of the variables of primary
      response ((pain and tinnitus intensity caused by TMD measured at the visual analog scale
      (VAS)), a pilot study has been made prior to the estimation of the final sample size from
      January to July 2016. This pilot study was performed in order to determine the standard
      deviation for this study. The standard deviation was 2.77.

      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, 56 subjects (28
      in the control group and 28 in the experimental group) are necessary to recognize as
      statistically significant a difference greater than or equal to 0.05 units. The standard
      deviation is assumed to be 2.77. It has been anticipated a drop-out rate of 10%.

      Data collection and analysis The patient will receive six treatment sessions, two sessions in
      the first week and a weekly session to complete the intervention. The total duration of the
      intervention shall be one month. Before starting the study, all patients will be asked to
      sign an informed consent.

        1. At first session will take place the initial assessment, including the collection of
           patient data records and the booklet of questionnaires and clinical measurements.

           The patient will receive anatomical notions of the temporomandibular joint and its
           relationship to the ear by means of bodily self-consciousness (jaw, muscles palpation
           ...) and will be given a booklet of health care and healthy habits of TMJ.

        2. At second session, before and after treatment clinical variables will be measured (ROM
           and algometry),visual analog scale (VAS) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory Questionnaire
           (THI) and treatment will be applied to each patient according to his assigned
           intervention group.

        3. At third, fourth and fifth session the before and after treatment clinical variables
           (ROM and algometry), VAS scale and THI will be measured, the treatment will be applied
           and home self-care exercises will be handed.

        4. During the sixth session the before treatment clinical variables will be measured (ROM
           and algometry), VAS scale and THI, and will be applied the treatment corresponding to
           the patient's group.

      The following week to the end of treatment, the patient will be re-evaluated. The statistical
      analysis will be performed using SPSS 22.0 program (IBM statistical software).

      The average and the standard deviation of quantitative variables will be calculated for the
      descriptive analysis of the sample. In non-normal distributions the nonparametric sum of the
      ranges of Wilcoxon and Chi Square test will be performed, as well as the homogeneity in
      baseline will be displayed by overlapping confidence intervals.

      For the comparative analysis, developed according to the intention to treat:

        1. A MANOVA (ANOVA for repeated measures) test should be carry out to evaluate the
           interaction between levels of inter - subject factor (treatment) and the intra- subject
           (main variables response in time) to be interpreted in case it is significant.

        2. To confirm whether this interaction effect is significant, pairwise comparisons will be
           made of the inter-subjects factor levels (treatment) for each level of main response
           variables over time using the Bonferroni method.

      Limitations of the study and measures taken to reduce them.

      Masking: The nature of the applied treatments prevents masking therapists and patients. This
      limitation is inherent to the type of treatment evaluated and common with other forms of
      treatment with similar characteristics, in which therapist should inevitably know the type of
      treatment that is applied.

      However, this limitation does not prevent the controlled clinical trials carried out on these
      technologies from being of higher methodological quality. Thus, in this study, randomization
      of patients will be blind, allocation of the random sequence, the assessment of patient
      evolution and analysis of results.
