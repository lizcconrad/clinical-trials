  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate participant reported quality of life, safety, and overall
      performance with ACTICOAT in a clinical setting.

      ACTICOAT is a silver coated antimicrobial barrier wound dressing for the treatment of a
      variety of wound types. It is widely used in routine clinical practice within the UK.
      ACTICOAT is CE marked and will be used within the intended indications for use. The proposed
      study is required for regulatory purposes.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate change in health related quality of life, associated with
      treatment. The primary outcome measure / endpoint will be change in EQ-5D 5L mean single
      index utility scores from baseline to 3 weeks.

      The study will also seek to gather and report relevant safety and performance data and
      evaluate change, where applicable, for outcomes including: clinical signs and symptoms of
      infection; wound length / width / depth; wound healing measures; tissue staining; pain,
      adherence, and pain on application / removal; wear time; adverse events and device
      deficiencies.

      In total 25 participants will be recruited into the trial, comprising a minimum of 8
      participants with a full or partial thickness burn and a minimum of 8 participants with a
      full or partial thickness chronic wound. All participants will have their wound dressed using
      ACTICOAT, and will be followed-up for 3 weeks.

             with ACTICOAT and meets either of the following requirements:

               1. A full or partial thickness chronic (≥ 4 weeks duration) wound, consisting of a
                  Venous Leg Ulcer, Pressure Ulcer or Diabetic Foot Ulcer, which in the opinion of
                  the Investigator, or delegated Sub-Investigator, appears to be infected based on
                  documented clinical signs and symptoms of infection.

               2. A recently acquired (≤ 7 days) non-infected burn, comprising a full or partial
                  thickness wound, covering a minimum 0.5% TBSA. The maximum must be less than 10%
                  TBSA. Absence of infection will be determined by the Investigator /

             days of Visit 1.

          3. Treatment with any other silver dressing (i.e. non ACTICOAT dressing) within seven (7)
             days of Visit 1.

          4. Patients with skin features which in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere
             with the study assessments.

          5. Patients requiring concomitant use of NPWT on the reference wound.

          6. Patients who have participated previously in this clinical trial and who have healed
             or been withdrawn.

          7. Patients with a history of poor compliance with medical treatment.

          8. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are experiencing burn shock.

          9. Patients with any other medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the study.
