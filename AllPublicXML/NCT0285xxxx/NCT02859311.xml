  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One third of patients diagnosed with heart failure demonstrate left ventricular reverse
      remodelling and recovery of cardiac function following a period of medical therapy. These
      patients have an excellent long-term prognosis. Whether they need to remain on long-term
      medical therapy is not clear. The investigators will investigate the safety of therapy
      withdrawal in patients with a previous diagnosis of heart failure and recovered cardiac
      function, in a randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a previous diagnosis of heart failure, who have recovered cardiac function,
      without symptoms, normal serum biomarker concentrations and who are currently still taking
      heart failure medications, will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to withdrawal
      of therapy and control arms and will undergo imaging investigations and cardiopulmonary
      exercise tests at baseline along with serum biomarker tests. Those participants randomised to
      withdrawal of therapy will have a gradual, supervised reduction of medications. If, at
      anytime, there are signs of recurring heart failure, medications will be restarted.
      Participants in the control arm will continue their medical therapy as usual.

      Participants will be followed up with further biomarker testing, cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing and imaging investigations at 6 months.

      The primary end-point will be a relapse in heart failure, defined by adverse remodelling,
      increase in left ventricular size, rise in serum biomarkers or clinical evidence of heart
      failure as judged by the clinical team.
