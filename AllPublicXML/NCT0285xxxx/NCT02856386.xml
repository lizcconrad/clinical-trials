      Micronutrients missing in the diet may assist in supporting digestive health in children with
      chronic GI issues. This study will monitor changes in symptoms associated with digestive
      problems in children provided with a dietary supplement that will be taken in conjunction
      with the standard of care.

      Children with GI symptoms have varying response to the standard of care treatments. A dietary
      supplement of polyphenols from green tea and pomegranate extracts provides micronutrients
      often missing from conventional American diets. The objective of this study is to monitor
      changes in GI symptoms when the supplement is provided alongside the standard of care for
      children with symptoms that have been present for more than two weeks.
