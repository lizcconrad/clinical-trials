  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the combined therapy
      lumacaftor-ivacaftor affects glycemia in patient with cystic fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label study. Patients will have 1 visits at the Diabetes
      Research Center (DRC), or Clinical Research Center (CRC).

      The participants will have been previously screened to make sure they are candidates for the
      study. These patients will be contacted prior to their first visit to discuss enrollment in
      the study.

      At the study visit the participant will come to the CRC or DRC for a research visit. The
      following will occur at this study visit: informed consent; brief medical history; weight and
      height; vital signs and blood pressure; blood draw for DNA extraction, A1c and an extra
      research tube for storage. This will be scheduled at a time that is convenient to the
      patient.
