    <textblock>
      The experimental strategy is to develop a specific device about the anesthetic and surgical
      acts for a subject with a documented psychiatric condition and to benefit from surgery. This
      device is based on 3 stages: pre-operative phase, Phase perioperative and postoperative
      phase. A nurse anesthetist will come into contact with the subject the day before surgery.
      This contact will be concomitant with the pre-anesthesia visit. She explained about the
      general organization of the arrival in the operating room. The interview will be a minimum of
      15 minutes and beyond if necessary. This will be accompanying this the next day in the
      operating room in order to optimize its hospitality and installing the block, guide the
      subject through all the steps before falling asleep. Finally, even accompanying will be
      present upon awakening the subject in the recovery room.
