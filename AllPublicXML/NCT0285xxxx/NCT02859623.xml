  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare disease characterized by an
      aggressive clinical behavior and a poor prognosis. It predominantly affects elderly males
      with an average age of 67 years at diagnosis and the affected organs are usually the skin,
      bone marrow, lymph nodes and the central nervous system. Patients with BPDCN have poor
      outcomes with median overall survival (OS) ranging in the largest series of patients from 8
      to 12 months.

      Patient care must be defined in this pathology. Despite 40%-90% complete remission (CR) rates
      after initial chemotherapy, relapses are almost inevitable.

      The investigators have developed a national network to collect clinical and biological data
      of French patients diagnosed with BPDCN.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) from
             January 2000 to June 2013 in France.

          -  Diagnosis should be established by hematology laboratory of French blood Agency of
             Bourgogne Franche-Comt√© and/or by anatomopathological analysis (realized in local
             centres or by Tony Petrella at Dijon University Hospital) according to phenotypic and
             anatomopathological criteria published in the literature.
