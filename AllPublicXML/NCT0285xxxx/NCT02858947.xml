  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of direct resin composite
      restorations placed with different placement techniques (incremental or bulk) and with
      different flowable linings (conventional or bulk-fill flowable) used in open-sandwich
      technique, in endodontically treated Class II cavities (mesio-occlusal or disto-occlusal), in
      a randomized controlled comparison.

      Forty-seven pairs Class II (mesio-occlusal or disto-occlusal) composite restorations were
      placed in 37 patients. In all cavities, Adper Single Bond 2 was used. In one of the cavities
      of each pair, a conventional flowable composite, Aelite Flo, was applied in approximately 2mm
      thick, and the remaining cavity was restored incrementally with GrandioSO. In the second
      cavity, a bulk-fill flowable composite, x-tra base, was applied in approximately 4 mm thick
      in bulk increments and the remaining 2mm occlusal part of the cavity was restored with
      GrandioSO. All cavities were restored with open-sandwich technique by the same operator. At
      baseline and after 6-month, 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-up visits, restorations were evaluated
      by Modified USPHS criteria.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Permanent premolars and molars without any restorations were included in the study.
             Every tooth included in the study had neighboring teeth and were in occlusion to
             antagonistic teeth.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded who needed indirect restorations due to significant loss of
             tooth structure, known allergies to product ingredients, had poor oral hygiene and a
             history of bruxism.
