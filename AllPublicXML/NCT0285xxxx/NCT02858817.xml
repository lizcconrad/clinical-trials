  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial using PfSPZ Challenge
      (NF54) under A/P chemoprophylaxis for immunization and PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) for repeat
      CHMI.

      A total of 30 adult, healthy, malaria naïve volunteers will receive three injections by
      Direct Venous Inoculation (DVI) of either placebo (n = 10), 51,200 PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) (n
      = 10), or 150,000 PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) (n = 10) under chemoprophylaxis with A/P at 4 week
      intervals. The placebo will be NaCl 0.9%.

      Ten weeks after the last dose of PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) for immunization, volunteers will
      undergo first CHMI and followed until asexual blood stage parasitemia, detected by
      quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) or thick blood smear microscopy. If parasitemic, they will
      be treated with A/P (used in this case as a standard treatment regimen). In the event of no
      parasitemia, volunteers will be followed until Day 28 post-CHMI and will not receive A/P.

      Forty-four weeks after the last immunization, a second CHMI will be administered to assess
      longevity of protection. All volunteers will be followed up to 28 days post-inoculation.
      Those developing parasitemia will be treated with A/P.
