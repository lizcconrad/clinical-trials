    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder. Epidemiological studies have
      documented its high prevalence and high socio-economic and personal impacts. Migraine affects
      more than 20% of the French population. However, the physiopathology of migraine is always
      partially known. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the widely accepted as the
      electrophysiologic substrate of migraine aura. CSD is a slowly propagating wave of transient
      neuronal and glial depolarization. The near death experience (NDE) is a rare, but well known
      phenomenon. NDE are profound psychic experiences commonly occuring in life-threatening
      conditions. Among the neurological hypotheses, epilepsy, temporal lobe disorders , REM-sleep
      intrusion have been discussed. However, the role of DCE has never been discussed. The goals
      of this study are : to see if there is an epidemiological link between NDE and migraine/ to
      specify if NDE was followed by a migrainous headache.
