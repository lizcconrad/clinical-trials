      To determine whether implementation of Rehab MATRIX will improve patient safety, patient
      satisfaction and nursing indices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The provision of efficient and conscientious nursing care is at the forefront of health care
      quality. Unfortunately, a lack of objectivity in the assignment of patients to nurses can
      lead to inequalities of care. Such inequalities translate to poor patient outcomes and
      diminished patient satisfaction. Furthermore, staff attrition related to nursing fatigue
      increases the cost of care due to a reliance on supplemental nurses. Rehab MATRIX is a
      patient assignment tool that objectively categorizes patients undergoing inpatient
      rehabilitation based on nurse identified acuity variables.

    <description>Two weeks prior to Rehab MATRIX initiation, a six question pre-implementation survey will be distributed via Survey Monkey to the nursing staff, evaluating nurse perceptions of the traditional nursing assignment. Questions 1 to 4 will be measured on a Likert Scale of 1 to 5; 1 - strongly disagree, 2 - disagree, 3 - neutral, 4 - agree, 5 - strongly agree.
At the end of the six month study period, a post-implementation Rehab MATRIX survey will be distributed at each center via Survey Monkey, examining the impact of Rehab MATRIX on workload equity, fairness, the role of seniority and overall satisfaction with the nurse assignment process.</description>
