      The phase II APPLE trial gives the opportunity to prospectively validate liquid biopsies as a
      new standard for testing tumor progression compared with conventional radiological procedure
      in EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC patients. Moreover based on the sequential T790M test during
      treatment the investigators will assess the predictive value of liquid biopsies. APPLE trial
      will examine the best strategy for delivering osimertinib (upfront versus sequential
      treatment after 1st generation EGFR TKI) in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. Finally, the trial
      will also explore the mechanisms of acquired resistance to Osimertinib based on the results
      of an optional biopsy upon progression.

      Primary objective To evaluate the best strategy for delivering Osimertinib (AZD9291) in NSCLC
      patients with EGFR mutation. The objective is assessed by Progression Free Survival rate at
      18 months (PFS-18).

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate PFS on Osimertinib measured from randomization by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref
           33].

        -  To evaluate PFS measured from switching to Osimertinib by RECIST criteria 1.1 [Ref 33].

        -  To determine the proportion of patients receiving Osimertinib based on the determination
           of cfDNA T790M mutation positive.

        -  To evaluate time to symptomatic brain metastases in patients with presence of brain
           metastases at study entry.

        -  To evaluate PFS-2 (defined as the sum of the PFS to Gefitinib and the PFS to Osimertinib
           treatment).

        -  To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Osimertinib.

        -  To evaluate the Treatment duration.

        -  To evaluate Time to progression (TTP) on Osimertinib (measured from switching to
           osimertinib).

        -  To evaluate Overall Survival (OS).

        -  To evaluate time to brain progression (TTBP).

        -  Safety.

             such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome family history of
             long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in first-degree
