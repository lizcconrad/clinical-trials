      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether perforating fat injections to the
      plantar fascia is a safe method to improve pain, quality of life, and reduce plantar fascia
      thickness for patients with chronic plantar fasciitis. We will also correlate the intrinsic
      fat properties of adipose stem cells (ie. growth factors) to the improvement in pain, quality
      of life, and plantar fascia thickness over time.

      Aim 1: Evaluate the safety of perforating fat injection into the plantar fascia in patients
      with chronic plantar fasciitis to improve pain, quality of life, and thickness of the fascia.

      Rationale: Perforating fat injections have been shown to improve multiple scar and fibrotic
      conditions such as burn scar contracture, breast radiation injury, and Dupuytren's
      contracture of the hand. (5-7) It is thought that the perforations allow expansion of the
      tissues, and filling them with fat allows for a regenerative healing process, rather than an
      inflammatory scar healing process.

      Hypothesis: Perforating fat injections into the chronically thickened plantar fascia is a
      safe method to improve pain, quality of life, and reduce tissue thickness.

      Aim 2: Correlate intrinsic fat properties of lipoaspirate to improvement in function and
      plantar fascia thickness.

      Rationale: Adipose tissue contains adipose derived stem cells. Various growth factors
      released from the stem cells may have a local effect on soft tissues (ie. VEGF). (8) These
      stem cells are thought to promote regenerative healing, rather than scar formation and may
      ultimately improve the thickness of the plantar fascia. (9-12) Hypothesis: Intrinsic fat
      properties of lipoaspirate (adipose stem cell characteristics) are closely correlated to the
      improvements in quality of life and thickness of the plantar fascia.

Observation visit will occur first, next the subject will have two Observation visits V1 (Month 2) and V2 (Month 6). The subject will then crossover to Pathway A. The subject will be assessed by the PI his/her for continued study eligibility. Once the continued eligibility has been determined, the subject will have the interventional fat graft procedure and subsequent post-operative follow up visits (V1-V4). After completion of Post-op V4 (Month 6), the subject will have completed study participation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fat Grafting</intervention_name>
    <description>Grafting of autologous fat tissue is a minimally invasive surgical technique that starts with the harvest of fat tissue from the abdomen or thighs using liposuction through incisions less than 2mm in length. The lipoaspirate is then processed to concentrate the adipose fraction and reinjected into the graft site. This surgical procedure involves the immediate transplantation of a patient's own tissue in a single operative procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:

          1. Aged 18 years or older and able to provide informed consent

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of Plantar Fasciitis having heel pain that has not improved
             with splints, exercises or rountine standard of care treatment

          3. Subjects must have a current relationship with their foot specialist managing the
             Plantar Fasciitis diagnosis.

          4. Subjects must be 6 months post any surgical intervention to the affected foot

          5. Subjects with a history of foot ulcer(s), the ulcer(s) must be healed with no
