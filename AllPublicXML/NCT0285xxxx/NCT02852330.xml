      Collection of normative voltage tomography data during and/or immediately after electrode
      insertion into the cochlea using Surgical Assistant (SA16) research software and
      postoperatively at activation, three and twelve months post-activation with CS19 research
      software in adults who are receiving a Cochlear Nucleus CI512, CI422, CI522 or CI532 cochlear
      implant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation will gather impedance and transimpedance (voltage tomography) data
      intraoperatively and post-operatively which can be used to characterize the electrical
      properties of the living cochlea.

      The Surgical Assistant Research Tool (SA16) research software is a software tool developed by
      Cochlear Limited. The use of the SA16 research software in the current clinical investigation
      is intended to support Cochlear's research into the development of implant telemetry based
      surgical tools.

      The SA16 research software is designed to perform a series of predefined measurements with
      minimal intervention both during and immediately following electrode insertion using
      telemetry from the implant via the Sound Processor to the computer. These measurements
      include real time continuous measurements, intended for use during the electrode insertion
      portion of the surgical procedure, and baseline measurements following the completion of
      electrode insertion.

      The SA16 research software will be used in the current clinical investigation in adults who
      meet current indications for cochlear implantation in Australia. The SA16 research software
      is not for use with patients who are receiving an implant that directly contacts neural
      tissue, such as auditory brainstem implants (ABI).

      CS19 (1.6.2) software will be used to collect voltage tomography measurements
      post-implantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet current cochlear implant indications at the implanting centre for a Cochlear
             Nucleus CI512, CI422, CI522 or CI532 cochlear implant

          2. Aged 18 years and older at the time of implantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recipient of a Nucleus 24 ABI device

          2. Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate undergoing general anaesthesia
             or surgery.

          3. Ossification, malformation or any other cochlear anomaly, such as common cavity, that
             might prevent complete insertion of the electrode array, as confirmed by medical
             examination.

          4. Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements.
