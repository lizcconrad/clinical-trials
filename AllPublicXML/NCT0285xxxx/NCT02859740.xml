      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the validity, the reproducibility and the
      coherence of the French version of the Special Interest Group in Amputee medicine (SIGAM)
      mobility scale questionnaire in adults with lower-limb amputations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 to 80 years

          -  Patients who have been informed about the research

          -  Patients with national health insurance cover

          -  Patients who accepted to take part in the study

          -  Able to understand simple instructions

          -  With transtibial, femoral, or bilateral amputation of the lower limb

          -  Whatever the etiology

          -  Patients able to do the 2-minute walk test

          -  Group 1:

               -  Patients in the stabilized phase of the definitive prosthesis, with no
                  modification of the prosthesis in the previous 3 months and at more than 6 months
                  after the amputation.

          -  Group 2:

               -  Patients in the initial phase of management (temporary prosthesis,
                  rehabilitation) post trans-tibial unilateral amputation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient without national health insurance cover.

          -  Patients under guardianship.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.

          -  Alteration of executive functions making understanding of and compliance with the
             research protocol impossible (Mini Mental State Examination&lt;20)

          -  Associated chronic motor deficiency, of neurological origin (examples: sequelae of
             stroke, balance and coordination disorders), or of osteo-articular origin (examples:
             knee or hip osteoarthritis), or due to secondary functional repercussions making it
             impossible to walk with a prosthesis.

          -  Severe medical disorder that significantly impairs functional capacities (severe heart
             failure, respiratory failure, non-stabilized metabolic disorders such as progressive
             kidney failure) that is life-threatening in the short or medium term (Progressive
             neoplastic disease, non-stabilized systemic disease).

          -  Complications at the stump other than microcirculation that could affect the
             application of a contact socket/sleeve: haematoma, Cysts, effusion, calcifications of
             soft tissues, bone spurs, infection (skin, abscess), neuroma, deterioration of the
             knee of the amputated limb, specifically painful Farabeuf angle (compression between
             bone and skin), venous thrombosis, abnormal stump shape making it impossible to use a
             socket (flexion of the knee, &quot;pear-shaped&quot;, &quot;deep-scar&quot; stumpâ€¦)
