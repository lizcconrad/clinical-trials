  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety Disorders (AD) are a serious mental health concern, affecting up to 15% of perinatal
      women. AD often coexists with depression and result in high distress and an impaired ability
      for new mothers to take care of themselves and their babies. In spite of the high prevalence
      of AD during pregnancy and postpartum, research and clinical attention in this area is
      lacking and no know empirically supported psychological treatments exist. Further, since many
      perinatal women are unable to choose not to take medication for their mental health symptoms,
      establishing an effective non-pharmacological alternative is imperative.
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a well-established psychological treatment for mental
      health disorders, with noted moderate to large effect sized (.5-1.3). The investigators have
      recently developed a novel CBT treatment program for perinatal women with AD and ran an
      initial pilot study thereafter. A significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression
      was found, along with reported high levels of treatment satisfaction. The purpose of the
      current study is to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment using a larger sample in the
      form of a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT).
