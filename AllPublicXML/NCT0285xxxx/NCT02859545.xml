  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and costly health care problem. Yet, little is known about
      the optimal ways for health care providers and family members to respond to the distress
      expressed by people with chronic pain. The aim of the current study is to compare two models
      of responsiveness to identify responses that result in better functioning and adjustment. An
      experimental design will be used to test the extent to which emotional validation (e.g., an
      empathic response to distress) increases or decreases pain behaviors during physical
      activity. Romantic partners of individuals with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to
      receive validation or control training. Following training, people with chronic pain and
      their partners will engage in a discussion about pain and complete household tasks to examine
      the effects of partner training on communication, pain intensity, and pain behavior.
      Additionally, each individual in the couple will complete self-report measures after the
      discussion, after the household tasks, and one-month following the laboratory visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Romantic couples who are married or living with each other for 6 months or longer or
             have been in a romantic relationship 2+ years.

          -  One individual in the couple must have chronic muscoskeletal pain, lasting 3 months or
             longer. Participants may have multiple pain sites.

          -  The individual with chronic pain must report that their pain occurs nearly daily.

          -  The individual with chronic pain must have an average pain intensity of 3 or greater
             on an 11-point scale (from 0: no pain to 10: worst pain imaginable)

          -  The individual with chronic pain must have an average pain interference of 3 or
             greater on an 11-point scale (from 0: does not interfere to 10: completely interferes)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  One or both individuals in the couple are unable to speak, read, or write in English.

          -  Both individuals in the couple have chronic pain. Couples may consist of one
             individual with chronic pain and one individual with &quot;minimal pain&quot;, which we define
             as having some aspects of chronic pain but not all (e.g., has had nearly daily pain
             for 4 months but rates their pain below 3 in regards to interference and intensity)

          -  One or both individuals in the couple have widespread pain (e.g., fibromyalgia)
