      The Phase 1 part of this study is designed to identify the MTD and RP2D, and to characterize
      the safety, tolerability, and PK. The Phase 1 part of the study will include 2 parts: dose
      escalation and dose expansion.

      After confirmation of the RP2D in the expansion part of Phase 1, enrolment into the Phase 2
      part of the study will begin. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug when administered to patients with relapsed
      or refractory NHL.
