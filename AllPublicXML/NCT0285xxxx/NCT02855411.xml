    <measure>Change From Baseline in the MCCB (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery) Working Memory Domain to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MCCB is a cognitive battery to assess 7 domains recommended by the MATRICS initiative (ie, working memory, verbal learning, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, visual learning, social cognition, reasoning and problem solving). The MCCB yields scores for individual tests that assess specific cognitive domains as well as a composite score. Scores for the individual tests and the overall composite score for all tests are calculated according to the developers' recommended scoring algorithms.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I consists of a single 7 point rating score total improvement, regardless of whether or not the change is due entirely to drug treatment. Raters select 1 response based on the following question, &quot;Compared to your patient's condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your patient changed?&quot; Scores are: 1=Very much improved; 2=Much improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=No change; 5=Minimally worse; 6=Much worse; or 7=Very much worse.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. All AEs (serious and non-serious) occurring following start of treatment or increasing in severity in any period were to be considered as a treatment emergent AE.</description>

          <description>The MCCB is a cognitive battery to assess 7 domains recommended by the MATRICS initiative (ie, working memory, verbal learning, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, visual learning, social cognition, reasoning and problem solving). The MCCB yields scores for individual tests that assess specific cognitive domains as well as a composite score. Scores for the individual tests and the overall composite score for all tests are calculated according to the developers’ recommended scoring algorithms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Neurological Examination</title>
        <description>The extended neurological examination includes observation for cerebellar (intention) tremor and for non-cerebellar tremors (eg, resting or positional), finger nose, heel shin, Romberg, tandem walking, positional and gaze-evoked nystagmus, reflexes, muscle strength, cranial nerves, sensory function of upper and lower extremities. The brief neurological examination includes an assessment of motor and sensory function, cranial nerves, reflexes, non-cerebellar tremor (eg, resting or positional) and cerebellar function. The assessment of cerebellar function is complemented by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), a clinical scale based on a semi-quantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level.</description>
