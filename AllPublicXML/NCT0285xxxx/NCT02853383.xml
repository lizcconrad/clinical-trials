      The purpose of this study is to determine COPD prevalence among patients registered in the
      healthcare system of Moscow (under outpatient surveillance at polyclinic institutions of
      Moscow).

      To describe the clinical profile of COPD patient who is under outpatient surveillance at
      polyclinic institutions of Moscow (including demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity,
      occupation), smoking status, disease duration, disease severity grade, distribution by
      disease phenotype, disease exacerbation rate in the setting of real-life clinical practice).

      The registry of COPD patients in fact represents two parts of a non-interventional
      multicenter descriptive study: one of these parts is a retrospective study including all COPD
      patients, and the other part is an observational prospective cohort study of COPD patients
      included into the registry and newly diagnosed under outpatient surveillance at the selected
      polyclinic institutions of Moscow with annual retrospective entry of data.

      Monitoring will be performed for 3 years with regular (yearly) entry of data concerning
      patients with diagnosed COPD; it will include all patients with registered diagnoses J40 -
      J44 according to ICD-10 with spirometry results confirming COPD diagnosis, who are at the
      study start under outpatient surveillance, and also newly registered patients diagnosed with
      COPD (ICD-10 J40 - J44, as confirmed by spirometry results) during the conduction of the
      registry program at the selected polyclinic institutions of Moscow (according to ICD: J40 -
      Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic, J41 - Simple and mucopurulent chronic
      bronchitis, J41.0 - Simple chronic bronchitis, J41.8 - Mixed simple and mucopurulent chronic
      bronchitis, J 42 - Unspecified chronic bronchitis, J 43 - Emphysema, J 44 - Other chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease) based on regular (yearly) retrospective analysis of patient
      records with data entry into a consolidated database.

      The present observational multicenter descriptive study will be conducted in the setting of
      routine clinical practice of outpatient polyclinic institutions. There is no hypothesis to be
      tested in this study.

      The study will be conducted in outpatient polyclinic institutions of the primary medical care
      system of Moscow. Pulmonologists of the primary medical care system will be engaged as
      investigators. These are the physicians, whom the patients with tentative COPD diagnosis are
      referred to in the Russian Federation and who within the scope of their responsibilities have
      access to source medical records and who evaluate the quality of diagnosis and extent of
      treatment prescribed to COPD patients.

      The present study is observational therefore it does not require a treatment regimen or
      directions for patient management. The patients receive medical care in line with routine
      practice for treatment of this disease in the Russian Federation. Patient participation in
      the study should not in any way affect the principles and extent of treatment received by the
      patient according to routine clinical practice.

      Physicians-investigators will enter into the study the information (data) concerning COPD
      patients, both those already registered at the selected medical treatment and preventive care
      institution, and newly registered patients as they seek attention at the outpatient
      polyclinic institutions.

      Patient data will be entered into the registry de-identified. The patients will be identified
      by their screening number and initials. Then the Physician-investigator will evaluate patient
      compliance with inclusion criteria. The study will enrol patients meeting all the inclusion
      criteria and not having any of the exclusion criteria.

      Only the physician who enters patient data into the regional COPD registry possesses patient
      contact information, and henceforth only this physician will enter de-identified patient data
      according to study design. This physician does not influence the choice of examination
      extent, treatment strategy and medication.

      Primarily epidemiological methods will be used for presentation of the study results.
      Descriptive analysis approach will be applied for analysis of the study objectives.
      Descriptive statistics will be used for analysis of the study population, baseline and
      clinical data.

      Descriptive statistics will include frequency tables (n, mean, median, standard deviation,
      minimum and maximum for continuous variables; n, frequency and percentage for categorical
      variables). Percentages will be evaluated together with 95% confidence intervals (in
      appropriate cases).
