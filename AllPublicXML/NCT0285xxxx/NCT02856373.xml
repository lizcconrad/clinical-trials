    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Sympathetic activity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ventricular
      tachyarrhythmia. Previous studies have shown evidence of significant heritable influences on
      individual responses to adrenergic stimulation. Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation
      (RDN) is a novel treatment option for patients with resistant hypertension, proved to reduce
      local and whole-body sympathetic activity. The investigators hypothesize that percutaneous
      transluminal electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve bundles in the renal arteries
      will cause ventricular arrhythmias and renal denervation will suppress these arrhythmias in
      patients with sympathetic ventricular arrhythmias.

      Objective:

      This study will investigate the effects of renal nerve stimulation before and after
      percutaneous transluminal RDN on cardiac excitable properties including induction of
      ventricular tachy-arrhythmias before and after RDN in six studies, i.e. patients with
      catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT syndrome and
      arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), sympathetically driven ventricular
      arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and
      ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). The aim of the six studies is to assess the anti-arrhythmic
      effects of RDN in patients with sympathetic ventricular tachy-arrhythmias.

      Study design:

      Investigator initiated, multi centre, six pretest-posttest design studies.

      Study population:

      Patients with recurrent sympathetically driven ventricular arrhythmia despite optimal
      pharmacological therapy. Patients should be diagnosed with CPVT and certain types of long QT
      syndrome, ARVC, HCM, DCM and ICM. Eligible patients will be in the age category of 18-85
      year.

      Intervention:

      RDN will be performed according to routine clinical practice. Prior to the ablation
      procedure, catheter mapping of the renal arteries will be performed according to routine
      clinical practice. Clinical and biological responses to transluminal electrical renal nerve
      stimulation will be assessed before and after RDN.

      Study endpoints:

        -  Main procedural study endpoint: Induction of ventricular arrhythmias in response to
           renal nerve stimulation prior to RDN and absence of renal nerves stimulation induced
           ventricular arrhythmias after RDN.

        -  Main clinical study endpoint: Development of ventricular arrhythmia during exercise
           stress testing performed 6 months after procedure.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      In several studies, it was shown that RDN was safe. The intervention resulted in
      significantly better control of blood pressure with less medication, and beneficial changes
      in heart rate variability, autonomic sympathetic balance, renal arteriolar function, and a
      higher success of atrial fibrillation prevention. In case reports and case series, RDN had a
      favourable effect in patients with sympathetic drug refractory ventricular tachy-arrhythmias.
