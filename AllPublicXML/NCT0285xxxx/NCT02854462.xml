  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to test whether training parents to ask their children 'inference-
      eliciting' questions during book reading is effective in promoting story comprehension for
      4-year-olds from a range of socio-economic backgrounds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Language comprehension relies on the ability to make local and global inferences (e.g.,
      inferring what a pronoun refers to, or inferring why a protagonist in a story did something
      based on information distributed through the text). These skills develop in the preschool
      years and are demonstrated when children make sense of stories that are read to them. While
      important for later reading ability and academic success, relatively little is known about
      whether anything can be done to improve inference-making skills in the preschool years. One
      possibility is that parent-child book reading would help. During book reading, some parents
      naturally ask their children questions about the story that would require them to make
      inferences about the text. The current study is designed to test whether doing this promotes
      children's ability to make inferences. Half the parents in this study will be given books
      with inference eliciting questions added to them and will be provided with training about how
      to ask these questions and respond to their children's answers. The other half of the parents
      will be given a maths exercise book and asked to spend the same amount of time per day
      working through this.

    <description>An age-appropriate test of inferencing ability has been developed for this study including vignettes developed by the Language and Reading Research Consortium. Children listen to short vignettes and are then asked questions that require them to make local and global inferences based on the information in the stories.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline: when child is 4 years 3 months - 4 years 6 months. Post test: 4 weeks post intervention</time_frame>

    <description>The intervention will run for 4 weeks. Caregivers will be provided with storybooks (e.g., Percy the Park Keeper) that have been amended to include inference-eliciting questions. Caregivers will be trained (with a video) to ask these questions and respond to their children's answers during shared reading sessions. They will be asked to read one book per day. Caregivers will keep a reading diary.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention will run for 4 weeks. Caregivers will be provided with a book 'At home with counting' that is made up of age appropriate maths exercises. Caregivers will trained (with a video) to work through one page of the book per day. This should take the same amount of time as the activity in the language intervention condition. Caregivers will keep a counting diary.</description>
