  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the evaluation is to confirm operability and usability of the SL-D301 Slit
      Lamp and the DC-4 digital camera attachment by conducting a usability evaluation and
      subsequently submitting a questionnaire and hold an interview with the operator.

      Of special interest for the study is to confirm whether the illumination level of SL-D301 is
      enough to perform an eye exam since the maximum illumination level on the SL-D301 is lower
      than other existing Topcon digital ready slit lamps due to regulations that limit the maximum
      light intensity on the human eye. The SL-D301 will be compared against the predicate device
      SL-3G.

      An eye care professional familiar with the use of slit lamps and experienced with other
      Topcon and other manufacturer's slit lamps will evaluate operability and usability of SL-D301
      and DC-4 digital camera attachment instrument performing routine eye examinations and image
      capture on volunteer subjects using above mentioned instruments. Similar evaluations will be
      performed with the SL-3G Slit Lamp and a comparative evaluation will be drawn between the two
      instruments. At the end of the evaluation, the evaluator will be presented with a
      questionnaire on specific points regarding the performance and features of the instruments
      and interviewed. The responses will then be evaluated by Topcon.
