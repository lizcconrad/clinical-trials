  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of daratumumab in Chinese participants with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma (RRMM) who failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (Part 1 and Part 2); and
      to evaluate the tolerability and safety of daratumumab in Chinese participants whose prior
      therapy included a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and who have
      demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (Part 3).
