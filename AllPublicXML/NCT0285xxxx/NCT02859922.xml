    <textblock>
      The study compared the Laryngeal Tube Suction (LTS-D) Disposable with the Supreme Laryngeal
      Mask Airway (SLMA) during spontaneous ventilation. The investigators hypothesized that the
      LTS-D and the SLMA perform similarly during spontaneous ventilation despite differences in
      their structural design.

    <textblock>
      The Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway (SLMA), (Intavent Orthofix, Maidenhead, UK), and Laryngeal
      Tube Suction -Disposable (LTS-D, (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz, Germany), are second
      generation single-use supraglottic airway devices (SADs) with gastric access, for airway
      management in spontaneously and mechanically ventilated patients undergoing general
      anesthesia.

      The SLMA has been compared to the Proseal Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA) during mechanical and
      spontaneous ventilation the LTS II (multiple use version of the LTS-D) with the PLMA.

      Recently, the LTS-D and SLMA have been compared when used during pressure controlled
      mechanical ventilation.

      To date, there is no published data comparing the SLMA to the LTS-D during spontaneous
      ventilation. The investigators hypothesized that the SLMA and LTS-D perform similarly during
      spontaneous ventilation despite differences in their structural design.

      The chief aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the SLMA and the LTS-D with
      respect to 1) Oxygen saturation and End Tidal carbone dioxide during spontaneous ventilation,
      2) time to achieve an effective airway, 3) ease of insertion, 4) need for interventions to
      achieve an effective airway, 5) cuff seal (leak) pressure at an intracuff pressure of 60 cm
      H2O, 6) ventilatory variables during spontaneous ventilation, 7) fiberoptic score, 8) adverse
      perioperative events.
