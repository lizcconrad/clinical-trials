  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for women with a relatively small breast cancer without arguments for
      involvement of the axillary lymph nodes, is breast conserving surgery followed by
      radiotherapy of the whole breast, often with a complementary dose to the operated area
      (boost). A delay of 3-4 weeks after surgery is advisable for allowing wound healing before
      the start of radiotherapy. Historically, whole breast radiotherapy plus boost are delivered
      in 6-7 weeks. This treatment can be associated with temporary fatigue and decrease in quality
      of life. Randomized trials have shown that shorter schedules, delivering slightly more dose
      per day during 3 weeks, are equal to the long schedules. In an earlier clinical study, the
      investigators have tested such a short schedule and shown that it is equally safe and equally
      well tolerated as the conventional schemes. Other hospitals have examined (and still are
      examining) the safety and tolerance of even shorter schedules, delivering radiotherapy in 1
      week.

      This clinical study involves delivering radiotherapy in 1 week and before the surgery in
      stead of following surgery. In the postoperative setting, it is often debatable which volume
      should be included in the boost. Often boost-volumes remain large because of uncertainties in
      delineation. Preoperative radiotherapy has the advantage that the tumor is visible on
      imaging. This can result in smaller boost volumes. The surgery will follow shortly after
      termination of the radiotherapy, resulting in a very short treatment period.

      This study is an open study investigating the effect on quality of life of a very short
      preoperative radiotherapy for early breast cancer.

      Women with early breast cancer are treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by
      whole breast irradiation (WBI) and a complementary dose to the lumpectomy cavity (boost). A
      delay of 3-4 weeks after surgery is advisable for allowing wound healing before the start of
      radiotherapy. Historically, WBI plus boost are delivered in 6-7 weeks. This treatment is
      associated with fatigue and a decreased quality of life. Randomized trials have shown that
      shorter hypofractionated schedules, delivering radiotherapy in 3 weeks, are equal to the long
      schedules. The investigators have shown that a hypofractionated tomotherapy with a
      simultaneous integrated boost is oncologically safe, well tolerated and has less impact on
      quality of life than the conventional schemes.

      In the postoperative setting, it is often debatable which volume should be included in the
      boost. Surgical clips can help to decrease inter-observer variability, but often
      boost-volumes remain large because of uncertainties in delineation. Preoperative radiotherapy
      has the advantage that the gross tumor volume (GTV) is visible on imaging. This can result in
      smaller boost volumes.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a short preoperative tomotherapy.
      The potential benefits are

        -  a decrease in overall treatment time

        -  a positive effect on quality of life

        -  a more precise target delineation

        -  profitable health economics.
