  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both biodegradable polymer-based biolimus-eluting stents (BP-BES) and durable polymer-based
      everolimus-eluting stents (DP-EES) have been shown to improve long-term clinical outcomes as
      compared with early generation DES. BP-BES with DP-EES have been directly compared in 2
      randomized trials, showing no differences between the two devices in all-comer patients
      during long-term follow-up. It is unknown whether these results are consistent in real-world
      patients with diabetes mellitus during long-term follow-up. To evaluate the safety and
      efficacy profile of biodegradable polymer-coated biolimus-eluting stents (BP-BES) as compared
      to durable polymer-coated everolimus-eluting stents (DP-EES) in patients with diabetes
      mellitus during long-term follow-up.

      Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions with BP-BES or
      DP-EES implantation were included in a multicenter registry between January 2007 and May
      2012. Long-term clinical outcomes between BP-BES and DP-EES will be compared using propensity
      score matching. The pre-specified primary endpoint is the occurrence of major cardiac adverse
      events (MACE) - a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI) or target-vessel
      revascularization (TVR). Secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary
      endpoint as well as definite stent thrombosis (ST).
