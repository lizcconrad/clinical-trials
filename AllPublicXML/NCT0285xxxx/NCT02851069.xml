  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interferon-free combination regimen of Paritaprevir/r - Ombitasvir with or without
      Dasabuvir (ABBVIE REGIMEN) ± Ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
      has been shown to be safe and effective in randomized controlled clinical trials with strict
      inclusion and exclusion criteria under well controlled conditions.

      This observational study is the first effectiveness research examining the ABBVIE REGIMEN ±
      RBV, used according to local label, under real world conditions in Israel in a clinical
      practice patient population.
