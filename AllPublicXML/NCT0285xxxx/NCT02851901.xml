      This double-blind placebo-controlled design with 374 cancer patients will compare standard
      varenicline treatment (12-weeks active + 12-weeks placebo) to extended varenicline treatment
      (24-weeks active) for increasing week 24 &amp; 52 biochemically-confirmed 7-day point prevalence
      abstinence, assess effects of extended varenicline therapy on QOL, including varenicline side
      effects, and assess changes in affect &amp; cognitive impairment as mediators of extended
      varenicline therapy effect on quit rates.
