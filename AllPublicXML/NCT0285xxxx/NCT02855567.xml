      This study investigates the role of acupuncture in controlling post-operative pain in
      patients who have undergone gynecological surgery.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate acupuncture at the time of gynecological surgery as a
      way to decrease post-operative pain which would decrease narcotic intake and hospitalization
      time. To do this, the researchers will recruit non-pregnant patients over the age of 18 who
      are undergoing laparoscopic surgery for a benign gynecological indication. These patients
      will be randomized using a computer generated randomization system to receive either
      acupuncture or sham acupuncture pre-operatively after the induction of anesthesia. The
      acupuncture points used will be points proven in the literature to be associated with
      decreasing general pain, pelvic pain and nausea and vomiting. The needles will be placed by a
      anesthesiologist trained in acupuncture and they will be left in place for 15 minutes while
      the patient is prepped for the surgery. The sham points will be on the hands and feet and
      chosen at random by the gynecologic surgeon who is not trained in acupuncture. For both
      groups, the acupuncture needles will be removed before the first incision of the surgery. All
      patients will be blinded to their group allocation.

    <description>Effectiveness of intra-operative acupuncture in post-operative pain control as measured by narcotic use in the 24 hours post-operatively. Narcotic use will be monitored either through hospital records if patient is still admitted to the hospital or over the phone if the patient is discharged home prior to 24 hours post-operative.</description>
