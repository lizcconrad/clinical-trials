  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, 4-way crossover study in healthy participants will determine the
      relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation relative to the capsule formulation and
      the effect of a high-fat and low-fat meal on the relative bioavailability of the tablet
      formulation.
