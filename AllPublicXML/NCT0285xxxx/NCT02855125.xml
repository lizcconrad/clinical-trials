  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study of TAS-114 administered in combination with
      S-1, to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the TAS-114/S-1 regimen in
      patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

      The study will be conducted internationally in 2 regions: Asian [Japan] and Western [Europe
      and US]. Patients will be randomized into TAS-114/S-1 arm versus S-1 control arm in a 1:1
      ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization will take place once the consented patient has completed all the necessary
      baseline procedures and is deemed eligible for study entry. Treatment assignment will be done
      centrally using a dynamic allocation method (biased coin) via an interactive voice/web
      response system (IXRS) stratified by:

        -  Geographical region (Region 1: Asian [Japan]; Region 2: Western [Europe and US])

        -  Histological subtypes (nonsquamous cell carcinoma [including mixed] and squamous cell
           carcinoma)
