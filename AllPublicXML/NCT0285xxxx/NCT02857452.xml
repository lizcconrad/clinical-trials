  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of lupus patients must include several approaches, in particular disease
      activity and quality of life.

      The Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) is a validated self-questionnaire to
      evaluate disease activity. It has the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use in large
      cohorts and has been used in several studies. It has never been validated in French. The
      Lupus Quality Of Life (LupusQoL) is a self-questionnaire to evaluate quality of life and is
      specific to systemic lupus erythematous; it was developed from interviews with patients.

      This tool, validated in a British population, has never been validated in French.
