      Aim of study:

      To evaluate the effects of the shortened version of the Incredible Years (IY) Basic
      programme, the study which the parents were recruited to. A randomising experimental control
      between-group design was used with pre- and post-intervention measurements, and a one-year,
      four-year and ten-year follow-up. Children and families were randomized to either the
      shortened basic version (n = 89), or the control group (n = 97).

    <description>Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (Robinson et al., 1980). The ECBI provides a list of 36 problem behaviours commonly reported by parents of children with disruptive behaviour problems. The inventory assesses behaviour on two dimensions: the frequency of the behaviour and its identification as a problem. The frequency ratings range from 1 (never) to 7 (always), and are summed to yield an overall problem behaviour Intensity score (Cronbach's alpha 1⁄4 0.82) ranging from 36 to 252.</description>

    <measure>Reasons for participation and help seeking behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Four-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire consisting of 12 questions was developed to assess parents' reasons for participating in child rearing classes. Three subscales measure parental concern (five items, a 1⁄4 0.82), motivation to learn (three items, a 1⁄4 0.42), and own/other's opinion (three items, a 1⁄4 0.42). The questionnaire was sent to all participants in the study. Examples of the questions were: ''I was concerned for my child's behaviour'', ''I was uncertain of how to raise my child'', and ''I think it's interesting to learn about children''. All questions were answered using a five-point Likert scale from ''agree'' to ''disagree''.</description>

    <measure>Longitudinal change in PROC scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after intervention, one-year follow up, four-year follow up, ten-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents Sense of Competence (Johnston and Mash, 1989). The PSOC consists of 16 items about parents' confidence on being a parent, answered on a six-point scale ranging from ''strongly disagree'' to ''strongly agree''. Scoring for some items is reversed so that, for all items, higher scores indicate greater parenting self-esteem. Two subscales measure efficacy (seven items, a 1⁄4 0.69) and satisfaction (nine items, a 1⁄4 0.77) in parenting.</description>

    <measure>Longitudinal change in PSI scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after intervention, one-year follow up, four-year follow up, ten-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Stress Index, Short Form (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1995). The PSI-SF is a 36 item self-report measure of parenting stress, derived from the full version PSI. The PSI-SF yields a total stress (a 1⁄4 0.90) in addition to scores on three scales: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child.</description>

    <measure>Longitudinal change in PPI scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-8 weeks after intervention, one-year follow up, four-year follow up, ten-year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Parenting Practices Interview (Webster-Stratton et al., 2001). The PPI was adapted from the Oregon Social Learning Centre's Discipline Questionnaire. Two subscales were used; Harsh Discipline (14 items, a 1⁄4 0.79), and Positive Parenting (15 items, a 1⁄4 0.67). Parents reported the probability and the frequency with which they used the different strategies on a seven-point scale.</description>

    <description>The IY parent training programme (3-8 years) developed by Webster-Stratton at the Parenting Clinic, University of Washington, is a manualised and video-based training programme for parents of young children with conduct problems (Webster-Stratton and Reid, 2003a). Parents assigned to the short IY Basic (S-IY) condition were divided into groups of 10-12 parents. The S-IY was led by two experienced group leaders and parents met weekly for two-hour sessions at a public health care center in the community. The group leaders led discussions regarding central aspects of parenting on the basis of the video vignettes, role play and homework.</description>
