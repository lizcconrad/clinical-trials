  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that growth in size (weight, length, and
      head circumference) and in body composition (fat and lean mass) in preterm infants should
      adhere as close as possible to the growth and body composition of a healthy infant in utero
      at the same gestational age. However, there are no body composition reference curves
      available at this time for the preterm infant population. The purpose of this study is to
      collect cross-sectional body composition data using air displacement plethysmography (PEA POD
      Infant Body Composition System, Life Measurement, Inc) on approximately 240 preterm infants
      within 3 days of birth, for the purpose of generating means, standard deviations, and
      percentile values for total body fat mass, total fat free mass, and percent body fat for
      infants born at 30-36 weeks gestation. Relatively healthy infants without evidence of growth
      retardation will be selected for form the reference sample. The goal is to generate a set of
      common reference curves to be used in clinical centers against which to compare body
      composition status for individual infants.

        AGA, singleton, healthy infants born between 30+0 and 36+6 weeks gestation were eligible.
        The study was conducted between 2010 and 2015 at three tertiary NICU's in the United
        States: the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, MN
        (referred to hereafter as the MN site), Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, CA
        (referred to as the SC site), and Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA (referred to
        as BS).
