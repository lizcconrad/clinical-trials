  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mechanism-driven translational project to test the efficacy of transcranial
      low-level light/laser therapy (LLLT), for enhancing cognitive function in middle-aged and
      older adults and participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of LLLT to enhance neurocognitive function
      in middle-aged adults and examine the modulating influences of carotid atherosclerosis. The
      specific aims will be accomplished in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by examining
      cognitive test performance and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a working
      memory task in middle-aged and older adults and participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment
      pre- and post- six-week long intervention of LLLT or placebo. In addition, the investigators
      will examine if carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) moderates the therapeutic effects
      of LLLT.

    <description>Six weekly sessions of LLLT. The treatment will consist of applying light of a specific wavelength (1064 nm) using a laser diode supplied by Cell Gen Therapeutics, LLC (CG-5000 laser, HD Laser Center, Dallas, TX, USA). Each laser stimulation session will consist of total 8 min, with eight 1 min/cycle treatments alternating between two locations on the right forehead.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Placebo</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will undergo the same procedure as the treatment group, but will receive brief (5-s) stimulation to the intended site on the forehead, followed by 55 s of no stimulation, for each 1-min cycle. Thus the control group will receive approximately 1/12th of the cumulative energy density as the treatment group. This is sufficient to provide a brief sensation of slight heat (as active placebo) at the onset of each one-minute cycle, using a fraction of the energy received by the experimental group.</description>
