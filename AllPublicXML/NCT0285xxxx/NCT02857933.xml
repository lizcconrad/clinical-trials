    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal frequency and intensity of physical
      therapy for children with cerebral palsy aged 6 to 24 months of age. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of three groups: daily, intermediate, or weekly physical therapy.
      Short and long term effects will be evaluated to determine the best 'dose' of rehabilitation
      for children with cerebral palsy, including frequency (number of sessions per week and the
      number of weeks), intensity (how hard the patient works), and time (how many total hours) of
      rehabilitation treatment.

    <textblock>
      Determining optimal frequency of treatment for young children with cerebral palsy (CP) has
      implications for shaping the future of pediatric rehabilitation. There are wide variations in
      the number of hours per week of treatment in current outpatient rehabilitation programs for
      children with CP, suggesting clinical uncertainty. Usual weekly therapy at 1 - 2 hours per
      week for 6 months or longer is the most commonly implemented frequency of dose for children
      with CP 6 - 24 months of age. However, this decision about frequency is often made based on
      clinical reasoning and scheduling, not on principles of rehabilitation, child development, or
      evidence from strongly designed randomized controlled trials. The proposed study will fill
      this gap by directly comparing the effects of 3 frequency levels of therapy - concentrated
      daily, intermediate, and usual weekly in children with CP 6 - 24 months of age at the
      initiation of treatment and following these patients for 2 years.

      In this prospective longitudinal study, children with Cerebral Palsy (n=75), 6 - 24 months of
      age, will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: daily, intermediate, or weekly
      physical therapy. The treatment phase of this study design is 5 months for a total of 40
      hours of one-on-one therapy for both groups. Level 1 daily therapy is 2 hours of therapy per
      day for 20 straight weekdays. Level 2 intermediate therapy is 2 hours of therapy per day 3
      days per week for 6.6 weeks. Level 3 usual weekly therapy is 2 hours of therapy one day per
      week for 20 weeks. Researchers will directly compare the effects of 3 these frequency levels
      of therapy at the initiation of treatment and following these patients for 2 years. Results
      will provide quantitative evidence of frequency-response, which is critical for informing
      clinical decision-making, health policy, and guidelines for reimbursement.

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after initiation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>GMFM evaluates change in gross motor function over time or with intervention in children with CP from 5 months to 16 years. It has been used widely in the field to determine functional motor change following intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after initiation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>GAS creates patient, family, and clinical anchors as the external criterion for improvement by establishing activity or participation goals that reflect what an individual, family, and clinician consider meaningful or relevant.The GAS method allows for goals to be defined at different levels of mastery and assigned numerical values for score calculation, similar to a Likert scale. The scale will have 5 points representing different levels of mastery of the individual patient's goal. A score of -2 represents baseline, -1 less change than expected, 0 for the expected level of change, and +1 and +2 for achievement of more change than expected. To attempt to ensure ordinality, each level on the scale will be described and will reflect a single dimension of change that is measureable, achievable, and relevant</description>

    <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition is an individually administered test designed to assess developmental functioning of infants and toddlers. The Bayley-III assesses development in five areas: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after initiation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Administered as a parent survey. The PEDI is a descriptive measure of a child's current functional performance and can track changes over time. The PEDI measures both capability and performance of functional activities in three content domains: self-care, mobility, and social function.It can be used as a comprehensive clinical assessment of key functional capabilities and performance in children between the ages of six months and seven years.</description>
