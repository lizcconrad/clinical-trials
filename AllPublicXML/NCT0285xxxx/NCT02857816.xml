      The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single arm study is to evaluate the NURO system
      for the treatment of OAB in drug naïve patients. The study will assess change from baseline
      through 12 PTNM therapy sessions in UUI (urge urinary incontinence) episodes, voiding
      episodes, and patient reported outcomes. The study is expected to last approximately 14 weeks
      per subject following the enrollment visit. Subjects will be exited from the study after the
      final study visit is complete.
