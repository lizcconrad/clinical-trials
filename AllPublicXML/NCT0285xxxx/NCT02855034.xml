  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head injury is a frequent motive of consultation in paediatric emergency units and the first
      cause of mortality in infants of more than one year old in developped countries. The
      indication of performing cerebral CT scans currently depends on clinical decision based on
      recommendations used in adults. In this way, 60 to 90% of scans are normal in children with
      head injury. CT scan is expesive and irradiating with the risk of increasing the cancer in
      children. Protein S 100B and copeptine are biomarkers which have shown their ability to
      detect cerebral lesion in children with head injury. (protein S 100B and /or in adults
      (protein S 100B and copetine.

      It is the first clinical biological evaluation of severity of head injury based on dosing of
      copeptine alone or associated with proein S 100B.

      220 children or infants will be recruited during 24 months.

      Each patient will attend:

        -  a visit of inclusion:

        -  a visit at 96 hours +/-24hours after the inclusion: this visit is made by phone. The
           patient and his parents will have to answer to a phone questionnaire
