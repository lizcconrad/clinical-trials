  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypoidal choriodal vasculopathy (PCV) is an ophthalmologic disease, characterized by
      vascular abnormalities of the walls of small choroidal vessels, reproducing the specific
      aspect of polyps (cluster aspect). PCV is one of the &quot;boundary-forms&quot; of age related macular
      degeneration.

      These vasculopathies can be idiopathic. Following the radiotherapy treatments of active and
      occult-typed neovessels in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD), 10% of the patients would
      present typical polypoidal vasculopathic lesions. These polypoidal secondary lesions have
      been induced by radiotherapy treatment and may show an increased sensibility to radiation in
      these patients.

      Such an increase of radiosensibility is noticed in ataxia telangiectasia syndrome, in
      relation to the ATM gene mutations. The secondary or idiopathic polypoidal vasculopathic
      lesions are to be brought closer to telangiectasias in Ataxia Telangiectasia. Considering the
      iatrogenic component of radiotherapy in the secondary forms of ataxia telangiectasia, it
      seems legitimate to search for predisposing variants to polypoidal vasculopathies in the ATM
      gene.

      Considering the frequency of PCV worldwide, it seems important to identify the predisposing
      genetic factors of the ATM gene. These biomarkers to the pathology might enable us to offer
      prevention (reinforced protection against radiations, including light) and to develop
      therapeutics (recruitment of other kinases, ATM's partners, in the stability and cellular
      control of DNA).
