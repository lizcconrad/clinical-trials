    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective proof-of-concept study is designed to evaluate the surgical
      outcomes and clinicopathologic results of neoadjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) in conjunction with perioperative systemic chemotherapy (SCT;
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant) and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a small cohort of patients
      having T1-T3 resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with one or more high-risk
      clinical features. The investigators hypothesize that HIPEC administered in this clinical
      course will reduce postoperative peritoneal disease recurrence. The investigators also expect
      that local recurrence of disease will be reduced. The primary aim of this study is to compare
      2-year peritoneal disease-free survival between patients receiving the experimental therapy
      (neoadjuvant HIPEC + SCT + PD) with historical controls receiving standard therapy (SCT +
      PD). Secondary aims are to determine the clinical feasibility and outcomes of neoadjuvant
      HIPEC for resectable PDAC using patient demographics and disease characteristic data.

    <description>Peritoneal disease-free survival is defined as the time between staging laparoscopy confirming no peritoneal disease (at the time of HIPEC treatment) and regional recurrence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma on the peritoneal surfaces as determined by diagnostic imaging. This definition is exclusive of recurrence status in the pancreatic remnant after resection.</description>

    <description>Immediately following laparoscopy for diagnosis and staging of disease, closed neoadjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) will be performed using the anatomical site of the laparoscopic procedure in the same operative encounter. Perfusion will be initiated with 4-6 L of 1.5% dextrose at a 500 mL/min flow rate with manual agitation of the abdominal wall. Once the temperature in the abdomen becomes stable above 40°C, perfusate volume will be reduced to 1.5 L/m sq, and gemcitabine (GEMZAR®) will be instilled into the abdomen (1000 mg/m sq) for 90 min. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine will be administered prior to open pancreaticoduodenectomy by the standard Whipple or pylorus-preserving approach. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine will be administered for 6 months (including period of neoadjuvant therapy) according to established institutional protocol.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>HIPEC in this study involves the washing of the peritoneal cavity with a heated (40-48°C), (1000 mg/m sq) solution of gemcitabine in 1.5% dextrose for 90 min. Compared with systemic delivery of chemotherapy, intraperitoneal delivery can increase site-specific concentration of chemotherapeutic agents and decrease duration of perfusion, vascular complications, and systemic toxicity. The use of heated chemotherapeutic agents, compared to conventional protocols, has been shown to increase direct cytotoxicity to malignant cells and augment penetration into tumors.</description>

    <intervention_name>Open pancreaticoduodenectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Tumors of the pancreatic head will be surgically removed by open PD (standard and pylorus-preserving approaches) with the aim of achieving en bloc R0 tumor resection (no macroscopic residual cancer remaining). In all patients, a lymphadenectomy will be performed along the hepatoduodenal ligament, common hepatic artery, vena cava, and the interaortocaval and right side of the superior mesenteric artery. In cases with portal vein involvement, a venous resection will be performed to achieve R0 resection. Patients with arterial infiltration by the tumor will be deemed locally nonresectable and will be excluded from analysis.
Established, routine surgical and ERAS protocols will be followed for pre-, intra-, and postoperative care of patients. Patients will be discharged after postoperative day 5 if tolerating oral intake and showing no signs or symptoms of complications.</description>
