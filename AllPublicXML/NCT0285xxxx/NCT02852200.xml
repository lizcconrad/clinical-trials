      &quot;Many tools to evaluate frailty have been developed. However, at the time our study was
      designed, none of these instruments had been validated in terms of psychometric properties.
      The aim of this study was to validate the modified version of the Short Emergency Geriatric
      Assessment (SEGAm) frailty instrument in elderly people living at home.

      It was an observational, longitudinal, prospective, multicentre study, set up in four
      departments (Ardennes, Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse) in two French regions
      (Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine). Subjects was aged 65 years or more, living at home, and was
      able to read and understand French, with a degree of autonomy corresponding to groups 5, or 6
      in the AGGIR autonomy evaluation scale. Assessment included demographic characteristics,
      comprehensive geriatric assessment, and the SEGAm instrument. Psychometric validation was
      used to study feasibility and acceptability, internal structure validity, reliability, and
      discriminant validity of the SEGAm instrument. &quot;

      Many tools to evaluate frailty have been developed. However, most are designed for use in the
      hospital setting, with the resultant drawback that they are not suitable for routine use in
      the community setting. A few tools have been developed for use in community-dwelling
      subjects, such as the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) developed by Fried from a cohort of
      subjects aged 65 and older; the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF); or the SHARE frailty
      instrument, developed in a cohort of the same name comprising subjects aged 50 years and
      older living at home. However, at the time our study was designed, none of these instruments
      had been validated in terms of psychometric properties. The aim of this study was to validate
      the modified version of the Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment (SEGAm) frailty instrument
      in elderly people living at home. It was an observational, longitudinal, prospective,
      multicentre study, set up in four departments (Ardennes, Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Meuse) in
      two French regions (Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine). Subjects was aged 65 years or more,
      living at home, and was able to read and understand French, with a degree of autonomy
      corresponding to groups 5, or 6 in the AGGIR autonomy evaluation scale. Assessment included
      demographic characteristics, comprehensive geriatric assessment, and the SEGAm instrument.
      Psychometric validation was used to study feasibility and acceptability, internal structure
      validity, reliability, and discriminant validity of the SEGAm instrument.

    <description>The SEGAm to be validated comprises Sheet A, which evaluates frailty per se on a 13-item scale, with each item graded either 0 (most favourable state), 1, or 2 (least favourable state), thus making it possible to classify subjects into three groups: not very frail (score ≤8), frail (8&lt;score ≤11), and very frail (score&gt; 11). The SEGAm was administered by social workers, ergotherapists, nurses and non-medical personnel trained in administration of the instrument.</description>
