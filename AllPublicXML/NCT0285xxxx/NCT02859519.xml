        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females 12 - 70 years of age

          2. Distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO) of at least one of the great toenail(s) affecting
             20% to 50% of the target nail

          3. Positive culture for dermatophytes

          4. Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Proximal subungual onychomycosis

          2. Distal subungual onychomycosis of both great toenails where involvement has extended
             into the proximal portion of the target nail (unaffected proximal nail is less than 3
             mm)

          3. Target toenail thickness more than 3 mm

          4. &quot;Spike&quot; of onychomycosis extending to eponychium of the target toenail

          5. Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as thick masses of fungal hyphae and necrotic
             keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail

          6. Other conditions than DSO known to cause abnormal nail appearance

          7. Presence of toenail infection other than dermatophytes

          8. Previous target toenail surgery with any residual disfigurement

          9. Topical treatment of the nails with other antifungal medication within 1 month before
             Baseline/ Visit 2

         10. Systemic use of antifungal treatment within 7 months before Baseline/ Visit 2

         11. Severe moccasin tinea pedis

         12. Signs of severe peripheral circulatory insufficiency

         13. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

         14. Known immunodeficiency

         15. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device during
             the previous 3 months before Baseline/ Visit 2

         16. Known allergy to any of the tested treatment products

         17. A positive pregnancy test at Baseline/Visit 2 indicating pregnancy in a woman of

         21. History of, or current drug or alcohol abuse

         22. Psychiatric condition that might limit the participation in the study and/or that lead

             of consent is missing

         23. Close affiliation with the investigator (e.g. a close relative) or persons working at
