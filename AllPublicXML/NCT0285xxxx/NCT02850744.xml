  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PQR309 is an oral, dual pan-PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase)
      and mTOR (mammilian target of rapamycin) inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier at
      pharmacodynamically active concentrations. This study plans to evaluate PQR309 in treatment
      of patients with first progression of glioblastoma.

      Open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multi-center study evaluating clinical efficacy,
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of PQR309 in patients with progressive
      glioblastoma during or after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy.

      The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 18 patients with glioblastoma at first
      progression during or after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy or temozolomide only. Following
      the completion of recruitment of patients in the first stage of the study, the decision will
      be made by the study team (study investigators and the sponsor), based on the continuous
      evaluation of safety and efficacy data, whether to continue recruitment of patients in the
      second stage while awaiting the data analyses. 17 additional patients may be enrolled for the
      second stage of the study, for a minimum of 35 patients in total. All patients evaluable for
      the primary endpoint will be followed until disease progression or death.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma at first progression following or
             during standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RTTMZ)

          2. older than 18 years of age

          3. Radiographic demonstration of disease progression by RANO criteria

          4. Only for patients of the surgical cohort:

               -  Eligible for open resection of progressive tumor according to standard practice
                  of the study center

               -  Availability of adequate surgical tissue sample for the evaluation of
                  concentration of PQR309 in the tumor and its PD effect

               -  Patients treated with PQR309 after incomplete surgical resection may still have
                  measurable disease according to RANO criteria and may therefore be evaluable for
                  evaluation of response to treatment with PQR309 according to RANO criteria. The
                  best response in patients treated with PQR309 after complete surgical resection
                  is stable disease. All patients can be assessed for PFS6.

          5. Only for patients of the non-surgical cohort:

             - Presence of at least one lesion of bi-dimensionally measurable disease by MRI with a
             contrast-enhancing tumor of at least 1 cm (10 mm) in the longest diameter on baseline
             MRI is required for patients who do not undergo surgery at relapse. For patients who
             undergo surgery for recurrence but do not participate in the presurgical PQR309 dosing
             cohort, the same rules regarding response assessment as in the surgical cohort apply.
             All patients can be assessed for PFS6.

          6. Patient must have at least 1 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tumor tissue
             block representative of glioblastoma available from the first surgical resection of
             glioblastoma.

          7. One prior systemic therapy regimen: patients must have received at least one dose of
