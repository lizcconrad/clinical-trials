  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective review of the data collected in a previously completed
      randomized, controlled trial (RCT) entitled &quot;Memantine and Comprehensive, Individualized,
      Patient Centered Management of Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial&quot;
      (NCT00120874). As part of the previously completed RCT, participants with Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD) were randomly placed into one of two groups: memantine, or memantine plus an
      individualized management program consisting of home visits, educational sessions for
      caregivers, and a caregiver support group. Participants received the study intervention for
      28 weeks; study follow-up lasted for 52 weeks.

      The collected data from the existing study books from the 28 week treatment portion of the
      RCT will be carefully examined with respect to each of the research questions for the present
      retrospective study.

    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAST-DS assesses the magnitude of progressive functional deterioration by identifying characteristic progressive disabilities in participants with AD. Scores range from 1.0 (normal) to 7f (severe loss of ability, not even able to hold up head independently). Scores are made up of stages (1 through 7) and substages (from a to e for stage 6; from a to f for stage 7). The following scoring for substages is applied: 6a=6.0, 6b=6.2, 6c=6.4, 6d=6.6, 6e=6.8, 7a=7.0, 7b=7.2, 7c=7.4, 7d=7.6, 7e=7.8, 7f=8.0. Additionally, non-consecutive deficits are noted and scored as follows: full stage non-consecutive deficit=1.0, non-consecutive substage deficit=0.2.
The overall FAST-DS score = (FAST Stage Score) + (Each Non-Consecutive FAST disability scored as described)</description>
