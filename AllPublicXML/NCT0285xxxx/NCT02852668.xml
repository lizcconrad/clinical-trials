  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inexorable decline in motor skills during aging provides the investigators with an
      elderly population with various functional limitations. Among these, the ability to walk,
      being associated with the risk of falling has been studied by several authors. The adoption
      of strength and power training as an intervention strategy to reduce the negative effects
      arising from the physiological or pathological process of aging has been widely discussed in
      these studies. However, the effects of these interventions on biomechanical gait indicators
      have not been fully debated yet. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of these
      two training protocols on functional capacities and biomechanical gait parameters of elderly
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three female groups, homogenized by age, body mass index and physical activity level, were
      formed: the control group (GC: n=8, 69±4 years old), the strength training group (GF: n=6,
      67±4 years old) and the power training group (GP, n=7, 68±4 years old). No extra activity was
      induced to GC's routine. Meanwhile, GF and GP underwent 12 weeks of strength and power
      training, respectively, with three weekly sessions. While GF performed the exercises with
      moderate speed (70-90% of 1RM), the GP executed them in fast speed (40-60% of 1RM). A
      kinematic and electromyographic gait evaluation, as well as balance and functional capacity
      evaluations, were conducted prior and after the intervention period.
