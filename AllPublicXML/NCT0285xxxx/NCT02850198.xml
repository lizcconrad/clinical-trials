      This research is primary to compare effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture and scalp
      acupuncture on motor function of the upper limb(UL) in convalescence phase of ischemic
      stroke. The clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT),consisting of two arms
      of scalp electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group to value difference
      of upper limb function after 4 weeks. The result indicates that scalp electroacupuncture is
      more sufficient to alter function. The purpose is to value effectiveness of scalp
      electroacupuncture on motor function of the upper limb in convalescence phase of ischemic
      stroke.

      Upper limb(UL) impairment is common in patients of ischemic stroke and recovery of motor
      function is important for regaining independence in activities of daily living. Researches
      show that the death toll of people who suffering from stroke more than 200 millions,the
      annual growth rate of this data reached 8.7%, which ischemic stroke take percentage of 60-70,
      and who suffered from UL impairment reached about 70%. Nowadays, morbidity of ischemic stroke
      of China is the first of the world.

      Aging is a risk for ischemic stroke，especially over the age of 50 years old, which will
      increase morbidity rate of UL motor function impairment.

      UL dysfunction make patients despaired and can not attend social activity normally,
      decreasing the quality of their lives. Attending social activity is very important for
      people's health, otherwise, people will get a series of diseases, like disability, depressive
      disorder,etc.

      This subject is primary to compare effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture and scalp
      acupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke. The
      clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT),consisting of two arms of scalp
      electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group to value difference of upper
      limb function after 4 weeks. The result indicates that scalp electroacupuncture is more
      sufficient to alter function.

      As a further study, this research contains two parallel arms of scalp electroacupuncture
      group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group. The purpose is to value effectiveness of scalp
      electroacupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke,
      comparing with sham scalp electroacupuncture.

    <description>Select a 1.5 cun long disposable sterile filiform needle NO.30.Divide the Anterior oblique line of the vertex-temporal in ipsilesional into three equal parts to accept acupuncture.Insert the needle subcutaneously at a 30°angle to the scalp.The depth of insertion is 1 cun.The needle is twirled continuously at a frequency of about 170 times per minute.When the acupuncture sensation is obtained,connect the positive and negative outputs of the electroacupuncture to the handle of the needle in the Anterior oblique line of upper 1/3 and the middle 1/3. Select an sparse-dense wave .Use the low frequency electroacupuncture which the frequency is 2Hz. Every session lasts for 30 min per day.The treatment must be given once daily and 5 sessions constitute one therapeutic course.There is 2 days for relaxation between the two therapeutic courses.The participants must be treated for 4 weeks.</description>
