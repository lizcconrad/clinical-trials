        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects with CD19+ B cell malignancies in patients with no available
        curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have limited
        prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be
        enrolled:

          1. Eligible diseases: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
             (CLL), Follicular lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and
             diffuse large cell lymphoma, previously identified as CD19+.

          2. Patients 14 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          3. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or karnofsky
             performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60.

          4. Adequate venous access for apheresis or venous sampling, and no other
             contraindications for leukapheresis.

          5. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks
             after the last infusion of CAR T cells.

          6. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements: White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2500c/ml, Platelets ≥ 50×10^9/L, Hb ≥
             6.0g/dL, lymphocyte (LY) ≥ 0.7×10^9/L, LY% ≥ 15%, Alb ≥ 2.8g/dL, serum lipase and
             amylase &lt; 1.5×upper limit of normal, serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5×upper limit of normal,
             serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL. These tests must be conducted within 7 days prior to
             registration.

          7. Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The transduction efficiency of the T cells is less than 30% or the amplification of
             the T cells via artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) stimulation is less than 5
             times.

          2. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate.

          3. Active HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

          4. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major
             cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric or emotional disorders.

          5. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.

          6. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not
             exclusionary.

          7. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          8. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin).

          9. Patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).

         10. Patients using fludarabine or cladribine chemotherapy within 3 months prior to
             leukapheresis.
