  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate spatial orientation in weightlessness as it
      manifests not in perception but rather in motor performance by direction and reaction time of
      flip switch.

      Hypotheses are that flip switch:

        1. will be biased towards visual allocentric cues when those are available;

        2. will be biased towards the egocentric reference when tactile cues are added;

        3. will be dominated by egocentric cues when visual cues are not available;

        4. will be delayed and more variable when confirmatory gravitational cues are absent;

        5. will be faster and more reliable in absence of conflicting gravitational cues, and even
           more so when tactile cues are added;

        6. The difference will be more pronounce when tested under Dual-task condition

    <description>subjects will be asked to flip a series of switches into the &quot;off&quot; position. On Earth, the &quot;off&quot; position corresponds to &quot;down&quot; in all three reference frames: the visual allocentric, the non-visual allocentric as well as the egocentric frames. We expect that flip direction will be dominated by visual allocentric cues when those are available, will be delayed and more variable when confirmatory gravitational cues are absent, and will be biased towards the egocentric reference when tactile cues are added</description>

    <intervention_name>FLIP SWITCHES &quot;DOWN&quot; IN WEIGHTLESSNESS</intervention_name>
    <description>The circular instrument panel that subjects will see into the cylindrical mask consists of one switch surrounded by a luminous ring (left part of the figure below). The switch can be flipped into any direction within the full 360Â° range. The switch provides no visual cues about &quot;down&quot;, but the experimenter can add such cues by means of visually polarized labelling displayed on a circular black screen at the center of the panel (right part the figure below).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers (men or women)

          -  Aged from 20 to 65

        flight campaign
