  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to combine regenerative techniques with bone grafting in human models to increase
      predictability and survival of reconstructed tissue. The MSCs in this study were derived from
      an intra oral fat source (BFP) and were cultured over natural bovine bone mineral granules
      and delivered within the lateral ramus cortical bone plate (LRCP)to treat human alveolar
      cleft defects.

      Patients enrolled in the present study were suffering from alveolar cleft and had previously
      received orthodontic treatment and only required secondary alveolar grafting. The buccal fat
      pad derived stem cells (BFPSCs) were harvested from buccal fat pad tissues of the patients.
      Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group A , the control group, was treated with anterior
      iliac crest (AIC) spongy bone to fill defects, followed by coverage with collagen membrane.
      Group B was treated with lateral ramus cortical bone cage (LRCP), used to create a protected
      healing space by fixing it to adjacent walls of the cleft defect. Group C was treated with
      (AIC) as in Group 1, but BFP-derived MSCs cultured over NBBM were put over the spongy bone
      and covered with a collagen membrane.Passage 3 BFPSCs were loaded on the implants ( Cerabone
      (Botiss, Berlin, Germany) a natural bovine bone mineral (NBBM); a granular biomaterial with a
      200- to 850-Âµm particle size) 3 days prior to transplantation.Cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) was obtained after 6 months.
