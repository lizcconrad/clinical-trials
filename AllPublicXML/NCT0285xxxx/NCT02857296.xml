  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project aims to analyze the implementation of a new health care system -
      &quot;alternative device to hospitalization and crisis home for people without home&quot; - whose
      objective is to provide the homeless and suffering from severe psychiatric disorders adequate
      care to prevent situations from seeking care or complication of their disease. This device,
      if it has the administrative and legal structure of the Twin Stop Health Care (LHSS), is
      based on the original concept of &quot;Soteria House.&quot; This will build tools for evaluating the
      performance of care device by a process evaluation describing and analyzing what activity
      involves the device, This research seeks to analyze the experimental device in the early
      stages of its implementation. The observation and analysis of the program period will adjust
      the management arrangements of the device. The data and conclusions from this research will
      identify the contributions and benefits of such a device and analyze the difficulties
      encountered in its implementation.
