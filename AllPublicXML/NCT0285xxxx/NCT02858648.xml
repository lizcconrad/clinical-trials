  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether a behavioral lifestyle intervention using
      mobile smart phone technology for self-monitoring can lead to greater improvements in
      diabetes outcomes.

      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention on weight,
      glycemic control, and vascular inflammatory marker outcomes. A total of 26 overweight or
      obese patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited from an underserved minority community
      health center in Houston, TX. They were randomly assigned into one of the three groups: 1)
      Behavior intervention with smart phone based self-monitoring, 2) Behavior intervention with
      paper diary based self-monitoring, and 3) Usual care group. Both Mobile and Paper groups
      received a total of 11 group sessions and 1 individual session in a 6-month intervention.
      Mobile group received an android-based smart phone with two applications loaded to help them
      record their diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose, while the paper group is
      using paper diaries for these recordings.
