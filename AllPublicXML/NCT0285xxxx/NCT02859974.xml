    <textblock>
      Paradoxical Vocal Fold Motion Disorder (PVFMD), otherwise known as vocal cord dysfunction
      (VCD) is a laryngeal breathing disorder that has several potential causes. In some
      individuals, exertion is the predominant trigger. PVFMD can present like an asthma attack,
      but asthma medication is ineffective in treating it. The effects of untreated PVFMD can be
      devastating, leading to harmful, invasive, and ineffective treatments over a period of years.
      Numerous anecdotal reports indicate that several behavioral techniques, may be surprisingly
      effective and even curative. However, data are lacking. The form of respiratory retraining
      technique tested in the current study educates people with PVFMD about breathing and teaches
      them a number of breathing exercises specially designed to restore normal breathing patterns.

      This case series study will use a dyspnea perception questionnaire, patient daily logs, and
      physiological measurements of heart rate and breathing to examine whether this form of
      therapy can improve exertion-induced PVFMD symptoms.

    <time_frame>Measured daily for 84 days</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in respiratory minute volume using Spirometry pre and post therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on day 1, 21, 42 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>This measure was chosen to quantify the volume (frequency and depth) of exchanged air to determine to what extent individuals who undergo the tested respiratory retraining technique change the rate and depth of respiration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ETCO2 using Capnometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on day 1, 21, 42 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>ETCO2, or blood gas end tidal carbon dioxide, is considered a surrogate measure for arterial CO2 levels (Bowler, 1998; Gardner 1996). Increased levels of ETCO2 have been suggested to improve symptoms of hyperventilation caused by over-breathing (Courtney, 2008; Stark &amp; Stark, 2002).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate using pulse oximetry and during home practice measured by the participants taking their pulse</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on day 1, 21, and then measured three times daily till day 84</time_frame>
    <description>A reduction in heart rate from pre-therapy to post-therapy may suggest decreased levels of arousal, which may also correlate with respiratory minute volume.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Control Pause (CP) or Steps</measure>
    <time_frame>measured on day 1 and 21 and then measured three times daily till day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CP/steps is a rough measure to determine the internal validity of the respiratory retraining program in the cohort with PVFMD. CP/Steps measures are proposed to be correlated with ETCO2 measurements (Stark &amp; Stark, 2002, p.77; p. 113).</description>

    <description>Patients serve as their own controls. During a three week baseline, participants will complete the Dyspnea Index (DI), and have their heart rate, Resp. minute volume and ETCO2 on days 1 and 21 (or on the day treatment commences). Participants will complete a &quot;daily log&quot; reporting their daily symptoms. This will serve as the baseline &quot;pre&quot;phase.
Post 1 phase will include five individual therapy sessions teaching the respiratory retraining techniques over an estimated three week period.
Post2 phase will comprise of a six week home practice phase. There will be four measuring points per participant: pre1/pre2 measurements on day 1 and 21 (or on the day therapy begins), post1 upon completing five therapy sessions and post 2 upon completion of the home practice phase.</description>
