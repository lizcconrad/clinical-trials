  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the majority of studies that have evaluated the efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA)
      in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions in cirrhotic patients and compared
      its efficacy with that of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for local recurrence and
      survival have been retrospective. There have been no prospective randomized studies comparing
      percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) with RFA for ablated tumour volume, the response after
      one session, local recurrence rates in the first year, complication rates and survival at 3
      and 5 years for HCC lesions &gt; 2 cm in patients with Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis. The
      hypothesis the investigators wish to explore is that though the 2 methods are equivalent for
      lesions ≤ 2 cm, MWA could show better efficacy with a similar risk for lesions &gt; 2 cm and for
      lesions close to vessels ≥ 3 mm in diameter, as shown in retrospective studies.
