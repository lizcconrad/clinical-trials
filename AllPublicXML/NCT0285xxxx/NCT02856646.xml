      The purpose of this study is to gather data on patients diagnosed with and treated for
      classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL). It aims to closely observe how treatment for cHL is
      rendered, as well as assess the outcome of those treatment options and their impact on
      quality of life. Additional analyses will also attempt to identify prognostic or predictive
      biomarkers

             therapy at time of enrollment

          -  Patients must be within ± 2 weeks of Day 1 of the first cycle of any line of therapy
             to enroll; a cycle is practice-defined for chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or

          -  Any Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or Karnofsky performance status (PS)

          -  Patients must have available medical records for the date of diagnosis of cHL and
             available medical records documenting any prior treatment and treatment dates for the
             Hodgkin lymphoma, including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and other anti-cancer
             therapy received.

          -  Patients must consent for use of their FFPE tissue blocks for exploratory analyses

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on supportive care only and not receiving anti-cancer therapy are not
             eligible to enroll

          -  Patients with unknown date of diagnosis of cHL

          -  Patients whose prior cHL therapy, and dates of therapy (eg, surgery, radiation, or
             drug therapy) are unknown

          -  Any other non-HL (non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) active malignancy for which the patient is
             receiving treatment

          -  Patients participating in a clinical study that does not allow enrollment into a
             non-interventional study

          -  Patients enrolled who go on to receive only supportive, palliative, hospice, or
             end-of-life care remain on study and should not be discontinued from follow-up.
