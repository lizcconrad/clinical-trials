      Prospective, open-label, within-subject, multi-center pilot study of Lymphoseek in the
      detection of lymph nodes in subjects with known squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. All
      subjects will receive a single dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 0.5 millicurie
      (mCi) (18.5 MBq) 99mTc.
