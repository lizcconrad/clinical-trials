  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMOF is a large double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial aiming to compare
      the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks corrected age in premature infants &lt;
      29 weeks and / or with birth weight &lt; 1000 g receiving either SMOFlipid® or Medialipide® 20%.
      This study will offer new information for optimizing the management of preterms requiring
      parenteral nutrition. The investigators hypothesis is that the composition of SMOFlipid may
      decrease lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in preterms, resulting in a lower incidence
      of BPD.

    <description>SMOFlipid® (FreseniusKabi France, Sèvres, France). It is a 3rd generation LE containing a physical mixture of soybean oil (30%), MCT (30%), olive oil (25%) and fish oil (15%). Its ratio omega6/omega 3 is 2,5/1. SMOF will be initiated within the 1st day of life of neonates and will be prescribed daily by the attending physician following these guidelines: initiation rate: 1 g/kg/day; daily increase: 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day ; target: 3 to 4 g/kg/day.
All included preterms will receive nutritional support according to a single protocol based on the ESPGHAN recommendations: parenteral glucose and amino acids (Primene 10%, Clintec Parenteral, Maurepas, France) soon after birth (in their 1st day of life). Initiation rate of parenteral glucose and amino acids will be 6 to 8 g/kg/day and 2 g/kg/day respectively. The daily increase of parenteral glucose and amino acids will be 1 to 2 g/kg/day and 0.5 g/kg/day respectively, for a target rate of 14 to 17 g/kg/day and 3.5 g/kg/day respectively.</description>
