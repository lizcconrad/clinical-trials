      The purpose of the study is to estimate the incidence of below-knee lower extremity
      amputation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participants newly exposed to sodium-glucose
      co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)/ non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemic agents (AHA) overall and
      in the subgroup with high cardiovascular (CV) risk and to compare the hazards of below-knee
      lower extremity amputation in canagliflozin new users versus non-SGLT2i AHA new users.

        exposure of interest between April 1, 2013 and January 31, 2015 and at least 1 condition
        occurrence of 'Type II diabetes' any time before or on index and no condition occurrences
