    <textblock>
      Currently the Toulouse University Hospital, the organization of transfusion care for patients
      requiring regular transfusions is based on reading the biological results received by fax
      before confirming or disproving a planned hospitalization or program a new hospital if
      needed.

      Remote transmission of laboratory results, replacing fax communication might facilitate the
      coordination of care that results from these laboratory results and provide a better respect
      of the Plan Custom Care Transfusion (PPST).

      The investigators offer organization of transfusion supportive care for patients with
      conditions requiring biological monitoring using the techniques of information and
      communication telemedicine.

      Primary objective

      - Assess the feasibility of setting up an upload procedure biological results in the
      treatment of transfusion supportive care.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Assess the evolution of the quality of life of patients during the treatment

        -  Assess changes in patient satisfaction over the support

        -  Assess the evolution of the satisfaction of the medical team at home and at Toulouse
           University Hospital

        -  Describe the programming time (hospitalization, consultations)

        -  Estimate the loss of biological results

        -  Assessment of the descriptive use of hospitalization, consultation and biological
           examinations in both groups. This remedy shall be valued in Euros thanks to GHS rates
           for hospitalizations, NGAP rates for consultations and biology of nomenclature (NABM)
           for biological tests.

      Setting up a Custom Care Plan for patients with conditions requiring a transfusion followed ,
      which in its development provides a transfusion Care Custom Program .

      The establishment of an electronic transmission enables the regulation of all
      hospitalizations throughout the patient care pathway and reinforces the link city / hospital
      through the receipt of laboratory results and issuing information to the partners of the care
      network patient. The PPST will be transmitted by secure messaging.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of transfusion episodes where PPST is respected. The
      proportion of patients whose care meets the PPST for 3 successive transfusion episodes will
      also be estimated.

      The secondary endpoints are:

        -  The Patient satisfaction questionnaires (relative to the consideration of the results,
           the management procedures) in 3 successive transfusions.

        -  The Quality of life of the patient assessed by questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30 and EQ5D) at
           baseline and after 3 successive transfusion episodes.

        -  The Satisfaction surveys of the medical team at home and the service effector
           transfusion at baseline and after 3 successive transfusion episodes.

        -  The Response time for a hospitalization or consultation program on the study period.

        -  The Number of lost biological results.

        -  Evaluation of the descriptive use of hospitalization, consultation, biology.
