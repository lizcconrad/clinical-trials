  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of JNJ-48816274 in healthy participants after administration of single and
      repeated doses, and to evaluate its potential effectiveness for treating insomnia.
