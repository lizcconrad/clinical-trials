    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to provide clinicians with a brief, patient self-administer
      instrument yielding a single composite score that reliably correlates with objective findings
      on standardized neurocognitive assessment for concussion.

      This Phase 2 study, Concussion in Motor Vehicle Accidents - The Concussion Identification
      Index (CIDI), focuses on the psychometric properties of the relationship between acute injury
      events, i.e. head impact, loss of consciousness (LOC), and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA),
      commonly reported post-crash signs and symptoms, and neurocognitive outcomes.

      Cohort 1 is the validation group and will be used to confirm the optimal cut-off score of the
      Concussion Identification Index (CIDI) with the score on the ImPACT.

      Cohort 2 is the cross-validation group.

    <description>The questionnaire is divided into two parts:
The Injury Characteristics section: asks for a yes-no indication of whether 5 concussion-associated events/injuries occurred: striking the head, whiplash, loss of consciousness, being dazed, or having post-traumatic amnesia; and, whether or not the patient had already been given a diagnosis of concussion.
The Concussive Symptoms section asks the patient to rate on a scale of 0-3 the presence and severity of 10 cognitive and emotional symptoms associated with a post-concussion diagnosis.
The total numeric value for each patient is reported as an indexed score.</description>
