    <textblock>
      The size of the infarct is particularly important prognostic marker. It is clearly
      established that the extent of the infarct is not only correlated to mortality, but also
      long-term adverse events. The evaluation of the infarct size at the acute phase of the
      disease is therefore an essential clinical tool to adapt the immediate treatment and
      follow-up of patients. It is therefore crucial to have techniques that are effective,
      precise, reproducible, and easily performed during the acute phase to quantify the size of
      the infarct following angioplasty. Myocardial scintigraphy and cardiac MRI have been the
      standard examinations for the evaluation of infarct size. However, these exams are difficult
      to perform during the acute phase of the infarct owing to difficulties in monitoring unstable
      patients and the limited availability of the apparatus. It is for this reason that the
      investigators would like to investigate the rotational angiography (RA), which is comparable
      to a scanner in its mode of action but does not require transfer of patients as performed
      using the same apparatus that used for diagnostic coronarography and therapeutic angioplasty.
      RA is a radiological technique that uses the system employed for coronagraph, and consists
      rotating the fixed C-Arm around the patient and acquisition of a series of images that are
      then reconstituted. The investigators propose to evaluate the size of the infarct using RA in
      comparison with cardiac MRI (standard examination) performed as soon as possible after RA and
      the investigators hope to demonstrated that RA allows the measurement of an infarct as
      precisely as cardiac MRI.
