  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-doses of Vitamin D (VD) may be used as targeted therapy against breast cancer. The
      investigators will assess the effect of high dose VD on the following biomarkers in the
      breast cancer cells: VDR, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu), androgen receptor (AR), as well as epidermal growth
      factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and Ki-67, as markers of proliferation, and E-cadherin, a marker of
      invasion and metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label, non-randomized study. In phase I, a fixed weekly course of
      oral high-dose Vitamin D (VD) is planned for either 3, 4 or 5 weeks; patients will be
      sequentially enrolled into 3 groups (A, B or C respectively) in a manner such that no more
      than two patients may have treatment-limiting toxicities (TLTs).

      After the group with the optimal duration of VD therapy to achieve a &quot;favorable response&quot; is
      determined, phase II will begin enrollment.

      Patients must be scheduled to have surgery performed within 2- weeks of the last dose of VD.

    <time_frame>Up to 7 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of subjects achieving a &quot;favorable treatment response&quot; to protocol therapy given within the optimal duration determined in Phase 1. The effect of VD therapy will be assessed in terms of change in expression of VDR, ER, PR, HER2/neu, AR, Ki-67, E-cadherin and EGFR comparing surgical specimen (post-VD treatment) and baseline biopsy specimen (pre-VD treatment). The effect of VD will be described as increased expression, decreased expression or no change in expression of each marker/receptor measured.
The expression of nuclear receptors/proteins (VDR, Ki-67, ER, PR, AR,) will be scored based on the percentage of positively staining nuclei as follows:
0 (Negative) if &lt;1%
+1 (Weak) if &gt;1-10%
+2 (Moderate) if &gt;10-50%
+3 (Strong) if &gt;50%
A decrease in the expression of Ki-67 by ≥+1 after treatment is considered a &quot;favorable treatment response&quot;.</description>

    <description>The determination of the optimal duration of once-weekly protocol therapy, 3, 4 or 5 weeks, as preoperative treatment to achieve a &quot;favorable&quot; treatment response in subjects with the study disease. The effect of VD therapy will be assessed in terms of change in expression of VDR, ER, PR, HER2/neu, AR, Ki-67, E-cadherin and EGFR comparing surgical specimen (post-VD treatment) and baseline biopsy specimen (pre-VD treatment).
