  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric analgesia is a requirement of our times. The different applicable methods vary in
      effectiveness. The essential part is represented by epidural analgesia which remains one of
      the most effective methods. It is important to know other methods to respond to all requests.
      The applications of these methods, patient satisfaction and psychic experience, complications
      or incidents remain poorly or partially evaluated in France.

      The main objective is to describe the different techniques of anesthesia/analgesia actually
      used in France for the management of pain during vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections on
      a representative sample of all maternity hospitals at a given time(7 days per maternity
      hospital, 63 maternity hospitals (levels I,II,III), so about 2500 births).

      Secondary objectives will be multiple :

        -  Describe the results of analgesic methods on the physical pain of patients during labor
           by a global visual analog scale

        -  Describe the feeling of pregnant women relative to the different anesthesic and
           analgesic techniques, by an analysis of the questionnaire responses

        -  Describe the frequency of adverse events of birth
