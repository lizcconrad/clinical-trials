  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this diagnostic study, the aim is at evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) to detect allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with cystic
      fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is not rare in the context of cystic fibrosis
      (CF), with a prevalence reported between 2% to 16%. This complication is a diagnostic
      challenge for clinicians, since it is related with poorer outcome and higher worsening of the
      disease. Therefore, the treatment relies on corticosteroid and antifungal therapy and thus,
      it is important to detect with good sensitivity because CF patients are usually treated with
      antibiotics. However, the treatment is often difficult to be initiated because of potential
      secondary side effects related to diabetes mellitus, growth impairment, bone mineralisation
      or immunodepression. Therefore, there is a need for specific diagnostic tool to discriminate
      ABPA amongst other polymicrobial infection.

      Lung MRI is a radiation-free imaging modality which offers the potential to combine several
      contrasts, in order to enable in vivo tissue characterization non-invasively. Investigators
      hypothesize that characterization of mucoid impaction using lung MR T1-weighted and
      T2-weighted contrasts may be a specific tool to diagnose ABPA in CF non invasively.
