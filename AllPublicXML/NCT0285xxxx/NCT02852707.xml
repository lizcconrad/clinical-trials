  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the performance and 3-dimensional shoulder kinematics between sides in
      unilateral overhead-throwers (volleyball attackers), bilateral overhead athletes (swimmers)
      and non-athletes during two physical performance measures of the upper extremity, one in an
      open kinetic chain position (unilateral seated shot put test) and the other in a closed
      kinetic chain position (upper quarter Y balance test)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3-dimensional shoulder kinematics (e.g., scapular angular position/displacement) at key
      events of each test will be described and compared across sides and groups. For the
      unilateral seated shot put test, the events are based on humeral motion: a) initiation of
      humeral motion, b) maximal humeral flexion, c) end of humeral motion. For the upper quarter Y
      balance test the events are the a) initiation of free hand motion on &quot;GO&quot;, b) maximal reach
      on the medial direction, c) maximal reach on superolateral direction, and d) maximal reach on
      the inferolateral direction (kinematics measured on the stance upper extremity). The best of
      3 maximal-effort trials on each side will be used for analysis. Warm-up exercises and two
      submaximal practice trials will be performed for preparation for maximal efforts and
      familiarization with the tests. A rest period of at least one minute between trials will be
      given to guarantee good physiological conditions to maximally perform. Further resting time
      will be allowed, if necessary, upon request of the participant.

    <description>The unilateral seated shot put test consists of pushing (not throwing) at shoulder height a ~3kg medicine ball as far and forward as possible while keeping the axial skeleton in contact with a wall, knees bent at a right angle, feet flat on the floor, and the non-testing arm resting on the lap.</description>

    <description>The upper quarter Y balance test is performed through the assistance of a testing device (Y-Balance Test Kit), with the subject stabilizing his/her body weight with the upper extremity being tested while performing maximal reaching efforts with the free hand in three directions: medial, superolateral, and inferolateral.</description>
