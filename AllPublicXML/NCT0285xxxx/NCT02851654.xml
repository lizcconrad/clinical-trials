  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a benign situation however its impact on patient's quality of live and on
      health system is not trivial. One problem is the lack of correlation between patient's
      symptoms and physical sign observed on slit lamp examination. Eye blinking is a parameter of
      increased interest in this pathology particularly its frequency. To date no treatment of dry
      eye syndrome has a proven impact on eye blinking frequency. However recording of blinks has
      mostly been performed on short duration (3 to 5 minutes) and the distribution of intervals
      between 2 blinks is not gaussian but exponential. In this study, it is proposed to use modern
      eye-movement recorder to measure the blink frequency on longer duration (12 minutes) while
      reading on a screen computer and during a face-to-face interview before and after treatment
      of meibomian gland dysfunction responsible of moderate to severe dry eye syndrome.
