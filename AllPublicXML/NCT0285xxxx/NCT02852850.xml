    <textblock>
      Molecular imaging with infliximab antibody with FITC has the potential to predict therapeutic
      responses to infliximab antibody and can be used for personalized medicine in ulcerative
      colitis.

    <description>Endoscopic examination with the fluorescent antibody (IFX-FITC) was performed in patients with active ulcerative colitis before infliximab therapy was initiated. Labeled infliximab was applied topically via a standard spray catheter onto the most inflamed region of the bowel during colonoscopy, followed by CLE. In vivo imaging of inflamed areas of the intestinal mucosa showed a specific fluorescence signal of mTNF+ cells after topical application of labeled adalimumab. These specific fluorescence signals were recorded.</description>
