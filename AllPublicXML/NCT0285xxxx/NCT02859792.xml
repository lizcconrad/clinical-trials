    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two steps:

        1. Determination of the Minimal Effective Dose (MED) among the four doses of the panel

        2. Estimation of the probability of response associated to the MED.

      Each step has a main objective:

      Step 1 Objective: To determine a daily dose of Riluzole that improves spasticity in patients
      with chronic SCI

      Step 2 Objective: To demonstrate, in a phase 2b trial, the efficacy of Riluzole to improve
      spasticity vs placebo, in patients with chronic SCI.

             ii. Complete and incomplete ( AIS A,B,C,D)

             iii. With Spasticity (5&gt;MAS&gt;1 on at least adductor muscles and/or triceps surae
             muscles and NRS ≥ 4)

          2. Male or Female

          3. Aged 18 to 65 years at the time of screening

          4. Judged by site investigator to be able to comply with evaluations at baseline and
             throughout the study

          5. Last injection of BTX-A in striated muscle more than 3 months ago and patients must
             have returned to their level of spasticity before BTX-A injection

          6. Last intrathecal (IT) injection of baclofen or per os administration of any
             myorelaxant should be more than 14 days ago (Step 1)

          7. The dose of myorelaxant or Baclofen should be stable for ≥ 30 days prior to screening
             and kept at stable daily dose until the end of the protocol (Step 2).

          8. Stable on all other chronic medications for ≥ 30 days prior to screening, including
             analgesics

          9. Stable on rehabilitation (methods and frequency) for ≥ 15 days prior to screening

         10. Written informed consent provided by subject

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Spinal cord injury of less than 12 months,

          2. Associated Brain lesion that might be the cause of spasticity,
