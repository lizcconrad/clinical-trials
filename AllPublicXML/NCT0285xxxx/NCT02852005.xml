      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the
      AIDSVAX B/E vaccine and the MVA/HIV62B vaccine in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults who
      previously received MVA/HIV62B in DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA vaccine regimens in the HVTN 205 study.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the AIDSVAX B/E
      vaccine and the MVA/HIV62B vaccine in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults who previously
      received MVA/HIV62B in DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA vaccine regimens as part of the HVTN 205 study.

      Participants in this study will be assigned to one of five groups based on their previous
      vaccine regimen received in HVTN 205. Depending on their group, participants will receive the
      MVA/HIV62B vaccine, the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine, or both the MVA/HIV62B vaccine and the AIDSVAX
      B/E vaccine. All participants will receive their assigned vaccines at study entry (Day 0) and
      Month 4. Participants will attend several study visits through Month 10. Visits will include
      physical examinations, blood collection, HIV testing and risk reduction counseling, and
      interviews and questionnaires. Optional procedures at some visits include collection of
      rectal fluids, cervical fluids, and semen. Study staff will contact participants 2 years
      following the initial study injection for follow-up health monitoring.

             defined in the most recent National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)
             Expert Panel report).

               -  Exclude a volunteer who:

               -  Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2 agonist) daily, or

               -  Uses moderate/high dose inhaled corticosteroids, or

               -  In the past year has either of the following:

               -  Greater than 1 exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral/parenteral
                  corticosteroids;

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. (Not
             excluded: history of isolated gestational diabetes.)

          -  Thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if volunteer
             has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time within the
             past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
