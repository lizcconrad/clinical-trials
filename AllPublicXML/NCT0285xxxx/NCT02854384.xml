  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work is intended to assess the effect of -30 minutes- exposure to mobile-phone on the
      functions of the central nervous system (CNS) in epileptic patients.

      This work shows the effect of the 30 minutes mobile waves' radiation over the normal person
      brain activity (EEG) and cognition (P300) together with the effect over the unstable brain of
      the epileptic patients. Exposure to mobile-phone radiation has been reported to increase the
      spectral power of electroencephalograms (EEGs), particularly in the alpha band, during both
      the waking and sleeping states. The tendency toward electrical instability of the neural
      networks of epileptic patients suggests that these individuals may be especially sensitive to
      electromagnetic fields espcially mobile-phone radiation (MPR). The short-term effects of
      exposure to electromagnetic (EM) fields on a number of cognitive variables such as memory,
      attention and speed of decision-making could be assedsed by P 300 latency and amplitude.

    <description>The P300 Test: Neurophysiological Test. P300 wave was defined as the most positive point of the average waveform to the target tones after 250 msec and before 600 msec. For each subject P300 latency and P300 amplitude were obtained to detect any significant abnormality</description>
