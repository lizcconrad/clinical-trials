  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL) is a well-defined low-grade B-cell lymphoma,considered
      as a rare neoplasm accounting for about 2% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and
      represents for most cases of otherwise unclassifiable chronic lymphoid B-cell cluster of
      differentiation antigen 5 (CD5)-lymphoproliferative disorders. SMZL is characterized by an
      almost exclusive involvement of the spleen and bone marrow and in about 25% of cases the
      disease pursues an aggressive course and most patients die of lymphoma progression within 3-4
      years.

      Retrospective studies have indicated that purine analogous achieved very high response rates
      in both naïve and pre-treated patients. Moreover, the introduction of the anti-cluster of
      differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) humanized antibody rituximab, either used alone or in
      combination with chemotherapy has been reported to be very effective in producing a rapid
      clearance of neoplastic cells.

      Prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase II study, designed to determine efficacy and
      safety of a Chemo-immunotherapy with the combination of bendamustine + rituximab in patients
      with splenic marginal zone lymphoma.

      Study Population: previously untreated (except for splenectomy and/or antiviral therapy for
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection) and symptomatic Splenic Marginal Zone patients.

      Objectives: evaluation of the efficacy and the safety of R-Bendamustine in symptomatic
      Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma patients.

      Primary Objective: efficacy of R-Bendamustine measured by Complete Response rate. Complete
      response rate defined as regression to normal size on CT of organomegaly (spleen, liver,
      lymph nodes); normalization of the blood counts and no evidence of circulating clonal cells,
      and no evidence or minor (≤ 5%) Bone Marrow (BM) infiltration detected by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC).
