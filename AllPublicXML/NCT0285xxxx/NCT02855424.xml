  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor cardiopulmonary endurance is observed in individuals with acute stroke, even in chronic.
      In addition, the poor fitness may obstacle activities of daily life, decrease activities of
      autonomic system, and increase risks of recurrent, therefore, the cardiopulmonary endurance
      training should be included into the early-stage rehabilitation program. The ergocycling
      training could improve cardiopulmonary endurance for individuals with stroke. Moreover, the
      low-intensity exercise training can increase the willingness, and it is safer than the
      moderate-intensity exercise training. However, it needs to be evaluated whether the
      low-intensity exercise training can bring sufficient benefits, compared to the
      moderate-intensity exercise training. Objectives of the study is to compare the exercise
      benefits between the low-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise training, and then these
      would offer optimal exercise prescription and considerations in clinical practice.

      After giving their signed consent, subjects would be randomly assigned into the control group
      (traditional rehabilitation), the low-intensity exercise group (traditional rehabilitation
      plus low-intensity exercise training), or the moderate-intensity exercise group (traditional
      rehabilitation plus the moderate-intensity exercise training). Frequency of the exercise
      training is 2-6 times/week, totally 20 times. In the symptom-limit exercise tolerance tests,
      subjects wear a gas-collecting mask and electrocardiogram, and pre-set graduated loading was
      offered by the bike. One therapists and one doctor would monitor the test. For resistance and
      time setting within each exercise training, it is customized by results of exercise tolerance
      tests in baseline and the allocation. Moreover, a therapist would stay with subject ,monitor
      the training, and measure the blood pressure before and after the training.
