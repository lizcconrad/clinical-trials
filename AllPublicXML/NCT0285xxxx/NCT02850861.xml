      In condylar fracture surgery, reduction is the most difficult step and the key factor which
      determined the postoperative outcome. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a new
      instrument, which the investigators call condylar redactor, to assist the surgeon to reduct
      the condylar segments effectively.

      In this prospective cohort study, it involved condylar fractures patients who were received
      surgical treatment from January 2014 to June 2016. Patients in the experimental group were
      treated with the condylar reductor, and patients in the control group were treated with the
      traditional surgical instruments. The primary outcome variable was reduction time and
      reduction rate. The continuity correction X2 and test student t test were used.
