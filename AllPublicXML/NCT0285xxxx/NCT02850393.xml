  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental-health conditions affect million people worldwide. The economic burden of mental
      illness is enormous and the economic health of both developing and developed nations will
      depend on controlling the staggering growth in costs from mental disorders.
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and frequent form of anxiety that
      affects approximately 2-3% of the population. OCD is characterized by anxiety, obsessions
      (persistent intrusive thoughts and images with highly distressing contents) and compulsions
      (repetitive activity), and severely impairs the lives of those affected. Despite their
      interest as effective and affordable care and rehabilitation, cognitive therapeutic profits
      too little from the increasing accumulation of knowledge in neuroscience, and neuroscientists
      pay too little attention to the challenges faced by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.
      To reduce this cultural gap, two teams specialized in the study and multimodal imaging of
      healthy participants and clinical patients with mental health disorders, the UMR-S
      INSERM-EPHE-UNICAEN U1077 unit led by Francis Eustache, and ISTS team (UMR-S 6301
      CNRS-CEA-UCBN) led by Sonia Dollfus, will joint their efforts to develop an integrated
      approach of the neural mechanisms at stake from basic neuroscience using state-of-art
      neuroimaging techniques, to novel and ground breaking psychological intervention. Both teams
      evolve at the brain imaging Cyceron center in Caen in connection with the Mental Health and
      Addictology Center, offering unique opportunities for such translational research. This
      project will capitalize on recent evidence showing that healthy participants can prevent
      unwanted images from entering consciousness using inhibitory control and memory suppression
      techniques, disrupting traces of the memories in sensory areas of the brain, and weakening
      their vividness and later reentrance. OCD is characterized by aberrant and excessive visual
      intrusions, usually extremely vivid, detailed, and unpleasant. These distressing images are
      particularly uncontrollable and may frequently initiate compulsive rituals. In a first phase
      of this proposal will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to develop a
      neurobiological model of the cognitive computations achieved by inhibition network to
      suppress memory. To achieve this goal we will develop an attentional model of healthy memory
      inhibition functioning, simulating the deployment of attentional resources and the different
      mental processes at stake during suppression. Using sophisticated analyzing tools of fMRI
      data, we will use this model to decode and infer the representational content of the brain
      inhibition network, and further refine the connectivity pathways which underlie such control.
      The lack of a strong neurobiological model prevents the development of therapies which would
      increase functionality of this network and optimize intervention aiming to disrupt mental
      intrusions and obsessions. In a second phase, we will assess whether memory suppression may
      be transferred and trained in OCD patients using images depicting their own obsessions, as a
      promising avenue to reduce their symptoms on the long run. In addition, fMRI and other brain
      structural acquisitions will be collected before and after cognitive training to memory
      suppression, offering a unique opportunity to observe the online dysfunction of intrusion
      control in OCD patients and to identify neurobiological markers predictive of training
      outcome and network reconfiguration with training. A fundamental goal of motivated forgetting
      involves not only to exclude unwelcome content from consciousness but also to reduce their
      later emotional impact by doing so. In parallel of these two main phases, we will thus also
      measure physiological markers of autonomic nervous system activity changes in response to
      suppressed images to better identify the consequences of memory suppression on emotional
      states, anxiety, and mental health in general.
