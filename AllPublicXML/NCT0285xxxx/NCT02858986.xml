      Introduction: Three-dimensional key-hole surgery ('laparoscopic') systems are proven to
      reduce the time required to complete tasks in laboratory settings. This benefit derives from
      the addition of binocular depth perception cues when compared to two-dimensional (2D)
      systems. This year a '4K' laparoscopic system has become commercially available, so-named as
      it provides a high resolution 2D image with four times the number of pixels of 2D full high
      definition. The improved visualisation is likely to provide additional non-binocular depth
      cues. It is currently unclear to what degree improving the resolution of 2D systems can
      compensate for binocular depth cues.

      Aim: To determine whether the binocular vision provided by 3D laparoscopic systems provides
      benefits in simulated tasks when compared to the monocular vision provided by high-resolution
      4K systems.

      Methods: Two experiments will be performed: 1) A laboratory assessment of 3D versus 4K
      laparoscopic systems against industry optical standards, 2) A study to assess the benefits to
      novices and expert surgeons of using 3D and 4K laparoscopic systems during laparoscopic
      simulator tasks. The primary outcome measure is number of errors during laparoscopic
      simulator tasks. The secondary outcome measures include: objective and subjective measures of
      picture quality, task completion time, side effects (such as eye discomfort) and cognitive
      workload during laparoscopic simulator tasks

      Impact: This study is a unique, first-of-its-kind investigation into two new surgical
      technologies, and is the first study to involve a 4K system. The uptake of three-dimensional
      systems has been curbed by financial cost and the limitations of early 3D technologies. This
      study aims to determine which system may be the safest, quickest and most cost- effective, in
      order to guide future investment and technological development towards either 3D or 2D
      systems. In addition, these systems may also aid in the learning curve of trainee surgeons.
