  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration (WBV) acutely improves quadriceps strength, and may improve long-term
      outcomes in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, it is
      unclear if WBV influences athletic tasks such as running. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the influence of WBV on running biomechanics in individuals with ACLR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have deficits in quadriceps
      muscles function that influences walking and running biomechanics. In the long term,
      alterations in walking and running contribute to physical disability and the development of
      knee osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, rehabilitation for the quadriceps muscles is often
      ineffective, and novel strategies to improve rehabilitation efforts are needed. Whole body
      vibration (WBV) acutely improves quadriceps strength, and may improve long-term outcomes in
      individuals with ACLR. However, it is unclear if WBV influences athletic tasks such as
      running.

      Specific Aim 1: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of WBV on running
      biomechanics in individuals with ACLR. The investigators hypothesize that WBV will improve
      running characteristics associated with knee osteoarthritis development.
