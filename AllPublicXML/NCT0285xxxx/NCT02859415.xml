  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Mithramycin is a new cancer drug. In another study, people with chest cancer took the drug 6
      hours a day for 7 straight days. Many of them had liver damage as a side effect. It was
      discovered that only people with certain genes got this side effect. Researchers want to test
      mithramycin in people who do not have those certain genes.

      &lt;TAB&gt;

      Objectives:

      To find the highest safe dose of mithramycin that can be given to people with chest cancer
      who have certain genes over 24 hours instead of spread out over a longer period of time. To
      see if mithramycin given as a 24-hour infusion shrinks tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who have chest cancer that is not shrinking with known therapies,
      and whose genes will limit the chance of liver damage from mithramycin

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Lung and heart function tests

      X-rays or scans of their tumor

      Liver ultrasound

      Tumor biopsy

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital overnight. A small plastic tube (catheter) will
      be inserted in the arm or chest. They will get mithramycin through the catheter over about 24
      hours.

      If they do not have bad side effects or their cancer does not worsen, they can repeat the
      treatment every 14 days.

      Participants will have multiple visits for each treatment cycle. These include repeats of
      certain screening tests.

      After stopping treatment, participants will have weekly visits until they recover from any
      side effects.

      Background:

      Increasing evidence indicates that activation of stem cell gene expression is a common
      mechanism by which environmental carcinogens mediate initiation and progression of thoracic
      malignancies. Similar mechanisms appear to contribute to extra-thoracic malignancies that
      metastasize to the chest. Utilization of pharmacologic agents, which target gene regulatory
      networks mediating stemness may be novel strategies for treatment of these neoplasms. Recent
      studies performed in the Thoracic Epigenetics Laboratory, TGIB/NCI, demonstrate that under
      exposure conditions potentially achievable in clinical settings, mithramycin diminishes stem
      cell gene expression and markedly inhibits growth of lung and esophageal cancer and malignant
      pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings add to other recent
      preclinical studies demonstrating impressive anti-tumor activity of mithramycin in epithelial
      malignancies and sarcomas that frequently metastasize to the thorax.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I component: To determine pharmacokinetics, toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) of mithramycin administered as a continuous 24hr infusion in patients with primary
           thoracic malignancies or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the
           chest.

        -  Phase II component: To determine objective response rates (CR+PR) of mithramycin
           administered as 24h intravenous infusions in patients with primary thoracic malignancies
           or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the chest.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary malignancies involving
           lungs, esophagus, thymus, pleura, chest wall or mediastinum, or extra-thoracic
           malignancies metastatic to the chest.

        -  Patients with germline SNPs in ABCB4 and ABCB11 that are associated with resistance to
           mithramycin-induced hepatotoxicity.

        -  Patients must have had or refused first-line standard therapy for their malignancies.

        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2, without
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;
           pCO2 less than 55 mm Hg and pO(2) greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.

        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000, an ANC equal to or
           greater than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate
           hepatic function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 times upper limits of normal.
           Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance greater than
           or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
           normal

      Design:

        -  Single arm Phase I dose escalation to define pharmacokinetics, toxicities and MTD.

        -  Patient cohorts will receive 24h infusions of mithramycin targeting total doses
           currently administered during 7 daily six hour infusions at 30-50mcg/kg.

        -  The 24 h infusions will be administered every 14 days (1 cycle). Four cycles will
           constitute one course of therapy.

        -  Pharmacokinetics and toxicity assessment to define MTD will be assessed during cycle 1
           of the first course of therapy.

        -  Due to uncertainties regarding potential cumulative toxicities, no intra-patient dose
           escalation will be allowed.

        -  Once MTD has been defined, patients will be enrolled into two cohorts (primary thoracic
           malignancy vs neoplasm of non-thoracic origin metastatic to the chest) to determine
           clinical response rates at the MTD, using a Simon Optimal Two Stage Design for Phase II
           Clinical Trials targeting an objective response rate (RECIST) of 30%.

        -  Following each course of therapy, patients will undergo restaging studies. Patients
           exhibiting objective response to therapy or stable disease by RECIST criteria will be
           offered an additional course of therapy.

        -  Patients exhibiting disease progression will be removed from study.

        -  Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and on day 4 of the first and if
           feasible second cycle of therapy for analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints. An
           additional biopsy may be requested in patient exhibiting objective responses following
           one course of therapy.
