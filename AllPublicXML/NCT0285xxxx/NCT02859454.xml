      Background:

      Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease caused by human papillomavirus.
      It can cause voice changes, airway compromise, pulmonary lesions, and cancers. PD-L1 is a
      protein on cells. It may be able to stop or decrease the immune system s response to viruses
      such as human papillomavirus. The drug Avelumab interferes with the activity of PD-L1.
      Researchers want to see if Avelumab treats RRP and study its side effects.

      Objective:

      To see if Avelumab works in treating RRP and is safe.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with aggressive RRP that has not responded to available treatments

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Previously collected tumor tissue

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Endoscopy procedure: A small tube with a camera is used to look in the nose, throat, larynx,

      and upper windpipe.

      Before starting treatment, participants will have:

      Endoscopy under anesthesia. A sample of papilloma will be taken.

      Voice handicap questionnaire

      CT scans

      Apheresis: An IV is inserted into an arm vein. White blood cells are separated

      from the rest of the blood and stored for research. The rest of the blood is returned

      through the same IV or one in the other arm.

      Participants will get the study drug by IV every 2 weeks for up to 12 weeks.

      Participants will repeat the previous tests throughout the study.

      If they respond to treatment, participants will be evaluated every 6 weeks (3 times), then
      every 12 weeks (3 times), then every 26 weeks (2 times) until their disease progresses.

      Participants will be evaluated 30 days after their last infusion. They will then be contacted
      annually.

      Background

        -  Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the
           aerodigestive tract that is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).

        -  RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive
           cancers.

        -  There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients require repeated interventional
           procedures for disease control.

        -  Study of a small number of RRP samples has shown PD-L1 expression by inflammatory
           mononuclear cells and by papilloma epithelial cells.

        -  This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of a PD-L1-targeted drug, avelumab, in
           the treatment of RRP. This drug was selected for its demonstrated activity in a variety
           of cancers and for its acceptable safety profile.

      Objective

      -Determine the complete response rate for avelumab in the treatment of patients with RRP.

      Eligibility

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.

        -  One of the following:

             -  A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater and a history of two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP.

             -  Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography
                scan.

             -  Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic
                interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy.

        -  Age 18 years or greater.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design

        -  Phase II clinical trial

        -  Simon optimal two-stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expansion to
           37 patients if one or more complete response(s) is/are observed in the initial patients.

                  protocol.

               -  No systemic therapy for RRP for four weeks prior to treatment.

               -  Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be
                  obtained within 14 days prior to first dose:

          -  WBC &gt; 2000/microL

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1500/microL

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 30 mL/min (measured
             or calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula below):

               -  Female CrCl: (140 - age in years) times weight in kg x 0.85/72 times serum
                  creatinine in mg/dL

             disease to theliver, AST and ALT levels less than or equal to 5 times ULN

          -  Total Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN

               -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) and all subjects of reproductive
                  potential must agree to use two methods of contraception: one highly effective
                  and one other effective method for at least 28 days prior, throughout the
                  avelumab treatment and for at least 60 days after avelumab treatment. Highly
                  Effective Methods are defined as: Intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth
                  control pills, injections, implants), tubal ligation and partner s vasectomy;
                  Other Effective Methods are defined as: latex condom, diaphragm and cervical cap.

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
                  protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive
                  can have decreased immune function and thus are likely less responsive to the
                  experimental treatment.

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, positive hepatitis B tests can be further
                  evaluated by confirmatory tests (Hep B DNA Quant, HBV Viral Load), and if
                  confirmatory tests are negative, the patient can be enrolled.

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C
                  antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of
                  antigen by Hep C RNA Quant, HCV Viral Load and be HCV RNA negative.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions including recent (within
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; liver, lung disease (with the
             exception of what is specified in inclusion criteria above), or laboratory
             abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigators, may increase the risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability
             of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study. Patients with mild to moderate asthma or
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) well controlled with oral or inhaled
             medications are permitted to enroll.

          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, are permitted to enroll.

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled, topical intranasal or intro-ocular
             steroids, and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Prior organ transplantation, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune
             checkpoint pathways.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative

             experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not
             postmenopausal. Post-menopause is defined as amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12
             consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are
             still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to
             prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible
             reason.

             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (greater than or equal
             to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring medication.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade &gt;1 NCI-CTCAE v 4.03; however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade less than or equal to 2 or other Grade less than or
             equal to 2 AEs not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are
             acceptable.

          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is
