    <textblock>
      To date, there is no treatment strategies for these patients according to American
      Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines and Baveno V consensus.
      Thus, we aim to compare the safety and efficacy of TIPS and conservative treatment
      (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or anticoagulation) in patients with PVT
      and CPTV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is about 16% in cirrhotic patients. Chronic PVT
      often cause two main undesirable consequences: symptomatic portal hypertension (such as
      variceal bleeding or ascites) and cavernous transformation of portal vein (CPTV). The former
      could lead to death and the latter increases the difficulty of the transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) treatment, which is considered as a main effective treatment for
      symptomatic portal hypertension. Some patients with CPTV and variceal bleeding only have to
      receive conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic therapy and/or
      anticoagulation). With advances in technology, modified TIPS procedure could significantly
      improve the operation success rate of patients with CPTV. To date, the difference in safety
      and efficacy between TIPS and conservative treatment (non-selective beta blockers, endoscopic
      therapy and/or anticoagulation) in patients with PVT and CPTV is still unclear.

    <description>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS) is an artificial channel within the liver that establishes communication between the inflow portal vein and the outflow hepatic vein. It is used to treat portal hypertension.TIPS was performed in a conventional fashion or in combination of percutaneous transhepatic or transsplenic approach (also called p-TIPS or modified TIPS). Oral warfarin was used for six months to one year prescribed at dosages to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of up to two times the upper limit of normal for the prevention of shunt dysfunction.</description>
