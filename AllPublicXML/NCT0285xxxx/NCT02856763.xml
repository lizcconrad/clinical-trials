      To identify predictive factors of adalimumab (anti TNF) response in patients with luminal
      Crohn's disease complicated by intra-abdominal and/or pelvic abscess after complete
      resolution of infection.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter prospective observational cohort.

      Initial management of sepsis and abscess (Before anti-TNF therapy initiation) i. Antibiotics.
      ii. Percutaneous drainage will be performed every time when possible iii. Surgical drainage
      will be performed if percutaneous drainage is not accessible or fails iv.

      Concomitant medications :

        -  Steroids will be rapidly tapered and stopped.

        -  Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurtine, 5-ASA derivatives and methotrexate will be maintained
           at a stable dose.

        -  If not present at inclusion, immunosuppressors could be introduced at the discretion of
           investigator

        -  Antibiotics could be used if needed for infections not related to intra-abdominal
           abscess recurrence and Crohn's disease. v.

      Supportive care including artificial nutrition will be started if necessary.

      2. Anti-TNF therapy:

      - The anti-TNF agent will be adalimumab, administered as subcutaneous injection of 160 mg at
      W0, 80 mg at W2, followed by 40 mg every 2 weeks.

        Patients presenting a luminal Crohn's disease complicated by an intra abdominal and/or
        pelvic abscess meeting the inclusion criteria and followed or addressed in one of the
        participating centers will be enrolled in the pre-inclusion phase of the study consisting
        in abscess drainage and antibiotic therapy as recommended by local and European guidelines.

        - After the initial pre-inclusion phase of the study, if there is a complete resolution of
        sepsis and abscess confirmed by MRE, patients for whom the treating physician decides to
        introduce adalimumab according to local and European Guidelines will be included in the
        anti-TNF treatment phase.
