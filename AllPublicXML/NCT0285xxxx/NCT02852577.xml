      The purpose of this study was to determine whether clonazepam and paroxetine are effective in
      the treatment of panic disorder. Efficacy was evaluated in short-term, long-term and
      post-treatment.

      The current study consisted of three steps. The first step was a naturalistic, prospective,
      randomized, open clinical trial with clonazepam and paroxetine. Subjects received either
      flexible dose clonazepam (0.5 - 2 mg/day) or paroxetine (10 - 40 mg/day), in monotherapy for
      eight weeks. In the second step, those who responded to monotherapy in the short-term study
      continued with the same drug and dose. Partial responders or non-responders were invited to
      receive combined pharmacological treatment with clonazepam and paroxetine. Patients received
      the maximum tolerated doses of clonazepam and paroxetine. The doses were flexible, ranging
      from 0.5 to 2 mg/day for clonazepam and from 10 to 40 mg/day of paroxetine. All patients were
      treated for 34 months in the second step. Patients who completed the second step and were in
      remission were included in the third step. For a period of four months all medications were
      tapered off. These patients were followed for 6 years with evaluations once a year. Those who
      relapsed were treated on a naturalistic basis, with drugs or psychotherapy.

      This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles established by the
      Declaration of Helsinki and the Brazilian National Ethics Committee (Conselho Nacional de
      Ética em Pesquisa - CONEP) guidelines. The local Ethics Committee approved the study
      protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
