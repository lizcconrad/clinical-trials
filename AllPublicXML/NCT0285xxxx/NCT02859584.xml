  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high frequency of adrenal dysfunction (AD) has been reported in severe acute hepatitis
      (SAH) using the dosage of serum total cortisol (STC). Because 90% of circulating serum
      cortisol is bound to proteins that are altered in SAH, we aimed to investigate the effect of
      decreased cortisol-binding proteins on STC, serum free cortisol (SFC) and salivary cortisol
      (SalivCort) in SAH.

      Baseline (T0) and cosyntropin-stimulated (T60) STC, SFC and SalivCort concentrations were
      measured

      We prospectively and consecutively enrolled 75 patients suffering from a SAH (n=44) or a NSAH
      (n=31). Inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18 and 75 years with an acute hepatitis
      defined by an abrupt rise in serum aminotransaminase levels during the 15 previous days (AST
      or ALT greater than 500 IU/L or greater than 10 times the upper normal value); the acute
      hepatitis was considered as severe if the prothrombin index was lower than 50% and as
      non-severe if it was greater than 50%. We excluded patients with the following conditions: a
      history of hypothalamic-pituitary or adrenal disease, corticosteroids treatment within the
      previous 6 months, ketoconazole intake, oral candida infection, any visible bleeding in the
      oral cavity, liver transplanted patients, acute alcoholic hepatitis and night workers.
      Twenty-nine healthy controls (HC) were thereafter enrolled and similarly distributed with the
      SAH group on age, sex and estrogen pill intake, estrogen therapy being the most common cause
      for changes in CBG levels. HC were without any known illnesses and were not receiving any
      medications. To evaluate the range of the SFC concentrations, eight patients with a known AD
      caused by impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (n=5) and adrenal gland (n=3) and
      followed at the Endocrinology Department of Besancon were also studied.

      STC, SFC and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured blindly before (T0 between 8am
      and 9am) and 60 minutes after (T60) an intravenous injection of 250 µg tetracosactrin
      (synacthenÒ, Sigma-Tau laboratory, France). Serum CBG, albumin and ACTH were also measured
