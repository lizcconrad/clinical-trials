  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The regulation of the cardiovascular respiratory system after changing environmental
      conditions or changes in work rates are essential for cognitive as well as physical
      functioning. For decades, it is known that high level of headward acceleration (+Gz) impairs
      cardiovascular function that may cause loss of consciousness. Some &quot;anti-g&quot; maneuvers, such
      as muscle contraction of the lower extremities and buttocks or intermittent exhalation on
      exertion (i.e., exhalation against a closed airway) have been proved to increase tolerance to
      high +Gz.

      Main objective of this experiment is to investigate the effects of anti-g maneuvers on
      cardiovascular and respiratory tolerance to the push-pull-effect.

      Cardiovascular and respiratory functions will be evaluated with the following parameters:
      heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide
      output, ventilation, breathing frequency, body core temperature.

      Electromyography (EMG) will not be a judgment criteria but will be used to check the quality
      of 'muscle contraction' anti-g maneuver.

      The main hypothesis is that anti-g maneuvers will increase cardiovascular and respiratory
      tolerance to the push-pull effect, especially when they are combined.

    <description>Before the first parabola, pulmonary function will be evaluated. Then during each weightlessness period the subject will be instructed either to stay at rest (control condition) or to perform anti-g maneuvers (4 times each): intermittent exhalation on exertion, lower limbs and abdomen muscular contraction, combined maneuver ('intermittent exhalation on exertion' + 'muscle contraction'). Before, the exhalation on exertion, the subject will close the airway after the mouthpiece by pushing on a button actuating a pneumatic valve.
Each subject will be tested during 15 parabola where the anti-g maneuvers will be performed in randomized order. After the 15th parabola, pulmonary function will be again evaluated.</description>
