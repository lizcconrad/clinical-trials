  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adductor canal block (ACB), Saphenous nerve block, which is a block of a purely sensory nerve
      which shares in nerve supply of knee joint has a hypothetical advantage of better pain
      management with less motor affection. Also, it has a clear anatomical landmark that will
      increase the success rate (femoral artery) (*).On the other hand, being a branch of the
      femoral nerve and far distal from the plexus, this can decrease the blocking effectiveness.
      Likewise, the great variation of the knee nerve supply.

      This prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial is comparing ultrasound guided
      adductor canal block (ACB) versus ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus block (LPB) in patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty aiming at decreasing post-operative pain, helping in early
      mobilization and better physiotherapy.

      This study hypothesizes that ACB, compared with LPB, will exhibit less motor, weakness, fewer
      opioids consumption with the same or better pain score.

The type of motor response (e.g., quadriceps, patellar) and the minimum current needed were recorded. Ultrasound pictures (preinjection and postinjection) were obtained to verify proper local anesthetic placement.</description>
