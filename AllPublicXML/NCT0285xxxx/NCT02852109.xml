  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine 15 patients who was firstly diagnosed as diffuse axonal injury
      and 15 patients negative for magnetic resonance examination with no trauma with DTI(diffusion
      tensor imaging). The investigators then determine the FA（fractional anisotropy）value and the
      ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient) value of relational interesting area（corpus
      callosum、brainstem、basal ganglia）to analyse the correlation between the FA（fractional
      anisotropy）value and ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient) value and GCS(Glasgow Coma Scale)
      and coma time,so that the investigators can quantify the damage degree of patients' white
      matter fiber.By using fiber tractography the investigators can have the extent of recovery of
      the patient of DAI（diffuse axonal injury） in real-time detection and give guidance for the
      clinical decision and the judgement of prognosis).

      The investigators will examine 15 patients who was firstly diagnosed as diffuse axonal injury
      and 15 patients negative for magnetic resonance examination with no trauma with DTI(diffusion
      tensor imaging). The investigators then determine the FA（fractional anisotropy）value and the
      ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient) value of relational interesting area（corpus

      anisotropy）value and ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient) value and GCS(Glasgow Coma Scale)
      and coma time,so that the investigators can quantify the damage degree of patients' white
      matter fiber.At the same time the investigators rebuild the white matter fiber tract(corpus
      callosum 、corticospinal tract、optic radiation) of patients using diffusion tensor
      tractography so that the investigators can judge intuitively the extent of damage and
      recovery. The investigators Trace the repair of nerve fibers after treatment and guide the
      further treatment.This trial can exactly determine the relationship between the FA（fractional
      anisotropy）value and ADC(apparent diffusion coefficient) value in relational interesting area
      and the extent of damage in patient of DAI（diffuse axonal injury）.Meanwhile the trial
      confirms that the DTI(diffusion tensor imaging) can exactly judge the prognosis of
      DAI（diffuse axonal injury）.Obviously by using fiber tractography the investigators can have
      the extent of recovery of the patient of DAI（diffuse axonal injury） in real-time detection
      and give guidance for the clinical decision and the judgement of prognosis).
