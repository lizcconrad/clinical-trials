  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in approximately 52 adults with primary
      (de novo) GB that has recurred or progressed (first or second recurrence, including this
      recurrence) after treatment(s) including surgery and radiotherapy with or without
      chemotherapy and following discontinuation of any previous standard or investigational lines
      of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, MDNA55, is a fusion protein comprising a genetically engineered Interleukin-4
      (IL-4) linked to a modified version of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE). MDNA55
      binds to the IL-4 receptor (IL4R), over-expressed by cancer cells and non-malignant
      immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and delivers a potent
      cell-killing agent, PE.

      The study will be conducted at up to 10 clinical sites following institutional review board
      approval and completed informed consent.

      Subjects that meet the study eligibility criteria will undergo surgery associated with study
      drug administration. MDNA55 will be administered locally by convection-enhanced delivery
      (CED).

      Post-treatment follow-up assessment of safety and efficacy will be performed monthly for the
      first 6 months and bimonthly thereafter for approximately 1 year after study drug
      administrations. Subjects will continued to be followed for survival and post-study
      treatment(s) of GB after study completion or withdrawal.
