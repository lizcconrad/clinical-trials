    <textblock>
      Behavioral lifestyle treatment for obesity produces clinically significant weight loss and
      corresponding improvements in disease risk and severity when delivered via in-person group
      and/or individual treatment sessions. Online versions have been developed in order to reduce
      costs. These programs typically include weekly weight loss lessons and tailored feedback on
      patients' weight loss progress. However, online programs often produce suboptimal outcomes
      compared to programs delivered in-person due to insufficient adherence to prescribed
      behavioral strategies, and a lack of objective methods for behavioral self-monitoring to
      support adherence. One approach to monitoring and improving adherence involves tracking
      patients' weight loss progress on a personalized nomogram (i.e., graph). The nomogram is
      based on a dynamic energy balance equation and depicts the expected weight loss over time if
      the participant is adherent to a prescribed goal for caloric intake and physical activity. A
      complementary approach to measuring and intervening on adherence involves the use of mobile
      technology to monitor eating behavior. The Bite Counter is a wrist-worn device similar to a
      wristwatch that measures the timing, frequency, rate, and duration of eating events by
      monitoring the &quot;wrist roll&quot; motion that occurs when food is brought to the mouth. By using
      mathematical models to &quot;calibrate&quot; the Bite Counter to the weight loss nomogram, it may be
      possible to identify the optimal number of bites that any given patient should take each day
      in order to facilitate weight loss. The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a small
      randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of adding weight loss nomograms and the Bite Counter to an established online weight loss
      program. A sample of 30 participants with overweight/obesity will be randomly assigned in
      equal proportions to one of three 12-week weight loss programs: (a) online behavioral weight
      loss treatment alone (OBWL), (b) online behavioral weight loss treatment plus the provision
      of weight loss nomograms with weekly feedback tailored to the nomogram (OBWL+N), or (c)
      online behavioral weight loss treatment plus the provision of weight loss nomograms with
      weekly feedback tailored to the nomogram and provision of a Bite Counter that can be used to
      alert participants when they are approaching their maximum number of prescribed bites per day
      (OBWL+N&amp;BC).
