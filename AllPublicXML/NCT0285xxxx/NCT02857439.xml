      What combination of ≤ 6 clinical variables will give the highest specificity for indicating
      significant shoulder injuries (fractures or dislocations) with a set sensitivity of ≥ 97%?

      Although shoulder trauma is a common injury, there is no clinical decision rule to determine
      the necessity for radiography for these traumas. With this trial the investigators aim to
      develop such a rule to reduce the amount of radiographs without missing any significant
      injuries.

      The primary objective is to compose a set of clinical diagnostic criteria predictive of
      shoulder fractures or dislocations that would reduce the amount of radiographs without
      missing any significant injuries. A second objective is to determine if the clinical decision
      rule is applicable for triage use.

      The CASH (Clavicle-AC-Joint-Sub-capital-Humerus) trial is designed as a cross sectional
      interobserver study. It will randomize between first examiner of the patient to determine
      applicability for triage use and use a list of 19 criteria to determine a clinical decision
      rule for significant shoulder injuries.

      Method/intervention After admittance to the ED, all consecutive shoulder injury patients will
      be assessed for eligibility in the study. After informed consent is given, the patient will
      be randomized for first observer (ED physician or triage nurse) to be examined, which means
      they will be assessed in duplo.

      The patient will be examined by means of a score form, which contains 19 different diagnostic
      criteria. The criteria are grouped: anamnesis, inspection, palpation and pain/range of
      motion(ROM). After completing the list, patients will get a full set of shoulder x-rays:
      shoulder AP- and axial-view, and clavicle AP and 30' cranio-caudal view.

      The trial participation for the patient will be completed at this point and final diagnosis
      and treatment are provided by the ED physician according to his/her own findings and
      interpretation of the radiographs. For the study, the radiographs will be reassessed by one
      consultant radiologist specialized in skeletal trauma.
