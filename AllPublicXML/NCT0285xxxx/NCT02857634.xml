  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancer worldwide and the second most frequent
      urological cancer. The photodynamic diagnosis technique (PDD) currently used (Hexvix®) has
      improved tumor detection but with a high false positive rate. Indeed, the main limitation of
      the PDD is its lack of specificity, ranging from 35 to 66%. The association of this technique
      with new technologies such as the Cellvizio Dual Band featuring simultaneous dual wavelength
      illumination and detection, could improve the identification of tumoral lesions. The
      objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Cellvizio dual band technique for
      the diagnosis of tumors bladders.

    <description>Using fluorescence cytoscopy, lesions in the bladder will be resected. The samples will be immediately observed in order to keep the fluorescein effect under confocal microscopy (Cellvizio dual band). After confocal microscopy samples will be fixed in formalin and prepare for the pathologist that will confirm the diagnosis. The Cellvizio system can be used to observe a resected sample ex vivo, offering a cellular-level view of internal tissue. This technique allows the visualization of the microstructure of the tissue in real-time which may improve targeted sampling, provide earlier disease detection and help patient management. The Cellvizio system includes miniaturized optics, optical fiber bundles, high-speed scanning and advanced image processing components.</description>
