    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug EF-022 in the
      treatment of adult patients with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP). Patients will be
      administered EF-022, either intramuscular or subcutaneous, for a period of 6 months.
      Preliminary effect of the drug on the disease will be evaluated by following the number and
      severity of the lesions in the respiratory tract and the effect on voice changes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of RRP is associated with local immune suppression at disease-involved sites.

      EF-022, a Vitamin D-Binding protein Macrophage Activating Factor, modulates the innate arm of
      the immune system to alleviate immune suppression. The investigators hypothesize that EF-022
      may modulate the immune response in a manner that might slow down or even prevent disease
      progression.

      Adult subjects will be treated weekly with EF-022 for a period of 6 months by either
      intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EF-022
      administered to adult subjects with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis either IM or SC.

      The main response assessment will be performed over the 6 months period by:

        -  Evaluating lesion size and/or number of disease-involved sites by Coltera-Derkay score

        -  Assessment of degree of voice disorder using the VHI-10 score

        -  Symptomatic assessment of dyspnea/stridor
