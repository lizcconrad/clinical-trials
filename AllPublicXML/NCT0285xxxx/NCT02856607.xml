    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as a bacterial infection of the endocardium (inner
      surface of the heart), which may include one or more heart valves. Epidemiologic pattern has
      changed during the last 20 years whereas the incidence was unchanged. However, the mortality
      increase despite recent diagnosis and therapeutic advances.

      Only few investigations consider the prognostic and the therapeutic medical care according to
      the clinical care pathway. In fact, 3 situations are observed: (i) patient for whom diagnosis
      and medical care are realized in a referent center with cardiac surgery, (ii) patients
      secondary addressed to a referent center with cardiac surgery, (iii) patients for which the
      totality medical care are performed in non-referent health center. In addition, epidemiologic
      studies concern only a part of IE, not including most of the time the patients hospitalized
      in non-referent center.

      The aim of the study was to determine the prognosis of threated patients according to the
      clinical care pathway. Secondary objectives was (i) to evaluate the application of European
      recommendations concerning trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TOE), antibiotic treatment and
      surgical practice, (ii) to compare the epidemiologic profile according to the type of center.

      For this, 300 patients addressed in the 22 French participating centers for a possible or
      certain IE according to Duke Criteria were prospectively included during 3 years.

      Patient data (clinical, demographical, biological, microbiological, echocardiographic and
      evolutive data) were collected at the admission, during hospitalization, at discharge and
      one-year follow up.
