    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that prolonged sitting increases risk for cardiometabolic diseases
      and the risk factors associated with cardiometabolic diseases. However, no study to date has
      examined if a chronic intervention that breaks up prolonged sitting in a real-world
      environment results in a reduction in the metabolic risk factors associated with
      cardiometabolic diseases. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the potential
      health benefits of breaking up sitting bouts throughout the workday using a small cycling
      device (DeskCycle) in office workers involved with jobs that require prolonged bouts of
      sitting. The investigators hypothesize that breaking up sitting will be associated with
      improvements in cardiometabolic disease risk factors. More specifically, the investigators
      hypothesize that breaking up sitting will decrease blood glucose during an oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT), increase cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), decrease blood pressure,
      decrease body fat, increase HDL cholesterol, and decrease LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol,
      and triglycerides.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Both males and females

          -  Subjects will need to be 18-55 years old

          -  Subjects will need to be sitting at least 6 hours/day on 5 days/week

          -  Subjects will need to be exercising less than 5 hour/week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females that are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Subjects must be free from any acute or chronic physical condition that would
             influence the outcome measures of the protocol. Examples include, but are not limited
             to advanced chronic disease states (chronic kidney, liver, heart, or lung disease),
             morbid obesity, emphysema, and an inability to use the legs for normal locomotion.
             Normality will be established on the basis of clinical history, physical exam, and
             vital signs. Any subject with a history of an uncontrolled metabolic disorder/disease
             or symptoms of active illness will be excluded from study. Any subject with a history
             of an uncontrolled metabolic disorder/disease such as diabetes (Type I or Type II) or
             symptoms of active illness will be excluded from study.

               -  Subjects will be excluded if they have a fasted blood glucose level &gt;126 mg/dl or
                  a systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg.

          -  Medical/psychiatric/sleep disorders history: any clinically significant unstable
             medical or psychological condition within the last year (treated or untreated).

          -  Drug use:

               -  Use of any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal products, that may
                  affect metabolic function within 1 month prior to the study or need to use any of
                  these medications at any time during the study (self-report by interview).
                  Examples of potential medications that will exclude a subject include:
                  beta-adrenergic blockers, sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones,
                  alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV
                  inhibitors. Note, subjects may be tested at a later date.

               -  Use of any investigational drug within 1 month before the study
