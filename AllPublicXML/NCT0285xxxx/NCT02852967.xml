      This study will be performed in adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe
      chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Study drug
      will be orally administered in a double-blind fashion for 16 weeks in order to evaluate
      efficacy through 16 weeks of treatment. Approximately 150 subjects will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 5 dose cohorts:

        -  200 mg KD025 once daily (QD)

        -  200 mg KD025 BID

        -  400 mg KD025 QD

        -  600 mg/day KD025 (administered as 400 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening)

        -  Placebo BID

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × ULN

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,
             antiestrogens, or ovarian suppression

               -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)
                  documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug

               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree

                  control includes (a) IUD plus one barrier method; (b) on stable doses of hormonal
                  contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable, implant,
                  transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier
                  methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels
                  that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner

          -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:
             agreement to use two forms of contraception as in criterion 5 above during the
             treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug

          -  Using phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Using biologic therapies, including antibodies to IL-17, anti-TNFα, anti-IL-12 &amp; -23,
             within 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Current use of an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4

                  any magnitude, or a ratio of AST: ALT &gt; 1.5 should be interviewed regarding use
                  of alcohol, have levels repeated and participation in the study should be
                  discussed with the medical monitor.)

               -  Renal disease and/or serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN at screening
