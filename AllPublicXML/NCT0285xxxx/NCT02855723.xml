  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with cancer of oral cavity or oropharynx T1-T2N0 classified, are treated
      surgically with systematic lymph node dissection while in 70%, there is no lymph node
      metastasis. The technique of identifying the sentinel node (GS) is validated for these tumors
      because the status of the sentinel node is predictive of the other nodes status in the neck.
      This helps to diagnose the presence of metastases without lymph node dissection and thus
      select patients requiring a treatment node. However, the oncological and functional results
      of a therapeutic strategy based on identifying the GS is unknown.

      This open-label randomized multicenter clinical trial aims to compare the oncologic and
      functional outcome of two strategies : the current management versus the management based on
      the sentinel lymph node.

      The hypothesis is based on a nodal control difference at 2 years in both arms not exceeding
      10%. The medico-economic analysis will be conducted in two stages : a classic stage on 2
      years with estimated incremental cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-utility, then a step
      with log term modeling.

      A reduction in morbidity and treatment costs in the sentinel node arm are expected in this
      study.

    <textblock>
      This study schedules the screening visit (V0) and then 9 follow-up visits during 24 months.

      At the screening, after verification of the eligibility criteria and signature of the
      informed consent form, the subject will be randomized in one of 2 arms. At the inclusion the
      following exams have to be done : clinical exam, panendoscopy, cytologic and histologic
      analysis and CT-Scan (or MRI). For each visit, the investigator will perform a clinical exam
      and the subjects should complete some questionnaires themselves from V0 to V3, V6 (12 months)
      and V9. At the last visit (24 months) the patients will have a CTC-Scan ou MRI.

      At the end of the follow-up period (24 months), the data of subjects survival will be
      recorded during three years.
