  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both anti-angiogenesis and anti PD1 immunotherapy have shown beneficial efficacy in solid
      tumors and in particular in NSCLC. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether the
      combination of these two approaches is tolerable. Moreover, comprehensive pre-clinical and
      clinical rationale sustain the hypothesis that anti-VEGF could synergize with immunotherapy
      for the benefit of the patients.
