  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal aflibercept has been approved for the treatment of visual impairments due to
      diabetic macular oedema (DMO) in Europe and the US in August 2014 and July 2014 respectively.

      The main objectives of this observational cohort field study are to evaluate effectiveness of
      intravitreal aflibercept and to describe follow-up as well as treatment patterns in anti
      vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment naïve patients with DMO in routine
      clinical practice in the United Kingdom.
