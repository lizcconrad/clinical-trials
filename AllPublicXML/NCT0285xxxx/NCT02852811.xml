      One hundred twenty women will be included in the study. The survey population consists of
      Swedish-speaking women aged 45-55 years and seek care at Distriktsköterskemottagningen in
      Skene and at the Antenatal clinic in Svenljunga. The selection is done consecutively.

      Method:

      Grouping:The women will be randomly allocated to intervention group and control group
      (60/60).

      The intervention:

      The project includes the implementation of a total of four equivalent group treatments. Two
      of the group education will be at Skene Medical center and two Svenljunga Medical center.
      Group treatments are carried out by the district nurse and midwife in common. Each treatment
      group includes 15 women. A total of 60 women will thus participate in group education..Each
      treatment group consists of two information sessions of 2 hours.

      The first information contains information about the menstrual cycle, hormonal shift,
      urogenital symptoms, and information on prevention and health promotion self-care.

      The other information currently contains information about cardiovascular risk factors during
      menopause, relations, mental health, information about depressive symptoms and for preventive
      measures and health-promoting self-care.

      The control group did not obtain any group education or any other intervention.
