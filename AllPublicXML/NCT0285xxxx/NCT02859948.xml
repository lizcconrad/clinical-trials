  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive oral SKLB1028 for 28 days to study the side effects, tolerability and
      best dose for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia With FLT3 Mutations.

    <textblock>
      It is open-label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally administered SKLB1028 as a single
      agent given daily for 28 days. Cohorts of 3 patients receive SKLB1028 until dose limiting
      toxicity is noted (DLT). At that point cohorts will expand to 6 patients until MTD is
      determined. Patients not experiencing DLT or significant disease progression could continue
      receiving SKLB1028 up to 1 year.
