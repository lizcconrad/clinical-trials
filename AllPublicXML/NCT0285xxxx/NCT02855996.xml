  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Child and Family Research Partnership (CFRP) will be conducting the &quot;local&quot; evaluation of
      AVANCE's Fathers in Action/Padres Activos (FA/PA) fatherhood program. AVANCE is a non-profit
      organization that has served low-income families and children since its founding in 1973.
      AVANCE sites have been providing fatherhood services for some time, but the programming
      offered has varied across sites and no rigorous evaluation of the programs has been
      completed. Through a federally-funded Responsible Fatherhood grant, AVANCE aims to create one
      fatherhood curriculum to be used across their sites: Fathers in Action/Padres Activos
      (FA/PA).

      The purpose of the study is to advance the field of knowledge in the area of fatherhood
      programing by providing rigorous evidence on the impact of a comprehensive fatherhood program
      on enhancing a father's ability to be involved with and parent his child, in addition to
      providing more information on the selective characteristics of fathers who choose to
      participate in fatherhood programs. The study will seek to answer the following research
      questions: (1) What are the demographic and relationship characteristics of fathers who
      choose to participate in the Fathers in Action/Padres Act√≠vos (FA/PA) program, and how do
      these characteristics compare to the fathers associated with mothers and children in other
      AVANCE programs?; (2) Does the FA/PA program positively impact parenting and co-parenting,
      father engagement and involvement, and healthy relationship?; (3) Are the program impacts
      similar for low-income fathers across regions (Houston v. the Rio Grande Valley),
      race/ethnicity (African American v. Hispanic), and coresidential status (nonresident v.
      resident)?; and (4) What are the factors that enhance or impede the successful implementation
      of the FA/PA program?
