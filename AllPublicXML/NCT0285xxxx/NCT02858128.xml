      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of whole-body diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DW- MRI) in detecting metastases by comparing the results with
      those from choline-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (choline-PET/CT) in
      patients with metastatic/oligometastatic prostate cancer. Patients with this disease profile
      who could benefit from treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) were
      selected and their responses to these techniques were rated.

      This was a prospective, controlled, unicentric study, involving 46 consecutive patients from
      our centre who presented biochemical relapse after adjuvant, salvage or radical treatment
      with external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. After initial tests ( bone scintigraphy,
      CT, pelvic MRI) 35 patients with oligometastases or without them were selected. 11 patients
      with multiple metastases were excluded from the study. WB-DW- MRI and choline-PET/CT was then
      performed on each patient within one week. The results were interpreted by specialists in
      nuclear medicine and MRI. If they were candidates for treatment with ablative SBRT (SABR)
      they were then evaluated every three months with both tests.

        46 consecutive patients given a diagnosis of prostate cancer by the Radiation Oncology
        Department of our center, between October 2014 and March 2015 who met the established
        inclusion criteria: a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer, and after treatment of the
        primary disease, a diagnosis of biochemical relapse and no metastases or oligometastatic
        stage (less than 5 lesions) in conventional diagnostic images (bone scintigraphy,
        chest-abdominal and pelvic CT and pelvic MRI).
