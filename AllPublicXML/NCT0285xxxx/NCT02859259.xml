        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Target Population: Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant
             deviation from normal in medical and surgical history, physical examination, vital
             sign measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements and clinical laboratory test results. Body
             mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/mÂ².

          3. Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has
             discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e., subject has not been
             randomized/ has not been treated). If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.

          4. Age: Males and Females, ages 18 or age of majority to 50 years, inclusive.

          5. Reproductive Status: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative
             serum/urine (urine test not allowed at screening and Day -1 of Period 1) pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin)
             within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. Women must not be breastfeeding.
             Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
             contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug plus 5 half-lives of study
             drug (60 hours) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 33 days
             post-treatment completion. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to
             follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with
             study drug plus 5 half-lives of study drug (60 hours). In addition, male subjects must
             be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time. Azoospermic males are
             exempt from contraceptive requirements. Women of childbearing potential who are
             continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from contraceptive
             requirements, and still undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases: History of any chronic or acute illness,
             gastrointestinal disease, gastrointestinal surgery within less than 4 weeks of dosing,
             blood donation within 4 weeks of dosing, blood transfusion within 4 weeks of dosing,
             smoking within less than 12 months prior to dosing, alcohol abuse, inability to
             tolerate oral medication, or inability to be venipunctured. Any other sound medical,
             psychiatric and/or social reason as determined by the investigator.

          2. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings: Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically
             significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs measurements,
             ECGs, or clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target
             population.

          3. Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of study drug
             administration.
