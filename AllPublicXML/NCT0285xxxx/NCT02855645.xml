    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) locates fifth of ten leading death etiology, the population of
      diabetic patients has a tendency of increase. Trichosanthes root is called as Tian Hua Fen,
      According to traditional Chinese writing record that Trichosanthes root has the action of
      downbear fire, moisten dryness, and slippery phlegm, and release thirst. The Trichosanthes
      root may lower blood sugar levels in the modern study. The investigators designed a double
      blind, randomized controlled study, a total of 60 diabetic patients with high blood sugar
      were divided into treatment and control groups, and each group was 30 patients. In the
      treatment group, oral administration of Trichosanthes root 1.5 g, bid/day for 84 days
      continuously; in the control group, oral administration of Trichosanthes root placebo 1.5 g,
      bid/day for 84 days continuously. The main outcome measure was the changes of plasma blood
      sugar and Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels changed before and after Trichosanthes root
      treatment. The investigators predict the results of the present study indicated that
      Trichosanthes root can improve plasma blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin A1c levels.
