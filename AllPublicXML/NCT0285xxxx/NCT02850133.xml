  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases
      compared to the healthy population. Aerobic exercise training is one of the recommended
      treatments. However, literature regarding the effect of aerobic training on patients with SCI
      is scarce. This study evaluated changes in parameters of exercise physiology and serum
      myokines immediately after exercise and after a training program among patients with SCI.

      Method:

      Male patients with SCI and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited.
      Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to determine oxygen uptake at peak exercise
      and anaerobic threshold in both groups. The patients with SCI attended aerobic exercise
      training for 36 sessions within 12-16 weeks. Basic data, hemodynamic and exercise physiology
      parameters, and serum myokine (myostatin, insulin like growth factor, and follistatin)
      concentrations were measured pre- and post-exercise in both groups, and were repeated in
      patients with SCI post-training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with SCI were invited to undergo a 12- to 16-week exercise training by arm
      ergometry. The exercise physiology and measurements of hemodynamic parameters and cytokines
      were repeated after completion of the training.
