    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persons with confirmed early symptomatic syphilis (primary or secondary) or high-titer
             latent syphilis

          2. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive, with a titer were 1:4 or higher. In
             addition, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay and/or fluorescent
             treponemal antibody absorption test were reactive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.Patients who were pregnancy, known allergy to penicillin, use of antibiotics active
        against syphilis during the preceding six months for symptomatic cases or during the
        preceding two years for asymptomatic cases, and concurrent illnesses requiring treatment
        with antibiotics effective against syphilis. 2. if RPR titers were found to be 1:4 or less
        or the T. pallidum particle agglutination test was nonreactive, participants were
        retrospectively excluded from the trial unless primary syphilis was confirmed by the
        finding of T. pallidum in ulcer exudates on direct immunofluorescence
