  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a program of systematic physical exercise maintained for at least
      12 weeks to normalize biomarkers of metabolic syndrome; improve neurocognition and social
      functioning; increase empowerment, self-esteem and self-efficacy and reduce self-stigma in
      individuals with severe mental disorder with metabolic syndrome.

      Major depressive disorder has an estimated annual prevalence of 4% in Spain and the risk of a
      major depressive episode is 10.6%. Although there are few studies available, there is growing
      evidence regarding the fact that patients with affective disorders have a higher morbidity
      and mortality in relation to general population. This mortality would be duplicated mainly
      due to suicides but also by other factors such as increased metabolic risk and cardiovascular
      diseases. In Europe, depression is one of the leading causes of lost productivity, early
      retirement and absence from work due to illness and it will be the first cause of disease
      burden worldwide in 2030 according to World Health Organization. Several reasons could
      explain it: from the adverse effects of medication, less access to health services, until
      unhealthy lifestyle options associated with a loss of quality of life related to health.

      Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that can affect between 2 and 5% of the
      population. This disease has a major impact on patient functioning and it is in sixth place
      among all diseases as a global cause of disability. Depending on the studies, metabolic
      syndrome is present between 8 and 56% of patients with bipolar disorder what this leads to
      increased morbidity and mortality affecting of their quality of life.

      Annual incidence rates of psychosis are from 0.2 to 0.4 per 1000 population and prevalence
      throughout life is about 1%, being similar between men and women although the start in women
      is later. The age of onset is between 15 and 30 years and it has a significant economic
      impact on patient, on his family and society in general. Schizophrenia is a psychotic
      disorder in which the person suffers from delusions or hallucinations with a disorganized
      thought or speech and negative symptoms that are not accompanied by insight. Historically it
      has been associated with greater vulnerability and higher rates of physical comorbidity and
      excess mortality. In physical comorbidity highlights cardiovascular diseases and they are
      attributed a 60% mortality together with metabolic syndrome, which is 2-3 times more frequent
      than in the general population. This increase in morbidity and mortality is related to a
      style of unhealthy life (bad eating habits and lack of exercise), use of antipsychotic drugs
      and disease as intrinsic factor.

      There has been an increase in interest for the study of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in
      psychiatric patients in recent decades. Although his description has evolved over time, we
      can define the MetS as a group of risk factors (abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure,
      elevated fasting plasma glucose, high serum triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL cholesterol) levels) that predict the onset of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
      gallstones, asthma, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and several cancers. The most commonly
      used criteria for his diagnosis are the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult
      Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III 2003), requires at least three of the following risk
      factors:

        1. Elevated waist circumference: ≥102 cm in men and ≥88 cm in women.

        2. Elevated serum triglycerides: ≥150 mg/dL or drug treatment.

        3. Reduced HDL cholesterol: &lt;40 mg/dL in men and &lt;50 mg/dL in women or drug treatment.

        4. Elevated blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
           ≥ 85 mm Hg or drug treatment.

        5. Elevated fasting glucose: ≥100 mg/dL or drug treatment.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal obesity, also known as central obesity, is when excessive abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health.
Men are considered to be at high risk from abdominal obesity if their waist measurements are 102 cm or higher, while women are considered to be at high risk if their waist measurements are 88 cm or higher.</description>

    <measure>Change in dyslipidemia measured by serum triglycerides and/or high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g.,triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood.
The normal triglyceride level is between 30 and 150 mg/dL. The normal HDL cholesterol level is between 40 and 60 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Change in hypertension measured by blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.
Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-130 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-85 mmHg diastolic.</description>

    <measure>Change in hyperglycemia measured by fasting plasma glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar (also spelled hyperglycaemia) is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.
A subject with a consistent range between 100-126 mg/dl is considered hyperglycemic, while above 126 mg/dl is generally held to have diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Effect of physical activity intervention on serum biomarkers by using metabolomics</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolomics can be defined as the quantitative and qualitative analysis of all metabolites (molecules with a molecular weight of less than 1,500 Da) in a given organism, resulting in the construction of a metabolome or metabolic fingerprint, analogous to the genome or the proteome. Metabolomics is based on high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatography.
The following biomarkers will be screened: Cytokines; Irisin, adiponutrin, adiponectin, resistin, leptin; Pro-inflammation status: tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a); Interleukin (IL-1b, IL-6), alpha-1-antitrypsin, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, C reactive protein; Oxidative stress: LDL-oxidized and anti-LDL-oxidized antibodies.</description>
