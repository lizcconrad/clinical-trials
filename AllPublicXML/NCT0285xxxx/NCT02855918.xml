  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behavior (SB) is a major public health problem in France, with more than 10,000
      suicides and 220,000 suicide attempts per year.

      According to the commonly accepted model for understanding suicidal behavior, individuals who
      carry a suicidal act when subjected to stress factors (environmental stress, depression,
      substance ...) are those which have a specific vulnerability.

      These vulnerabilities can be considered as clinical parameters (propensity to despair,
      aggressive and/or impulsive traits), neurobiological parameters (dysfunction of the
      serotonergic system, ...) and cognitive parameters (taking disadvantageous decision ...).
      Suicidal vulnerability is partly underpinned by genetic factors. The interest of current
      researches is to identify biomarkers that will improve the opportunities for early
      identification of subject with a risk for SB. Numerous scientific studies, including
      post-mortem studies of the brains of suicide completers, have established a link between
      dysregulation of the ribonucleic acids editing (RNA) of certain genes, the enzymatic activity
      of Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARS) responsible for this edition and suicidal
      behavior. A prospective study is needed to quantify and qualify in the blood of depressed
      patients (with or without a history of suicide) and healthy controls, the editing changes and
      the expression and alteration of the activity of ADARS.

      Over two years, 600 participants will be recruited:

        -  225 subjects with current major depressive episode and an history of suicide attempt
           (depressed suicide attempters)

        -  225 subjects with current major depressive episode but with no personal history of
           suicide attempt (affective controls)

        -  150 subjects with no history of psychopathology whole life (healthy controls)

      Each patient will attend a total of 3visits during a follow-up period of 6 months +/- 15 days
      (inclusion, visit at 3 and 6 months).
