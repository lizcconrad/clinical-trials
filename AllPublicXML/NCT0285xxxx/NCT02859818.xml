      Introduction: Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) is the key of the interdisciplinary
      management of type 1 diabetes for adolescents, favoring their adherence and improving their
      quality of life and metabolic control. Six pediatric diabetes teams have engaged in action
      research to build a regional ETP program based on social cognitive theory of Bandura,
      assuming that the learning strategies of theory, applied in ETP program, should strengthen
      self-efficacy of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, which could induce an improvement
      behaviors adherence, quality of life and physiological profile of participants about 6 months
      post-inclusion in the program.

      Aims: The main objective is to describe the evolution over 6 months of self-efficacy in a
      cohort of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who followed a therapeutic education program based
      on social cognitive theory of Bandura in region PACA (ETPACAP program). Secondary objectives
      are to describe the evolution of 6 months of glycemic control, behavior of adherence, quality
      of life and other components of social cognitive theory for this population, to explore the
      effects of socio-cognitive profile on adherence, quality of life and glycemic control among
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes followed this program.

      Method: A prospective multicenter cohort study of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who
      participated in ETPACAP program, consisting of three components:

        -  A quantitative component: collection and analysis of changes over 6 months of
           self-efficacy, adherence, quality of life and HbA1c levels (ANOVA repeated measures);

        -  A qualitative component: interviews with 32 participants at M0, M3 and M6 on the
           socio-cognitive factors according to Bandura (analysis continues theming);

        -  An integrative component, exploring the effects of the components of social cognitive
           theory on adherence, glycemic control and quality of life of adolescents with type 1
           diabetes cohort.

      Expected results: This research is expected to bring new knowledge about the ETP programs and
      the adolescent cohort studied to make an improvement and adjustment of educational sessions
      relevant to the needs and expectations of this population.
