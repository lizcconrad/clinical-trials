    <textblock>
      HDClarity will seek to enroll approximately 600 research participants - 500 of whom will be
      at different stages of Huntington's disease (HD) and 100 healthy controls. The primary
      objective is to collect a high quality CSF sample for evaluation of biomarkers and pathways
      that will enable the development of novel treatments for HD. The secondary objective is to
      generate a high quality plasma sample collection matching the CSF collections, which will
      also be used to evaluate biomarkers and pathways of relevance to HD research and development.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will attend a screening and sampling visit. During the screening visit,
      medical history, and clinical and phenotypic data will be obtained. Participants who meet the
      eligibility requirements are willing to continue in the study, will return for a sampling
      visit during which ≤20ml CSF and approximately 50ml blood will be collected following an
      overnight fast: blood will be obtained via venipuncture and CSF will be obtained via lumbar
      puncture using local anaesthetic if required. Approximately 120 participants (including 20
      controls) will be invited to attend an optional repeat sampling visit 4-6 weeks after the
      original sampling visit.

         10. Predictable non-compliance as assessed by Site Principal Investigator; or

         11. Inability or unwillingness to undertake any of the study procedures; or

         12. Exclusion during history or physical examination, final decision to be made by the
             Site Principal Investigator; including but not limited to: any reason to suspect
             abnormal bleeding tendency, e.g. easy bruising, petechial rash; or any reason to
             suspect new focal neurological lesion, e.g. new headache, optic disc swelling,
             asymmetric focal long tract signs; or any other reason that, in the clinical judgment
             of the operator or the Site Principal Investigator, it is felt that lumbar puncture is
             unsafe without brain imaging.
