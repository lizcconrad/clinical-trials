      Single-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose study and
      multiple dose study. AK002 will be administered as an intra-venous (IV) infusion in eight
      cohorts of single escalating doses and two cohorts with multiple doses. The study will
      comprise of 3 parts: Part A (Cohorts 1 - single ascending dose); Part B (Cohorts 2 to 9 -
      single ascending dose); Part C (Cohorts 10 and 11 - multiple dose).

      Participants who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in
      the study. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study. Blood sampling for
      PK and PD analysis will be also collected during the course of the study.

      Up to approximately 48 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be
      screened from -28 days prior to dose administration.

      In parts A and B, participants will be admitted to the unit on Day -1 and will remain
      confined to the clinic until completion of Day 4 procedures. On Day 1, participants will
      receive a single dose of AK002 or placebo and complete study procedures. Participants will
      return to the clinic for follow up at Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 112 or end of study (EOS)
      visit.

      In part C, In Part C, participants will be admitted to the unit on Day -1 and will remain
      confined to the clinic until completion of Day 2 procedures. On Day 1, participants will
      receive a dose of AK002 or placebo and complete procedures as detailed in Table 2.
      Participants will return to the clinic for follow up at Days 4, 7 and 14, and on Day 28
      participants will receive a second dose of study drug (AK002 or a corresponding placebo) and
      will remain confined to the clinic until completion of the Day 29 procedures. Participants
      will return to the clinic for follow up at Days 31, 35, 42, 56, 84 and 112 or end of study
      (EOS) visit.
