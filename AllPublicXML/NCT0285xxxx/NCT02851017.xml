  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balance training is an important component of physical fitness, however due to the mundane
      and often repetitive nature of balance training alone this is often forgotten about and as a
      result people may be more susceptible to postural control instabilities. A potential solution
      to the mundane aspect of balance training is the use of exergaming (interactive exercise and
      gaming combined) through the use of commercial gaming systems such as the Nintendo Wii, Dance
      Dance Revolution (DDR) and more recently the XBOX Kinect. The aim of the investigation was to
      assess the XBOX Kinect versus traditional balance training on postural control, flow and
      technology acceptance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exergaming - exercise with the use of an interactive computer-generated environment - is
      increasingly used in physical rehabilitation. Benefits have been reported in a range of
      clinical populations (people with neurological problems children with cerebral palsy and
      learning difficulties, Parkinson' disease, multiple sclerosis and older people. Balance
      training is an important focus of such rehabilitation. Previous literature regarding the
      effects of exergaming as a method of balance-training has mainly been conducted using the
      Nintendo Wii™ and the Wii™ fit where people must stand on a balance board to play the games.
      Although literature has shown that traditional balance training alone is effective in
      improving balance in a range of populations, studies comparing exergaming with &quot;traditional&quot;
      balance exercises (SEBT, trampolines and wobble boards) have shown mixed results from both
      exergaming and traditional balance training groups improving in postural control outcomes to
      greater improvement in the exergaming group over traditional balance exercise. A potential
      reason for the differentiation if results could be due to different movements required in the
      &quot;traditional&quot; balance exercises rather than there being something inherently different about
      exercising in a virtual environment. There is also a dearth of randomized controlled trials
      (RCT) in this area so the evidence base is limited. Furthermore, few have studied the
      important psychological aspect of exergaming, in particular acceptance and flow experience.
      The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exergaming using the XBOX Kinect™ system,
      versus, traditional gym-based exercise, with no virtual stimuli (TGB) on: (1) postural
      control, (2) technology acceptance (3) flow experience and (4) exercise intensity in young
      healthy adults. Matching of intensity of exercise, in the two groups, was assessed
      objectively, by Heart Rate and subjectively by Borg RPE during all exercise sessions. To our
      knowledge this is the first paper to compare the effects of exergaming against matched
      traditional exercises where the movement patterns, intensity and physiological demand was
      matched and assessed across groups.

    <description>Postural sway was measured using a portable Kistler™ force platform (Model 9286AA, W 40 x L 60 x H 3.5cm). Participants were instructed to stand as still as possible with their arms by their side and eyes open, on their dominant leg (preferred kicking) for five periods of 30 seconds. Between trials, participants stepped off the force plate to allow calibration of the equipment which gave a 30 seconds rest.</description>

    <measure>Flow State Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (week 1) to post intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consist of a 36-item questionnaire with nine subscales and response options on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Dimensions of flow include challenge-skill balance (CB; skills match the task and will be successful); clear goals (CG; experience of having a pre-set goal which on is aiming to achieve); unambiguous feedback (UF; feedback on performance); concentration of task (CT; focused on task); paradox of control (PC; performs task with ease); action-awareness-merging (AM; automatic response to task); transformation of time (TT; time speeds up or slows down during activity); loss of self-consciousness (LS; immersed in task) and autotelic experience (AE; activity intrinsically rewarding).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (week 1) to post intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Technology acceptance was measured using UTAUT which comprised a 7-point Likert scale, with response options on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The questionnaire has six main domains, performance expectancy (PE; system will help performance), Effort Expectancy (EE; ease of using system), Social Influence (SI; degree in which others believe they should use system), Facilitating Conditions (FC; support in using the system), Self-efficacy (SE; confidence in using the system) and Behavioural Intention (BI; intention to use the system again).</description>

    <description>Heart rate (HR) was recorded using a Polar™ Heart Rate Monitor™ (FS2C), recording watch and T31 coded chest strap (Polar Electro, Oy, Finland). Mean HR was collected at the end of every exercise session and calculated as a percentage of predicted HR max (220 - age).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (week 1) to post intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>For a subjective measure of physiological cost the BORG Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale was used. Mean RPE data were recorded in each exercise session. RPE was defined as how hard participants felt their body was working in general based on the physical sensations they may experience during the activity, including increases in HR, respiration, breathing rate, sweating, and muscle fatigue.</description>
