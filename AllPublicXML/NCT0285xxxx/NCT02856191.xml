  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to determine, as exhaustively as possible thanks to the
      continuous and precise recording of heart rhythm, the frequency of de novo atrial
      fibrillation in septic shock, which is currently unknown, and to identify specific factors
      that could be associated with the condition. These will be investigated more precisely in a
      future study. This constitutes the first step in a reflection on the management of Cardiac
      Arrhythmia by Atrial fibrillation (ACFA) in septic shock in Medical Intensive Care, known as
      a major prognostic factor for morbimortality, but for which management is uncertain in the
      absence of reference data.
