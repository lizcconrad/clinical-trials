  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese women are significantly more likely than their normal BMI counterparts to experience
      failure of orally-dosed emergency contraceptives. Our preliminary data provides evidence for
      testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to provide improved efficacy from
      orally-dosed emergency contraceptives in obese women. More data is needed regarding emergency
      contraception containing ulipristal acetate. The overall project will be focused on both
      levonorgestrel (LNG) - and ulipristal acetate (UPA)-containing emergency contraception but
      this protocol registration is for the UPA aspect of the study procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency contraception (EC) provides a woman with an additional line of defense against
      unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse. Orally-dosed EC works by
      delaying ovulation and reduces the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected
      intercourse by 50-70%. Unfortunately, obese women are significantly more likely than their
      normal BMI counterparts to experience failure of orally-dosed EC and in some instances EC is
      equivalent to placebo.

      Our preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to
      provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. We hypothesize that increasing
      the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics resulting in the
      expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In the overall
      proposal, we plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of
      UPA-based EC in obese women and expand upon our preliminary findings of LNG-based EC. This
      protocol registration is for the UPA aspect of the study procedures focused on the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of UPA and will include a dose escalation intervention.
