  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD), frequent in PLHIV, is a risk factor for cognitive impairment.
      Micro-albuminuria is an early manifestation of CKD and a marker of vascular risk, notably
      affecting the small vessels. In the older general population microalbuminuria is associated
      with greater annual cognitive decline and has been proposed as an easily and inexpensive
      measured marker predicting future cognitive function decline. Ageing of the PLH leads to an
      increase of cognitive disorders and chronic renal failure incidence and could imply a common
      underlying mechanism affecting the renal and cerebral microvasculature. In this setting the
      investigators undertake this prospective, cross-sectional, case-control study to determine
      whether the presence of a microalbuminuria at least 5 years ago in PLHs with sustained good
      combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-controlled immunovirological parameters could be a
      marker predicting future cognitive impairment. They chose PLHs infected for at least 5 years
      and with cART-sustained immunovirological control for at least 1 year.
