             electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or before the first study drug administration as
             deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  History of moderate or severe use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-5) criteria within 1 year before
