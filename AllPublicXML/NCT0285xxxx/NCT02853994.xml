    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study
      evaluating the CE-marked DEVOIR Sirolimus-Coated Coronary Balloon in 4 subgroups regarding
      device approved indications:

        -  In-stent restenosis lesions: either bare metal or drug eluting stent restenosis

        -  Bifurcation lesions (with drug-eluting stent in main branch and drug-coated balloon in
           side branch): treatment of lesion of all Medina types except (0,0,1) in native coronary
           arteries

        -  Small vessels: treatment of lesions â‰¤2.75 mm

        -  BMS implantation followed by DCB inflation

        Patient's inclusion and exclusion criteria are per device instructions for use's
        indications and contraindications.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patient is at least 18 years old

          2. Lesion lengths ranging from 8 to 38 mm and diameters ranging from 1.50 mm to 4.00 mm.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with a hypersensitivity to Sirolimus drug or its structural activity related
             compounds.

          2. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to excipients with phospholipid or related
             origins.

          3. Patients whose diseased segment cannot be pre-dilated or prepared before drug coated
             balloon treatment.

          4. Severely calcified lesions requiring treatment of other type for e.g. Rotational
             Atherectomy (Rotablator)

          5. Patients judged to have lesion that prevents complete inflation of angioplasty balloon
             or proper placement of delivery catheter

          6. Patients who cannot receive recommended antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.
