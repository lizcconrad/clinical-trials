  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) remains high because of the huge
      blood lost from the aorta. Questions about the potentially genetic effects on sporadic TAAD
      are raised by researchers to explore the possible mechanisms leading to sporadic TAAD and to
      establish new clinical approaches to prevent TAAD-caused adverse clinical outcomes. This
      study is intended to collect the gene information in sporadic TAAD patients and to explore
      the relationship between genetic variation and the incidence of sporadic TAAD for further
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a critical clinical condition partly due to the rupture
      of aortic aneurysm. Mostly, surgical treatment can reduce the symptoms and extend life span
      of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). However, mortality of TAAD
      remains high because of the huge blood lost from the aorta. Sporadic TAAD was considered to
      be a server consequence of hypertension, though most patients with hypertension won't have
      TAAD as their final outcomes. Previous studies have revealed the associations between genetic
      abnormalities and familial TAAD, and genetic tests have applied to assist the diagnosis of
      certain TAAD. Therefore, the potentially genetic effects on sporadic TAAD are explored by
      researchers to understand the possible mechanisms leading to sporadic TAAD and to establish
      new clinical approaches to prevent TAAD-caused adverse clinical outcomes. This study is
      intended to collect the gene information in sporadic TAAD patients and to explore the
      relationship between genetic variation and the incidence of sporadic TAAD for further study.
