  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-phase adaptive randomized clinical trial will examine the individual and combined
      impact of pairing cognitive training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
      tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that directly stimulates brain regions
      involved in active cognitive function and could enhance neural plasticity when paired with a
      training task. We will compare changes in cognitive and brain function resulting from CT and
      ET combined with tDCS using a comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical, and multimodal
      neuroimaging assessment of brain structure, function, and metabolic state. Functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) will be used to assess brain response during working
      memory, attention, and memory encoding; the active cognitive abilities trained by CT. Proton
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess cerebral metabolites, including GABA
      concentrations sensitive to neural plasticity. We hypothesize that: 1) tDCS will enhance
      neurocognitive function, brain function, and functional outcomes from CT, with combined CT
      and tDCS providing the most benefit; 2) Effects of tDCS on CT will be maintained up to 12
      months following training, and 3) Neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebral metabolism, neural
      plasticity (GABA concentrations) and functional brain response (FMRI) during resting vs.
      active cognitive tasks will predict individual response to tDCS.

    <description>Sham stimulation is performed with the same device and all procedures will be identical except for the duration of stimulation. Participants will receive 30 seconds of 2 mA of direct current stimulation at the beginning of the session. Participants habituate to the sensation of tDCS within 30-60 seconds of stimulation. This procedure provides the same sensation of tDCS without the full duration of stimulation, making it a highly effective sham procedure.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Age 65 to 89 years; this age group was selected because it is at high risk of
