      This clinical trial is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel
      design, multi-center, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GV1001 in
      patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Eligible subjects are randomized into a group out
      of the three study groups and a placebo group after four weeks of placebo run-in period.
      Placebo run-in period is concurrently proceeded as a wash-out period for previous treatment
      of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a placebo is administered intradermally twice with
      two-week interval during this period. After that, the randomized subjects receive a study
      drug and a placebo intradermally seven times with two-week interval by visiting at Week 0, 2,
      4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. After the treatment period, the subjects additionally visit at Week 13
      and 16, and the efficacy is evaluated at Week 4, 8, 12, 13, and 16, and the safety is
      evaluated over the 16-week period.

    <description>IPSS questionnaire: 7-item questionnaire that measures urinary symptoms, but with an additional, independent eighth question on quality of life. It measures the level of urinary symptoms (including incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) reported as the total IPSS score. The first 7 items has a 6-point response scale (0=none/never to 5=almost always/5 or more times) with a total score that can range from 0-35: mild (0-7), moderate (8-19), or severe (20-35). The last item assesses quality of life reported as a Quality of Life assessment index.</description>

             patient has to consent to avoid pregnancy by using contraceptive devices or oral
             contraceptives during the patient's participation in clinical trial and for 90 days
             after the end of treatment, except if the partner reaches menopause or is surgically
             sterilized. (Consent should be obtained before visit 4, when necessary.)

        [Exclusion Criteria]

         11. Any other patients who are considered to be ineligible for this study by an
             investigator

        [Inclusion Criteria for Randomization]

          1. A patient who satisfies the following clinical signs and symptoms of benign prostatic
             hyperplasia

             ② A patient with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms with IPSS ≥ 13
