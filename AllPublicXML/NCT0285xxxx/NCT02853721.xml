      150 patients divided into two groups.The experimental group was submitted at the assay of
      iPTH six hours after surgery whilst the control group was submitted to a daily assay of serum
      calcium and phosphorus.

      Purpose: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to validate the results of a
      previous prospective cohort study conducted in the same surgical unit regarding the use of
      concomitant intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium measurement in predicting
      hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy.

      Methods: From January 2014 to January 2015, 150 patients underwent total thyroidectomy in our
      department and were divided into two groups. The experimental group was submitted at the
      assay of iPTH six hours after surgery whilst the control group was submitted to a daily assay
      of serum calcium and phosphorus. Sensitivity and specificity of different serum measurements
      have been calculated using the Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve.
