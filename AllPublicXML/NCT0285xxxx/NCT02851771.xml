  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A point-of-care laboratory (POC) was set at North Hospital, Marseille, France for the
      diagnosis in less than two hours of pneumonia caused by known pathogens, close to the
      reception of Emergency service. In this instance 30% of patients have no etiological
      diagnosis after the POC tests Pneumonia. This lab has discovered over 200 new species of
      bacteria in humans, including vector bacteria and opened the field of large Deoxyribo Nucleic
      Acid (DNA ) viruses. Also, the laboratory of emerging viruses discovered many Ribo Nucleic
      Acid (RNA) viruses transmitted by arthropods. Based on this collection of new pathogens
      described in POC laboratory, this study proposes to expand the etiological diagnosis strategy
      of pneumonia after POC tests.
