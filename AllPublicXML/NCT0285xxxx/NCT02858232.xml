  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Target Antigen Stimulating Cell Therapy (MASCT-I) is a new immunotherapy that
      dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood. The DC can then be loaded
      with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell
      proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly
      re-infused. The previous research data showed that MASCT had the modest overall response and
      less adverse effects for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients.

      The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of MASCT-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples,
      and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase.

      40-50 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who had failed after standard
      treatment will be recruited in this study.
