  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives and messaging tailored to
      individual goals and aspirations to promote and sustain weight loss. This is a 2-arm
      randomized controlled trial that will recruit eligible employees at a large university to
      participate in a 3-month weight loss program, followed by a 3-month follow-up period. The
      primary outcome will be change in autonomous motivation for weight loss.

      The study hypothesis is that intervention group participants will have a greater increase in
      autonomous motivation for weight loss than participants in the control group at 12 weeks.
