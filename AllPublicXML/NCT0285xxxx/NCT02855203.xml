      This investigator driven study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological effects of
      combining pembrolizumab (MK-3475) an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell death 1
      (PD-1), with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for oligometastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC). The investigators hypothesise that the safety profile of this combination
      will be clinically acceptable.

          4. Participants must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic renal
             cell carcinoma. Oligometastatic lesions do not need to be biopsied but they must be
             clinically consistent to represent metastatic disease.

          5. Patient can either be treatment naïve or have previously received up to 2 lines of
             systemic treatment (eg. Pazopanib or Sunitinib). The total number of metastases
             throughout the pre-trial period should not number more than 5.

          6. Must have had surgical consideration for metastasectomy and thought appropriate for
             SABR due to medical inoperability, technical factors or patient declining surgery.

          8. Be willing to provide archival tissue from a previously biopsied or excised primary or
             metastatic RCC lesion (if available). If safe to do so, a request for newly obtained
             specimen (obtained up to 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment) will be made,
             however participation for this biopsy is entirely optional.

             will be required.

         14. Female participants of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of
             birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the

             Section 9.4.2: Contraception). Participants of childbearing potential are those who
             have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         15. Male participants should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting
             with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Based on clinician assessment of disease volume and rate of progression of patient's
             tumor deposits, the patient requires immediate TKI therapy.

          2. Has had previous high dose radiotherapy (biological equivalent of 30Gy in 10#) to an
             area to be treated which includes vertebral bodies (see below).

             Note: Previous high dose radiotherapy is defined as a biological equivalent dose to
             above that of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using an alpha/beta ratio [82] of 3. Where a
             patient has received radiotherapy to an equivalent or lower dose than defined above,
             stereotactic radiotherapy of the area may be considered. In doing so, assessment of
             the volume and total dose received by any overlap region must be made, and documented
             by generating a cumulative plan incorporating both the previous and current treatment
             fields. It is the treating radiation oncologist's responsibility to review both the
             current plan and the cumulative plan inclusive of previous radiotherapy.

          3. Has evidence of untreated or active intracranial metastases. Patients who have had
             fully resected brain metastasis or those controlled by stereotactic radiotherapy are
             eligible as long as they are not requiring corticosteroids for symptomatic control.

          4. Has evidence of Spinal Cord Compression.

          5. Has a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ≥ 7 unless lesion reviewed by a
             neurosurgical service and considered stable (see Appendix 3).

          6. Requires surgical fixation of bone lesion for stability. This must be performed before
             enrollment into the trial.

          7. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of registration.

          8. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

          9. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

         10. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks of registration
             or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         11. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks of registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

             Note: Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
             may qualify for the study.

             Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
             the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

         12. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

         13. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four
             weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are
             not using steroids within 7 days of registration. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         14. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         15. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         16. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         17. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the participant's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment.

         20. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         21. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         22. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         23. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of registration
