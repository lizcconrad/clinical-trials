      This paper will present a specific tool for evaluation of cosmetic results after breast
      conserving surgery (BCS) and secondary breast reconstruction with free DIEP-flap.
      Introduction of a breast score system using digital photography seems to be a reliable tool
      for estimation of cosmetic results after breast surgery. The method has been employed on a
      specific group of 346 consecutive patients operated for breast cancer with breast conserving
      surgery. For the purpose of this study breast score system was tested on patients with free
      flap breast reconstruction (DIEP flap).

      Background: Validated instruments for assessing results after breast surgery are sparse.
      Investigators want to present a method used for the past 10 years at their institution for
      evaluation of the outcome after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and microsurgical breast
      reconstruction. Methods: 346 consecutive patients subjected to BCS for cancer and 30 patients
      operated with a deep inferior epigastric flap (DIEP ) were assessed at least one year after
      the operation. The Telemark Breast Score is a method based on standard two-dimensional
      photographs assessing the outcome after breast surgery in terms of volume, shape and
      symmetry. Three different panels including plastic surgeons, breast surgeons and nurses were
      invited to test the Telemark Breast Score. Consistency of agreement between and inside the
      panel groups was studied Results: Inter- and intra observer reliability was acceptable. Good
      stability of ratings could be shown in test-retests.

      Conclusion: The Telemark Breast Scale is inexpensive, statistically reliable and can be
      applied for quality control after breast surgery.
