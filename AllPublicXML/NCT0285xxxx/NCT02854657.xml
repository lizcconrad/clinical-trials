  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a continuation of a research program (STU00017005: Interventions to
      teach melanoma patients skin self-examination) designed to increase early detection of
      melanomas before they metastasize. In 2015, approximately 73,870 individuals in the U.S. will
      be diagnosed with invasive melanoma and about 9,940 will die from the disease. During
      2002-2011, melanoma incidence increased at an average annual rate of 1.6% for men and 1.5%
      for women. People with a history of melanoma have 10 times greater risk of developing a
      second primary melanoma relative to the general population.Early detection with surgical
      excision at an earlier stage when treatment is usually more effective is the only proven
      curative strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The completed R01 demonstrated preliminary evidence for a melanoma survivor and partner skin
      self-examination (SSE) training program resulting in regular and accurate SSEs relative to
      patients and partners receiving treatment as usual care. However, one caveat is that the
      patients and partners in the well-controlled study are potentially being cued to conduct the
      SSEs following training and reinforced for their actions. Whereas in &quot;real-world&quot; conditions
      the participants would see their dermatologist less frequently with significantly less cueing
      to conduct SSEs.

      This research addresses this limitation by examining the long-term influence of SSE training
      on SSE knowledge, self-efficacy, performance, and accuracy under real-world conditions for
      melanoma patients in the treatment group from the ongoing R01 study relative to controls (Aim
      1). In addition, the continuation study will also examine for whom the intervention works
      best under real-world conditions (Aim 2). Findings from clinical RCTs of behavioral
      interventions involving patients are rarely, if ever, examined to determine generalizability
      to real-world settings. The current proposal will contribute critical information to the
      scientific literature on the impact of early detection of melanomas using SSEs and will be
      the first to test the sustainability and long-term impact of an efficacious SSE intervention
      for early detection targeting melanoma survivors in real-world settings.
