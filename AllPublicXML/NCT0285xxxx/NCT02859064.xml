    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and cancers that originate from the gastrointestinal tract can
      be resistant to standard chemotherapy and often metastasize to the liver. Lanreotide
      (Somatuline® Depot) Injection and Yttrium-90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres®) each have FDA
      approval to treat patients with metastatic NETs. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      treatment for patients with NETs can be optimized by combining these therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, multi-center Phase II study for patients with metastatic
      well-to-moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, including typical carcinoid and
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, who are candidates for liver-directed radioembolization.

      Lanreotide (Somatuline® Depot) Injection, is FDA-approved for treating unresectable, well- or
      moderately-differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroentero-pancreatic
      neuro-endocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) to improve progression-free survival. Radioembolization
      with yttrium-90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres® therapy) is FDA-approved for treating liver
      metastases from colorectal cancer. While each of these individual treatments has had
      promising results, investigators hypothesize that treatment for patients with NETs can be
      optimized by co-administration of both therapies. Patients will receive treatment with
      lanreotide (120 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) in combination with SIR-Spheres therapy. The
      dose and treatment day of SIR-Spheres will be determined by the treating radiation
      oncologist. Patients who are currently receiving or have previously received lanreotide are
      eligible, and treatment with lanreotide can continue monthly until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Up to 25 patients are planned for enrollment to be conducted at
      approximately 5 investigational sites in the U.S.
