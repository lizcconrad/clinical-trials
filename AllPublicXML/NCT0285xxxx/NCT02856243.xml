  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryoglobulinemia are responsible for systemic vasculitis, and the most frequently targeted
      organs are the skin, joints, kidney and peripheral nervous system. Cryoglobulinemia
      vasculitides are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require therapeutic
      intervention. With the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the etiologic agent for most
      cases of mixed cryoglobulinemia new opportunities and problems for crafting therapy of HCV
      mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) have emerged. A new and major concern was the potential adverse
      effects that immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs could have on
      an underlying chronic viral infection. Alternatively the discovery of HCV provided the
      opportunity to control HCV-MC with antiviral therapy based on the belief that the underlying
      infection was driving immune complex formation and resultant vasculitis. Inducing a sustained
      virologic and clinical response and minimizing the use of immunosuppressive drugs are the
      main goals in the treatment of patients with HCV-MC vasculitis. Aggressive antiviral therapy
      has been shown to induce a complete remission of HCV-MC in up to 70% of patients. New
      antiviral combination, Interferon (IFN)-free regimens have recently proved very high
      virological response rate and with a very good safety profile and now need to be evaluated in
      severe and/or refractory HCV-MC patient's population.

    <description>The complete clinical response is defined by improvement of all the affected organs involved at baseline and the absence of clinical relapse. The skin and articular improvement will be evaluated clinically (i.e. disappearance of purpura and/or ulcers and/or skin necrosis, disappearance of arthralgia and/or arthritis). Renal improvement will be evaluated biologically (i.e. proteinuria &lt;0.3g/24h, disappearance of hematuria and improvement of Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 20% at week 24 if GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at diagnosis). Peripheral neurological improvement will be evaluated clinically (i.e. improvement of pains and paraesthesia by visual analogue scales, improvement of muscular testing in case of motor impairment at baseline) and/or electrophysiologically (i.e. improvement of electromyogram abnormalities at week 24 compared to baseline). The neuropathy total symptom score-6 (NTSS-6) will be applied to evaluate individual neuropathy sensory symptoms.</description>
