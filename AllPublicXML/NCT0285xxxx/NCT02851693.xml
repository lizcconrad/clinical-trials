  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of cutaneous lesions often involves the use of surgical and invasive procedures
      such as biopsy or excision in order to analyze the structure and appearance of the fabric
      pathologists. With recent advances in optical and electronic fields, considerable efforts
      were produced to build high-performance optical instruments, able to transcribe the internal
      structure of the skin with varying degrees of depth and variable resolution.

      The imagery is now an area of great interest for medical diagnosis: non-invasive, quick, and
      in real time. This area is booming and new optical instruments are created to eventually be
      able to offer a reliable alternative to invasive techniques.

      The optical properties of different tissues have been studied for several years by different
      research groups: the coefficient of light absorption by the tissue both in vivo and in vitro,
      the coefficient of light scattering or the index refractive were characterized in various
      tissues that make up the skin.

      Other studies have focused on melanoma detection by multispectral optical techniques, or via
      the technique of optical coherence tomography (OCT) performed on lesions suspicious for
      cancer, but without linking criteria between these two techniques.

      However, no study to date and to our knowledge has been able to demonstrate the different
      optical parameters obtained with OCT and can be directly connected to known and
      histopathological parameters commonly used in the diagnosis of lesions skin. This study aims
      to verify if it is possible to determine the parameters measured in OCT that would
      discriminate between benign and malignant lesions.
