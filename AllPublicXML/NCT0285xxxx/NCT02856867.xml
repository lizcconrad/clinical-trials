  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind phase II
      trial. The randomization will be a 1:1 randomization (experimental arm:control arm). This
      study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed esophagogastric adenocarcinoma with
      metastatic disease. Patients will have had no previous chemotherapy for metastatic
      esophagogastric cancer. Patients will receive nintedanib or placebo in combination with
      mFOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, 5-Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 continuous
      infusion over 46 hours starting on day 1, Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 on day 1, Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2
      on day 1) via IV infusions every 2 weeks (14 days). Dose modification of nintedanib or
      placebo and mFOLFOX6 is allowed. Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy as long as
      they have not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation of study
      medication and have not demonstrated disease progression.

      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that progression free survival (PFS) is
      prolonged in HER2-negative patients with untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma
      when treated with nintedanib plus modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) as compared to placebo plus
      mFOLFOX6. The analyses will be performed when 124 events for PFS will have been observed in
      the pooled arms.

             skin or pre-invasive cervical cancer).

          -  Other anti-cancer therapy (systemic therapy, radiotherapy, surgery) within 28 days
             prior to treatment start and while on protocol treatment.

          -  Treatment with another investigational agent within 28 days prior to treatment start
             and while on protocol treatment.
