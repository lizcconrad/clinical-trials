  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this intervention is to evaluate the effect of sensory imagination (i.e.,
      imagining the sensory properties of an object) on the choice of food portion size in
      school-aged children. Previous research showed that it may help children to choose smaller
      portion size. The investigators would like to assess whether this effect can be reproduced
      with two types of food (one with a high energy-density and one with a low energy-density),
      and in older children.

      School-aged children (8-11 years old) will be included in their usual schools to participate
      in an afternoon snack, organised according to regular arrangements, during two days separated
      by one week. On each day, the participants will receive a choice of three portion sizes of a
      food (small, medium, large), and will be asked to chose one of these portions and to eat it
      for snack. On one day, the high energy-density food will be offered; and on the other day,
      the low energy-density food. This will be counterbalanced across participants. Moreover, two
      groups of children will be constituted: the first group, the control group, will have to
      perform a sensory imagination task about neutral facts. The second group, the &quot;food sensory
      imagination&quot; group, will have to perform a sensory imagination task foods.

    <description>In both groups, children will be presented with pictures of items. In the control group, the pictures will represent landscapes at different seasons. In the experimental group, the pictures will represent a variety of foods. In the experimental group, based on the pictures representing a variety of foods, children will have to perform a food sensory imagination task before choosing the portion size of a food.</description>
