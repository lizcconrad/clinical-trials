      This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate the acute safety and effectiveness of
      ablation with the TactiCath™ Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™ (TactiCath SE)
      for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      (PAF). This clinical investigation will be conducted under an investigational device
      exemption (IDE) and is intended to support market approval of the TactiCath SE ablation
      catheter in the United States. One hundred fifty six (156) subjects will be enrolled at up to
      35 investigational sites in the US, Europe, and Australia. This clinical investigation is
      sponsored by Abbott.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm clinical trial to demonstrate the acute
      safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath SE catheter for the treatment of PAF against a
      performance goal. One hundred fifty six (156) subjects will be enrolled at up to 35
      investigational sites in the US, Europe, and Australia. Only sites that enroll at least one
      subject will be part of the analysis population. No center may contribute more than 20% of
      the total number of enrollments without sponsor pre-approval to exceed this proportion and at
      least 50% of subjects must be from the United States.

Atrial-esophageal fistula
AV block
Cardiac Perforation/ Tamponade

Diaphragmatic paralysis
Gastroparesis
Hospitalization
