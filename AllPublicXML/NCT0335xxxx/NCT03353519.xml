  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No formal primary care based model of care exists to support stroke survivors living in the
      community. A large variation in the range, quality and access to health services offered to
      stroke survivors between and within local clinical commissioning groups suggests that many of
      the stroke survivors' needs are not being met systematically. Therefore, to address the
      longer term needs we have developed a multi-factorial primary care model that seeks to enable
      greater engagement with stroke care and community services, to link effectively to specialist
      services, and to improve the lives of stroke survivors.

      This will be a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial. Participating general practices
      will be randomised to deliver either the new model of stroke care or current usual care. The
      aim of this trial will be to assess the clinical and long-term cost effectiveness of the new
      model of primary care for stroke survivors living in the community. The primary outcome for
      the trial will be measured using two sub-scales (emotion and handicap) of the Stroke Impact
      Scale questionnaire at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IPCAS trial is a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with general practices as
      the unit of randomisation. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the clinical and long-term
      cost effectiveness of a novel model of primary care for stroke survivors living in the
      community.

      People with a history of stroke on the registers of GP practices in the East of England and
      the East Midlands will be invited to take part. We will aim to recruit approximately 920
      people registered with 46 general practices. We will target Practices with a stroke register
      comprising a minimum of 100 patients, to ensure that we reach our cluster target of 16 - 24
      participants.

      Potentially eligible participants will be sent an invitation to take part in the study by
      their GP surgery. Once all invitation letters and reminders have been sent out to patients in
      a practice, the GP practice will be randomised. GP practices will be randomised in a ratio of
      1:1 to intervention or control. Intervention practices will deliver the new model of primary
      care. The control arm will consist of current usual care.

      Data collection will occur at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. This will comprise a
      combination of postal and telephone administered questionnaires and a review of general
      practice notes. The primary endpoint for the trial will be two sub-scales (emotion and
      handicap) of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS v3.0) as co-primary outcomes at 12 months (adjusted
      for baseline). Economic evaluation as well as quantitative and qualitative assessments of
      intervention fidelity will also be performed.

    <description>The primary endpoint for the trial will be two sub-scales (emotion and handicap) of the Stroke Impact Scale as co-primary outcomes. The SIS is a 59-item mail administered stroke-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure. Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale with answers based on the level of difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale Short Form (SIS-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after attendance at a review</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS Short Form consists of 8 items comprising one question from each of the SIS domains (strength, hand function, mobility, activities of daily living, memory, communication, emotion and handicap). Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale with answers based on the level of difficulty.</description>

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months after attendance at a review</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardised measure of health status suitable for health and economic appraisal. The responses to 5 dimensions can be combined to provide a 5 digit profile. The profile can be converted using a link function to a single index value which facilitates the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The questionnaire will be used to allow for economic evaluation.</description>

    <description>ICECAP-A is also used in economic evaluation. The ICECAP-A focuses on wellbeing defined in a broader sense rather than health. It comprises of 5 attributes: Attachment, Stability, Achievement, Enjoyment and Autonomy. Each attribute is judged on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from full capability to no capability.</description>
