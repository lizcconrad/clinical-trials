    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of dapaconazole tosylate 2% cream in the treatment
      of Tinea cruris compared to the active control miconazole nitrate 2% cream in patients with a
      single lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, non-inferiority, monocentric, double-blind, randomized (allocation of
      treatment), balanced, controlled (active comparator) trial, with two parallel groups.

      Randomization depended on inclusion/exclusion criteria, taking into account the confirmation
      of diagnosis by the direct mycological test and culture performed during the screening phase.

      Participants showed up to the clinic, for treatment, during 14 consecutive days, when one of
      the investigational products (according to the randomization) was applied by a blind member
      of the study staff. A non-blind member of the study staff weighed the corresponding
      investigational product and passed on to the blind member only a spatula with the weighed
      product, in order to maintain the blinded aspect of the trial.

      For exploratory purposes, clinical and mycological evaluations was also performed after 7 and
      after 14 days of treatment.

      Safety analysis was performed considering all the randomized patients to which at least one
      dose of the investigational products has been applied, regardless of the result of the fungal
      culture.

      Conclusion of non-inferiority was based on the per protocol set. It was deemed as per
      protocol those participants who did not miss more than 20% of the applications and, also, no
      more than four consecutive application days.

    <description>Proportion of participants, in each treatment group, who achieved therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical and mycological cure, on the assessment performed after 14 days of treatment.
Clinical cure was considered when there was no more scaling of the lesions, total absence of erythema, itching and desquamation.
Mycological cure was defined as negative result for the direct mycological examination (potassium hydroxide [KOH] test) and a negative fungal culture.</description>
