    <textblock>
      Wuchuan Osteoarthritis Study is a population-based longitudinal study of natural history of
      knee osteoarthritis and its risk factors. At baseline and follow-up visits, IPA-Q
      questionnaire and a radiographs at tibiofemoral (TF) joints will be taken in order to assess
      the relationship between physical activity and radiographic osteoarthritis worsening.

      1025 residents aged â‰¥ 50 years will be recruited using door-to-door enumeration in randomly
      selected rural communities in Wuchuan, China, and will be followed in 3 years. At baseline
      and follow-up visits, subjects will complete a home interview (including, but not limited to,
      socio-demographic factors, physical activity level using IPA-Q questionnaire,WOMAC
      questionnaire) and have a weight-bearing posteroanterior semiflexed view of radiographs at
      tibiofemoral (TF) joints. Radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) worsening for a knee is defined
      if its Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L) grade increases by at least 1 grade except for the change
      from 0 to 1 during follow-up. The relationship between level of physical activity and ROA
      worsening will be assessed.

    <description>The tibiofemoral radiograph of both knee joint will be taken at baseline and in 3 years. Knee radiographs will be read by one investigator according to Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L) criteria. A knee will be defined as ROA worsening if its K/L grade increased by at least 1 grade except for the change from 0 to 1 during follow-up.</description>
