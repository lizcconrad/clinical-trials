  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect human biological samples and measurements from people
      of various ethnic and racial backgrounds for projects related to the &quot;Mechanisms of
      Ethnic/Racial Differences in Lung Cancer Due to Cigarette Smoking&quot; Program Project Grant.
      These samples will be used to evaluate and compare biomarkers of tobacco exposure across
      Japanese Americans, Whites, and Native Hawaiians and to add to the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC)
      biorepository to develop or assess future biomarkers.

      This cross-sectional, observational study will primarily recruit smokers from the MEC study.
      The biological samples from these smokers are being collected since they do not currently
      exist in the biorepository (e.g. buccal cells). Potential smokers from the three racial
      groups who meet specific inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.
      Should recruitment from the MEC sample be insufficient, smokers who meet the criteria will be
      recruited from the general population. This study will involve one to two home visits where
      tobacco use and medical history and biological samples will be collected including blood,
      buccal cells and urine.

      Approximately 300 smokers will be recruited from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study or the
      general population in Hawai'i. 100 participants from each of the three designated
      ethnic/racial groups: Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites. All
      participants will be recruited from Hawai'i to reduce variation due to geographical location
      and maximize ability to recruit the targeted ethnic/racial groups.

      This study will involve one to two home visits where demographics, tobacco use and exposure
      history, medical history and medication use, questionnaires assessing tobacco dependence,
      alcohol use, and environmental exposures will be administered. and biological samples will be
      collected including blood, buccal cells and urine.

    <ipd_description>Intend to share findings from this research through publications and presentations. Institutions and individuals wishing to access any resources or data must contact the Principal Investigator (Hatsukami). Data will be available in two formats. One will be a summary of the data, with graphs and tables, posted as pdf files and as raw individual-level data for analysis. Data generated by this grant will be made to outside investigators, according to NIH Guidance. When data are shared, there will be no limits placed on how the data will be used, and co-authorship is not required as a condition for receiving data. Users will agree, however, that the recipient must not transfer the data to other users and that the data are only to be used for research purposes. A record of transfer of data and a copy of the dataset that was distributed will be kept by University of Minnesota.</ipd_description>
