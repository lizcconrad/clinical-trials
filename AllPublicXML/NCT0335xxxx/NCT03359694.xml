    <textblock>
      We plan to carry out a prospective, randomized, open phase III clinical trial which sponsored
      by the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital and Institute. The primary aim is to
      evaluate pCR of DT and ET regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2
      negative Luminal B breast cancers and the correlation of pCR respectively with the
      susceptible gene mutation scores and differential protein identified by proteomics. For
      patients with pCR, the association between the 5 year DFS and susceptible gene mutation
      scores and differential protein identified by proteomics will be evaluated. All Non-pCR
      patients will receive NX chemotherapy for 4 cycles, and to evaluate correlations between 5
      year DFS of these patients respectively with susceptible gene mutation scores and
      differential protein identified by proteomics, and to evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and sequential adjuvant NX regimen therapy. Meanwhile, we will verify
      susceptible gene mutation scores and differential protein identified by proteomics are
      significant predictors of HER2 negative Luminal B breast cancer chemotherapy sensitivity and
      prognosis, and explore the feasibility of susceptible gene mutation scores and differential
      protein in clinical application.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open phase III clinical trial which will be sponsored by
      the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital and Institute. The primary aim is to evaluate
      pCR of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Docetaxel (DT) Compared to Conventional
      Doxorubicin and Docetaxel (ET) regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2
      negative Luminal B breast cancers and the correlation of pCR respectively with the
      susceptible gene mutation scores and differential protein identified by proteomics. For
      patients with pCR, the association between the 5 year DFS and susceptible gene mutation
      scores and differential protein identified by proteomics will be evaluated. All Non-pCR
      patients will receive NX chemotherapy for 4 cycles, and to evaluate correlations between 5
      year DFS of these patients respectively with susceptible gene mutation scores and
      differential protein identified by proteomics, and to evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant
