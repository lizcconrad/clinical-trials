  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Listeriosis is a rare, severe foodborne infection, responsible for severe invasive
      infections. It occurs in the great majority of cases in elderly patients and / or patients
      with comorbidities, with a deficit of innate or cellular immunity. Pregnancy is also a risk
      factor.

      The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis of Listeriosis and Listeria (MONALISA) is an
      ongoing national case-control prospective study on listeriosis implemented since 2009 to
      study risk and prognosis factors for listeriosis. In this cohort, which enrolled 902 patients
      on 1 August 2014, 7% of patients with neurolisteriosis are under 40 years of age and have no
      identified risk factor. Genetic susceptibility is suspected in these patients. Genetic
      susceptibility could also explain the inconstant development of a neurolisteriosis or fetal
      infection, as well as the particular severity of some infections (death, foetal loss,
      neurological sequelae).

      The aim of the study is to identify genetic susceptibility to Listeriosis.

      Listeriosis is a rare, severe foodborne infection caused by the bacterium Listeria
      monocytogenes (Lm), responsible for severe invasive infections. It occurs in the great
      majority of cases in elderly patients and / or patients with comorbidities, with a deficit of
      innate or cellular immunity. Pregnancy is also a risk factor.

      The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis of Listeriosis and Listeria (MONALISA) is an
      ongoing national case-control prospective study on listeriosis implemented since 2009 to
      study risk and prognosis factors for listeriosis. In this cohort, which enrolled 902 patients
      on 1 August 2014, 7% of patients with neurolisteriosis are under 40 years of age and have no
      identified risk factor. Genetic susceptibility is suspected in these patients. Genetic
      susceptibility could also explain the inconstant development of a neurolisteriosis or fetal
      infection, as well as the particular severity of some infections (death, foetal loss,
      neurological sequelae).

      The analysis of the genetically transmitted vulnerability of Lm has not yet been studied,
      because of the lack of accessibility to prospective cohorts (and their DNA) for this rare and
      severe infection.

      The aim of the study is to identify genetic susceptibility to Listeriosis that will optimize
      the patient care in terms of treatment and prevention.

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with Listeriosis, the hypothesis that the identified genetic variation is the mutation responsible for the infection will be verified :
by verifying that it is not a listed polymorphism by sequencing genomic DNA controls
by verifiyng that family genetic segregation is compatible with clinical segregation
by verifying the function of the mutated protein in the patient's cell lines and / or fresh cells
by performing complementation experiments by transfecting the wild-type allele into the patient's cells</description>

    <measure>Identification of a susceptibility factor associated with the most severe or atypical forms</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with Listeriosis, the susceptibility factor associated with the most severe or atypical forms will be characterized :
By testing the response and production of cytokines involved in infection control.
By identifying chromosomal regions associated with the disease by a homozygosity mapping genetic study on multiplex and / or inbred families.
By sequencing the identified candidate genes.</description>
