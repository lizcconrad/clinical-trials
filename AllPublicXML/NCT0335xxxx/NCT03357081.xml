  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic and non-traumatic soft tissue hematomas are frequently encountered in the acute
      care setting. The incidence of these hematomas appears to be on the rise secondary to the
      increased use of anticoagulants among older patients for a variety of medical conditions.

      The management of soft tissue hematomas depends on the accurate diagnosis of any ongoing
      bleeding as well as of identification of the injured vessel type. While the majority of cases
      can be managed conservatively, expanding hematomas leading to hemodynamic instability or
      ongoing blood loss might require embolization or surgical intervention. The mainstay
      diagnostic imaging modality is multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with intravenous
      contrast that allows accurate assessment of hematoma size, location as well as evaluation for
      active extravasation. However, many patients cannot undergo CT imaging due to underlying
      kidney disease, allergy to contrast, or due to concerns for radiation exposure, especially in
      young age. Currently there are no alternative tests for these patients with a similarly high
      diagnostic accuracy available.

      This study intends to establish an imaging protocol and investigate the utility of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnostic work-up of soft tissue hematoma as an
      ionizing radiation-free alternative to computed tomography (CT) that can be used independent
      from the kidney function of the patient.
