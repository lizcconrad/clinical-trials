  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiovascular diseases from Guangdong province will be recruited and followed
      up for at least 4 years to evaluate the risk factors for cardiovascular-related mortality and
      disability. Physical examination, questionnaire survey and biological sample collection will
      be conducted at baseline and the incidence of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality will be
      investigated during follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      5,000 patients (30-85 years old) with primary hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart
      failure or peripheral vascular disease and who have been living in Guangdong province for
      more than 5 years will be recruited. All participants will be prospectively followed up for
      the incidence of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Information about socio-demographic,
      diet, lifestyle, psychological status, medical history and current medication will be
      collected by questionnaires. Physical examinations including height, weight, waist and hip
      circumferences, blood pressure, fat mass and vital capacity will be conducted.Besides, blood,
      urine and fecal samples will be collected for further analysis. The associations between diet
      and lifestyle and risks for cardiovascular disease will be evaluated.
