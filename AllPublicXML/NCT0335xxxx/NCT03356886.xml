  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The primary objective will be to investigate the additional effect (immediate and
      after one-month follow up) of pain neuroscience education (PNE) to Spinal Manipulative
      Therapy (SMT) on primary outcomes of pain intensity and disability in patients with chronic
      nonspecific low back pain (CLBP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: This study will be a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants: One
      hundred and four participants with CLBP (18 and 55 years) both genders. Interventions:
      Individuals included will be randomized into two possible treatment arms: PNE+SMT or SMT
      alone. Each treatment will last for 8 sessions. The group submitted to PNE+SMT will received
      in the first two initial sessions an individual face-to-face PNE program of 40 minutes.Main
      outcome measures: Pain intensity and low back pain-related disability will be adopted as
      primary outcomes and as secondary outcomes we will assess fear-avoidance, pain self-efficacy
      and global perceived effect of improvement. The outcomes will be assessed on three occasions:
      pre-intervention, immediately after 8 sessions of intervention and after one-month follow-up
      period. All statistical analysis will be conducted following the principles of intention to
      treat, and the effects of treatment will be calculated using linear mixed models. Discussion:
      This study will help to better understand if PNE -a psychosocial cognitive intervention- will
      add significant effect (immediate and at follow-up) to a movement therapy protocol based on
      manual therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>The recruited subjects will be randomized through the use of randomizer software in two groups of 52 individuals: SMT group which will receive PNE + SMT interventions or SMT alone. Both groups will be assessed at baseline (before the initial treatment session) by a blinded investigator. Immediately after the end of the last session and after the one-month follow-up, the primary outcomes and secondary outcomes will be re assessed. A single blinded investigator for the interventions administered will accomplish the assessment protocol. Another trained researcher (physiotherapist trained in SMT - 8 years of clinical experience) will administer the SMT maneuvers and a third researcher will be involved in the administration of the PNE. The treatment will last at least 8 sessions. The treatment will last at least 8 sessions lasting between 20 and 30 minutes each.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Once the patient has accepted the invitation to participate, the same researcher (FAGT) will gather the clinical assessment and determine eligibility. After this initial assessment, participants will be randomly assigned following simple computerized randomisation procedures to one of the two treatment groups through the use of cards previously placed in opaque sealed envelopes. The allocation sequence will be generated by a researcher (TCC) not involved in the assessment and interventions, and another research assistant will assign participants to interventions.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (before the initial treatment session), Immediately after the end of the last session and after the one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) used to assess pain intensity in this trial will consist in a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10, in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in low back pain Disability after the end and at 1 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before the initial treatment session), Immediately after the end of the last session and after the one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brazilian Portuguese version of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used to assess low back pain related disability. This instrument consists of 10 items, each of which has six response options. The total score will be calculated by summing up all the points, with the largest possible sum being 50. This sum will be transformed into a percentage by multiplying it by two.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the end of the last session and after the one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The global perceived effect (GPE) used for this trial is an 11-point scale that ranges from -5 (&quot;vastly worse&quot;) through 0 (&quot;no change&quot;) to +5 (&quot;completely recovered&quot;) and participants are asked: &quot;Compared to when this episode first started, how would you describe your back these days?&quot;. A higher score indicates higher perception of recovery from the condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fear Avoidance Beliefs after the end and at 1 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before the initial treatment session), Immediately after the end of the last session and after the one-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) adapted for Brazilian Portuguese consists of 16 self-response items, rated on a seven-point ordinal scale from 0 (completely disagree) to 6 (completely agree). The score is obtained for each separate subscale: one that addressed the fears and beliefs of individuals in relation to work and one that addressed their fears and beliefs about physical activities. As the content of PNE included topics about fear-avoidance, the construct will be assessed. A recent systematic review showed an association between baseline fear avoidance belief and worst levels of pain and disability as treatment outcome in chronic low back pain and showed that interventions that addressed FABs were more effective than others based on biomedical concepts.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a tool that can be used to systematically and thoroughly assess mental status. We used the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the tool. It is an 11-question measure that tests 5 areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of ≤22 is indicative of cognitive impairment. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to exclude cognitive impairment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) translated and validated to Brazilian Portuguese will be used. The scale is composed of 13 items staggered on 6-point ordinal scale (0-5). The total score is the sum of the items divided by the number of items answered, with the minimum score being 0 and the maximum being 5 for each item. Higher scores indicated a greater presence of catastrophic thoughts. The total score of the scale could vary between 0 and 52 points. A recent systematic review found that catastrophizing to be associated with pain and disability at follow-up in CLBP patients.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Self-Efficacy Scale - PSES</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants will be evaluated on self-efficacy related to chronic pain, which can be defined as an individual's confidence he/she can successfully produce desirable results related to living with chronic pain. The Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) has 10 items which are rated on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 0: &quot;not at all confident&quot; to 6: &quot;completely confident&quot;). It was adapted and validated to Brazilian Portuguese. Previous research showed an effect on self-efficacy using a PNE intervention based on metaphors compared to an intervention using cognitive-behavioral concepts.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HADS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS will be employed to identify anxiety disorders and depression. It was translated and validated into Portuguese. The HADS is divided into the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D), both containing seven interspersed items. It is composed of seven items for depression and seven items for anxiety, each item including four response options ranging from 0 to 3. A cutoff of ≥8 was described with good sensitivity and specificity values (0.70-0.90) for anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SBST questionnaire was translated to Brazilian Portuguese and its psychometric measurements were checked. The questionnaire is comprised of 9 items. For the purposes of scoring and classification, respondents were given answer options of &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;I disagree&quot; for the first 8 items, which were scored 1 and 0 points, respectively. For total scores greater than 3, classification was based on the psychosocial subscale score (items 5 to 9) as follows: scores ≤3 corresponded to medium risk and scores &gt;3 corresponded to high risk.</description>

    <description>This protocol of combined manipulation and mobilization techniques was adopted in view of the previous findings of a systematic review in which the combination of thrust mobilization and non-thrust techniques showed greater (moderate) evidence for chronic low back pain when compared to each technique alone (limited evidence). In addition, the thrust manipulation will be administered at the thoracic spine considering that a previous study found no differences in pain intensity after lumbar spine high-velocity manipulation versus non-region-specific manipulation in patients with chronic low back pain.</description>
