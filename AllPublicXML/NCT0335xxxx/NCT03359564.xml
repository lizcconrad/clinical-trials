      Evaluate the outcome of micro endoscopic discectomy (MED) by tubular retractors on safety and
      efficacy of the technique.Patients who underwent surgery for herniated disc using the tubular
      retractors. The results were evaluated by using VAS (Visual Analog Scale 0-5) for back and
      leg pain and ODI (Oswestry Disability Index). Patients were followed up at intervals of 1
      week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 2 years after surgery.
