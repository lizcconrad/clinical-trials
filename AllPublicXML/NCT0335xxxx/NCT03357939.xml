    <textblock>
      This healthy male volunteers study will evaluate 148 subjects who will receive a single
      sub-cutaneous dose of HLX03 （a monoclonal antibody against TNF-a, 40 mg/ 0.8 mL） or
      Adalimumab(Humira,China spourced,40 mg/0.8 mL injection with a single-use prefilled syringe).
      This study will involve sampling,pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity
      evaluation of drug levels following administration of HLX03 and the licensed adalimumab
      products.
