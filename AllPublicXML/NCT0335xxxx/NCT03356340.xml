      The &quot;Singapore Chinese Health Study&quot; is a cohort study established by the Department of
      Epidemiology and Public Health in National University of Singapore, together with
      collaborators from several universities in the United States of America. This is a long-term
      study to help doctors and scientists understand the influence of diet, lifestyle and
      environment on the development of common diseases among Singaporean men and women. This
      includes cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, high cholesterol and
      diabetes. The aim is to help us understand the causes of these diseases and to discover
      effective and efficient approaches for prevention and treatment.

      The cohort consists of more than 60,000 men and women who were enrolled in the Singapore
      Chinese Health Study during 1993-1998. At the time of enrollment, participants were
      interviewed in-person regarding their dietary habits and other lifestyle factors. About half
      of them also donated small amounts of blood and urine for research between 2000 and 2004.

      Beginning in April 1994, a 3% random sample of enrollees were re-contacted for donation of
      blood/buccal cells and spot urine specimens. In January 2001, the accrual of biospecimens was
      extended to include all consenting cohort enrollees. Hitherto, biospecimens have been
      collected from about 32,800 subjects (28,439 bloods, 4,438 buccal cells, 31,201 urines),
      representing a consent rate of about 60%.
