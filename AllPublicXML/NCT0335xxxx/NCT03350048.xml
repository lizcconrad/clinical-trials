      Title: Evaluation of host biomarker-based point-of-care tests for targeted screening for
      active TB (Screen TB)

      Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) places severe pressure on health care services of the
      developing world. Despite the introduction of the highly sensitive and specific GeneXpert
      MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) test [1] with a potential turn-around time of two hours, many people in
      high TB prevalence areas still do not have access to efficient TB diagnostic services due to
      logistical constraints in these settings. A cost effective, rapid, point-of-care screening
      test with high sensitivity would identify people with a high likelihood for active TB and
      would prioritize them for testing with more expensive, technically or logistically demanding
      assays including GeneXpert or liquid culture, facilitating cost-effective diagnostic work-up
      in resource-limited settings. A serum cytokine signature for active TB disease, discovered in
      the AE-TBC project, with a sensitivity of 89% (CI 78 - 95%) and specificity of 76% (CI 68 -
      83%), will be optimised and utilized in a point-of-care format (TransDot) to rapidly test for
      TB disease in symptomatic people.

      Hypothesis: The TransDot test will achieve a sensitivity of &gt; 90% for TB disease, in a
      training set of people suspected of having TB disease, and be validated (achieve similarly
      high sensitivity) subsequently in a prospective test set of people suspected of having TB
      disease, when compared to a composite gold standard of sputum culture, smear, GeneXpert,
      chest X-ray, TB symptoms and TB treatment response.

      Objectives: The overall objective of the study is to incorporate a six-marker serum signature
      into a multiplex UCP-LFA format, referred to as TransDot, for finger-prick blood testing. The
      end point of the study is the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the UCP-LFA TransDot
      test on finger-prick blood for active TB and will be prospectively compared against gold
      standard composite diagnostic criteria (GeneXpert, MGIT culture, TB sputum smear, CXR, TB
      symptom screen and response to TB treatment).

      Primary: The primary outcome of interest will be accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the
      TransDot finger-prick test when compared with the composite gold standard tests.

      Protocol Summary Title: Evaluation of host biomarker-based point-of-care tests for targeted
      screening for active TB (Screen TB)

      Population: A total of 800 people presenting at primary health care clinics with presumed
      active pulmonary tuberculosis, aged 18 to 70 years, male or female gender, will be recruited.
      They should be willing to give informed, written consent, including consent for HIV testing.
      They should have symptoms that could be compatible with active TB (cough &gt; two weeks, plus at
      least one of the following: fever, weight loss, haemoptysis and night sweats). Participants
      should not have been on TB treatment for the past 90 days and should not have received immune
      suppressive therapy, be known with alcohol of drug abuse, have a haemoglobin level &lt;9g/dl or
      be pregnant or breastfeeding. HIV co-infection is not an exclusion criterion. Participants
      will be recruited from primary health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa, Windhoek in
      Namibia, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Banjul in The Gambia and Kampala in Uganda.

      Number of Sites: Five sites

      Study Duration: 3 years

      Subject Duration: 18 months for TB cases, 2 months for non-TB cases

      Objectives:

      The overall objective of the study is to incorporate a six-marker serum signature into a
      multiplex UCP-LFA format, referred to as TransDot, for finger-prick blood testing. The end
      point of the study is the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the UCP-LFA TransDot test
      on finger-prick blood for active TB and will be prospectively compared against gold standard
      composite diagnostic criteria (GeneXpert, MGIT culture, TB sputum smear, CXR, TB symptom
      screen and response to TB treatment).

        Adult participants with suspected active TB disease will be recruited in South Africa, the
        Gambia, Uganda, Namibia and Ethiopia. Each site will recruit approximately 160 participants
        with suspected TB, until the desired overall total of about 800 participants is reached. In
        South Africa, up to 300 participants will be recruited from primary health care clinics
        (Adriaanse, Elsiesriver, Uitsig, Ravensmead, Fisantekraal, Durbanville and Dunoon) in Cape
        Town.

        Patients presenting to the health care facility with symptomatic pulmonary disease and a
        high likelihood of having tuberculosis will be enrolled and followed up for outcome
        classification. Participants who had previous TB, extra-pulmonary TB in addition to
        pulmonary TB, drug resistance detected on GeneXpert or culture or other concomitant
        diseases, will not be excluded from enrolment. Both HIV positive and HIV negative
        individuals will be enrolled.
