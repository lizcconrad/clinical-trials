  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the first non-traumatic cause of disability in young people,
      responsible for physical but also cognitive deficits. MS is an inflammatory demyelinating and
      degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Recently, MRI technics have demonstrated
      their sensibility to the different processes involved in MS. Particularly, MRI has evidenced
      that the pathological process of MS is not restricted to the macroscopic lesions of the white
      matter but also involves the normal appearing white and grey matter. In the normal appearing
      brain tissue, demyelination, neuronal suffering and neuronal loss have been evidenced.
      Moreover, MRI has demonstrated the existence of brain functional reorganization processes
      that may limit the clinical expression of pathological injuries. Despite these important
      findings, the pathological underpinnings of irreversible disability are largely unknown. The
      present project aims to depict the main determinants of physical but also cognitive
      disability in patients with MS. To do this, a longitudinal study including 70 patients with
      MS using different MRI markers known to be sensitive to the different pathological aspects of
      MS will be performed. The relationships between these markers and the progression of
      disability will be assessed. Identification of the main pathological underpinnings of
      irreversible disability of MS will provide the most relevant therapeutic targets.
