  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has found that there is moderate evidence for the use of breathing exercises
      for treating chronic, non-specific low back pain. Researchers have found that there were
      significant improvements in pain and quality of life in those suffering with low back pain
      who completed a breathing program intervention. Researchers also found that healthy
      individuals had higher pain thresholds and tolerance following deep and slow breathing
      exercises.

      There are numerous formats of breathing interventions, some interventions that have been used
      with individuals with chronic, non-specific low back pain include: deep breathing, yoga
      breathing, resisted inspiration, and breathe holding. There is moderate evidence to suggest
      the use of these interventions for managing chronic low back pain Another common breathing
      format is Equal-Ratio Breathing. This format requires an individual to inhale and exhale with
      the same duration while gradually increasing the duration of both. This breathing format can
      be easier for patients to perform given the simplicity of the equal inhalation to exhalation
      ratio.

      This research is being done because Equal-Ratio Breathing has yet to be studied in
      individuals with chronic low back pain.

    <description>Blood pressure recorded at baseline, immediately pre- and post-trial
Maximum Tolerable Breathing Ratio: Test run to determine the maximum tolerable time for inhalation and exhalation.
PRESSURE TOLERANCE: Pressure algometer device used to determine pain pressure tolerance. It will be applied to the first dorsal interosseous and deltoid, and pain pressure tolerance will be measured and recorded. Pressure will be applied at 1kg per second until the patient indicates that the pressure has become painful. Pain pressure tolerance will be performed 3 times at each anatomical location and an average will be determined for each location.
TRIAL: Participants will begin 5 minutes of Equal Breathing at their maximum tolerable equal breathing ratio that was previously determined. Immediately after 5 minutes of breathing, the pain pressure tolerance will be measured using pressure algometry</description>
