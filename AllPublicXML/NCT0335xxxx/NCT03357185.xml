  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endarteriectomy is considered as the first line treatment of femoral bifurcation atheromatous
      lesions. Eversion technique, similar to that used for carotid bifurcation, is safe and
      possible for the majority of the femoral tripod lesions. The major advantage of the eversion
      technique is the absence of prosthetic material to be performed. However, its use has been
      scarcely evaluated in the literature to date. This work aims at evaluating the long term
      safety and the efficacy of eversion femoral technique. Surgical technique was thoroughly
      described and participants were followed up for two years by serial clinical and doppler US
      examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral bifurcation lesions is one of the most frequent lesion encountered in lower limb
      atheromatous occlusive disease. Current treatment options consists in femoral endarteriectomy
      or bypass. More recently, endovascular treatment of femoral tripod lesions has been reported.
      Inguinal area is prone to postoperative infection in up to 20% of the cases. Hence, the use
      of synthetic graft puts the participants at risk of dramatic consequences in case of
      postoperative infection. Besides, long term data are still required to validate the use of
      endovascular device in this very &quot;surgical&quot; area. The use of the eversion technique is
      possible in the majority of the lesions and offer the major advantage of open surgery in
      terms of durability, without the use of synthetic material in case of postoperative
      infection.

      The investigators herein report the detailed technique, tips and variations of the eversion
      technique as well as the clinical follow up in terms of clinical benefit according to
      Rutherford classification and restenosis evaluated by serial doppler US.

    <description>The purpose of this database is to compile the data of patients followed at the René Dubos Hospital Center with symptomatic lower extremity arterial disease (AOMI) (Rutherford 2 to 5) who were operated on by the femoral tripod eversion technique.
The database will include data on the operation, possible complications, clinical course of patients and medical and surgical follow-up.</description>
