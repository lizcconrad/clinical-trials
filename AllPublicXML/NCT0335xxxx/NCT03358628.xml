  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By obtaining clinical specimens from participants with high-grade bone and soft tissue
      sarcomas to establish and profile as freshly implanted tumors in mice, the aim of this study
      is to identify agents with predicted activity in the host patient while also potentially
      providing them with individualized cancer treatment options

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are increasingly used as tools for drug development in
      pre-clinical settings, and have been shown to recapitulate the histology and behavior of the
      cancers from which they are derived. Although, they have been commonly used productively as
      pre-clinical disease models to study disease biology and drug response, they have not been
      used prospectively to inform clinical management. PDX have been employed to inform clinical
      decision-making in small studies, which have shown high concordance between individual PDX
      and patient responses to therapy. While encouraging, the role of this approach in bone and
      soft tissue sarcomas and in the context of genomic drug matching strategies remains
      undefined. This has created an opportunity to evaluate the utility of PDX as clinical
      predictors to direct the use of chemo- and targeted therapies in combination with
      comprehensive genomic and epigenetic analysis for patients with bone and soft tissue
      sarcomas.
