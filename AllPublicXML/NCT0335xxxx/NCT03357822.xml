    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective real-world study is to evaluate whether sequential combination
      therapy with pegylated interferon plus entecavir/tenofovir could induce higher rates of HBsAg
      loss in nucleoside-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to continuous
      nucleoside treatment.

      Patents who were treated with NA at least one year and achieved hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA
      suppression and HBsAg level&lt;3000 international unit (IU) /mL are enrolled in this study, they
      are assigned into two groups, in group I, patients will receive pegylated interferon plus
      entecavir/tenofovir for 48/72/96 weeks, in group II, patients will receive
      entecavir/tenofovir for 96 weeks. HBsAg loss rates at the end of treatment and sustained
      response at the end of follow up will be evaluated.
