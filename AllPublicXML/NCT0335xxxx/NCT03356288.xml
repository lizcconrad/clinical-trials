  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the use of a new handheld device (called the N-Tidal C), that measures a
      person's tidal breath carbon dioxide, in diagnosing the cause of someone's breathlessness. It
      will also evaluate whether this device can detect when a person's breathing problem is
      getting worse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a person breathes out, they exhale carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 levels in breath change
      as they breathe out and this makes a specific pattern, or &quot;waveform&quot;. This waveform can tell
      a clinician a lot about the underlying health of a person. There are disease specific CO2
      waveforms for common breathing conditions such as Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). However up until this point there has been no accurate and non-invasive
      method of measuring the tidal breath CO2 waveform.

      This study will test the N-Tidal C, a new handheld device that accurately measures this
      waveform, and whether it can differentiate different causes of breathlessness; namely asthma,
      heart failure, pneumonia, breathing pattern disorders and motor neurone disease.
