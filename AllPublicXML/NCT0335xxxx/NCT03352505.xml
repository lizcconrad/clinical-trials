  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will analyze if exercise is able to elicit the well-known anti-atherogenic
      effects in patients with SCI. This will be evaluated by measuring vascular parameters such as
      endothelial and inflammatory blood markers, echocardiography of the heart and peripheral
      vessels, as well as blood pressure and arterial stiffness, in subjects performing either
      wheelchair dancing, wheelchair marathon or no sports. Further, it will be investigated,
      whether there is an association between neuroplasticity and cardiovascular health, as
      measured by electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and blood
      levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

      We hypothesize that the cardiovascular, physical and psychological benefits of wheelchair
      dancing and/or wheelchair marathon parallel improved neuroplasticity in SCI-patients
