    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of 2-drug (DA) or 3-drug (IDA) regimens on lymphatic
      filariasis infection parameters in communities. Parameters measured will include: circulating
      filarial antigenemia (CFA) assessed with the Filariasis Test Strip (FTS), antifilarial
      antibodies tested with plasma and microfilaremia (assessed by night blood smears and
      microscopy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from clinical trials in Papua New Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire have shown that a single
      dose of three drugs (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole [IDA]) was superior to
      standard two drug therapy (diethylcarbamazine and albendazole [DA]) in clearing W. bancrofti
      microfilaremia (MF) (King et al. unpublished data).1 Recently, large safety studies that
      treated more than 23,000 participants across four countries were conducted to determine if
      IDA was safe for use in mass drug administration (MDA) (DOLF Project, unpublished data).
      Currently, there is no information about what community indicators of infection look like
      following shorter IDA programs. It is possible that current WHO guidelines for stopping MDA
      need to be modified for MDA programs that use IDA. Observing the levels of infection
      indicators in a community following treatment with IDA will provide important information to
      the GPELF if IDA is recommended for use in MDA programs. There is an opportunity to study
      communities that were treated with IDA during the &quot;Community Based Safety Study of 2-drug
      (Diethylcarbamazine and Albendazole) versus 3-drug (Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazine and
      Albendazole) Therapy for Lymphatic Filariasis&quot;. Communities in this study were randomly
      assigned to receive IDA or DA treatment. A large percentage of individuals in these
      communities participated in the study thereby approximating a mass distribution of the
      treatments. By surveying these communities 12 months following their initial treatment the
      investigators will be able to better understand and compare the impact of MDA with IDA or DA
      on LF infection parameters at the level of communities.
