  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that children completing 30 sessions of occupational therapy
      using a sensory integration approach (OT-SI) will demonstrate positive changes in outcome
      measures related to motor coordination, functional performance and sensory processing
      (changes pre-post test).

    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment Scaling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a way to develop individual goals for a patient that can be measured over the course of intervention using a standardized scale. Goals are rated on a 5-point scale and criteria for each level is established prior to starting treatment. While each patient has individual goals that are meaningful to him/her and his/her family, the outcome measurement scale is standardized so that it can be used for statistical analysis with other patients' goals. The expected level of outcome is established at initial goal setting, and 0 is used to rate an outcome where a patient achieves the expected level. If patient achieves a better than expected outcome, the score can be +1 (somewhat better) or +2 (much better). If patient achieves a worse outcome than expected, the score can be -1 (somewhat worse) or -2 (much worse). GAS goals are identified during semi-structured interview with patient and/or caregivers, and 3-4 goals are set and weighted by importance.</description>
