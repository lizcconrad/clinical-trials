  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cells
      (MSCs) from adipose anticular injection in comparison with hyaluronic acid anticular
      injection in the treatment of human knee osteoarthritis(OA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, quadruple blined, randomized controlled clinical trials with a total
      of 14 knee osteoarthrits patients as participants, who will be randomly assigned into
      experiment group or compare group.Participants in experiment group will receive the treatment
      of MSCs from adipose anticular injection, while participants in compare group will receive
      hyaluronic acid. Unexplained local and systemic symptoms as well as visual analog scale pain
      score, WesternOntario McMasterUniversities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index scorewill be assessed
      at baseline and 2 years after the injection.

    <description>The severity of AE must be recorded and graded according to the CTCAE criteria, and its relationship to therapy must be assessed according to the following definition:①not related: there is evidence that the cause of adverse events is not due to intra-articular injection therapy (such as previous conditions, potential diseases, concurrent diseases); ②related: AE and intra-articular injection are time-related and it is known or suspected that intra-articular injection of drugs can cause the AE; ③it can't be assessed.</description>
