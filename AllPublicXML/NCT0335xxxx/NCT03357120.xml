  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial assessing the prognostic value of ctDNA mutations from samples taken sequentially in
      patients with invasive breast cancer initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      whose tumor is not in complete histological response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an invasive breast cancer on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with the exception of
      cT2cN0 tumors) are preselected before the surgical procedure. They are definitely included
      during the post-surgery visit following the analysis of the surgical specimen (only patients
      whose tumor did not achieve a complete pathological response are included).

      Sequential plasma samples for ctDNA mutations analysis will be taken during the post-surgery
      visit (within 2-5 weeks after surgery) and every 6 months (+/- 1 month) thereafter for 5
      years.

      In case of relapse patients will be proposed to participate to an optional research program
      with a blood test for ctDNA assessment and biopsies from a metastasis (when these biopsies
      are clinically indicated).

In case of relapse patients will be proposed to participate to an optional research program with a blood test for ctDNA assessment and biopsies from a metastasis (when these biopsies are clinically indicated). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis will be performed on post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy residual tumor tissue samples. The mutations identified by NGS in residual tumor will be tracked in ctDNA using personalized digital PCR (dPCR) or by an NGS technique whose bioinformatics pipeline is adapted to the analysis of ctDNA.

                    -  or cN2 or cN3 whatever the cT.

             cancer, including a history of contralateral invasive breast cancer. However, patients

             cancer treated in situ are eligible.

          6. Patient unable to follow and comply with research procedures for geographical, social
             or psychological reasons.
