  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of a solar lighting system on kerosene lamp use, levels of
      indoor air pollution, and health in women living in rural Uganda. Half of the participants
      will receive the lighting systems immediately, while the other half will receive them after
      an 18 month delay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One fifth of the global population relies on kerosene lamps for lighting, yet few studies
      have focused on kerosene lighting as a source of indoor air pollution. In our preliminary
      studies performed in Uganda, we show that homes using solar lighting have much lower levels
      of indoor air pollution compared to homes using kerosene lighting. The primary goal of this
      study is to determine the extent to which solar lighting will reduce kerosene use and indoor
      air pollution in rural Uganda, whether this intervention improves lung health, and to
      identify the role bacteria in our gut have on determining whether or not people will get sick
      from indoor air pollution.
