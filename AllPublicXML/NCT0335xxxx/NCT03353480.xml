  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) initiated a generic consistency evaluation program
      to evaluate the quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China in 2016. This is a
      reference scaled bioequivalence study to support the program and to demonstrate the
      bioequivalence between the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China
      (the localized originator, Test) and the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer
      Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US (the originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under
      fasted and fed conditions. This open-lable, randomized, single-dose 3-way crossover study
      will enroll approximately 33 subjects for each condition. The primary endpoints are
      azithromycin area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours
      post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.

      This is a reference scaled bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation
      program, initiated by CFDA in 2016, for the evaluation of quality and efficacy of the
      products manufactured in China. The selected strength of 250 mg tablet is the approved
      strength. The primary objective is to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the 250 mg
      azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator, Test) and
      the 250 mg azithromycin tablet manufactured at Pfizer Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US (the
      originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted (Group 1) and fed (Group 2)
      conditions. Approximately 33 Chinese healthy subjects will be enrolled for each group.

      The primary endpoints are azithromycin area under the serum concentration-time curve from
      time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of azithromycin
      administered as a single oral dose of 250 mg tablet manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China and
      250 mg tablet manufactured at Pfizer Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, US in healthy Chinese subjects
      under fasted and fed conditions. And the secondary endpoint is adverse events (AEs). Other
      endpoints include Tmax of azithromycin, safety laboratory tests and vital signs.

      In each group, subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment sequences. Each
      treatment sequence will consist of 3 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 14
      days between each period.

      On Day 1 of each period in both groups, each subject will be administered investigational
      product at approximately 8:00 AM (± 2 hours). Blood samples for the analysis of azithromycin
      in serum will be collected at pre-dose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2,
      3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post dose in each period. Vital signs, physical
      examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at
      specified times. Tolerability and safety will be assessed for all treatments by monitoring
      AEs.

        the study:

          1. Healthy Chinese male and female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 45 years,
             inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a
             detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure (BP) and
             pulse rate (PR) measurement, 12-lead ECG, or clinical laboratory tests.

          2. BMI of 18 to 28 kg/m2; and a total body weight ≥50 kg for males and ≥45 kg for
             females.

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          5. Subjects must be of Chinese ethnicity (individuals currently residing in mainland
             China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics/conditions will not be included in the
        study:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          3. A positive urine drug screen, history of drug abuse within the past 5 years.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week (1 drink = 100 mL of
             wine or 285 mL of beer or 25 mL of hard liquor) within 3 months of Screening.

          5. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day within 3 months prior to Screening.

          6. Treatment with an investigational drug within 3 months preceding the first dose of
             investigational product.

          7. Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least
             5 minutes of rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to
             determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or
             a QRS complex &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects who are unwilling
             or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this
             protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             investigational product.

         10. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or with positive pregnancy test at Screening and
             during the study period.

             used at doses of ≤1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not
             believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted
             on a case by case basis following approval by the sponsor. Taking any medicinal
             product that changes the activity of hepatic enzymes within 28 days prior to
             Screening, such as a strong CYP3A4 inducer (eg, St. John's Wort).

         12. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) or loss of blood of approximately 450 mL
             or more within 3 months prior to Screening.

         13. History of hypersensitivity to azithromycin or any components of its formulation.

         14. Use of special diet (including dragon fruit, mango, citrus, etc.), strenuous

         16. Use of products containing alcohol within 48 hours prior to dosing.

         17. Intolerance of the standard high fat breakfast, which is only applicable to the
             subjects participating in Group 2 (fed condition).

         18. History of HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive testing for HIV, HepBsAg,
             HepBcAb, HCVAb, or TPPA.

         20. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         21. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
