        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis (including,
             hemodiafiltration, hemodialysis, and other modalities except for peritoneal dialysis)
             weekly or more than weekly

          -  Body weight &gt; 40 and ≤ 160 kg at screening

          -  Male or female subject ≥ 20 years of age at screening

          -  At least one kidney

          -  Not treated with ESAs and/or HIF-PH inhibitors within 8 weeks prior to randomization.
             However, in case of the patient washed out from ESAs, when the mean Hb (at least 2
             central laboratory measurements must be taken ≥ 2 days apart before dialysis) has
             decrease to ≥ 0.5 dL from the Hb level (central laboratory measurement, before
             dialysis) after the last ESA administration, AND the interval from the last ESA
             administration to the study drug assignment was over 1 week for epoetin-alpha, 2 weeks
             for darbepoetin alpha or 4 weeks for epoetin beta pegol

          -  Mean of the last 2 Hb level (central laboratory measurement, before dialysis) during
             the screening period must be ≥ 8.0 and &lt; 10.0 g/dL (2 measurements must be taken ≥ 2
             days apart and the difference between the 2 measurements must be &lt; 1.2 g/dL) with the
             last screening Hb measurement within 14 days prior to study drug assignment

          -  Ferritin ≥ 50 ng/mL at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  History of cardio- (cerebro-) vascular events (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction, stroke, pulmonary thromboembolism, and acute limb ischemia) within 6
             months prior to randomization

          -  Sustained and poorly controlled arterial hypertension (defined as systolic BP≥ 180mmHg
             or diastolic BP ≥ 110mmHg) or hypotension (defined as systolic BP &lt; 90mmHg) at
             randomization

          -  Proliferative choroidal or retinal disease, such as neovascular age-related macular
             degeneration or proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring invasive treatment (e.g.,
             intraocular injections or laser photocoagulation)
