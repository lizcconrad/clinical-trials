    <description>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ +12). There are 32 questions in 4 different domains (Symptoms, Activity Limitation, Emotional Function, and Environmental Stimuli). Each of the questions is scored on a 7 point scale. The scale range is from 1-7. 7 is no impairment, 1 is severe impairment. The overall score is the mean of all 32 responses, and the individual domain scores, are the mean of the items in the domains.</description>
