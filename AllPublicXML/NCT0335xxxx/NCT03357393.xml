  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      bronchoscopy - a randomized controlled trial&quot; (EudraCT number: 2015-005274-38, protocol
      number: &quot;BRONSE&quot;) is a phase IV single centre prospective randomized controlled trial with
      parallel groups. A total of 150 adult outpatients undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy during
      sedation and are randomized into three sedation arms (1:1:1); sedation with midazolam and
      morphine-scopolamine as premedication (clinical routine), sedation with propofol using PCS
      and morphine-scopolamine as premedication, and sedation with propofol using PCS and
      glycopyrronium bromide as premedication. The study is partially blinded, the bronchoscopist
      is blinded regarding given premedication for patients given PCS (two sedation arms). The
      hypothesis is that PCS increase the amount of patients ready for discharge, and further that
      patient characteristics affect the amount of propofol administered. The endpoints are
      primarily the amount of patients ready for discharge within 2 hours and secondary assessment
      of patient recovery and satisfaction as well as bronchoscopist evaluation and doses of
      administrated drugs. Finally safety variables are collected such as vital signs and
      interventions performed to maintain cardiovascular and respiratory stability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Discharge assessment using PADSS after 2 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after bronchoscopy is finished</time_frame>
    <description>Post Anaesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS).A measurement of the PADSS score is done by pulmonary nurse every 15 min after bronchoscopy is finished (when bronchoscope is removed) for 2 hours. The PADSS is used to clinically assess if the patient is ready to be discharged after anaesthesia/sedation and consist of five criteria: vital signs, ambulation, nausea and/or vomiting, pain and surgical bleeding. Each criterion is given a score ranging from 0 to 2. Only patients who achieve a total score of 10 are considered ready for discharge after 2 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of self-rated patient questionaries' using S-PSR</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment is done by the patient at home (or at ward if pro-longed hospital stay is necessary) in the evening on the day of bronchoscopy. It takes approximately 2 minutes to complete the questionnaire.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-discharge Surgical Recovery Scale (S-PSR) The modified Swedish version S-PSR is based on the &quot;Post-discharge Surgical Recovery Scale&quot; and is a 14-item questionnaire to assess the recovery post-discharge regarding the patients' health status and activity (see further appendix 2). Each item is rated using a semantic differential scale and the total sum is multiplied by 100. The possible range is 10-100, with higher score indicating a more favourable postoperative recovery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of self-rated patient questionaries' using QoR-23</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment is done by the patient at home (or at ward if pro-longed hospital stay is necessary) in the morning the day after bronchoscopy. It takes less than 1 minute to complete the assessment.</time_frame>
    <description>Modified version of Quality of Recovery (QoR-23) The questionnaire &quot;Quality of Recovery&quot; (QoR-23) is a 23 item questionnaire to assess recovery after day surgery regarding the patients' emotional state, physical comfort and physical independence (see further appendix 4). Each item is rated on a five-point scale (1-5) and the scores are summed. A higher score indicate a better quality of recover</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' satisfaction using a Likert-type scale</measure>
    <time_frame>After patient has recovered after bronchoscopy and before discharge home, estimated period of time 0-24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>overall satisfaction with the procedure using the Likert-type scale (1. Very dissatisfied, 2. Dissatisfied, 3. Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4. Satisfied, 5. Very satisfied). The patient may comment any cause which made the satisfaction score high or low and if the patient would like to receive the same method of sedation during a future bronchoscopy.</description>
