  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and provide preliminary reliability and validity of a
      questionnaire to measure Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in adolescents with
      psoriasis. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first psoriasis-specific HRQOL
      instrument for use in adolescent patients. Data will be collected from a Danish population of
      adolescents with psoriasis (12-17 years), as well as from parents of adolescents with
      psoriasis, and a group of adolescents without psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will examine the psychometric properties of a preliminary 41-item version
      of the PsoTeenQOL. The preliminary PsoTeenQOL has been developed based on qualitative
      interviews of adolescents (12-17 years) with psoriasis, their parents, and health
      professionals working within the field, as well as literature reviews and existing
      questionnaires. Face and content validity has been established through subsequent cognitive
      interviews with the target group.

      Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and analysis of differential item functioning (DIF) will be
      used to further refine the PsoTeenQOL questionnaire by selecting the most appropriate items.
      In addition, indicators of reliability (internal consistency; test-retest reliability),
      validity (construct validity, criterion validity; discriminant validity), and responsiveness
      will be evaluated.

        To achieve maximum variation in participant demographic and clinical characteristics,
        eligible participants with psoriasis plus their parents will be identified through several
        sites; a) the Danish Psoriasis Association, b) the National Danish Birth Cohort, and c) all
        five tertiary hospital clinics in Denmark. All adolescents without psoriasis will be
        recruited from the National Danish Birth Cohort.
