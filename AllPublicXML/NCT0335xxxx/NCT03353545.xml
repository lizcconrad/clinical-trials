  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of real-world evidence studies stems from the following considerations. The
      study population of a specific clinical trial needs to meet strict inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, which result in a population of participants that is not necessarily representative
      of the study population of interest treated in routine care. Furthermore, the outcomes of a
      clinical trial occur under controlled conditions that do not necessarily reflect the routine
      healthcare practice. This is especially true among patient populations with challenging to
      treat disease such as in MM, where personalized therapeutic approaches are commonly
      considered taking into consideration the patients' age and associated comorbidities, among
      other factors. In addition, observational studies, due to their non-interventional nature,
      often show increased degree of heterogeneity across the enrolled patient populations compared
      to clinical studies, thus aiding generalizability of the results.

      In light of the above and due to the scarcity of evidence regarding the outcomes for patients
      with RRMM receiving Pom/LoDex in routine clinical practice, this retrospective chart review
      and prospective observational study aims to assess the PFS and response to treatment as well
      as to obtain real-world evidence on the utilization patterns and management strategy of
      Pom/LoDex in routine clinical care settings in Greece.

      This is a non-interventional, multicenter, single-country, retrospective chart review and
      prospective cohort study which will include a representative sample of patients with RRMM who
      have been initiated on Pom/LoDex between 01 January 2016 and 28 February 2019 in the third
      line and beyond treatment setting under routine care conditions in Greece.

      The study will be carried out by hospital-based hematology specialists practicing in
      geographically diverse locations throughout Greece and will be conducted under real-world
      conditions of daily clinical practice.
