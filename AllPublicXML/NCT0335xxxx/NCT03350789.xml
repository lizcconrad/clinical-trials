      This research is planned to build a basis about the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture on
      pain and emotional disorder in patients with chronic sciatica using fMRI.

      Clinical research to assess the effect of acupuncture for chronic sciatica on pain and
      emotional disorder will be processed with randomized, patient-assessor blinding, and
      sham-acupuncture controlled study design. Sixty eight subjects would be collected and divided
      into two groups(experimental and placebo, 34 subjects each). Experimental group will undergo
      with real acupuncture treatment(manual acupuncture + electroacupuncture) and placebo group
      will undergo with sham acupuncture treatment (acupuncture without skin penetration +
      electroacupuncture without electrical stimulation) twice a week, for 4 weeks. The effect on
      parameters related with pain and emotional disorder will be assessed at 1(baseline: just
      before the beginning of treatment) and 5(primary end point: 1 week after the end of
      treatment) weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be also conducted for 52
      subjects(experimental and placebo, 20 among 34 subjects each + normal control 12 subjects) at
      1 and 5 weeks to seek machanism of acupuncture.
