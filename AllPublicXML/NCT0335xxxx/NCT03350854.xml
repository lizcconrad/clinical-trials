  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effects of the Patient Preference Scale as the basis
      for a clinical intervention for role negotiation in breast cancer surgery decisions and the
      Patient Perception Scale to measure role concordance. The investigators hypothesize that
      better role concordance will be achieved with a simple provider-based intervention. In the
      first half of the study, providers will be blind to the patient's preferred role. In the
      second half, providers will be made aware of the preferred role prior to the encounter and
      will have a brief conversation with the patient about their desired role in the decision
      making process.

      The goal of this project is to test the effects of the Patient Preference Scale as the basis
      for a clinical intervention for role negotiation in breast cancer surgery decisions and the
      Patient Perception Scale to measure role concordance. The investigators hypothesize that
      better role concordance will be achieved with a simple provider-based intervention. In
      addition, role concordance will be associated with improved short-term and longer-term
      improvements in outcomes of the following parameters: a) satisfaction with decision process
      b) breast specific QOL, and c) decision regret.

      The investigators propose a mixed methods, interventional study with concurrent controls
      performed in a breast cancer surgery clinic at a comprehensive cancer center. The Patient
      Preference Scale will be used to identify the preferred involvement in decision making of
      newly diagnosed breast cancer patients prior to their first clinic visit. The Patient
      Perception Scale will be used after the encounter in order to evaluate role concordance. The
      Provider Perception Scale will also be used to assess the perception of the achieved role by
      the provider. In the first half of the study, providers will be blind to the patient's
      preferred role. In the second half, providers will be made aware of the preferred role prior
      to the encounter and will have a brief conversation with the patient about their desired role
      in the decision making process. Clinical encounters will be audiotaped, transcribed, and
      scored for patient involvement. The investigators propose the following aims and hypotheses:

      Investigate the impact of a brief provider-led intervention about the patients' preferred
      role in treatment decision making on role concordance. The investigators hypothesize that:

      1. Role concordance will be improved when the preferred role is discussed with the patient at
      the beginning of the encounter.

      2. The provider's perception of the role achieved will be more concordant with the patient's
      perception when the preferred role is discussed. 3. Investigate the impact of role
      concordance in the treatment decision making process on short term and long term quality of
      life and decision outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that: Patients who achieve role
      concordance will be more satisfied with the decision process.

        1. Patients who achieve role concordance will have better QOL and less decision regret at
           early (2 to 6 weeks) and later (6 months) time points after the clinic visit.

        2. Patients who achieve concordance will be more likely to complete or plan to complete
           recommended treatments.

        3. Patients who achieve concordance will be more likely to complete or plan to complete
           recommended treatments

    <measure>Decision role concordance of provider and patient</measure>
    <time_frame>This is an one-time measurement (Immediately after a surgical consultation)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction with the decision making process</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after a surgical consultation</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the decision making process will be measured directly after the clinic encounter using a modified version of the Holmes-Rovner Satisfaction with Decision scale. The scale uses a Likert-type ranking of 6 items related to decision making, with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparing Reliability and Validity of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) assessment of short-term quality of life between the groups</measure>
    <time_frame>This scale will be used prior to the first consultation to establish a baseline for each patient and will subsequently be used at 2 weeks and 6 months after initial clinic visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the (FACT-B) questionnaire. FACT-B measures 27 items in five different areas: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns specific to this patient population. FACT-B is measured on the scale from 0 to 4, with a total minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 144.</description>

    <time_frame>The scale will be administered at 2 weeks and 6 months after initial clinic visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The decision regret outcome will be measured using the Decision Regret Scale. The Decision Regret Scale is is a 5 item scale with items ranked on a 5-point Likert-type scale and added together with higher score indicating more regret.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (OPTION) assessment of patient involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months after initial clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of patient involvement at the clinic encounter will be measured using the OPTION scale. This scale measures 12 item from 0 to 4, with 0 being &quot;this behavior is not observed&quot; to 4 &quot;This behavior is exhibited to a very high standard&quot;</description>
