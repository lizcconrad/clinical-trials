      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of balance training with Kinesthetic Ability
      Trainer 2000 (KAT 2000) in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain related balance
      disorder.

      Methods: A total of 60 patients who developed peripheral neuropathic pain-related balance
      impairment in the chronic phase due to lumber disc herniation, lumber spondylosis and
      gonarthrosis were included into this randomized controlled prospective study and randomized
      into either balance exercises groups or KAT 2000 exercises groups. Balance exercises were
      given all patients in Group 1 (n=30). In addition to balance exercises, KAT 2000 balance
      exercises were given all patients in group 2 (n=30). All patients received 45-min
      individualized training session for three times a week for 4 weeks. Patients were evaluated
      according to pain, static and dynamic balance and quality of life (QoL).

      Neuropathic pain was determined by the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire. Pain
      severity was assessed by using a visual analogue scale (VAS). KAT 2000 was used to evaluate
      static and dynamic balance. Dynamic balance and mobility also was assessed using the Berg
      Balance Scale (BBS) and Time Up and Go (TUG) test. QoL was assessed by using Nottingham
      Health Profile (NHP). Patients were evaluated at baseline and the end of the 4-week exercise
      program.
