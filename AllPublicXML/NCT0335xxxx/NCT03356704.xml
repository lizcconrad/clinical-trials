  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture surgery requires high risk anesthetic procedure for elderly patients (1).
      General anesthesia, continuous spinal anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks are three
      anesthetic techniques possible. Continuous spinal anesthesia has proven its efficacity to
      provide an intraoperative haemodynamic stability wich guarantees good patients outcomes (2),
      in comparison with general anesthesia but there is poor evidence in the litterature
      concerning the use of peripheral nerve blocks.

      The primary objective of this study was to compare intraoperative haemodynamic stability
      provides by peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia and continuous spinal
      anesthesia.

      Secondary outcomes included : use of vasoactive drugs, opioids consumption, lenght of stay
      and inhospital mortality.

      After receiving the ethic approval from the &quot;CERAR&quot;, the investigators retrospectively
      identified all patients who underwent hip fracture surgery from January 1 2015, to December
      31, 2016 in the CHU of Montpellier. The exclusion criterias were: multiple trauma victims,
      two hip fractures in the same patient and single shot spinal anesthesia. In our institution
      the investigators used to perform three types of anesthesia: general anesthesia (GA),
      continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) and combined plexus blocks (CPB). The investigators
      therefore made three groups GA, CSA and CPB and used a propensity score to make these groups
      comparable. The matching criterias were age, arterial hypertension, ASA status, Frailty
      score, chronic cardiac failure and type of surgery.
