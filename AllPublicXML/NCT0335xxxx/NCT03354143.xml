  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if lowering blood pressure using FDA approved
      medication (antihypertensive drugs) alters brain pulsatility and reduces brain amyloid beta
      protein accumulation in older adults. Amyloid beta protein is high in the brain of older
      adults with Alzheimer's disease. Hypertension may increase brain amyloid beta protein
      accumulation and affect memory and thinking ability in older adults. However, whether
      lowering blood pressure reduces brain amyloid beta protein and improves brain function is
      inconclusive.

      The investigators hypothesize that treating high blood pressure alters brain pulsatility,
      which in turn reduces brain amyloid beta protein accumulation and improves brain structure
      and function.
