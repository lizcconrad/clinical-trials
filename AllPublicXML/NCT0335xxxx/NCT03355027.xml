  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTENSITY-HIGH study aims to answer if there are any limits to LDL reduction in relation
      to benefiting vascular health, exploring the mechanisms by which secondary prevention in
      patients with established heart disease may benefit from even lower LDL levels. By using
      PCSK9 inhibitors such as Alirocumab, very low LDL cholesterol levels not previously
      encountered in statin trials, can be achieved in patients with established heart disease on
      top of intensive statin treatment.

      This research is being carried out because it is unclear what the lowest threshold of LDL
      cholesterol should be to attain significant reductions in CV risk in stable cardiovascular
      patients. It is unknown whether there is a true limit of LDL cholesterol below which there is
      no further improvement in endothelial function in stable cardiovascular patients, and,
      whether this is associated with a reduction in markers of both systemic and vascular
      inflammation.

      Defining this may help identify individuals from the general population who may benefit from
      more aggressive lipid lowering treatment than standard statin treatment in terms of CV
      morbidity and mortality.

      This study will be conducted in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, where they will
      be randomized to receive either a combination of Alirocumab and statin, or Ezetimibe plus
      statin. 60 patients will be recruited to this single center, randomized, open label, parallel
      group, mechanistic physiological study which will be conducted at Cambridge University
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study, some
      patients may have to complete a 4 week washout period on a suitable statin therapy. The total
      study duration for each participant will be approximately 14 weeks, where a series of
      non-invasive vascular studies and medical imaging assessments which will be conducted to
      observe vascular/systemic inflammation and to assess endothelial vascular function.This study
      is funded by JP Moulton Charitable Foundation.
