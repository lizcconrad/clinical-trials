  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares weekly versus daily administration of iron for prevention of anemia in 6
      months old infants. One third of the infants that are exclusively breast fed will not receive
      iron, the second third will receive iron weekly and the last third will receive iron daily.
      Half of the infants that take infant formula will receive iron weekly and the other half will
      receive iron daily.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency and the main cause of anemia.
      It's estimated that 43% of pre-school children worldwide are anemic, in Argentina a national
      survey carried out in 2007 (last survey), showed that 34.5% of children less than 2 years old
      were anemic and that 50.8% of children 6 to 9 months old were anemic. Although there is a
      consensus on iron supplementation as a preventive strategy for anemia in infants, there is a
      poor adherence due mainly to mild gastrointestinal adverse effects and low prescription rates
      from pediatricians. On the other hand, the excess of iron can lead to genomic instability
      with structural and functional alterations on proteins, lipids and DNA. Weekly administration
      of iron has been proposed as an alternative of similar efficacy and higher effectiveness in
      older children and pregnant women, but sufficient evidence for infants is lacking.

    <intervention_model_description>Two main arms: weekly vs daily iron supplementation. Infants who are exclusively breast fed will be randomized into three groups: no iron supplementation, weekly iron supplementation and daily iron supplementation. Infants that are partially fed with infant formula will be randomized into two groups: weekly iron supplementation and daily iron supplementation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Outcomes assessor: the outcomes are defined by hemoglobin and ferritin (corrected by CRP), also genomic instability is defined by a laboratory result such as comet assay. The members of the laboratory will receive labeled specimens with a code unrelated to the allocated arm.
The investigators that will analyze the data will not carry out the study. All the clinical data will be obtained by the care providers.</masking_description>
