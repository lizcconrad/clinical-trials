  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work aims to describe the characteristics and methods of management of patients
      suffering from a solid tumor treated with immunotherapy admitted to intensive care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The place of checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and PD-L-1) is currently validated in the
      management of melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The toxicity profile is
      specific with adverse effects related to immunity. Some side effects (myocarditis, colitis,
      interstitial lung disease, etc.) can be severe and patient could be hospitalized in intensive
      care unit.

      The question of immunotherapy's imputability in the acute disease is becoming more frequent.
