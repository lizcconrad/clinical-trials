      Up to one hundred (100) female patients will be enrolled and consented to participate in the
      study. These women will be enrolled from screening assigned BIRADS 0, patient complaint, or
      referral for second opinion. The enrolled patient will accept CE-CBBCT scans within 4 weeks
      of her diagnostic mammography and before breast biopsy if biopsy is needed. The final
      diagnostic workup outcome of these enrolled patients needs to include at least 30 confirmed
      cancers cases.

This will be immediately followed by a saline &quot;chaser&quot; from 20 to 40 ml at ~2 ml/s (20 seconds) to maximize dynamic enhancement.</description>
