      In this research, 60 patients with unilateral rotator cuff tear in Peking University People's
      Hospital in 2018 are planned to be recruited .They will receive Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging(MRI) and X-ray of the painful shoulder before enrollment in this study, the duration
      between the two examinations was no longer than 1 week, also there is no past history of
      surgery in the selected shoulders. There is no other exclusion criteria. Upward Migration
      Index(UMI) is the ratio between the distance of humeral head center to the lower surface of
      acromion, and the radius of humeral head circle. It can help to minimize the effect of
      anatomy difference and imaging magnification, compared with the traditional acromiohumeral
      distance(AHD). Then we use the Spearman correlation analysis to evaluate the relationship
      between UMI and fatty degeneration, rotator cuff tear size and the thickness of ruptured
      supraspinatus tendon from X-ray and MRI.
