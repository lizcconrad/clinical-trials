        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients ≥18 years of age with more than 24 hours of urinary symptoms
             attributable to a urinary tract infection (UTI)

          2. Two of the following signs and symptoms of uUTI: urinary frequency, urinary urgency,
             pain or burning micturition, suprapubic pain, gross hematuria.

          3. A mid-stream urine specimen with:

               1. a dipstick analysis positive for nitrite AND

               2. evidence of pyuria as defined by either:

             i. a dipstick analysis positive for leukocyte esterase AND/OR ii. at least 10 white
             blood cells per cubic millimeter on microscopic analysis of unspun urine iii. White
             blood cell count ≥10 cells/high-powered field in the sediment of a spun urine

          4. Has given written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of acute pyelonephritis: fever (temperature
             &gt; 38°Celsius), chills, costovertebral angle tenderness, flank pain, nausea, and/or
             vomiting

          2. Receipt of prior effective antibacterial drug therapy for uUTI for the presenting
             illness unless recovered pathogen demonstrates resistance to initial antibiotic and
             clinical symptoms persist

          3. Concurrent use of non-study antibacterial drug therapy that would have a potential
             effect on outcome evaluations in patients with uUTI

          4. Patients with ileal loops or urinary stoma

          5. Patients with an indwelling urinary catheter in the previous 30 days

          6. Patients with paraplegia

          7. Patients who are likely to receive ongoing antibacterial drug prophylaxis after
             treatment of uUTI (e.g., patients with vesico-ureteral reflux)

          8. Any history of trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract

          9. Causative uropathogen for the presenting illness known to be resistant to any
             carbapenem or ciprofloxacin

         10. Patient's urine culture, if available at study entry, isolates more than 2
             microorganisms regardless of colony count or patient has a confirmed fungal UTI

         11. Patient is receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or had a renal transplant

         12. Creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min as calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation

         13. Patients who are pregnant

         14. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

         15. Patients with hypersensitivity to probenecid

         16. Patients with history of blood dyscrasias

         17. Patients with history of uric acid kidney stones

         18. Patients with acute gouty attack

         19. Patients on chronic methotrexate therapy

         20. Patient known to be immunocompromised with absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mm3

         21. Patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis

         22. Patients who require concomitant administration of tizanidine or valproic acid

         23. Patients with a history of allergy to carbapenems, beta-lactams or quinolones

         24. Patient is considered unlikely to survive the 4-week study period or has a rapidly
             progressive or terminal illness including septic shock which is associated with a high
             risk of mortality
