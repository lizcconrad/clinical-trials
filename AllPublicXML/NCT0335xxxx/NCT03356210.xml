  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the usefulness of
      electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback, also called neurofeedback (NF), a treatment method
      that can potentially prevent relapses among patients with a substance use disorder (SUD)
      through its calming effect on the central nervous system.

      The study will examine whether NF can improve general well-being and quality of life (QoL)
      and subsequently its ability to play a role in relapse prevention strategies. Specifically,
      the effect on physical and psychological distress will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A patient with a substance use disorder (SUD) typically requires comprehensive and
      individualized care across different levels of service providers, from primary care to the
      specialist health care services. Among the known threats to a prolonged remission are
      negative emotional states because they can trigger the urge to use drugs. An integrative
      approach is warranted aimed to address the physiological, psychological and social aspects of
      the disorder during the rehabilitation period.

      Patients with a SUD diagnosis in an outpatient clinic will be randomized to either 1) 20
      sessions of symptom-based NF training in conjunction with traditional therapy or 2)
      conventional counseling. The primary outcome is QoL at the end of treatment and at a 3 and 12
      month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include alcohol and drug use, mental distress,
      sleep quality and cognitive function. The optimal quantity of the intervention will be
      assessed with a cost-benefit approach.

      The proposed study will provide new knowledge about how NF can be best utilized in SUD
      treatment, potentially improving QoL and relapse rates.

    <description>QoL is measured with the Quality of Life 5 scale (QoL-5). QoL-5 consists of five subjective statements: two questions are about health, physical and mental; two questions address the quality of significant relationships (partner and friends); and one question addresses the existential self i.e. the relationship with oneself. Responses are scored on a 5-step ordinal scale from 1 to 5. A score of 1 is very good, and 5, very poor. The scores are transposed, and inverted into a decimal scale ranging from 0.1 to 0.9; 0.9 is now the best score and 0.1, the worst. Mean scores for health and relationship QoL are calculated, and a total QoL score is calculated as a mean of health, relationship and existential QoL.</description>

    <description>QoL is measured with the Quality of Life 5 scale (QoL-5). QoL-5 consists of five subjective statements: two questions are about health, physical and mental; two questions address the quality of significant relationships (partner and friends); and one question addresses the existential self i.e. the relationship with oneself.

Mean scores for health and relationship QoL are calculated, and a total QoL score is calculated as a mean of health, relationship and existential QoL. Normative data from a previous survey of the general population showed a mean QoL score of 0.69 and a minimal clinically important difference is 0.10.</description>

    <measure>Perceived functioning/well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>After the intervention (approx 5 months) and 3 &amp; 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived functioning/well-being will be measured with the Outcome rating scale (ORS). The ORS each consist of four 10-cm visual analog scales (VAS) ranging from negative (left) to positive (right). The ORS measures three areas of client functioning: individual, interpersonal, and social, as well as measuring the client's overall view of their personal well-being. The marks made by clients on each of the four lines are measured to the nearest millimeter to derive the score. These are then summed to obtain a total score. Cm is analogue to scale score and the total score range from 0 to 40. High scores reflect a good level of well-being and functioning. A clinical cut-off is 25 (i.e., one would expect scores below 25 in a clinical sample) and a 5 point difference in score is consider as the minimal clinically important difference</description>

    <measure>Perceived psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>After the intervention (approx 5 months) and 3 &amp; 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived psychological distress measured with the Symptom Check List - 10 (SCL-10), a short-form of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 90. SCL-10 has 10 items about anxiety (4 items) and depression (6 items). Responses are scored on an ordinal scale from 1 to 4, with the highest score indicating highest distress. A total mean score is calculated. Scores above 1.85 is considered a pathological score.</description>

Data on drug and alcohol use in the 30 days before the interview are used to derive a composite score to indicate severity; scores range from 0 (no problem) to 1 (a severe problem).</description>
