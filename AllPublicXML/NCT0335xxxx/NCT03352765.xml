  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a combination of chemo-immuno therapy called RBM. RBM consists of
      combination of drugs: rituximab, bendamustine, and melphalan followed by reinfusion of the
      participants own stem cells which is called autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Compared
      to the standard BEAM regimen, this RBM regimen may or may not be less effective in lymphoma,
      but will likely have fewer side effects.

    <description>This is a phase I/II study of rituximab, bendamustine and melphalan (RBM) conditioning followed by ASCT in elderly patients with B-cell NHL. Conditioning regimen consist of rituximab 375 mg/m2 on days -10 and -4, bendamustine 160 mg/m2 intravenously on days -3 and -2; melphalan 140 mg/m2 intravenously on day -1 before the reinfusion of autologous stem cells on day 0.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Phase I eligibility:

          -  Any - B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma would be eligible for phase I portion of the study.

        Phase II eligibility:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of rel/ref DLBCL, or diffuse large B cell lymphoma
             transformed from an indolent lymphoma Since the endpoint of the Phase I portion is
             safety, any B-cell NHL can be enrolled. However, the PFS endpoint varies greatly
             amongst different types of lymphoma. In order to accurately interpret the survival
             data, a homogeneous cohort of patients with DLBCL will be evaluated. DLBCL is the most
             aggressive B-NHL with limited options. Other B-NHL's are generally more indolent and
             have more options available to them.

        Additional eligibility for both the phase I and phase II studies:

          -  Age ≥ 70 at the time of enrollment

          -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) ≥ 3^50

          -  KPS ≥ 70

          -  Males must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception per institutional
             practices.

          -  Complete or partial response to salvage chemotherapy by IWG Working Group Criteria

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction of ≥ 45%

          -  Hemoglobin-adjusted diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) of ≥45%

          -  Creatinine clearance of ≥50 mL/min

          -  Completion of most recent salvage therapy within 8 weeks of enrollment

          -  Direct bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL in the absence of suspected Gilbert's disease (if
             Gilbert's disease is suspected, the total bilirubin must be ≤3.0 mg/dL), and AST ≤ 2.5
             ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease progression by IWG Working Group Criteria since last therapy

          -  Patients with history of CNS involvement

          -  Prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  Patients who have failed bendamustine-based regimen previously

          -  Patients within 6 months of MI and stroke will be excluded
