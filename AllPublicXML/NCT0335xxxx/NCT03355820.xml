  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of immune response in subjects who
      received the HPV-16/18 vaccine, seven to eight years after the last dose of primary
      vaccination in the HPV-058 study. No new subjects will be enrolled in this extension study.

             an impact on the study objectives) during the period starting 30 days (Day 29 to Day
             1) before the study visit.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, in which the subject has been or
