  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most prevalent in eastern Asia, with the highest incidence
      reported among the Cantonese population from the province of Guangdong. Radiotherapy is the
      cornerstone of initial treatment due to the radiosensitive behavior of NPC and its
      deep-seated location. Although radiotherapy has achieved satisfactory results, it can also
      cause some severe adverse events. Currently, surgery is only applied to the treatment of
      recurrent NPC (rNPC) patients, mainly dominated by the conventional open surgery. However,
      the traditional surgery was accompanied by high rate of treatment-induced complications and
      low rate of block removal, which greatly limited the surgical application to the treatment of
      primary NPC.

      With the continuous improvement in surgical techniques, especially the electronic endoscopic
      system to be used in the surgical treatment recently, endoscopic nasopharyngectomy can
      largely overcome these shortcomings of traditional surgery mentioned above.

      In addition, the investigators retrospectively analyzed the survival outcomes of 9 patients
      with NPC (all T1N0M0 according to the UICC / AJCC seventh staging) treated with endoscopic
      nasopharyngectomy in our hospital, with 5-year rate of overall survival, loco-regional-free
      survival, distant metastasis-free survival of 100%. Therefore, the investigators considered
      endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for staged I NPC patients feasible.

      This study will focus on the survival outcomes and quality of life of the staged I NPC
      patients treated with endoscopic nasopharyngectomy.
