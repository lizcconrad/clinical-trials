  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases are common diseases, frequently met
      together in overlap syndromes. Their physiopathology remains puzzling. A strong role of gut
      microbiota has been recently put forward to explain the development of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, and is suspected to play an important role in rheumatoid diseases. Anti-Tumor
      Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) alpha are effective and safe drugs in the treatment of both
      digestive and rheumatoid inflammatory diseases. The way they work is unclear, and the
      clinical response to this treatment is variable. A better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases and of the action of anti-TNF alpha is
      essential to an optimized care.

      Our hypothesis is that the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha in spondyloarthritis and in
      inflammatory bowel diseases is at least partly due to its restoring action of homeostasis at
      the interface between gastrointestinal mucosa and intestinal microbiota, either by primary
      action on the digestive epithelium, allowing it to regain its control and tolerance functions
      toward mucosal microbiota, either by direct action on the intestinal microbiota, via an
      inter-reigns regulation.

      The main objective of our study is to assess quantitative and qualitative changes in fecal
      microbiota before (D0) and 3 months after initiation of anti-TNF alpha.

      The investigators propose to conduct an exploratory study, on 10 spondyloarthritis and 20
      inflammatory bowel diseases patients (10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis (UC), in
      which a first anti-TNF alpha treatment is indicated. At D0 and M3, intestinal microbiota will
      be studied by DNA16S sequencing and qPCR, via a stool sampling. Blood lymphocytes profile
      will be obtained by flux cytometry. In addition, a colonoscopy will be performed at D0 for UC
      patients, with an endoscopic and histological assessment. A second short colonoscopy will be
      performed for UC patients at M3. At each time, clinical assessment will be performed.

      A mirror group of 10 spondyloarthritis and 20 inflammatory bowel diseases patients (10
      Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis), in which an &quot;all but anti-TNF alpha or
      biotherapy&quot; treatment is indicated will be included to distinguish the specific effects on
      microbiota of anti-TNF alpha.

      12 patients by group will be included at M0 by anticipating that some patients will stop
      their treatment between M0 and M3, and consequently will be excluded from M3 sampling and
      from final analysis. Final analysis will be performed on 10 patients by group.
