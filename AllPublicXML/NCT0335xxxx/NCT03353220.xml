      This two-phase study aims to explore ways to predict who will respond well to the weight loss
      drug lorcaserin and to understand the mechanisms that develop which limit drug efficacy.
      Subjects will be recruited for a 5-week crossover study (phase 1) with lorcaserin and placebo
      followed by treatment with lorcaserin for 24 weeks (phase 2).

      In phase 1, at Weeks 1 and 5, participants will take the weight loss drug lorcaserin or
      placebo for 7 days. At Week 5 participants will receive whichever treatment they did not
      receive at Week 1. At the end of Weeks 1 and 5, participants will have a lumbar puncture
      (spinal tap) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for neuropeptide and hormone analyses,
      including proopiomelanocortin (POMC), Agouti-related protein (AgRP) and cortisol. Blood will
      also be obtained for neuropeptide and hormone analyses. Breakfast will be served to
      participants who will then complete an eating behavior profile. A laboratory test meal will
      be performed 4h after breakfast.

      After completing both the 7 day lorcaserin and placebo studies, participants will then
      continue on Phase 2 of the study, which includes treatment with lorcaserin for 24 weeks.
      Subjects will receive nutritional counseling to reduce their daily caloric intake to 600 kcal
      below their calculated caloric requirement and will be encourage to exercise moderately for
      30 minutes daily. Participants will visit the clinic monthly during the 24 week study period
      for nutritional counseling, review of food diaries, vital signs and safely labs. Blood will
      also be obtained for neuropeptide peptide and hormone analyses. At the end of the 24 week
      period subjects will come for a final study visit, including a lumbar puncture, blood sample,
      breakfast, an eating behavior profile and a test meal.
