  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular blood transfusions are essential for the management of haematological conditions such
      as β-thalassemia major. As a result, however, patients with these conditions are susceptible
      to the development of transfusion-dependent iron overload (hemosiderosis or secondary iron
      overload
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of a naturally occurring physiological mechanism for the removal of excess
      iron in the body, life-long treatment and adherence to iron chelation therapy (ICT) are
      necessary to prevent the morbidity and mortality that may result if excess iron is allowed to
      .

      Deferasirox (DFO),is the oldest available form of ICT used by patients with
      transfusion-dependent disorders. Improvements in ICT administration convenience and
      tolerability are expected to improve patient's satisfaction with ICT and Health Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL), thus promoting adherence to ICT regimens and potentially reducing
      iron overload-related morbidity/mortality and associated healthcare costs

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>- The Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36v2) It is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 36-items measuring eight dimensions of general HRQOL: physical functioning (10 items), role limitation due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and general mental health (5 items). In addition to scores for individual dimensions, two summary scores assessing physical and mental dimensions of health and well-being can also be calculated: Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, respectively</description>

    <description>SICT It is a questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with ICT regimens. It comprises 19 items assessing four domains: perceived effectiveness of ICT (PE), burden of ICT (BD), acceptance of ICT (AC), and side effects of ICT (SE). Patients rate all items on scale from 1 &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to 5 &quot;very satisfied&quot;.
