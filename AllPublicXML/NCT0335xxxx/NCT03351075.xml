  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to fatigue, pain is the most frequent and persistent symptom following breast
      cancer and breast cancer treatment. Despite the effectiveness of different physical therapy
      modalities, such as manual techniques, passive mobilizations and exercises, many patients
      still experience pain and subsequent difficulties in daily functioning at short and long
      term. Past decades, the awareness on the important role of educational interventions in the
      management of pain in general has increased. Educational interventions aim at explaining and
      improving the knowledge, control and attitude of the patient regarding his/her pain
      complaint. However, these educational interventions are often restricted to more biomedical
      pain management instructions and general advice on physical activity and analgesics (=
      traditional biomedical education). Only recently, increased knowledge on pain mechanisms led
      to a more modern educational approach. This modern approach is suited to explain more complex
      issues associated with pain and takes into account many more factors related to pain. To our
      knowledge, only one controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of a modern educational
      intervention in the early stage of breast cancer treatment. The results were very promising
      for shoulder function. However, only short-term effects were examined, no randomization was
      performed and no pain-related and socio-economic outcomes were evaluated. Therefore, the aim
      of the proposed project is to investigate the effectiveness of a similar modern educational
      program, in addition to standard physical therapy care, in the early treatment phase of
      breast cancer in comparison with traditional biomedical education. A randomized controlled
      trial will be performed with a long-term follow up period. The primary outcome parameter is
      pain-related disability. Secondary outcomes are different dimensions of pain, physical and
      mental functioning, return to work and health-care related costs.
