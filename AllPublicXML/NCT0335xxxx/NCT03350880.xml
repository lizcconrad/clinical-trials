      Comparison of therapeutic intervention to gain range of motion at the hip joint within
      therapeutic in water and on land. Stretching is a therapeutic maneuver used to increase the
      length of shortened soft tissue structures and thereby gain range of motion; for that,
      innumerable procedures within Physiotherapy use it for the benefit of patients. The work in
      question is justified by the need to seek the means that can promote a better performance in
      the application of the stretching procedure, called Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
      Facilitation, in a universe of pre-selected volunteers. It is a relevant and feasible study,
      hoping that its results may benefit future patients, with better results and faster
      responses. What is the medium that leads to better results in a program using the
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique? Hypotheses: a - Probably the heated
      aquatic environment, in a range of 32 ° to 36 ° C, will promote a better result, since the
      heat increases the collagen's distensibility. b - Perhaps the heat, by increasing the
      excitability threshold of nerve fibers, triggers the &quot;protective reflex&quot; later, which may
      promote a more vigorous elongation without the protective response. c - Possibly the
      relaxation promoted in the aquatic environment, could influence the gains obtained in the
      swimming pool.
