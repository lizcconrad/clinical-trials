  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new neonatal follow-up model that offers additional support and
      coping resources for parents during their child's NICU admission as well as during their
      transition home. The Coached, Coordinated, Enhanced Neonatal Transition (CCENT) model
      involves a key worker who will be the primary support for families during the first year of
      their child's life. The key worker's role involves 1) parental coaching using a
      mindfulness-based approach, 2) helping coordinate care across various levels of care as well
      as supporting families in system and resource navigation, and 3) provided proactive education
      targeting normal challenges in caring for a child who required intensive care support. The
      goal is to improve the psychosocial support and medical care coordination beyond the neonatal
      intensive care unit as many of the medical and social concerns do not end at the time of
      discharge.
