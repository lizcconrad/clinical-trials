  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microsurgical tunneling flap procedures using connective tissue grafts (CTG) are predictable
      for treating teeth with gingival recessions. Enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) can be used as
      an alternative to the aforementioned gold standard. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      clinically the use of tunnel technique with EMD applied group in addition to CTG and the same
      technique with CTG group for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.

    <description>A modified microsurgical tunnel technique by Zuhr et al. (2007). Initial sulcular incisions with a microsurgical blade are followed by a split-thickness buccal flap preparations using the tunneling knives. The preparation is extended into the mucosal tissue to gain sufficient flap mobility. The papillary regions are detached in their buccal aspects with the periosteum. The root surfaces are applied with 24% EDTA (PrefGel®, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) for 2 minutes and then washed with saline. Subsequently, EMD (Emdogain®, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) is applied on root surfaces. The graft is inserted into the tunnel and stabilized with absorbable suspensory sutures. The buccal flap is advanced coronally and stabilized with non-absorbable suspensory sutures.</description>
