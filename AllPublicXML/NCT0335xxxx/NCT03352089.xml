    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common valve disease requiring surgery in the Western world. It
      is defined by progressive calcification and fibrosis of the valve leaflets and restricted
      valve opening. This in turn exposes the heart muscle (left ventricle) to increasing pressure
      leading to heart muscle thickening (left ventricular hypertrophy, LVH) to normalise wall
      stress and maintain heart output (stroke volume). The only treatment available is relief of
      pressure overload by surgical or minimally invasive valve replacement (TAVI).

      Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a condition characterised by deposition of insoluble
      transthyretin protein (a small protein tetramer produced in the liver) in various tissues,
      predominantly in the heart. Although there are inherited forms caused by specific TTR gene
      mutations, most cases occur in older individuals with non-mutated TTR (wild-type). The
      finding of TTR plaques in elderly individuals is relatively common; in a post-mortem study
      22-25% of patients over the age of 80 had evidence of cardiac amyloid deposition. However,
      there is significant progressive amyloid accumulation in a small percentage of individuals
      leading to heart muscle thickening and heart failure. No medical treatments are currently
      licensed although several agents are at advanced stages of clinical trials.

      As both the above conditions are increasingly common in the elderly population and
      characterised by increased heart muscle thickening, there is the potential for them to
      coexist unrecognised in individual patients. The prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in
      clinical populations with significant aortic stenosis is not known however small series have
      estimated somewhere in the region of 6-29%. Other data have suggested that patients with
      aortic stenosis and concurrent cardiac amyloidosis have an adverse prognosis even despite
      AVR. It is therefore important to identify aortic stenosis patients with coexistent
      amyloidosis both in terms of predicting prognosis and because it may influence decisions
      about whether to proceed to valve intervention.

      PET/MR is an emerging technique, which combines the excellent temporal and spatial resolution
      of MRI with the sensitive molecular imaging of PET. PET/MR has significant advantages over
      PET/CT (the currently more widely used approach) in that it offers superior tissue
      characterisation, improved correction for cardiac and respiratory motion and major reductions
      in radiation exposure. Whilst there are concerns about its ability to provide reliable
      attenuation correction of the PET data, these issues appear to have been largely overcome
      with recent techniques proposed by our group. MR is also more naturally suited to the imaging
      of certain tissues in the body compared to CT including the left ventricular myocardium.

      In aortic stenosis, MRI has become the gold-standard technique for examining the heart muscle
      (myocardium) with the unique ability to assess its tissue composition. In particular both
      late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping based techniques are able to detect heart
      scarring (fibrosis) which act as biomarkers of left ventricular decompensation and are
      strongly associated with poor patient outcomes. CMR is also the gold-standard non-invasive
      technique for detecting cardiac amyloid, which is associated with both a characteristic
      pattern of LGE and high native T1 values. However it is not currently able to differentiate
      between the two different types of cardiac amyloid TTR and AL amyloidosis, which have
      different prognoses and treatments. Preliminary studies conducted by our group have suggested
      that 18F-NaF PET when added to CMR can make this distinction on the basis that this tracer
      binds to TTR deposits but not AL deposits, may be able to differentiate between the two.
      Importantly we have also used the same PET tracer as a marker of calcification activity in
      the aortic valve, demonstrating its ability to predict disease progression and cardiac
      events.

      In this study, we will investigate whether PET/MR could be used as &quot;one-stop&quot; imaging in
      aortic stenosis in whom valve intervention is being considered to assess in detail functional
      and structural properties of both the valve and myocardium and identify cases of significant
      cardiac TTR amyloid deposition.
