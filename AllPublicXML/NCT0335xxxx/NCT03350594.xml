  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the implementation of Multiple Family Therapy
      (MFT) within a multi-disciplinary treatment program for Anorexia Nervosa (AN) in adolescence
      is at least as effective in terms of clinical Body Mass Index evolution as single Systemic
      Family Therapy (SyFT) after 12 months of treatment. We expect that these two techniques will
      not differ in terms of global efficacy, but that MFT could be more suitable for certain
      profiles who may be less responsive to SyFT.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While family therapy is considered to have proved itself, its efficacy has been tested with
      reference to individual therapy by several teams of researchers or in addition to an overall
      treatment program. Few studies however have compared different types of family studies, and
      these studies were often on small samples. In addition, efficacy in terms of remission at
      12-18 months was below 50% for large samples, and whatever the technique envisaged.
      Consequently, there is a need for exploration of this type of care provision. It is in this
      context, and also on account of budget considerations, to avoid hospitalizations, that the
      Maudsley team developed MFT for AN in the form of intensive day-care. The system is open to
      debate (there is a selection of highly motivated subjects able to suspend family and
      professional activities for some 20 days a year, and to find accommodation close to the
      hospital, and ready to relinquish other types of follow-up. However, MFT is, according to its
      advocates (families, caregivers) a therapeutic tool that is effective and appreciated by
      families. Other teams have therefore adapted it to care practices in France, and suited it to
      children, adolescents or adult in ambulatory care. In addition, we are aware that our care
      program is not satisfactory (fewer than half the subjects are cured after 12 to 18 months of
      treatment) and hence perfectible. We would like to use MFT, but this approach, particularly
      in ambulatory setting, has never been evaluated in comparison with another type of therapy in
      a randomized trial. We therefore wish to perform a randomized controlled trial to assess the
      contribution of MFT to the treatment of AN in comparison with SyFT.

      The project is original in that, for the first time, it sets out to assess MFT in adolescent
      AN in ambulatory care in reference to SyFT, to estimate cost parameters relating to the two
      techniques, and also to identify the profiles of the best responders according to patient
      characteristics.

      Family therapy will be established either after first half of hospitalization (half way to
      weight gain fixed for discharge), or when the patient seen in consultation is in a stable
      clinical state with no indication for hospitalization.

      Patient will be randomized to MFT or SyFT after agreement to take part in the study.
      Randomization will be stratified on care provision status at inclusion (ambulatory or
      hospitalized - the latter being a possible selection bias according to severity) and
      therapies will start in the month following the randomization.

      Patients and their families will have one session a month MFT ou SyFT during 12 months.

      Evaluations will take place at the end of therapy at 12 months, then at the 6 months
      follow-up. Evaluators will be blind to the treatment group and will use a standardized
      research questionnaire.

    <description>Assess with the Morgan and Russell outcome categories. A quantitative score (0-12) was obtained through four subscales: Food intake, Menstrual state, Mental state, Psychosexual state and Socioeconomic state. The higher the score, the better the clinical state.
We use BMI percentiles that are a good relevant index. Hence, to take the ages of our patients into account, we refer to the INSERM (French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) weight curves for the French population, in which a BMI 10th percentile indexes AN.
We define the Morgan and Russell outcome categories as follows: 1) Good outcome: weight&gt;10th BMI percentile and regular menstruation; 2) Intermediate outcome: weight&gt;10th BMI percentile but amenorrhea (i.e., the absence of menstruation for at least the past three months); 3) Poor outcome: weight &lt;10th BMI percentile and/or presence of bulimic symptoms.
We will pool the Good and Intermediate outcome categories.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline nature and seriousness of eating-disorder symptoms at 12 months and 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) and the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS) to assess their current eating disorder (ED) symptomatology. The EDI-2 consists of 91 questions that make up 11 subscales measuring ED pathology and psychopathology. A higher total score represents a higher burden of disease level of symptomatology. The EDDS is a 22-item questionnaire measuring anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. The scale consists of a combination of Likert scores (ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely)), dichotomous scores, frequency scores and open-ended questions like weight and height. It is a diagnostic scale and a symptom composite scale. An overall eating disorder symptom composite score is computed by standardizing and summing up scores across all items.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline patient's quality of life at 12 months and at 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Eating Disorders Quality of Life Questionnaire (EDQOL) and the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) for patients.
The EDQOL has 25 items that contribute to four subscales (Psychological, Physical/Cognitive, Work/School, and Financial), which combined produce an overall quality of life score. Each item is coded on a five-point scale and asks the participant to rate the extent to which they perceive their eating disorder to affect their quality of life in different domains. Higher scores indicate lower quality of life.
The SOFAS is a rating scale used to subjectively assess the social and occupational functioning due to medical conditions. The scale is based on a continuum of functioning, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

    <description>Parents will answer the following questionnaires:
The WHOQOL (World Health Organization Quality of Life) to evaluate quality of life that can be defined as an individual's subjective perception of different aspects of life that are influenced by health status and includes subjective evaluations of physical functioning, mental health, and social/role functioning.
The LHS (the London Handicap Scale) to determine the effect of chronic disorders on a person's functional ability using a self-completion questionnaire. Each degree of handicap along a 6-point interval was assigned a scale weight. Six scales are rated Mobility, Physical independence : Occupation ; Social integration: Orientation, Economic self-sufficiency. A total score from 0 to 1 and lower score indicate total disability.
The CarerQoL-7D (Care-related Quality of life) to describe caregiver burden in seven dimensions (ie, fulfillment, relational, mental, social, financial, perceived support, and physical).</description>

    <description>SyFT involves the patient, the parents, and siblings over the age of 6 living at home. Therapists do not manage the issues relating to AN, which are taken on by referent psychiatrist who can be called on in case of any concern. Without denying personal suffering and its intra-psychic and meta-psychological impact, or the somatic and biological aspect of the pathology, the emphasis is on interactions around the symptom.
There will be free exchanges along the lines between therapist and family, within the family and between therapists.
Session is possible with sibling alone or the parents alone or in inter-generational mode (other family relatives)</description>

    <description>Each session will involve 5 families of patients suffering from AN including the parents and non-systematically the siblings. There will be exchanges in groups and mediation via different exercises involving different sub-groups according to the theme: complete families, patients on their own for problems specific to them, or &quot; cross-parenting &quot; exercises whereby parents adopt another patient for the duration of the exercise. This organization enables mutual support and social propping, favoring the emergence of family resources. Direct exchanges between families (between parents, siblings, or mixes) with and between therapists are also sought.</description>
