  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the leading cause of cancer-related
      deaths in Western countries. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, the majority of
      patients already have metastatic disease and a systemic, palliative treatment is the primary
      therapeutic option.

      Guidelines for PS 2 patients or older than 75 years old patients at the time of diagnosis
      recommend for fit patients a carboplatin doublet chemotherapy.

      Nivolumab has proven efficacy in 3rd line squamous cell lung carcinoma and is superior to
      chemotherapy in 2nd line treatment of squamous and non-squamous lung cancer in term of
      overall survival.

      In 1st line, nivolumab failed to show superiority compared to a platin based doublet in terms
      of progression free survival and overall survival in tumors ≥ 5% PD-L1 expression. The
      association Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab showed encouraging results in first line setting in
      phase 1 study.

      The investigators think that with regard to the manageable toxicity of nivolumab in lung
      cancer population and the possibility to obtain long responses, this association could be a
      valid option for this population of elderly and/or PS2 patients in term of overall survival.
