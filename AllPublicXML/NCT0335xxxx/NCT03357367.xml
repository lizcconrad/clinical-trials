  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective interventional study. The aim is to analyze the effect of usual ongoing
      treatments over microvascular cutaneous response to galvanic current applications (CIV:
      current induced vasodilatation) with tissue vitality (TiVi) system on the forearm of subjects
      referred for ultrasound investigations due to suspicion of peripheral disease. Hypothesis is
      that the use of aspirin (even at low dose) abolishes the response.

      This test could make it possible to detect the functional effects of low dose aspirin without
      using biological tests. A routine clinical application could be to use this CIV to verify
      adherence to aspirin.

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed.

      No register of non-included patients will be kept. In included patients, in parallel to the
      routine ultrasound investigation for which the patient is referred, microvascular
      investigation will be performed as explained later in arm description.

      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the
      end of the participation of the subjects.
