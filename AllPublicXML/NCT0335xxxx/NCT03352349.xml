  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aim to screen out the patients with portal hypertension by
      monitoring intraoperative PVP, and to decide the effect of Terlipressinum on the portal
      pressure after liver resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is a common treatment for liver tumors. But the incidence of postoperative
      liver failure after hepatectomy is as high as 9-18.6%, which results in relatively high
      mortality rate . Portal hypertension is considered as a contraindication for hepatectomy
      according to the guidelines of the European Society of Hepatology and the American Society of
      Hepatology. Recent studies found that patients with portal hypertension were more likely to
      have persistent liver failure and shorter long-term survival after liver resection operation,
      compared to patients without portal hypertension.

      Most of liver cancer patients in China have disease backgroud including chronic hepatitis and
      cirrhosis. Among liver cancer patients, of which function is Child A or B and have indication
      for liver resection, 25% of them have portal hypertension.
