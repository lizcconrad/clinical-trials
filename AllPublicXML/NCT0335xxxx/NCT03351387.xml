  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are performing this study to evaluate if intraoperative angiography can be shown
      numerically to determine which wounds are at high risk of wound necrosis/breakdown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the beginning of the Participants surgical procedure, a picture will be obtained using
      intraoperative angiography using ICG dye which the camera can detect. This dye will be
      provided through intravenous access. The picture will be taken of the wound to determine
      preoperative blood flow to the area where the incision is planned. After the wound has been
      closed postoperatively, a final picture, using the procedure described above, will be taken
      to determine blood flow after closure of the wound. These images will be obtained using
      intraoperative angiography. The Participant will be followed after the surgical procedure at
      standard intervals as determined by the surgeon until the wound heals or requires further
      intervention.

    <description>The SPY Intra-operative Angiography Fluorescent Imaging System consists of an imaging head equipped with a charged coupled device (CCD) camera, a laser light source and a distance sensor. The imaging head is attached to an articulating arm on a mobile cart containing the central processing unit, keyboard, monitor, and mouse. SPY is used in tandem with indocyanine green (ICG), a water-soluble tricarbocyanine dye. Once the camera is in place, 5 cc of diluted ICG is pushed through an IV line and is flushed immediately; simultaneously the room lights must be dimmed. Perfusion images will be recorded then the SPY system will be removed from the operating room.</description>
