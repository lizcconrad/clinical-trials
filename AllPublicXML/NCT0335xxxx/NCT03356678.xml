      A non-interventional, multicenter, multinational retrospective analysis using electronic case
      report forms completed by the investigators based on information from patient medical records

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria for this study in each participating
      institution will be included. Considering the number of participating centers in Korea, Latin
      America (Mexico, Colombia), and Europe (Switzerland, Israel), the expected number of patients
      is 50.

      This research involves only the collection and analysis of existing data, documents, and
      records. The information will be recorded by the investigators on a CRF in a way that the
      subjects cannot be identified directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects. Thus,
      this study should be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of each
      participating institute, and exemption from additional written informed consent should be
      applied.

        1. Age, sex, nationality, ethnicity

        2. Ann Arbor stage, disease involved sites, number of extranodal involvement, serum LDH
           concentration, ECOG performance status, presence of B symptoms, regional lymph node
           involvement, International Prognostic Index, bone marrow invasion at the time of
           pralatrexate treatment

        3. Dose and schedule of pralatrexate, start date, last treatment date, other treatment
           modalities
