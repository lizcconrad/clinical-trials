      This study evaluates the frequency of use of smartphone health applications among people
      consulting in primary care in the Grenoble region, France.

      This is a descriptive study using a questionnaire completed by the patient and distributed by
      general practitioners. The study also collects the type of used application as well as the
      rhythm of usage, and compares the use of mobile health applications according to the
      sociodemographic, geographical and medical characteristics of the studied population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smartphones are more and more present and change many aspects of people's life, especially in
      the field of health. The appearance of numerous mobile health applications over the past
      years explains this strong attractiveness.

      According to some studies, these could lead to savings in health care systems by promoting a
      preventive approach and refocusing cares on the patient who would be more independent.
      However, not much data on the use of smartphone health applications by patients are reported
      in the scientific literature.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of use of smartphone mobile
      health applications among primary care patients aged 18 to 69 in the Grenoble region, France.

      The secondary objectives are the collection of the kind of application used, the rhythm of
      usage of these health applications and the comparison of the frequency of use with the
      sociodemographic, geographical and medical characteristics of the studied population.

      To this end, the investigators use a questionnaire distributed by voluntary general
      practitioners and filled by patients. The number of subjects to be included is 385 and the
      number of distributed questionnaires is 1500.
