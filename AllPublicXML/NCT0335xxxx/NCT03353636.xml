  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the superiority of Natural
      Calm magnesium powder with respect to absorption when compared to three marketed forms of
      magnesium (two magnesium bisglycinate powders and magnesium citrate capsules). The primary
      endpoints were serum magnesium AUC (0-8h) and urine magnesium AUC (0-8h) after a single dose
      of 150 mg elemental magnesium.
