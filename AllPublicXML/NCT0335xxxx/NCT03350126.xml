      This is a non-randomized study, open label phase II study. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate disease control rate (DCR) by RECIST and iRECIST at 12 weeks.

      Evaluation of RECIST and iRECIST will be done in each center in order to choose the optimal
      therapy (Assessment by Investigators).

      A centralized evaluation of RECIST and iRECIST, will be organized in Saint-Antoine.

    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy treatment in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer with a dMMR tumor. The association nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated
      encouraging results with durable responses in these patients.

      The criteria for assessing responses for solid tumors are currently based on RECIST 1.1,
      which are well correlated with the clinical response to chemotherapy. However, in patients
      treated with immunotherapy, such criteria are less accurate, as already demonstrated in the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma, but not yet in other malignant tumors.

      Therefore, we hope with this study, to identify more accurate imaging criteria that could
      help oncologists to make optimal decisions for treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated informed consent,

          2. For female patients of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             before starting the study drug,

          3. Men and women are required to use adequate birth control during the study (when
             applicable):

             Within the frame of this study, female participants of childbearing potential and male
             participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly
             effective method of birth control (i.e., pregnancy rate of less than 1% per year)
             during the period of treatment and for 5 months for women and 7 months for men from
             the last treatment administration. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this
             same period.

             Contraceptive methods that result in a low failure rate when used consistently and
             correctly include methods such as combined hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal
             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable),
             some intrauterine devices, intrauterine hormone-releasing stem, true sexual abstinence
             (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant),
             bilateral tubal occlusion, or a female partner who is not of childbearing potential or
             a male partner who has had a vasectomy. Women and female partners using hormonal
             contraceptive must also use a barrier method i.e. condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm
             or cervical/vault caps).

             A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has
             not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no
             identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization
             (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).

          4. Histologically proven metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or rectum,

          5. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,
             laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study,

          6. dMMR DNA (protein expression by ICH and/or MSI by PCR):

               -  Tumor MMR and/or MSI will be assessed per local guidelines: ICH with two
                  (anti-MLH1 and anti-MSH2) or four antibodies (anti-MLH1, anti-MSH2, anti-MSH6 and
                  anti-PMS2) and/or PCR (with PROMEGA: BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, NR27]) by the
                  investigators prior to screening,

               -  In ICH, the extinction of MLH1 (+/- PMS2), or MSH2 (+/- MSH6), or MSH6, or PMS2
                  alone is necessary for inclusion (dMMR),

               -  In PCR, we recommended pentaplex panel (BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, and NR27).
                  Tumor samples with instability in 0, 1, or ≥2 markers were identified as MSS,
                  MSI-L, and MSI-H, respectively. Only tumor samples with ≥2 instable markers are
                  necessary for inclusion (MSI-H).

             Agreement of the SPONSOR (GERCOR) will be mandatory to include a patient. GERCOR will
             check every patient's file to confirm the dMMR/ MSI-H patient's status before
             inclusion (an anonymized fax. The confirmation of a patient's allocation will be
             immediately sent by mail to the investigator).

               -  Anti-EGFR therapy if wild-type RAS and RAF and anti-VEGF therapy,

         10. Hematological status: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5x109/L; platelets

         14. Subjects must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Subjects with lesions in a
             previously irradiated field as the sole site of measurable disease will be permitted
