  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of a continuous glucose monitor by people who
      experience low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) after gastric surgery can help reduce the number
      and severity of low blood sugar episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that will be used in this study is already approved by
      the FDA for monitoring the glucose levels of people with diabetes. The investigators of this
      study are looking to see if this CGM will be able to benefit people who have had gastric
      surgery and experience low blood sugar episodes, which can be asymptomatic and lead to
      complications. This study will involve three to five visits, and involves wearing a sensor
      and regularly recording blood sugar values and any symptoms experienced as well as a record
      of treatments for symptoms. This study also involves the use of a fitness tracker, which will
      be worn for the duration of the 4 weeks of the study and returned at the end of the study.
      Participants will be able to keep the Dexcom CGM receiver and transmitter.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of unmasked personal CGM to reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia after gastric surgery. Specifically, we will analyze glycemic patterns during 2 weeks of unmasked CGM wear, in comparison to the baseline 2 weeks of masked CGM wear. Please note that we have chosen to have a consistent masked monitoring first, as providing unmasked data to participants first could alter their dietary or other patterns and reduce ability of the study to independently assess efficacy of the CGM intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of unmasked personal CGM to reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia after gastric surgery. Participants themselves will not be masked to study design. The only masking will be of the device itself during the first 2 weeks of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary outcome will be hypoglycemia frequency and severity in masked vs. unmasked periods of CGM wear, as assessed by: (1) minutes per day &lt;70 mg/dl, (2) minutes per day &lt;55 mg/dl, (3) number of episodes requiring assistance, (4) episodes of severe hypoglycemia (&lt;55 mg/dl), (5) episodes of moderate hypoglycemia (55-70 mg/dl), and (6) nocturnal hypoglycemia (11 PM to 6 AM).</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity measures, including total step number as well as duration of activity as defined by heart rate increment, will be analyzed to determine relationship to changes in sensor glucose levels. For all data, paired analysis will be used to compare responses per participant for masked vs. unmasked periods (2 weeks each).</description>

    <measure>Reduction in glycemic variability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGM data will be analyzed to evaluate (1) number of episodes of hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dl) and (2) overall variability in glycemia.</description>

    <description>Each participant will wear the DexCom continuous glucose monitor for four weeks. During the first two weeks, participants will not be able to read the sensor glucose levels. In the second two weeks, participants will be able to read the sensor glucose levels. Frequency of hypoglycemia will be compared between the two phases of the study.</description>

    <description>The CGM will monitor sensor glucose levels in all participants. During the first two weeks of the study, participants will be masked to the sensor glucose levels and will need to use other methods, such as a blood sample from a finger stick, to check their blood sugar. During the second two weeks, participants will be able to see the sensor glucose levels displayed from the CGM. Participants will be instructed to use this information to treat low glucose levels before symptoms or severely low glucose levels develop.</description>
