  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There had been much evidence in aspirin controlling tumorous conditions conducted by basic
      researches, especially through mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The investigator
      observed efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in one
      child who got Kawasaki disease and in the addition four TSC patients with epilepsy. The
      investigator intend to evaluate whether aspirin would be an effective add-on treatment in TSC
      patients with refractory seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no optional treatment for patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and
      refractory epilepsy.The investigator observed efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of in one
      child who got Kawasaki disease. Subsequent adjunctive aspirin therapy in four patients
      yielded a reducted frequency of seizure for 51.2-89.7%. The investigator intend to evaluate
      whether aspirin would be an effective add-on treatment in TSC patients with refractory
      seizures.

      Refractory epilepsy was defined as more than 8 times of epileptic events in 4 weeks at
      baseline, and had been given more than two antiepileptic drugs maintaining for more than 3
      months.TSC patients aged 6-30 years' old would be recruited with refractory seizures and
      randomly assigned to two groups, aspirin and antiepileptic drugs(AEDS) group and placebo-AEDS
      group after written informed consent be obtained. Patients and their guardians would be
      instructed to record their own seizure diary on the epileptic events and report monthly.The
      primary outcome would be reduction of seizure frequency (measured by average seizure
      frequency and response rate). The secondary outcome would include seizure-free days,
      seizure-free rates, changes in EEG, changes of facial angiofibromas, and exposure-response
      relationship analysis.The study is designed as a placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded
      evaluation trial.

             seizure-free time of more than 10 days a month

          3. more than two antiepileptic drugs (AED) had been administered but fail to control the
             situation; maintaining with 1 or more than 1 AEDS for over 2 months and intending to
             continue with the drugs

             months

          5. vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is allowed as a previous or current therapy and would
             maintain until the end of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma and requires immediate surgery；

          2. a history of intracranial surgery within 6 months;

          3. epilepsy caused by improper use of drugs;

          4. patients treated with aspirin had severe or intolerant side effects, including
             gastrointestinal ulcer, bleeding, aspirin allergy, and other conditions;

          5. psychogenic seizures;

          6. severe renal dysfunction and infection

          7. pregnant women and lactating women

             using aspirin may cause a rare life-threatening Reye syndrome (characterized with
             persistent vomiting）, should temporary withdrawal, medication needs to consult a
             physician before using again.
