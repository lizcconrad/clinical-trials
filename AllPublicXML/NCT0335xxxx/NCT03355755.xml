    <textblock>
      A safety and feasibility study of robotic exoskeleton training in deconditioned patients
      residing in a healthcare facility.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are hospitalized for several weeks or months are at a higher risk of decline in
      physical condition and are also at a higher risk of rehospitalization within 30 days of
      discharge. A program incorporating robotic exoskeleton training may provide sufficient
      physical support and challenge for patients to maintain a higher level of physical condition
      than if they did not undergo exoskeleton training. The investigators aim to demonstrate that
      EksoGT robotic exoskeleton training can be performed safely with patients who have been
      hospitalized and are at risk of experiencing a further decline in their physical condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of &quot;deconditioned&quot;, defined as the loss of muscle tone and endurance due
             to chronic disease, immobility, or loss of function.

          2. Adults 18 years and older (or as specified by state law).

         11. Uncontrolled or severe orthostatic hypotension that limits standing tolerance.

         12. Cardiac ischemia within 24 hours.

         13. Unresolved or new (within 24 hours) deep vein thrombosis.

         14. Concurrent severe neurological pathology/disease or stroke within 72 hours.

         15. Open skin ulcerations on any body surfaces in contact with exoskeleton.

         16. Acute fracture

         17. Osteoporosis

         18. Active heterotrophic ossification (HO) of the lower extremity, hip dysplasia, or
             hip/knee axis abnormalities.

         19. Current chemotherapy

         20. Inability to speak or understand the English language.

         21. Inability to cooperate in tests/exercises.

         22. Hip flexion contracture greater than ~17°.

         23. Knee flexion contracture greater than 12°.

         24. Unable to achieve neutral ankle dorsiflexion with passive stretch (neutral with max
             12° knee flexion).

         25. Cognitive impairments - unable to follow 2 step commands or to communicate pain or to
             stop session.

         26. Pregnancy
