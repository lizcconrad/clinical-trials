        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be healthy, without significant medical illness, on the basis of
             physical examination, medical history, and vital signs performed at screening

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening. If the results of the laboratory screening tests are outside the laboratory
             normal reference ranges, and additionally within the limits representing Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA) toxicity Grade 1, the participant may be considered eligible only
             if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Participant must agree not to donate bone marrow, blood, and blood products from the
             first study vaccine administration until 3 months after the last study vaccine
             administration

          -  Participant must be willing to provide verifiable identification

          -  All female participants of childbearing potential must have:

               1. a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at
                  screening

               2. a negative urine (beta-hCG) pregnancy test immediately prior to each study
                  vaccine administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a known history of flavivirus infection or previous receipt of
             flavivirus vaccine such as dengue virus (DENV) types 1-4, yellow fever virus (YFV),
             Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV)

          -  Participant has traveled to an area with active flavivirus transmission (as per
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]'s 'Zika travel notices') or Zika
             cautionary areas ('Yellow and Red areas') within 4 weeks before screening

          -  Participant has chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, verified at
             screening by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, respectively

          -  Participant has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or type 2 infection

          -  Participant received or plans to receive licensed live-attenuated vaccines within 28
             days before or after each planned study vaccine administration; licensed inactivated,
             subunit, or conjugate vaccines within 14 days before or after each planned study
             vaccine administration
