  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate the effects of combined corneal wavefront-guided
      transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (tPRK) and accelerated corneal collagen
      cross-linking (CXL) after intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation in patients with
      moderate keratoconus. Medical records of 23 eyes of 23 patients undergoing combined tPRK and
      CXL after ICRS implantation were retrospectively analyzed. Uncorrected distance visual acuity
      (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent
      (MRSE), corneal indices based on Scheimpflug tomography, higher-order aberrations (HOAs), and
      corneal biomechanical properties were evaluated before and after ICRS implantation, and at 1,
      3, and 6 months after combined tPRK and CXL. Corneal biomechanical properties were measured
      using the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer at approximately the same time of day.

      3, and 6 months after combined tPRK and CXL. Corneal biomechanical properties were measured
      using the dynamic Scheimpflug analyzer at approximately the same time of day. The dynamic
      Scheimpflug analyzer automatically calculated corneal deformation amplitude, radius values,
      and maximal concave power when the cornea is deformed to its greatest curvature by the air
      puff. The deformation amplitude is defined as the maximum amplitude when the cornea is
      deformed to its greatest concave curvature and is influenced by corneal stiffness. The radius
      values represent the central concave curvature at the highest concavity (depressed to the
      highest concavity), while maximal concave power is the inverse radius of the curvature at the
      highest concavity.
