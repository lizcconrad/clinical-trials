        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A cataract will be defined as clouding of the lens that interferes with normal vision.

          2. Not relevant, as study not on cancer patients.

          3. Only patients older than 50 years will be included, as cataracts develops with
             increasing age. No gender criteria are applied.

          4. Only individuals with the mental capacity to provide informed consent with be
             included.

        More specifically, all the following inclusion criteria must be met:

          1. Patients have medically dilated pupil size of at least 4.0mm.

          2. Patients are willing and able to sign a written Informed Consent Form prior to any
             study-specific procedures.

          3. Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 12
             months after the cataract surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with prior history of pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

          2. Patients with a prior history of glaucoma filtration surgery.

          3. Patients with optic atrophy.

          4. Patients with ocular pathology or disease (including pupil pathology such as fixated
             pupils) that might confound the outcome or increase the risk of adverse event..

          5. Patients with a prior history of vitrectomy.

          6. Patients with a prior history of cataract or refractive lens surgery

          7. Patients with central corneal scarring.

          8. Patients with residual, recurrent, active or uncontrolled eyelid disease.

          9. Patients with significant corneal asymmetry or irregular topography.

         10. Patients with anterior segment pathology.

         11. Patients with any corneal abnormality

         12. Patients with any progressive retinal disease or subjects with a history or evidence
             of retinal vascular occlusion and/or hypercoagulability, because of the risks
             associated with high pressures during suction application.

         13. Patients with amblyopia or strabismus or those who are at risk for developing
             strabismus postoperatively as determined by corneal light reflex and cover-uncover
             testing.

         14. Patients who are pregnant, lactating, of child-bearing potential and not practising a
             medically approved method of birth control, or planning to become pregnant during the
             course of the trial, and patients with other conditions associated with fluctuation of
             hormones that could lead to refractive changes.
