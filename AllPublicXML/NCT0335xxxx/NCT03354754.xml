    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18 to 85 years of age with visual confirmation (presence of
             pus within the abdominal cavity) of an intra-abdominal infection associated with
             peritonitis including at least one inclusionary diagnosis during surgical
             intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any of the excluded diagnoses: abdominal wall abscess, small bowel obstruction,
             traumatic bowel perforation undergoing surgery within 12 hours, perforation of
             gastroduodenal ulcer with surgery within 24 hours, an intra-abdominal process that is
             not likely caused by infection.

          -  Pre-operative treatment of any duration with non-study Drug systemic antibiotic
             therapy for peritonitis or abscess is not allowed unless certain criteria are met.

          -  Concomitant bacterial infection at time of enrollment requiring non-Study Drug
             antibiotics and that may interfere with the evaluation of clinical response to the
             study antibiotic.

          -  Known non-abdominal source of infection, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis,
             abscess, meningitis, or pneumonia diagnosed within 7 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient has an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score &gt;
             30 or is considered, in the judgement of the investigator, unlikely to survive 4 weeks
             (e.g. rapidly progressive terminal illness, including septic shock).

          -  Patients that meet sepsis criteria as defined by the quick sequential sepsis-related
             organ failure assessment (qSOFA).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception during dosing and for 7 days after stopping study treatment.
