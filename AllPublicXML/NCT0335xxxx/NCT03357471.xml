    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of subjects who are already prescribed
      Certolizumab Pergol therapy and have been self injecting with prefilled syringes for at least
      the previous three months, to safely and effectively self-inject Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)
      using the e-Device and to evaluate the post-use structural integrity of used devices and
      cassettes via visual examination.

    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Week 2 for Q2W; Week 4 for Q4W)</time_frame>
    <description>Safe and effective self-injection will be evaluated by the healthcare provider and is defined as:
Dose Delivery: Subject self-injected the complete dose of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) as confirmed by a visual inspection of the CZP-cassette(s) which shows the pre-filled syringe container to be empty AND
No Adverse Events related to use of the e-Device (Adverse Device Effects) that would preclude continued use of the e-Device for self-injection
For subjects on the Q4W (every 4 weeks) dosing regimen who will self-inject twice (2×200 mg CZP) at each visit, each injection will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness using the above criteria. The primary endpoint of safe and effective self-injection for subjects on the Q4W dosing regimen will be met only if both self-injections are determined to be safe and effective.</description>

          -  Subject must have been diagnosed at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 with documented
             moderate to severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA),
             active Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) (in US), or moderately to severely active Crohn's
             Disease (CD) (in US)

          -  A minimum of 10 subjects will have impaired hand function. Impaired hand function will
             be measured using the Cochin scale (Duruöz et al, 1996; Poiraudeau et al, 2000) and
             impaired hand function will be defined as patients who have a Cochin score &gt;= 13.5 at
             Baseline

          -  Subjects must have been prescribed Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) and must have been
             self-injecting CZP using the pre-filled syringe for at least 3 months prior to Visit
