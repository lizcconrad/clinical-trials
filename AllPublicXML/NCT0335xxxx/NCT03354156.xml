  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of
      atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that monocytes can develop a long-lasting
      immunological memory after stimulation with various microorganisms, which has been termed
      'trained innate immunity'. This memory is induced by epigenetic reprogramming, in particular
      trimethylation of lysine 4 at histone 3 (H3K4me3).

      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the immunophenotype of circulating
      monocytes in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol levels and the effect of statins on this
      phenotype.

      The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of
      atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that monocytes can develop a long-lasting
      immunological memory after stimulation with various microorganisms, which has been termed
      'trained innate immunity'. This memory is induced by epigenetic reprogramming, in particular
      trimethylation of lysine 4 at histone 3 (H3K4me3).

      The main objective is to study whether circulating monocytes of patients with elevated levels
      of LDL have a phenotype of trained innate immunity compared to control patients. Subsequently
      the investigators will study the effect of treatment with statins on the increased
      inflammatory response and epigenetic changes of the innate immune system.
