  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood trauma is known as a vulnerability factor in schizophrenia. In healthy volunteers,
      these adversities are linked to a decrease of grey matter of the brain, similar to those
      observed in schizophrenia.

      In a previous study based on Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM), including 21 schizophrenic
      patients and 30 healthy volunteers, the investigators shown a negative correlation between
      emotional neglect (important dimension in childhood trauma) and grey matter decrease. This
      strong correlation was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in healthy
      volunteers, suggesting a higher genetic predisposition to environmental factors in
      schizophrenic people.

      Currently, interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental stress factors is the
      major model for understanding in schizophrenia. In order to analyze both effects on human
      body, particularly on brain, several studies currently focus on the product of genetic
      expression, the ribonucleic acid (ARN).

      The purpose of this study is to provide an explanatory model of links between childhood
      trauma, candidate gene for schizophrenia expression, cerebral morphology and schizophrenic
      symptomatology. Using conceptual framework of stress vulnerability, structural equation
      modeling (SEM) will allow testing causal link between these different variables.
