    <description>The hair loss will be assessed by the investigator using Investigator Photographic Assessment Questionnaire (IPAQ).The change from Baseline in hair growth will be assessed using the following 7-point scale: -3 = greatly decreased, -2 = moderately decreased, -1 = slightly decreased, 0 = no change, +1 = slightly increased, +2 = moderately increased, +3 = greatly increased.</description>

    <description>Subject satisfaction evaluated by Women's Androgenic Alopecia Quality of Life Questionnaire (WAA-QOL) at each post-treatment visit from baseline. WAA-QOL is a sixteen-question questionnaire to evaluate subjects' quality of life influenced by hair loss. Each question will be assessed using the following 7-point scale: 0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = a good bit, 4 = quite a bit , 5 = very much, 6 = extremely.</description>
