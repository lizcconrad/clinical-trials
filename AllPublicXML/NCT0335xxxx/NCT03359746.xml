      This is a prospective, interventional, case-control study at King Faisal Specialist Hospital
      &amp; Research Centre in post-renal transplant patients who are receiving Grazoprevir/Elbasvir
      combination. Data will be compared with matched historical controls, which will be selected
      according to the following matching criteria: age, time from transplant to initiation of
      therapy. Only patients who completed at least 48 weeks of pegylated Interferon + Ribavirin
      therapy in the control group and 12 weeks of therapy on the case group will be enrolled. Any
      patient who received at least one dose of Grazoprevir/Elbasvir combination will be included
      in the safety analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the subject must be:

          -  Male or female &gt; 18 years on the day of consent signature.

          -  Post renal transplant with stable graft function divided into 2 groups according to
             Creatinine Clearance (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min Or CrCl â‰¥30 mL/min).

          -  Positive HCV infection post renal transplant defined as: Positive HCV RNA with
             documented HCV Genotype 4 (including those with mixed infections with Genotype 4 &amp;
             Genotype 1 or Genotype 4 &amp; Genotype 6).

          -  Fibro scan (Liver Elastography) performed prior to the baseline with evidence of
             chronic HCV infection.

          -  Liver Cirrhosis subjects may be included but will be limited to those with compensated
             liver disease (Child Pugh-A)

          -  Patient understands the study procedures, alternative treatments available, risks

             signs or symptoms of advanced liver disease (Child Pugh-B or Child Pugh-C based on a
             platelet count below 75000 or an albumin below 3 g/dL)

          -  Pregnant or nursing female or male patient with pregnant female partner.

          -  Contraindications for Grazoprevir/Elbasvir.

             compound within 30 days of signing informed consent and is not willing to refrain from
             participating in another such study during the course of this study.
