  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of nutritional therapy (TN) in the surgical patient is well described in the
      literature and is associated with reductions in postoperative complications, length of
      hospital stay, and mortality. Adequate determination of caloric and protein requirements is
      an essential step in the TN institution, avoiding hypoalimentation and hyperalimentation.
      Thus, it is essential to understand the changes in energy expenditure after surgery and its
      relation with nutritional status. In addition, little is known about the effect of
      nutritional therapy and caloric adequacy on parameters such as phase angle and dynamometry.
      Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in energy expenditure after
      major abdominal surgeries and to evaluate the phase angle and dynamometry as possible markers
      of nutritional therapy. Energy expenditure will be assessed by indirect calorimetry.
      Functionality will be assessed by means of dynamometry and 6-minute walk test. Nutritional
      diagnosis will be given through subjective global assessment. Energy and protein intake will
      be monitored and registered daily. Phase angle will be obtained by performing bioelectrical
      impedance.
