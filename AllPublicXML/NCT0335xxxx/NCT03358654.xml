    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) from
      umbilical cord in the treatment of 7 knee OA patients by assessing unexplained local and
      systemic symptoms or death before and at 1, 2, 3, 6 months after the injection.

      This is a single group assignment study with a total of 9 knee osteoarthritis patients
      participants. All of the patients will receive the anticular injection with MSCs from
      umbilical cord and unexplained local and systemic symptoms or death before the end of
      following-up will be assessed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      from umbilical cord.

    <description>The severity of AE must be recorded and graded according to the CTCAE criteria, and its relationship to therapy must be assessed according to the following definition:①not related: there is evidence that the cause of adverse events is not due to intra-articular injection therapy (such as previous conditions, potential diseases, concurrent diseases); ②related: AE and intra-articular injection are time-related and it is known or suspected that intra-articular injection of drugs can cause the AE; ③it can't be assessed.</description>
