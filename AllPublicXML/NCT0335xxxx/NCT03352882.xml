      Pilot study examining changes in liver stiffness measured by ultrasound before and after TIPS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single arm pilot study of adults â‰¥18yo investigating changes in liver stiffness as measured
      by ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) before and after creation of TIPS.
      Duration of participation is 30 days from TIPS creation. TIPS creation with Viatorr stent
      graft will be in accordance with its FDA-approved indication for symptomatic portal
      hypertension and per the manufacturer's instructions for use. Liver stiffness will be
      measured on pre-TIPS and post-TIPS ultrasounds using Phillips Epiq Ultrasound systems
      equipped with ElastPQ ultrasound shear wave elastography. Both ultrasounds will be performed
      at times which are standard of care before and after TIPS creation. Primary objectives
      include liver stiffness as measured by ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)
      before and after creation of TIPS. Secondary objectives include change in portosystemic
      gradient, clinical success as measured by difference in frequency of repeat paracentesis
      post-TIPS or freedom from recurrence of variceal bleeding and rate of hepatic encephalopathy.
      Exploratory objectives include serum biomarkers of liver stiffness.

    <description>The primary study endpoint will be decrease in liver stiffness following TIPS creation as measured by ARFI using mean propagation velocity values in meters per second. Mean normal values and mean values indicating severe fibrosis range about 0.8-1.7 m/s and about 1-3.4 m/s respectively. We hypothesize TIPS creation will reduce the liver stiffness by &gt; 50%. Change in liver stiffness will be correlated to change in PSG.</description>
