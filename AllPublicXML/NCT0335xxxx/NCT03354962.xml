    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I/II, multicenter, open-label study starting with a phase I part
      followed by a Phase II part.

      The phase I part of the study aims at evaluating the safety and efficacy (in terms of
      abscopal effect at week 6) of the treatment combination schema of Stereotactic Body Radiation
      Therapy (SBRT) and PD-1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients
      will be assigned in one of 3 cohorts depending the metastatic site. 18 patients will be
      enrolled in each cohort.

      Once the recommended optimal radiotherapy dose has been declared for the 3 cohorts, patients
      will be enrolled in the phase II part of the study in order to evaluate the activity
      (progression-free survival at 6 months) of SBRT given in combination with immune checkpoints
      inhibitors in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      71 patients will be included in the phase II.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically-proven metastatic and/or unresectable melanoma (stage
             IIIc-IV, M1a-c as per AJCC 2009), including mucosal melanoma, without evidence of
             active intra-cranial disease.

          2. Patients are included regardless of BRAFV600 mutation status. BRAFV600 mutation status
             must be documented.

          3. Patients with a metastatic lesion located on liver, lung, or bone and eligible for a
             SBRT.

          4. Patients should present at least two lesions: one lesion to be irradiated and one
             distant lesion that will serve as control. Lesion to be irradiated will be selected on
             the basis of symptomatology, safety and/or location. Preferentially, both lesions
             should be measurable per RECIST 1.1. If only the control lesion is measurable but not
             the irradiated lesion, eligibility will be discussed with the sponsor.
