  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common complication in patients with sickle
      cell disease (SCD) and pain related to VOC is often inadequately treated. This is a phase II
      randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of virtual reality technology
      when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease who are
      experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting. Patients will be randomized to
      receive either standard management only or standard management in addition to virtual reality
      therapy. The remainder of care for the painful event will continue per institutional
      standards according to clinical indication, including reassessment and documentation of pain
      and additional doses of pain medicines by intravenous (IV) or oral route. Pain scores and
      opioid requirement will be measured and compared across treatment arms, along with the
      outcomes of discharge from clinic versus admission to the inpatient unit.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing pain
      at 30 minutes after intervention during an acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with
      sickle cell disease. Primary endpoint will be change in pain scores in Standard versus VR
      arms, between the first pain assessment at the time of presentation and the subsequent pain
      assessments up to 30 minutes after intervention.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare total opioid consumption from the time of presentation to the time of
           discharge from acute care setting in Standard versus VR arms.

        -  To assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) technology in reducing pain at 60 minutes
           after the first IV medication administered or 60 minutes after completion VR during an
           acute vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease.

      After consenting to participate in this study, patients will be randomized to receive either
      standard care therapy for VOC or to receive standard care therapy plus a 15-minute virtual
      reality (VR) session. They will be additionally randomized into strata by age: 6 to 11 years,
      12 to 18 years, and 19 to 25 years. At the end of therapy or therapy plus the VR session,
      they will be asked to complete a 5-minute satisfaction survey. Information will also be
      collected from the medical record about the pain episode, including pain scores, medicines
      used, and time needed for pain to lessen.

      Standard care for management of an acute VOC includes parenteral hydration and pain
      management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as Toradol or Ibuprofen, and
      opioids. Pain scores will be measured at three different time points: baseline at
      presentation, at 30±10 minutes after first intravenous (IV) analgesic medication, and at
      60±10 minutes after first IV analgesic medication.

      Use of VR will be included in addition to the standard care for management of patients
      randomized to VR arm. VR is an interactive technology that allows the user to interface with
      a three dimensional computer-generated environment by means of a lightweight head mounted
      display. The user is transported into a relaxing VR environment that diverts their attention
      away from pain. The duration of VR session is 15 minutes. Pain scores will be measured at
      three different time points: baseline at presentation, at 15±10 minutes after completion of
      VR therapy, and at 60±10 minutes after completion of VR therapy.
