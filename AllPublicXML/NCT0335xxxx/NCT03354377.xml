  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses two challenges seen among African American (AA) participants during
      previous weight loss and dietary interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      risk: poor weight loss results and high attrition rates. Investigators will target both of
      these challenges by using a randomized design to compare a plant-based dietary intervention
      (vegan diet) vs. an omnivorous (omni) diet and by focusing on culturally-tailored food
      choices for AA adults living in the South. Therefore, the objective of the study is to
      conduct a culturally-tailored, randomized trial examining how a vegan diet affects CVD risk
      factors and weight as compared with an omni diet. The study will randomize overweight AA
      adults (n=130) to follow one of two different diets (vegan or omni) for 24 months.
      Investigators will accomplish objectives and test hypotheses by following two specific
      primary aims:

      Primary Aims: Using a randomized design, determine the impact at 12 months of two different,
      culturally tailored diets (n=65 omni and n=65 vegan) on changes in:

        1. Risk factors for CVD, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure; and

        2. Body weight.

           Secondary Aim

        3. Examine long-term changes in CVD risk factors and body weight at 24 months.

    <description>Participants in this group will follow a plant-based vegan diet. The vegan group diet will be based on investigators' pilot work, which instructs participants to favor a diet built around whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. This group will be supplemented by the Oldways African Heritage and Health program, which includes a food pyramid guide. A Taste of African Heritage (ATAH) six-lesson nutrition and cooking program and an online course for health professionals and cooking instructors (all research and restaurant team members will complete this course.
Interventions include intervention meetings, physical activity, and podcasts/mailings.</description>
