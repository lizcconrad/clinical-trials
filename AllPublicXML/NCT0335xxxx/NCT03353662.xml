      To conduct a sub-regional micronutrient survey (SRMNS) assessing the prevalence of vitamin A,
      Zn, and Fe status in the country
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Ethiopia, biofortified staple crops, such as high vitamin A maize, high zinc
      (Zn) maize, high Zn wheat and high iron (Fe) common bean could have a beneficial impact on
      micronutrient status, as the regular varieties of these crops are eaten in significant
      amounts in some of the administrative regions. It is however, unknown in which region people
      would most benefit as data on vitamin A, Zn and Fe status in the different regions is too
      limited to efficiently target specific biofortification approaches.

      Objective: The overall objective of the project is to generate data to target and tailor bio
      fortification approaches in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is planned to conduct a sub-regional
      micronutrient surveys (SRMNS) assessing the prevalence of vitamin A, Zn, and Fe status in the
      country.

      Study design: The sub regional micronutrient survey (SRMNS) will have a cross-sectional
      design with one measuring point.

      Study population: The SRMNS will be conducted in 600 children &lt; 5 years of age and 600 women
      of reproductive age (18-45 years) living in the regions of Kamashi in Benishangul Gumuz, West
      Gojjam in Amhara, and Goma Gofa in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Regions
      (SNNP).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The prevalence of Fe, Zn and vitamin A deficiency will be
      assessed by measuring hemoglobin (Hb), plasma ferritin (PF), soluble transferrin receptor
      (sTfR), C-reactive protocol (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), plasma Zn (PZn), plasma
      retinol and retinol binding protein (RBP), respectively.

      Significance: The study will generate important data on the vitamin A, Zn and Fe status of
      children and women for sub-regions in Ethiopia. Such sub-regional data will be more specific
      than common survey data and therefore be helpful to target bio fortification and identify the
      populations in Ethiopia who will benefit most from high nutrient crops.
