    <textblock>
      For 25 years, the concept of Rapid Rehabilitation After Surgery or RRAC has developed to
      bring about a global care of the patient by establishing a safe and quality climate. With
      this concept of RRAC or fast track surgery, it is the idea that a patient will recover sooner
      than he is lying later. &quot;Fast care&quot; is based on the principle that any patient is valid
      before he / be operated and therefore do not need to come to a bed in the operating room.

      The ambulatory surgery department of the CHU of Caen welcomes and supports adults and
      children over 8 years old. The following specialties are covered: dental surgery and
      stomatology, digestive and visceral surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngological surgery,
      vascular surgery, gynecological surgery, urological surgery. The ambulatory surgery unit is
      experimenting with patient support at the operating theater on foot by the service stretcher
      team since December 2015. It seems that this technique makes it possible to improve the
      quality of care by respecting the dignity and autonomy; in fact to wander the patient
      preserves his glasses, his hearing aids, capillary prosthesis ... The patient is an actor and
      not dependent, he is accompanied and not taken away. The preservation of autonomy improves
      their feelings, especially in terms of dignity. It also appears to be a technique for
      participating in the reduction of preoperative anxiety, an important factor for postoperative
      follow-up.

      However, studies reporting the benefit of this technique have rather evaluated the feelings
      of patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated their
      benefit on anxiety reduction by questionnaires or ad hoc scales. Assessing anxiety with
      appropriate tools seems essential to determine a real impact.

      We hypothesize that accompanying the patient to the operating room on foot would reduce
      preoperative anxiety. We have not yet found any studies showing that the &quot;standing patient&quot;
      pathway had an impact on preoperative anxiety. We propose to carry out a randomized study
      comparing the anxiety score using the APAIS scale at the operating room installation between
      patients benefiting from the &quot;standing patient pathway&quot; versus the patients receiving the
      care standard, that is to say the stretcher transport to the operating theater.

      The duration of this study is evaluated at 2 years.
