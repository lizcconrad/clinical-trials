  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-medical used of misoprostol for abortion is a growing concern in Guadeloupe. Such
      situation is reasonable for countries in which abortion is not easy to obtain or prohibited.
      However regarding the risk of complications, it is less understandable in region like
      Guadeloupe where legal abortion with medical assistance is accessible for all and free.

      The aim of the study is to investigate on the amount of misoprostol taken by women in
      Guadeloupe, by doing an analytical measurement. The aim is to evaluate batter this practice
      in Guadeloupe, when the main objective of the study is to detect the presence or the absence
      of misoprostol in the urine sample of the woman coming at hospital for threatened miscarriage
      or miscarriage complications. Moreover, these abortions can be more important than
      spontaneous miscarriage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous assessments in many countries as well in Guadeloupe were based on self-declaration.
      Such assessment is suspected to lead to underestimation. In addition, to our knowledge, no
      comparison has been done between those induced abortions and the natural miscarriages.

      Illegal aspects of non-medical use of misoprostol and consequently bad self-declaration are
      hindrance to good assessment of the burden of such practice among patients asking for medical
      care at emergency unit for miscarriage or threatened miscarriage. They may also impair
      quality of evaluation of the relative risk associated to miscarriage threatened miscarriage
      induced by misoprostol compared to the same obstetrical complication without absorption of
      misoprostol. After a dose, misoprostol is quickly active and metabolised. It is mainly
      eliminated in urine. This elimination seems to be a way to increase the length of detection
      of the use of misoprostol. The aim of our study is to perform a detection of misoprostol in
      urine sample of patients hospitalised for a miscarriage or threatened miscarriage. This
      sample will be done during emergency cares. The study will not change the procedure of
      medical care of the patients during or after hospitalisation. All data will be obtained from
      information and result of tests normally done in such situation.
