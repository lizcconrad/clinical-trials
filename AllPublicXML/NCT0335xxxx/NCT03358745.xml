  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The order in which the different components of a meal are eaten may have impact on the
      postprandial metabolic responses to carbohydrates, fat and proteins. This study will compare
      blood lipids and glycemia regulation following lunches of identical composition but varying
      the order of intake of the different meal components.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The order in which the different components of a meal are eaten may have impact on the
      postprandial metabolic responses to carbohydrates, fat and proteins. Some of these responses
      are associated with the risk for developing cardiometabolic complications.

      The study will be carried out in a cohort of healthy subjects with a wide BMI range and
      normal fasting glycemia. Postprandial metabolic responses to a reference meal starting with
      bread and butter (BB) will be compared with those registered after 3 other meals of identical
      composition, in which the starter will be permutated. Each meal is tested on an independent
      experimental session, with a 1 week washout interval.

      The intervention will be carried out at the Food for Health Science Centre - Lund University.
      Additionally, the plan contemplates an initial information visit including screening of
      fasting blood glucose. In total, each volunteer completing the study will pay five visits to
      the clinical unit.

      Based on the results from the above-described phase, a second step of the study will compare
      various quality attributes of the most effective starter on the impact on cardiometabolic
      risk markers, as a way to optimize putative protective actions and to gain further
      mechanistic insight.

    <description>Subjects eat a reference lunch (reference lunch) at 11:30 am, 4 h after a defined light breakfast. The meal contains 38 g fat and 885 kcal and consists of bread and butter, soup, salad and cheese. The participants eat the bread and butter portion within 15 min and the remaining components of the meal are consumed within the following 15 min (total eating time=30 min).
Blood samples are taken before the lunch and every 30 min postprandial for 4 h.</description>
