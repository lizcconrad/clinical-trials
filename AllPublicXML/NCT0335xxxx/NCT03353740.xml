  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent
      (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients
      with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histopathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Rising PSA (at least two consecutive rising PSAs) after definitive therapy with
             prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy).

               -  Post radical prostatectomy (RP) - AUA recommendation for biochemical recurrence
                  after radical prostatectomy

                    -  PSA greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6 weeks after RP.

               -  Post-radiation therapy -ASTRO-Phoenix consensus definition of biochemical
                  recurrence after radiation therapy

                    -  Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent).

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign
             it.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Unable to lie flat, still or tolerate a PET scan.

          -  Concomitant investigational therapy.

          -  Patient undergoing active treatment for non-prostate malignancy, other than skin basal
             cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and
             superficial bladder cancer.

          -  Contraindication to furosemide administration including prior allergy or adverse
             reaction to furosemide or sulfa drugs. (Note: This exclusion criteria can be removed
             if Furosemide is omitted as part of the PET imaging protocol if a second-generation
             scatter correction is available for the used PET device).
