  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery aims to correct jaw position taking into account esthetic and functional
      criteria (dental occlusion, lip position, breathing...). These surgeries are planned using
      clinical, radiological and dental cast data. The result of this planning are occlusal
      splints. Orthognathic surgery had improved in the last decade with 3 dimensions computerized
      tomography scan (3D CT-Scan) planning and osteosynthesis implants. However the accuracy of
      the operative results compared to the planned ones has rarely been measured.

    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery aims to correct jaw position taking into account esthetic and functional
      criteria (dental occlusion, lip position, breathing...). These surgeries are planned only
      after the end of the growing period and in association with orthodontics. It is necessary to
      wait the end of facial growth to expect a stable result especially concerning mandibular. The
      age limit seems to be around 15 to 16 years old for retromandibular deformities and around 18
      years old for premandibular deformities.

      These surgeries are planned using clinical, radiological and dental cast data. Occlusal
      splints are made using all these results; these occlusal splints are used during the
      orthognathic surgery to maintain bones in the planned position.

      Since 1993, a navigation system (Orthopilot™) is used, which allow to track jaw position, in
      real time, with an accuracy around one millimeter and one degree, during orthognathic
      surgery. This system is routinely used for condyle repositioning after mandibular sagittal
      split osteotomies; but it is also useful for maxillary navigation and positioning.

      The investigator propose to measure the accuracy of the operative results compared to the
      planned ones, using the Orthopilot™ system.

    <measure>Distribution of the translational and rotational shifts of the maxilla between planning and realization</measure>
    <time_frame>during the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Shifts will be quantified by 6 components (3 in rotation and 3 in translation) in a coordinate system given by Orthopilot™ navigation system.
Accuracy of the surgical technic is evaluated by the distribution of the translational and rotational shifts of the maxilla between planning and realization, taking account conformity (when left/right translation is ≤ 1 mm, top/bottom and back/front translations are &lt; 2 mm, frontal rotation is ≤ 1° and axial and sagittal rotations are ≤ 2°), failure (when left/right, top/bottom and back/front translations are &gt; 2 mm, frontal, axial and sagittal rotations are &gt;4°), and non conformity (every other shifts).</description>

    <description>The inter-incisal vector (that is square root of the sum of each translation shift squared) is calculated by the statistician. It derived from shifts in millimeter and degree measured during surgery by Orthopilot™ navigation system.</description>
