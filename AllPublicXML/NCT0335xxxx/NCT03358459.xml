  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a major disease of the nervous system (WHO, 2015), as well as the second most
      common neural disease. It has been recorded that there have been 65 million epilepsy patients
      all over the world, more than 10 million in China, resulted in high morbidity, high
      mortality, heavy social and social psychological burden. Due to complex etiology, which
      genetic playing a large part for 70%-80%, easy to recurrent, as well as various seizure
      types, a great heterogeneity in clinical manifestation, epilepsy is difficult to treat in
      general, at least 33% patients. At present, It's still a big challenge in early warning,
      choice of treatment, efficacy and severe adverse reaction rate, prognosis assessment. Lack of
      precise diagnosis based genetic and molecular bio-markers for treatment are the main key
      points. Recently, clinical phenotype classifications of epilepsy have been refined, the exist
      researches had made a progress in gene mutation mechanism and targeted therapy, which pushed
      epilepsy being another disease could be precise treated after tumor. It's sure to provide a
      breakthrough for another neural diseases if epilepsy precise treatment project are
      successful.

      Research projects:

      Part 1: Based on already existed large samples of epilepsy clinical cases, choose 2,0000
      non-acquired epilepsy patients for clinical general phenotype and middle phenotype(EEG and
      MRI) data collection to further multi-dimensional standardization measure and evaluate.
      Through metabolic detection to define micro-phenotype. Establish a standardized clinical and
      biological samples database.

      Part 2: By NGS technology to sequence for all cases, including family members, then require
      genotype. To test brain tissue DNA somatic mutation, which MRI negative and had an operation.
      To verify the newly discovered pathogenic candidate genes and carry on functional studies.
      Finally, to draw epileptic genetic mutations mapping in Chinese people.

      Part 3: Integrated clinical and genetic epilepsy phenotypic data, combined with neural EEG
      and image bitmap data points for bio-markers analysis, included early warning, classification
      of diagnosis, curative effect prediction and epilepsy con-morbidity disease.
