      To assess the impact of soil iron intake from teff flour on iron status in infants in Debre
      Zeit, Ethiopia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Teff (Eragrostis Teff), a major staple crop in several areas of Ethiopia, is of
      special relevance to Fe biofortifcation as it provides the population with a regular high
      consumption of contaminant soil Fe due to the traditional threshing procedure under the
      hooves of the cattle. The bioavailability of soil Fe, and hence its contribution to Fe
      requirements, is unknown. Data on the bioavailability of soil Fe would clarify to what extent
      the soil Fe can be considered as a source of absorbable Fe. This information is important in
      order to establish dietary advice and is essential for the development of iron
      biofortification (and fortification) policies related to Fe nutrition in Ethiopia.

      Objective: The overall objective of the project is to generate data to target and tailor
      biofortification approaches in Ethiopia by an intervention trial assessing the impact of soil
      Fe intake from teff consumption on Fe status.

      Study design: The intervention trial will be a 7 months partially blinded, randomized control
      trial (RCT) with the following three arms: control-group consuming injera based on
      traditionally threshed teff (average Fe content 50 mg/100g flour), 2) intervention group
      consuming injera based on lab-threshed teff (average Fe content 6.65 mg/100g flour), 3)
      positive control group consuming the lab-threshed teff together with ferrous sulphate iron
      drops (additional Fe from the drops = 6 mg).

      Study population: 315 children between 18-36 months of age living in Debre Zeit and
      surrounding areas will be enrolled.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The impact of soil Fe in teff on Fe status will be assessed
      by measuring the Fe status, prevalence of Fe deficiency and Fe deficiency anemia at baseline,
      midpoint and endpoint. To assess Fe status, Hemoglobin (Hb), Plasma Ferritin (PF), Soluble
      Transferrin Receptor (sTfR), C- Reactive Protein(CRP) and Alpha 1B glycoprotein (AGP) will be
      determined.
