  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and metabolism using
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging before and after exercise training intervention at
      fasting state under normal room temperature and during cold stimulation.The investigators
      hypothesize that BAT glucose uptake is increased after exercise and BAT becomes metabolically
      more active.

      Understanding the mechanisms of BAT activation and the role of exercise in humans is crucial
      to combat epidemic of obesity and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training has been suggested to activate and recruit human BAT through the activation
      of sympathetic nervous system and contracting skeletal muscles by the release of myokines
      such as lactate and irisin that signal WAT to induce expression of beige adipocytes. It has
      been also suggested that exercise training could enhance the metabolism of already existed
      functional BAT by increasing uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) gene transcription, mitochondrial
      biogenesis and hyperplasia. This is of clinical relevance because brown fat activation has
      been found to improve metabolic factors linked to obesity and diabetes.

      In this study the investigators use a PET radiotracer 2-[18F] flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)
      to quantify the glucose uptake in BAT, whie adipose tissue and the muscle.The participants
      are scanned thrice at fast in this study once at room temperature, second at cold exposure
      and third after six weeks of exercise at cold exposure. This study will provide an insight
      about the role of exercise in activation of BAT metabolism.

    <description>Arm: Exercise: Combination of moderate intensity continuous training, high intensity interval training and endurance training 5 times per week for a total of 6 weeks. Out of 5 sessions three were supervised by trainer and two sessions were performed by subjects on their own.The duration of the exercise was increased progressively. The first two weeks was 30 minutes that increased to 45 minutes in the third and fourth week. It was 60 minutes for the last two weeks.</description>
