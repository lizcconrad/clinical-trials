  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-retroviral
      activity of MK-4250 monotherapy in anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, HIV-1 infected
      participants. The primary hypothesis of the study is that at a dose that is sufficiently safe
      and generally well tolerated, MK-4250 has superior antiretroviral activity compared to a
      historical placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) (log10 copies/mL) at 168 hours postdose.
