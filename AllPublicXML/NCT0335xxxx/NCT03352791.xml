  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (dementia) poses a significant challenge to our
      public health. While many persons with dementia are cared for by friends and family in the
      community with the assistance of home healthcare and hospice, most clinicians and agencies
      are ill prepared to care for this population and therefore have difficulty assisting patients
      and caregivers in maintaining quality of life leading to adverse patient outcomes, increased
      caregiver stress and burnout, and healthcare utilization. This study will utilize a cluster
      randomized controlled design with 6 care teams at a single study site to examine the ability
      of a multi-component evidence-based practice hospice care quality improvement program for
      registered nurses, social workers and chaplains to improve the quality of life and reduce
      healthcare utilization for persons with dementia and their informal caregiver.
