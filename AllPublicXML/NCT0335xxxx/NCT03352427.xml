    <measure>The proportion of patients that respond to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>56 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response assessment will take into account response in both target and non-target lesions, as well as the appearance of new lesions. Partial Response (PR) will be defined as ≥50% decrease in size of tumor in comparison to baseline measurements. Complete Response (CR) will be defined as The disappearance of all abnormal signal. This includes return to normal size of the brainstem for brainstem lesions.</description>

Everolimus = starting dose of 3.0 mg/m2, with titration of dosing after first cycle to keep everolimus trough level of 5-15 ug/ml
Both agents will be taken daily for 28 day cycles. Cycles will be repeated every 28 days and patients may receive up to 24 cycles.</description>
