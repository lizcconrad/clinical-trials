  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib (Zejula®)is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily by hepatic and renal
      pathways. The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of niraparib
      in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, for the purpose of providing recommendations to
      guide the initial dose and dose titration in this patient population.
