      This trial is an open-label, single arm, Phase II study using an A'Hern single stage design.

      The molecular prescreening step will allow to defined HPV tumor status as well as molecular
      status CDKN2A, CCND1 and CDK6. Following this centralized molecular screening, only patients
      with HPV negative status and with tumor harboring CDKN2A homozygous deletion and/or CCND1
      amplification and/or CDK6 amplification could initiate abemaciclib at time of documented
      radiological progression. Patients will be treated with ABEMACICLIB, 400 mg/day with 2 doses
      of 200 mg 12 hour apart (QH12). A cycle is defined as an interval of 28 days. For each 28-day
      cycle, a total of 56 doses of study drug will be dispensed.

      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The primary endpoint is the non-progression rate (CR, PR, SD as per
      RECIST 1.1) after 8 weeks of treatment.

      The sample size calculation was based on an A'Hern single stage phase II design, with a
      minimum success (non- progression) rate considered of interest of p1=40% and an uninteresting
      rate of p0=15%. Assuming a type I error alpha of 0.05 and 85% power, 23 patients are needed
      to reject the null hypothesis H0: p&lt;=p0 vs the alternative hypothesis H1: p ≥ p1 in a
      unilateral situation.

      Based on the assumption that 10% of the patients may be non-evaluable, 25 patients will be
      included in the study.

      DATA ENTRY AND DATA MANAGEMENT All the data concerning the patients will be recorded in the
      eCRF throughout the study. SAE reporting will be paper-based by Fax.

      The sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local
      low requirements.
