      A study on healthy patients undergoing anesthesia for non-abdominal surgery - evaluation of
      positive end-expiratory pressure versus zero positive end-expiratory pressure on the amount
      of atelectasis in the early postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often used during mechanical ventilation to
      preserve end-expiratory lung volume. After emergence and extubation, this volume will
      diminish instantly. Some patients will have difficulties to restore functional residual
      capacity (FRC) during the early phase of recovery. If routine high FIO2 has been delivered
      together with maintained PEEP prior to extubation, several important prerequisites are
      established for the development of postoperative atelectasis. The investigators hypothesize
      that establishing zero positive end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) immediately prior to emergence
      preoxygenation, will prevent gas with high oxygen concentration from entering dorso-basal
      areas of the lungs, and thereby prevent postoperative atelectasis formation.

      This randomized controlled study will study patients undergoing non-abdominal day case
      surgeries under general anesthesia. The patients in the two study groups will receive
      mechanical ventilation with identical settings, comprising low TV, moderate PEEP, and no RM.
      At the end of surgery, the lungs will be examined by CT, and any atelectasis areas will be
      calculated. Randomization will occur after the first CT. The patients will be allocated to
      zero PEEP (ZEEP) or maintained PEEP during emergence preoxygenation and extubation.
      Importantly, the intervention group will have ZEEP established while still having low ETO2
      levels, prior to any preoxygenation. The study subjects will be examined with CT no.2
      approximately thirty min after extubation. Primary endpoint measure will be atelectasis area
      as a percentage of total lung area. Blood gases will be collected for comparison of
      oxygenation as a secondary outcome measure.

    <description>Controlled ventilation with tidal volume of 7 mL/kg of ideal body weight and respiratory frequency 10. Fresh gas flow is set to 1 litre/min with an oxygen mixture of 40%, aiming for an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 30-35%. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set to 7 or 9 cm H20 (9 if BMI≥25) until start of emergence preoxygenation.
Unless the patient´s SpO2 falls below 90%, the FiO2 remains unchanged throughout the procedure.
First CT scan after completion of surgery, before emergence. After the first CT scan and immediately before start of emergence preoxygenation, this group will have the PEEP exchanged for zero PEEP (ZEEP). ZEEP will remain until the study subjects are extubated. Second CT scan approx. 30 min after extubation.</description>
