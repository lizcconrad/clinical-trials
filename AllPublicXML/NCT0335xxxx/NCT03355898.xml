    <textblock>
      Lorraine is one of the most affected French region by cardiovascular diseases with a
      mortality rate for ischemic heart disease higher than the national average in 2010. Due to
      practice change with the new recommandations of the European Society of Cardiology involving
      the myocardic revascularization, the investigators wanted to compare the Stemi care in
      2005-2006, 2010-2011 and 2015 in the CHR Metz-Thionville.
