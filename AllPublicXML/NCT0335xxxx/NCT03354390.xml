      Background:

      Gene transfer is a new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person and grows them in
      a lab. The cells are changed with a virus to attack tumor cells, then returned to the person.
      Researchers want to see if this therapy fights kidney cancer cells.

      Objective:

      To see if gene transfer is safe and causes tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      People at least 18 years old with certain kidney cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests. They may have:

        -  Scans

        -  Heart, lung, and eye tests

        -  Lab tests

        -  Tumor samples taken

      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed by a needle in an arm. It will go
      through a machine that removes white blood cells. Plasma and red cells will be returned
      through a needle in the participant s other arm.

      Participants cells will be grown in the lab and genetically changed.

      Participants will stay in the hospital 2 3 weeks. There they will:

        -  Get 2 chemotherapy drugs by catheter (thin plastic tube) inserted into a vein in the
           chest.

        -  Get the changed cells via catheter.

        -  Get a drug to increase white blood cell count and one to make the cells active.

        -  Recover for about a week.

        -  Have lab and blood tests.

      After leaving the hospital, participants will:

        -  Take an antibiotic for several months.

        -  Have leukapheresis.

        -  Have one- or two-day clinic visits every few weeks for 2 years, and then as determined
           by their doctor. These will include blood and lab tests, imaging studies, and physical
           exam.

      Participants will have follow-up checks for up to 15 years.

    <textblock>
      Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an incurable condition. Current therapy for this
      disease consists of the serial administration of agents such as VEGF, mTOR inhibitors and
      immunotherapy (high-dose (HD) IL-2 or immune-checkpoint inhibitors). Long-term survival can
      be achieved with high-doses IL-2 or immune-checkpoint inhibitors. However, of those patients
      treated with immunotherapy, three quarters will not respond at all and only 5-8% will achieve
      a complete and durable response.

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also capable of inducing prolonged
      disease regression in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC (ccRCC). In vitro studies have
      established that transplanted donor T-cells targeting antigens expressed on RCC cells mediate
      these anti-tumor effects. However, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be toxic and
      associated with a 10-20% risk of procedure-related mortality. The observation that
      transplanted donor T-cells have the potential to cure a subset of patients with metastatic
      disease forms the basis for continued efforts in our laboratory to harness the power of
      T-cells to cure this disorder.

      Our team isolated a tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) line from peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained after an allogeneic transplant from a patient who showed
      prolonged tumor regression. Using limiting dilution cloning, we identified an allogeneic
      (derived from the stem cell donor) CD8+ T-cell clone that killed ccRCC cells in an HLA A11
      restricted fashion. Using cDNA expression cloning, we identified a HERV-E derived antigen
      expressed in the patient s ccRCC cells to be the target of this T-cell clone. Remarkably, we
      found this HERV-E was expressed in the majority of ccRCC cells with no expression in normal
      tissues. Based on the identification of the antigenicity of the HERV-E transcripts in ccRCC,
      our team in collaboration with Dr. Nishimura s laboratory (Loyola University Cardinal
      Bernardin Cancer Center) has cloned, expressed and characterized the TCR from this CD8+
      T-cell clone that recognizes an HLA A11 restricted HERV-E antigen.

      This research protocol is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      infusion of HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells in HLA-A*11:01 positive
      patients with metastatic clear cell RCC. Subjects will receive a novel non-myeloablative
      immunosuppressive conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by an
      infusion of HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells. To mediate T cell survival and
      sustain function, moderate-doses of IL-2 (aldesleukin) will be administered intravenously
      twice a day for 7 days.

      The primary endpoint is safety by day 21. Secondary endpoints will include overall response
      rate, progressionfree survival and overall survival. We will also evaluate for the
      persistence of circulating HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ enriched T cells, changes in
      immune cell subsets and activation status of T cells, as well as, other immunologic
      determinants with clinical outcomes at baseline, at different time points during treatment
      and at the time of disease progression.

    <description>This is a single-arm, phase 1 trial of HERV-E TCR transduced CD8+/CD34+ T cells in HLAA* 11:01 positive patients with metastatic ccRCC. The study is planned based on a Phase 1 3+3 dose escalation design. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 patient in six has experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients with evaluable advanced/metastatic ccRCC will be recruited in up to 4 dose levels.</description>

             inhibitor (i.e. nivolumab) (2-week washout from antiangiogenic drug therapy and 4-week

             contraindications to receiving these medications, the agents are not available to the
             patient, or the patient declines to receive these drugs due to personal preference.

             sexually active and able to bear or beget children. In addition, male patients must
             refrain from sperm donation for 90 days after the final dose of investigational
             product. Female patients must refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days after the
