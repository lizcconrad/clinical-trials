    <description>Subjects will be stratified based on the diagnosis of documented atrial fibrillation at screening, and then subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 dose cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio (Cohort A, Cohort B and Cohort C).
Cohort A: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose #1 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort B: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose #2 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort C: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose # 3 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort A, B and C will include a 4 week screening period and a 26-week treatment period followed by a 12-week post-treatment evaluation period.
Cohort A, B and C will receive Study Drug (ISIS 416858 or placebo) once a week for the 26 week treatment period. All doses of Study Drug will be administered subcutaneously (SC) post-dialysis within 2 hours.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ End stage renal disease maintained on outpatient hemodialysis at a healthcare center for
        &gt; 3 months from screening with hemodialysis at least 3 times per week for a minimum of 9
        hours per week of prescribed treatment time and plan to continue this throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of major medical event (previous acute coronary syndrome,
             stroke or transient ischemic attack or systemic thromboembolic event) within 3 months
             of screening, major surgery within 3 months of screening, or new major physical
             examination finding except for documented atrial fibrillation

          -  Active bleeding within the past 3 months from screening or documented bleeding
             diathesis (excluding uremia), coagulopathy, or recent prolonged compression time at
             arteriovenous fistula

          -  Screening values of:

               -  Platelet count &lt; 150,000 cells/mm3

               -  &lt; 180,000 cells/mm3 for platelet function/activation subgroup

               -  INR &gt; 1.4

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated. Subjects with
             malignancies that have been treated with curative intent and which have no
             reoccurrence within 5 years may also be eligible if approved by Sponsor Medical
             Monitor.

          -  Within 6 months prior to screening, have any of the following:

               -  More than 3 episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another
                  person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative
                  actions

               -  One event of hypoglycemia in which the patient required hospitalization
