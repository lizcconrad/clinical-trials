    <description>Subjects will be stratified based on the diagnosis of documented atrial fibrillation at screening, and then subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 dose cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio (Cohort A, Cohort B and Cohort C).
Cohort A: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose #1 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort B: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose #2 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort C: Approximately 68 subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either Dose # 3 of ISIS 416858 or placebo.
Cohort A, B and C will include a 4 week screening period and a 26-week treatment period followed by a 12-week post-treatment evaluation period.
Cohort A, B and C will receive Study Drug (ISIS 416858 or placebo) once a week for the 26 week treatment period. All doses of Study Drug will be administered subcutaneously (SC) post-dialysis within 2 hours.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        • End stage renal disease maintained on outpatient hemodialysis at a healthcare center for
        &gt; 3 months from screening with hemodialysis at least 3 times per week for a minimum of 9
        hours per week of prescribed treatment time and plan to continue this throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of major medical event (previous acute coronary syndrome,
             stroke or transient ischemic attack or systemic thromboembolic event) within 3 months
             of screening, major surgery within 3 months of screening, or new major physical
             examination finding except for documented atrial fibrillation

          -  Active bleeding within the past 3 months from screening or documented bleeding
             diathesis (excluding uremia), coagulopathy, or recent prolonged compression time at
             arteriovenous fistula

          -  Screening values of:

               -  Platelet count &lt; 150,000 cells/mm3

               -  &lt; 180,000 cells/mm3 for platelet function/activation subgroup

               -  INR &gt; 1.4

               -  aPTT &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  ALT or AST &gt; 2 x ULN

          -  Malignancy within 5 years, except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been successfully treated. Subjects with
             malignancies that have been treated with curative intent and which have no
             reoccurrence within 5 years may also be eligible if approved by Sponsor Medical
             Monitor.

          -  Within 6 months prior to screening, have any of the following:

               -  More than 3 episodes of severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another
                  person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative
                  actions

               -  One event of hypoglycemia in which the patient required hospitalization

               -  Recurrent syncope and recurrent hypotension in the inter-dialytic period

          -  Concomitant use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran,
             rivaroxaban, clopidogrel) that may affect coagulation (except low dose aspirin (≤ 100
             mg/day) during Treatment and Post-treatment Evaluation Periods is not allowed. Stable
