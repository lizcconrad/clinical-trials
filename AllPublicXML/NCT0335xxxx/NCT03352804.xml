  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction : The multidrug resistance (MDR) Bacteriae are growing and are a public health
      problem. The known risk factors to be expanding of MDR Bacteriae are: taken antibiotics,
      hospitalization, journey in a country at risk. Other risk factors are emitted in hypothesis
      as the presence of pets.

      Aim : The primary objective is to study the association between the presence of a pet and the
      presence of a MDR bacteria. Methods : Cross sectional study will be performed in Reims
      University hospital in internal medicine ward.

      Introduction : The multidrug resistance (MDR) Bacteriae are growing and are a public health
      problem. The known risk factors to be expanding of MDR Bacteriae are: taken antibiotics,
      hospitalization, journey in a country at risk. Other risk factors are emitted in hypothesis
      as the presence of pets.

      Aim : The primary objective is to study the association between the presence of a pet and the
      presence of a MDR bacteria.

      Methods : Cross sectional study will be performed in Reims University hospital in internal
      medicine ward. Within the framework of the management of patients in internal medicine ward,
      all the hospitalized patients have systematically a screening of MDR Bacteriae. A
      questionnaire will be put handed to all the patients during their hospitalization as soon as
      they will be able to answer it. They will be informed about the objectives of the study. If
      the patient agrees to participate in the study, the questionnaire will be filled by every
      patient. It includes essentially closed questions and some open questions. A descriptive
      analysis will be performed. Bivariate analysis will be performed to investigate the relation
      between the presence of a pet and the presence of a MDR bacteria and clinical variables
      Multivariate logistic regression will be performed to investigate the factors independently
      related to the presence of a MDR bacteria.
