  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the feasibility of using a 3D printer to create
      tailored assistive technology rehabilitation devices. Specifically, we are investigating if a
      tailored 3D printed pillbox is safe, acceptable, and effective compared to an off-the-shelf
      generic pillbox. In this study, approximately 20 people with chronic health conditions who
      use pillboxes will describe their satisfaction and medication adherence with their current
      pillbox using a series of surveys and interviews. Then they will partake in an interview
      about their pillbox, medications, and routines. Based on the interview, the research team
      will 3D print a new pillbox tailored to the participant's preferences, abilities, and
      medication regimen. Then the participant will use the pillbox for 2-8 weeks. At the end, the
      participant will answer the same questions describing their satisfaction and medication
      adherence with the new pillbox using a series of surveys and interviews. This research will
      reveal important knowledge about the potential of 3D printing in the clinic and effectiveness
      of customized assistive technology.

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week and again at 2-8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be asked if they experienced any changes in their health or major issues using their pillbox at 1 week and at the end of the study. Also, all participants were educated to contact to the study team should they experience an adverse event.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will complete the QUEST 2.0 to describe their satisfaction with the 3D printed pillbox as compared to their satisfaction with the off the shelf pillbox. This will demonstrate the acceptability of the device.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence as measured by the ARMS will demonstrate the preliminary efficacy of the of the 3D printed assistive technology. Specifically, it will help determine if the pillbox helped participants better take their medications as prescribed.</description>

    <description>Participants in the study were pillbox users at baseline. Participants described their experiences and preferences with their own pillbox. Then participants will be given a 3D printed pillbox. Researchers will compare participants' experiences and preferences between their off-the-shelf pillbox used at baseline and the customized 3D printed pillbox delivered to participants as part of the study.</description>
