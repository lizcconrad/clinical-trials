  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fiberoptic bronchoscopy plays a very important role in the diagnosis and treatment of
      respiratory diseases in children.In China,this procedure is mainly performed under two
      different anesthesia methods：sedation and general anesthesia(GA) . Which is better ? there
      are still a lot of controversies . Several early retrospective studies suggest that, in
      addition to the possible increase in costs, general anesthesia in intraoperative
      complications, postoperative recovery and other aspects did not bring significant
      improvement. But clinically we observed that children under sedation often can not cooperate,
      they often shows anxiety,restless,crying,and so on, under these situation, some restraint
      measures may be used, which may have an impact on the child's neuropsychological development.
      Therefore ,we design this study ,aiming to compare the influence between sedation and general
      anesthesia (GA) on children 's neuropsychological development.

    <description>Using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL)for Parents.The CBCL is a widely used parent report questionnaire identifying behavioural and emotional problems in children. The CBCL is administered in interview format and respondents are asked to rate 112 problem items as 0 for &quot;not true of the child,&quot; 1 for &quot;somewhat or sometimes true of the child,&quot; and 2 for &quot;very true or often true of the child&quot;, based on the past two months. The raw scores from the 112 items are then compared with age- and gender-matched controls from the standardization sample, and standard scores are then derived with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Worst value is 80; best value is 30.</description>

    <measure>Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) Score of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Three years after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The WISC-IV is designed for children 6 years 0 months to 16 years 11 months. This study used the Full Scale IQ, which ranges from 45 to 155 with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Higher scores indicate stronger cognitive function. Scores between 90 and 110 are considered to be within the range of average IQ</description>
