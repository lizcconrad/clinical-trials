  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare changes to the tumor(s) in your breast
      before and after radiation.

      Radiation treatment is standard treatment after surgery for women with breast cancer. This
      radiation treatment is typically delivered to the larger breast area for 3-5 weeks of
      treatment, followed by 1 week of treatment (called a radiation boost) to the area where the
      tumor used to be. In this study, the radiation boost will be given before surgery rather than
      after it.

      Researchers want to learn about how radiation changes the immune system's response to the
      tumor, about side effects that develop after radiation treatment, and how radiation kills
      breast cancer cells.

      This is an investigational study. The radiation treatment will be delivered using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The timing of the radiation boost is
      considered investigational.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have an ultrasound of the breast to check
      the status of the disease.

      Leftover tumor tissue from the biopsy performed to diagnose you (called a diagnostic biopsy),
      if available, will be collected. This is collected so researchers have a baseline (control)
      sample to compare to the results of testing performed later in this study.

      Then, if there is enough tissue to biopsy, image-guided biopsies will be taken of the tumor
      in the breast. Depending on how you feel, up to 6 biopsies will be performed. To perform an
      image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using an ultrasound to
      collect cells or tissue from the tumor. The doctor will use the imaging to guide the needle
      into the area. Two (2) types of samples will be collected. A single fine needle aspirate will
      collect cells and up to 5 core biopsies will be performed to collect small pieces of tissue.

      If it is found that there is not enough tissue to biopsy, then you will not have these
      biopsies, and you will be taken off study.

      You will have blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon each time) for tests of your immune system:

        -  On the same day as your biopsies

        -  At the time of surgery, while you are in the operating room

      About 6 to 8 days before your surgery, you will receive the radiation boost. The radiation
      boost will be delivered in a similar way it would if you were to receive it after surgery.

      You will have an MRI done before surgery.

      You will then have your surgery and radiation therapy as scheduled.

      You will receive separate consent forms for the radiation therapy and surgery that explains
      the procedures and the risks.

      Information about any side effects you may be having from radiation and/or surgery will be
      collected from your medical record for up to 6 months after the end of radiation.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after your standard, 6-month follow-up visit
      after the end of radiation therapy.
