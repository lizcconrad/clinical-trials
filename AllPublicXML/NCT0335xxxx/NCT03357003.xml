  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol is a grade II analgesics as World Health Organization definition. It can both be an
      agonist on mu receptors, which provides it a low opioid action, and also be a
      Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which act on neuropathic pain.

      Tramadol is metabolized by P450 2D6 cytochrome (CYP2D6) in O-desmethyltramadol (O-dt) which
      is the most active form on the pharmacologic side (analgesic effect 2 to 4 times more
      powerful than tramadol itself).

      In caucasian population, 5 to 10% of patients are genetically qualified as &quot;poor metabolizer
      phenotype&quot;; this status is correlated to a lower analgesic efficiency compared to &quot;rapid
      metabolizer&quot;.

      A multicenter study, CYTRAM, is under publication and allowed measurement of blood ratio
      O-dT/tramadol as a way to know the phenotype of CYP2D6 to detect &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot;
      status.

      Indeed, blood ratio O-dT/tramadol threshold under 0.1 detects &quot; poor metabolizer phenotype &quot;
      status for postoperative patients treated by tramadol, with a good sensibility (87,5%) and
      specificity (83.8%).

      Which impacts for current practice? The next step is to know if this blood ratio is linked to
      an analgesic efficiency and a good tolerance for tramadol. A &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot;
      patient would have no benefit of tramadol posology increasing. Therefore, phenotype
      detection, thank to blood ratio, could allow to switch quickly tramadol to another analgesic
      treatment for &quot;poor metabolizer phenotype&quot; patients.

      The main objective of the study is to forge a link between O-dT/tramadol ratio and analgesic
      efficiency. Secondary objectives investigate side effects and frequency related to
      O-dT/tramadol ratio and pain relief, and also impact of CYP2D6 - inhibitor treatments on the
      blood ratio.

      If there is a correlation between this blood ratio and treatment efficiency and tolerance,
      O-dT/tramadol ratio's detection will allow a better adaptation for some treatments
      metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, this evolution will contribute to health quality and health
      safety improvement.
