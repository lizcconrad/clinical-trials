  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective observation is to investigate the incidence,clinical outcomes and
      prognosis of hospitalized heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in patients
      with acute myocardial infarction(AMI).

      1. Patients with first AMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in
           our hospital since January 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. The enrolled subjects
           were divided into two groups (AMI patients with HFpEF and AMI patients without HF).

        2. The investigator collected the clinical data of participants' demographics (age, sex),
           previous history,risk factors for AMI (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus,
           smoking and stroke), laboratory biomarkers, echocardiographic measurements, clinical
           characteristics,medical procedures and treatments, as well as in-hospital complications.

        3. Two sub-investigators independently analyzed these data by using SPSS software.

    <description>The differences of data(clinical characteristics, history, laboratory biomarkers, echocardiographic measurements, angiographic characteristics and clinical outcomes) in two groups were conducted. The differences between two groups were compared (clinical characteristics, history, laboratory biomarkers, echocardiographic measurements, angiographic characteristics and clinical outcomes) in two groups were compared, and then found the risk factors. Following,the incidence of clinical outcomes and mortality were compared. Then, univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for significant risk factors were performed to find out the independent predictive factors. Finally, the ROC was constructed, and the area was evaluated to assess the predicted probability of regression model.</description>
