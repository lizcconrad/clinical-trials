      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of NovoTTF-200A device in treating
      patients with newly diagnosed high risk oligodendroglioma. NovoTTF-200A device is a portable
      battery operated device which produces tumor treating (TT)Fields in the body by means of
      surface electrodes placed on the skin. TTFields are very low intensity, intermediate
      frequency electric fields that may slow the growth of tumor cells in patients with high risk
      oligodendroglioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of the TTFields treatment in patients with newly
      diagnosed high risk oligodendroglioma following standard of care treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who tolerated 75% of treatment goal at months 6,
      12, 24.

      II. To estimate the progression free survival time. III. To assess quality of life. IV. To
      assess whether or not there is a correlation between genomics and the efficacy of the
      TTFields treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 4-8 weeks after standard of care treatment, patients wear NovoTTF-200A device over
      18 hours daily (QD). Treatment continues for up to 24 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 months and then monthly
      thereafter.
