  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Action research has been developed in this direction in order to use a tool to identify food
      disorder behavior among obese youths in their neighborhoods and social centers in vulnerable
      neighborhoods of Marseille, with the aim of a multi-professional therapeutic management
      (psychosocial support, theater) and a specialized orientation.

      This program consists of the participation of each patient recruited in collective workshops.
      A total of 60 patients considered. Our hypothesis lies in the fact that for young people to
      participate in an adapted device, taking into account the global needs of young people and
      their entourage, would limit the deleterious effects of obesity and promote the young
      person's autonomy and allow him to be a actor in the request for care.

      The project's objective is to provide support in the form of workshops with patients
      identified by the Marseille Hospitals Public Assistance Health Center as obese children and
      adolescents, in a precarious situation; to identify the presence of binge eating disorders
      and evaluate the impact of participation in these workshops on subsequent management by
      highly specialized professionals in food disorder behavior.

      The mobile team (EM) of the Marseille Hospitals Public Assistance Health Center has the
      mission to inform, screen, support and guide the access to care of people in targeted
      neighborhoods, said to be vulnerable, by the city's policy of Marseille. The health space, a
      place of welcome and care, is located at a distance from any hospital structure within the
      most vulnerable neighborhoods of the city.
