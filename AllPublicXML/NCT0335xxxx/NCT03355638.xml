  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a combination of intravitreal aflibercept and pranoprofen eyedrops or
      nutraceutical support provides additional benefit over IVA monotherapy for the treatment of
      choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a prospective, randomized, pilot study in 60 patients with treatment-naïve choroidal neovascularization. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups: aflibercept monotherapy, aflibercept plus pranoprofen, or aflibercept plus nutraceutical tablets containing multivitamin antioxidant and mineral supplementation plus omega-3.</intervention_model_description>
