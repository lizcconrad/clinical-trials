  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the hemodynamic changes in the
      peripheral microcirculation system as a response to various changes, using noninvasive
      thermography and laser doppler

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a single session per subject. Microvascular and systemic variables will
      be monitored in response to a number of non-invasive interventions/device that are approved
      for clinical use and known to elicit microvascular responses. These interventions are applied
      consecutively, include breathing at different rates, low power visible light in the
      red-to-near-infrared range, increase in local temperature, and changes in the arm position.
