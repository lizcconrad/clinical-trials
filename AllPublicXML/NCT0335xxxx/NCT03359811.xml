  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effects of 4 quadrant TAP block
      (4Q-TAP block) with the standard-of-care thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in patients
      recovering from cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (CRS-HIPEC).

      A 4Q-TAP block is also known as an abdominal wall block and TEA is also known as a thoracic
      epidural. Both are types of anesthetics but are given in different ways. A 4Q-TAP block is
      when anesthetic injections are given in 4 different parts of the abdomen. A TEA is when an
      anesthetic injection is given in the space surrounding the spinal cord through your back.

      This is an investigational study. The surgery and the levels of anesthetic participant is
      receiving are standard-of-care. It is investigational to compare 4Q-TAP block with TEA.

      Up to 140 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Tests:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, within 60 days before participant's
      surgery:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 8 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will complete a questionnaire about the quality of recovery. Participant's
           responses before surgery will be compared to participant's responses after surgery. It
           should take about 5 minutes to complete.

      Study Groups/Procedures:

      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups on
      the morning of participant's surgery. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive standard-of-care TEA before
           participant goes to sleep.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive the 4Q-TAP block injections after
           participant is asleep.

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will have a catheter placed in participant's back
      before surgery so that the TEA can be infused. If needed, participant may receive an
      injection of numbing medication and/or pain medication before the catheter is placed.
      Participant will sign a separate consent for the placement of the catheter.

      If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive up to four (4) injections of 4Q-TAP
      block directly into different parts of the abdomen. These injections will take place after
      participant has been given general anesthesia. An ultrasound will be used to guide these
      injections. Participant will not be awake for these injections.

      Both groups will sign a separate consent for the surgery that explains the procedures and the
      risks. Participant may receive standard drugs during surgery. The study staff can tell
      participant about the risks of these drugs and how they are given.

      For both groups, information about the surgery will be collected while participant is in the
      operating room.

      Post-Surgery:

      After surgery, participant will receive standard drugs for pain as needed. Participant will
      be asked to complete a questionnaire about the quality of participant's recovery on the
      following days after surgery:

        -  Days 1-3

        -  Day 5

        -  Day 7

        -  Day 10 and

        -  Day 30

      The questionnaire should take about 5 minutes each time. Participant will complete the
      questionnaire in person or participant will be called on the phone to complete it if
      participant has already left the hospital.

      On Days 1, 2, and 7 after surgery, blood (about 8 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      After participant leaves the hospital, researchers will collect information from
      participant's medical record about participant's standard follow-up visits.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Active participation in this study will be complete 30 days after the surgery.

    <time_frame>48 hours after CRS-HIPEC surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Recovery measured using the QoR-15 scale. The QoR scale is a validated scoring system that allows for the quantification of a patient's early postoperative health status.
The QoR-15 consists of 15 items. All 15 items follow a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 10 (where &quot;0&quot; refers to none of the time [poor] and &quot;10&quot; refers to all of the time [excellent]). A patient's total score is the sum score across all 15 items (note: the last 5 items are reverse scored). The lowest score a patient can receive is &quot;0&quot;, and the highest score is &quot;150&quot;; where higher total scores indicate better quality of recovery. To evaluate the trial changes in QoR-15 total scores will be computed for each treatment arm. The changes will be compared between patients receiving 4Q-TAP Block and patients receiving TEA.</description>
