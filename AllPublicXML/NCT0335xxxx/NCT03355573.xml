    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Entry Visit (Visit 1) until Last Visit (up to Week 208)</time_frame>
    <description>Once it is determined that a subject experienced an Adverse Event (AE), the seriousness of the AE must be determined. An SAE must meet 1 or more of the following criteria: death, life-threatening, significant or persistent disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event, initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline of AS0008, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS40 will be calculated relative to Baseline. The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for 40% improvement are defined as relative improvements of at least 40%, and absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 domains and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.
The domains are:
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGADA)
Pain assessment (the total spinal pain, NRS score)
Function (represented by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI))
Inflammation (the mean of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI))</description>

    <description>The Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>

             Serious Adverse Event, or a history of serious infections (including hospitalizations)
             in the lead-in study, the Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to the subject's
             entry into AS0009
