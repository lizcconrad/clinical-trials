      Primary Objectives:

      To assess in overweight to obese T2DM patients:

        -  The glucagon receptor occupancy of SAR425899 at two dose levels in the human liver with
           positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging using [68Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Tuna-2 as a
           tracer compound.

        -  The GLP-1 receptor occupancy of SAR425899 at two dose levels in the human pancreas with
           PET imaging using [68Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Exendin-4 as a tracer compound.

        -  Pharmacodynamic effects on fasting plasma glucose and biomarkers of lipid metabolism.

        -  Pharmacokinetic parameters for SAR425899 after repeated subcutaneous (SC) doses in
           plasma.

        -  Safety and tolerability of SAR425899.
