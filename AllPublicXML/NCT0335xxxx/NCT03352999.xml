  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French guidelines for Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) consider Extra-Corporeal Life
      Support (ECLS) as one option in Refractory out-of hospital Cardiac Arrest (ROHCA) patients
      with a no-flow less than five minutes and absence of spontaneous circulation 30 minutes after
      initiation of advanced CPR. Duration of both pre-CPR arrest (no-flow) and of CPR (low-flow)
      have been systematically highlighted as crucial prognostic factors in all observational
      studies focused on ROHCA.

      In order to shorten the time to ECLS initiation, the most recent European Resuscitation
      Council guidelines recommend, in eligible ROHCA patients, a fast track access to ECLS
      implantation.

      CHRU Nancy elaborated an operational strategy which was designed to improve the enrolment of
      eligible ROHCA patients and to reduce the delay time between recognition and ECLS initiation.

      The objective of the present register was to assess prospectively the impact of this new
      operational strategy over a 5 years period.

    <description>ROHCA must be witnessed with onset of bystander CPR and an immediate call to Emergency Dispatch. Furthermore, to minimize any loss of time, all qualified geographical locations are directly incorporated in the regulation software of the center for medical emergency control.
Patients suitable for vaECMO implantation were identified as early as possible by the Medical Dispatcher at the Emergency Call Dispatch Center.
Bystanders pursued CPR until Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) arrival. OHCA was considered refractory after 10 min of CPR initiating the transport by MICU to the hospital such that the vaECMO intervention could be performed. The resuscitation was pursued during the transfer to hospital. An automated chest compression device was used in order to minimize interruption periods.
The intensivists and cardiac surgeons stood ready to implant the vaECMO surgically in the catheterization laboratory where a percutaneous coronary intervention was subsequently performed.</description>
