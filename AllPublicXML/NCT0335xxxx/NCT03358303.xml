  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease and has come to be recognized
      as a growing epidemic. Digital health interventions are the most recent iteration of an
      effort to promote individualized outpatient care through positive behaviour change theory.
      The UHN team has developed a highly automated and user-centered smartphone-based system,
      Medly, which allows for the telemonitoring of patients diagnosed with heart failure. The
      purpose of this study will be two-fold: 1) to determine if the introduction of Medly within
      two weeks of discharge will improve self-care management, quality of life, and clinical
      status, 2) to assess whether Medly will lead to a potential reduction in 30 day readmission
      rates amongst HF patients in the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network (TC LHIN),
      without increasing the average length of stay or visits to the emergency department. These
      parameters will be measured as secondary outcomes.

      Heart failure is the most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease and has come to be recognized
      as a growing epidemic. Digital health interventions are the most recent iteration of an
      effort to promote individualized outpatient care through positive behaviour change theory.
      The UHN team has developed a highly automated and user-centered smartphone-based system,
      Medly, which allows for the telemonitoring of patients diagnosed with heart failure

      Patients with heart failure will be provided with a smartphone and commercial home medical
      devices, such as a blood pressure monitor and weight scale. The measurements from the medical
      devices will be automatically sent to the smartphone, and from there to a data server at the
      hospital for analysis and storage. Both clinicians and patients will be able to access these
      data and will be sent alerts by the system if the measurements are outside of the normal
      range. The system will be evaluated through interviews and comparing outcomes between the
      intervention and control groups.

    <description>Medly is a smartphone application allows heart failure (HF) patients to measure and record their daily weight, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and self-reported symptoms. This monitoring information is then transmitted wirelessly to a data server where an algorithm is used to generate an alert to a healthcare provider as necessary. The patient also receives an automated self-care message based on their measurements and reported symptoms.</description>

    <description>Medly) will enable patients with HF to take clinically relevant physiological measurements with wireless home medical devices and to answer symptom questions on the smartphone. The measurements will be automatically and wirelessly transmitted to the mobile phone and then to a data server. Automated self-care instructions/messages will be sent to the patient based on the readings and reported symptoms. If there are signs of their status deteriorating, an alert will be sent to a clinician that is responsible for the particular chronic condition of concern. The clinicians will have all the relevant patient data sent to them and will be able to access (through a secure web portal) to view historical and trending data for their patients.</description>
