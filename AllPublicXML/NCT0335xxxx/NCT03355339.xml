    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of binasal occlusion (BNO) glasses on balance and eye
      movement in adults with dizziness after a concussion. Participants will stand on a force
      plate while rapidly reading a series of numbers both with and without the BNO glasses. It is
      thought that the BNO glasses will improve both balance and the time to read the numbers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While most individuals will recover within the first month after concussion, a significant
      number will continue to experience dizziness, balance problems, cognitive deficits, and
      vision problems. Single-task measures of static balance may not be sensitive enough, however,
      to capture mild postural changes still associated with incomplete recovery. Increasingly
      there is an interest in dual-task paradigms of balance assessment as a more accurate
      representation of functional postural control associated with activities of daily living and
      sport participation. Binasal occlusion (BNO) has been proposed as a means of providing visual
      stabilization to improve postural control in individuals with vision-related balance problems
      following a concussion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural sway</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of interest is the mean medial/lateral and anterior/posterior velocity of centre of pressure, in addition to the 95% ellipse during different conditions of static balance. The minimal clinical difference considered to demonstrate a change in postural sway is 5cm based on previous validation of the Balance TrackS force plate in a concussed population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to completion of the King-Devick Test (KDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The KDT is a vision-based test of rapid number naming speed that acts as a proxy measure for saccadic eye movement. The KDT consists of a demonstration card, plus a series of 3 increasingly more difficult test cards of variably spaced single digit numbers. Following completion of the demonstration card, participants are asked to read each test card from left to right, top to bottom, as quickly as possible without errors. A summary score of the test is recorded as the total time to complete all 3 test cards, measured in seconds. Time to completion for the KDT will be recorded. Any increase in time compared with a control condition, or any uncorrected errors are considered a significant change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Saccadic eye movement</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Saccadic eye movement will be assessed with a Tobii™ Pro wearable eye tracker. Tobii™ Pro wearable eye tracker uses infrared video-oculography to analyze patterns of eye movement in terms of fixations and saccades. Longer, more complicated visual tasks, such as rapid number naming, require longer processing times. The number of saccades completed during each balance condition will be recorded by the Tobii™ Pro.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-concussion symptom score (PCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCSS is a standardized and easily administered 22-item self-report symptom scale that measures the severity of each symptom experienced that day. Symptoms are reported on a 7-point Likert scale, with 0 and 6 representing anchoring points from the absence of symptoms to the presence of severe symptoms. Results are conveyed as the total symptom score and range from 0-132, with a higher score associated with a higher level of symptoms. Total scores demonstrate high internal consistency in a concussion population (α=0.93), with a 6.8 point change (80% CI) associated with a clinical change in symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is the most commonly used self-report outcome measure for neck pain. The index is a simple and quickly administered 10-item questionnaire measured on a 6-point Likert scale from 0=no disability to 5 = full disability. Scores range from 0-50, with 50 representing the highest level of disability. Clinically important difference have been reported with a 5-7 point change in score depending on whether the pain was of musculoskeletal or neural origin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>After one month post-injury. Data collection will occur in one single session per participant upon enrolment in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI is a self-report measure of disability associated with dizziness. Internal consistency is high for total scores (α = 0.89). The presence of dizziness-related disability is scored as no (0), sometimes (2), or yes (4). Scores range from 0-100, with a higher score reflecting a greater disability associated with dizziness. Cut-off scores exist for mild (16-34), moderate (36-52), and severe (54+) disability, with an 18-point change in score considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        either a direct or indirect blow to the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an
        impulsive force transmitted to the head, which may or may not have involved loss of
        consciousness, and included one or more of the following clinical domains:
