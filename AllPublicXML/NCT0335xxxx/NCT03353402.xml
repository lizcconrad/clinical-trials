      Altering the Gut Microbiota of Melanoma Patients Who Failed Immunotherapy Using Fecal
      Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) From Responding Patients.

      FMT includes both colonoscopy and stool capsules, conducted in an outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I single-center study of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in melanoma
      patients who failed all standard lines of therapy.

      Eligible patients must have a disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to
      FMT.

      Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, tumor biopsy, blood samples
      and stool studies to confirm suitability for the study.

      Eligible patients will undergo FMT in an outpatient setting. The FMT includes a colonoscopy
      followed by stool capsules.

      Patients will undergo repeated evaluations including follow-up blood, stool and radiological
      testings.

      The study will be conducted over a 24-week period.

    <description>Patients with metastatic melanoma who responded to immunotherapy will serve as the fecal implant donors. The tested fecal implant will be used for two different products. The first part of the tested stool will be mixed with a saline solution, strained and infused into your bowel using colonoscopy. The second part of the tested stool will be packed into capsules. These stool capsules are at the size of standard drug-containing capsules and can be swallowed in a standard manner. Stool capsules are a common method of FMT and has been used worldwide for several years. After the colonoscopy, you will be asked to swallow the capsules. Swallowing the capsules will be conducted at the clinic, and does not require any additional procedures.</description>
