      The study has a phase Ib and a phase II part.

        -  The phase Ib aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab in combination
           with a dose- dense EC regimen in a neoadjuvant setting for early breast cancer.

        -  The phase II aims to explore the efficacy of durvalumab in combination with a dose-dense
           EC regimen in a neoadjuvant setting for early breast cancer.
