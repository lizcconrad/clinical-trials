      The Quebec Family Study (QFS) is an observational study that was planned to investigate the
      role of genetic factors in physical fitness, body composition, risk factors for common
      disease and health-related behaviour.

    <textblock>
      The Quebec Family Study was an observational study with three cycles of data collection
      between 1978 and 1992. During the first cycle of data collection (Phase 1: 1978-1982), a
      total of 1,650 subjects from 375 families were recruited. During the second cycle (Phase 2:
      1989-1997), 385 subjects from 105 phase 1 families were retested and an additional 372
      subject from 74 families were recruited. During the third cycle (Phase 3: 1998-2002), 204
      subjects from phase 1 were tested a third time, 113 subjects from phase 2 were tested a
      second time and 194 new subjects from 44 families were recruited.

        The QFS cohort is a mixture of random sampling and ascertainment through obese individuals.
        In Phase 1 of the study, subjects were randomly selected from French-Canadian families
        living in the Quebec city area, In Phases 2 and 3 of the study, families with a least one
        obese parent and one obese offspring were recruited.
