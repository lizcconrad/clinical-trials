  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in numerical cognition usually think that the greatest and most common difficulty
      in children suffering from dyscalculia is retrieval of arithmetic facts from long-term
      memory. However, we have recently shown that retrieval might not be the optimum strategy in
      mental arithmetic. In fact, expert adults would rather solve simple problems such as 3 + 2 by
      automated and unconscious procedures. Therefore, we hypothesize that children with
      dyscalculia might not present deficit in retrieval but, instead, in counting procedure
      automatization. The aim of the current project is to test this challenging position. Through
      a longitudinal approach, we plan to precisely examine the behavior of children suffering from
      dyscalculia over a 3-year period. Children will be aged between 8 to 11 years at the
      beginning of the study and we will precisely observe the evolution of their solution times
      when they solve simple addition problems involving one-digit numbers. If children with
      dyscalculia still struggle with simple additions three years, their solution times plotted on
      the sum of the problems should still follow an exponential function. Indeed, if counting is
      not automated, difficulties necessarily increase with the progression on the number line or
      the verbal sequence, hence the exponential function. On the contrary, if counting procedures
      tend towards automatization, moves along a number line will progressively become as easy at
      the beginning of the line as at the end, hence the linear function. Importantly, a retrieval
      model would predict exactly the inverse pattern because, according to this model, the linear
      function, which is unanimously considered as the hallmark of counting procedures, should
      progressively be replaced by a non-linear function through practice.

    <description>The experiment will contain several tasks. The main one will be a computerized task on arithmetic facts where participants will have to solve simple additions. There will also be three additional tasks: a processing speed task where the participant will have to tell the orientation of an arrow as fast as possible, a visuo-spatial task where the participant will have to reproduce a tapping block sequence and an arithmetic task where the participant will try to solve a maximum of operations in a limited time.</description>
