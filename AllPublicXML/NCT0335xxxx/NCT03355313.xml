  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a clinical-social disease caused by multiple prenatal, intrauterine and
      postnatal factors as well as social, political and cultural determinants (distal causes).
      Despite the global and national reductions in the number of cases, malnutrition continues to
      be a public health problem, with greater prevalence in pockets of poverty found in the
      northern and northeastern regions of Brazil.

      Episodes of malnutrition in early childhood, with consequent calcium, phosphate and vitamin
      A, C and D deficiencies, can increase one's susceptibility to dental caries through three
      probable mechanisms: defects in tooth formation (odontogenesis), delayed tooth eruption and
      alterations in the salivary glands.

      It is likely that the significant increase in susceptibility to caries in malnourished
      individuals stems from alterations in the salivary secretion rate, since a reduction in
      salivary flow (salivary gland atrophy) increases the susceptibility to both dental caries and
      dental erosion. As saliva is the main defense factor of the oral cavity, a reduction/change
      in its physical properties (secretion rate and buffering capacity) can cause immunological
      disorders that affect an individual's defense capacity.

      Studies have demonstrated that salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) also plays an important role
      in the immunity of the oral mucosa. Indeed, patients with IgA deficiency can experience
      recurring upper airway (tonsillitis, ear infection and sinusitis), lower airway (pneumonia)
      and gastrointestinal (diarrhea and parasitosis) infections.

      The investigation of mechanisms that can reduce the impact of malnutrition on the defenses of
      the organism is of the utmost important and interest to public health. Among such mechanisms,
      low-level laser therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of diverse conditions
      and disease through the promotion of the biomodulation of the cell metabolism and due to its
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties with no mutagenic or photothermal effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser stimulation of the major salivary glands to produce more saliva occurs through the
      increase in local circulation due to vasodilatation, the induction of the proliferation of
      glandular cells and cell respiration/ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis as well as the
      release of growth factors and cytokines to stimulate protein exocytosis. With regard to an
      increase in salivary IgA, low-level laser intensifies the activation of B lymphocytes, which
      differentiate into plasma cells, thereby contributing to the increase in immunoglobulin
      levels.

      The study of salivary aspects in malnourished children and possible treatments that can be
      used to improve salivary quality and quantity in these children has significant social
      relevance, as saliva is one of the main mechanisms against infection and participates in
      essential functions of life, such as swallowing and the maintenance of oral health.

      An experimental cross-sectional study is proposed, which will be conducted at the Center for
      Educational and Nutrition Recovery in the city of Maceió, state of Alagoas, Brazil, and
      University Nove de Julho (UNINOVE) in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This project has been
      approved by CESMAC ethics committee (CAAE 71961317.1.0000.0039).

    <intervention_model_description>Nutritional status of 50 children will be measured according the World Health Organization. The volume of saliva will be measured and, also, the salivary flow rate(mL/min) and buffering capacity will be determined. Concentrations of salivary IgA in all samples will be measured using a ELISA kit. Laser will be administered for 10 seconds on four intraoral points and four extraoral points in the region of the parotid glands bilaterally as well as one intraoral point and one extraoral point in the regions of the submandibular and sublingual glands. Three sessions of laser therapy will occur (after the collection of saliva, 7 and 14 days after the first session, respectively). The final saliva collection will be performed after the third laser session. The laser will be adjusted according to the following parameters: 808nm, 4 J, Continuous and contact mode,100mW, Irradiation at target (mW/cm2)=2500,Irradiated area (cm2)=0.40.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A weighing sling (spring balance), also called the 'Salter Scale' will be used for measuring the weight of children under two years old, to the nearest 0.1 kg. Children over two years a beam balance will be used and the measurement is also to the nearest 0.1 kg.</description>

    <measure>Saliva flow rate measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary flow rates can be reduced significantly in individuals who have suffered severe malnutrition in early childhood.
Saliva parameters of children with malnutrition will be measured and compared to normal values.
Total resting saliva will be collected between 9 and 11 am (to avoid the influence of circadian rhythm) using the drainage method.
The child will be instructed to swallow prior to the collection and then instructed not to swallow, allowing the saliva to drain between the lips (which will be separated) into a test tube (aspirator) connected to a 15-mL Flacon tube positioned near the mouth.
Collection time will be five minutes. The volume of saliva will be measured and the salivary flow rate will be determined (mL/min).
Normal unstimulated salivary flux is above 0,2 ml/min. This measure was done in the samples of saliva before and after the lasertherapy for all patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Buffering Capacity of saliva</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One aliquot (1 ml) of saliva will be transferred immediately to a small tube (capacity: 5 ml) for titration with hydrochloric acid 0.005 Ne. The tube will be shaken for 15 seconds and buffering capacity will be measured using a glass electrode (Orion) coupled to a pH meter.
The reading of this test is performed based on the following parameters: pH 3.0 to 4.0 = very low to low buffering capacity; pH 4.5 to 5.0 = intermediate buffering capacity; and pH ≥ 5.5 = normal/good buffering capacity.
This measure was done in the samples of saliva before and after the lasertherapy for all patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of salivary IgA</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations of salivary IgA in all samples will be measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.
Salivary IgA (µg/ml) in each sample will be calculated using a standard curve obtained from the calibrators in the kit.
Normal saliva in children from 12 to 23 months = 2.3 ± 1.5 (mg/dl) Normal saliva in children from 24 to 71 months = 4.1 ± 2.4 (mg/dl) This measure was done in the samples of saliva before and after the lasertherapy for all patients.</description>
