  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether intake of Glycine (MSG) leads to an increase of
      cognitive performance after an acute stressor compared to placebo. One group will receive
      verum, one group placebo and one group will not receive any intervention. Cognitive testing
      will be performed in connection with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress can enhance or impair memory performances depending on the timing of the stressor and
      the timing of the memory processes in relation to the stressor. If stress occurs directly
      before or during the retrieval of information, the performance is impaired. Decreased
      performances using an acute stressor were also observed for other domains of cognitive
      functioning like working memory, interference control, cognitive flexibility and attention
      tasks.

      Glycine, the simplest of the amino acids, is an essential component of important biological
      molecules, a key substance in many metabolic reactions, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter
      in the spinal cord and brain stem, and an anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and immune
      modulating substance. Studies have found positive effects of Glycine on episodic memory
      retrieval and in a word retrieval task.

      To assess the effect of Glycine (MSG) on cognitive performance after an acute stressor,
      subjects perform baseline cognitive testing before intake of investigational products
      (Glycine (MSG), placebo or nothing) and participation in a stress test (Trier Social Stress
      Test - TSST). After the TSST stress-induced changes in cognitive performance are assessed. A
      second treatment intake takes place between the first and the remaining cognitive tests.

    <description>Do Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress (TICS) scores differ between groups? The TICS includes 57 items. Stress chronicity is measured by the frequency of stressful events perceived retrospectively within the last 3 months. Answers are given on a five-point rating scale, where 0 resembles &quot;never&quot; and 4 &quot;very often&quot;. For analysis the questionnaire items are assigned to 10 scales: Work overload (range 0-32), Social overload (0-24), Pressure to succeed (0-36), Work dissatisfaction (0-32), excessive demands at work (0-24), Lack of social recognition (0-16), Social stress (0-24), Social isolation (0-24) and Chronic worrying (0-16); the last scale presents a Screening scale for chronic stress (0-48). Scores are obtained by summing up the values of the scale specific questionnaire items.</description>

Some STAI questions relate to the absence of anxiety, and are reversely scored. For analysis of the STAI-scale, items are combined in one scale, which then informs about trait anxiety.
