  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To test the effect of LIVE-LiFE, a home-based, tailored fall prevention program for
      older adults with a high risk for falling.

      Study Type: Single-blind, two group randomized pilot trial. Randomization is 2:1 (27
      intervention, 13 control). Participants have a chance of being in the LIVE-LiFE group or the
      control group.

      Safe-LiFE Group: Individually tailored intervention at the participant's home spaced across
      12 weeks including:

        -  Home safety assessment and risk reduction strategies; incorporating strength and balance
           training into daily habits vision screening and referral; and education about fear of
           falling and falls

        -  Home repairs, modifications, and low cost assistive devices to address unsafe home
           environments increasing fall risk

        -  Medication review and feedback concerning medications with increased fall risk

      Control Group:

      • An individualized fall risk assessment provided to participant and their primary care
      provider

      Sample: 40 community-dwelling older adults in Baltimore City or County
