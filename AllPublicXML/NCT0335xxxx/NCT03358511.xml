  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if using probiotics will help the body's immune
      system react to breast cancer. New studies showed that diverse species of bacteria inside the
      bowel might help improve immune system, particularly the ability of immune system to
      recognize cancer. This study will investigate how probiotics will affect the subjects' immune
      system on breast cancer.
