  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone scintigraphy is currently a reference test in the initial staging of cancer. Bone
      scintigraphy historically consists in a planar whole-body scintigraphy (WBS). SPECT/CT has
      been shown to dramatically reduce the proportion of inconclusive results and increase the
      specificity of bone scintigraphy. Therefore, in most of nuclear m√©dicine centers, the usual
      protocol for staging of bone metastases consists in a whole-body planar acquisition followed,
      if needed, by a targeted SPECT/CT to characterize suspicious or equivocal uptakes seen on
      WBS. The aim of this study is to assess the incremental diagnostic utility of a systematic
      double-bed SPECT/CT acquisition for bone scintigraphy in initial staging of cancer patients
      compared with the conventional &quot;WBS plus single-bed targeted SPECT/CT&quot; strategy.

      Images are interpreted by two nuclear medicine physicians in a 3-step procedure and by
      consensus. Firstly,only WBS planar images are considered. Secondly, a single-bed SPECT/CT
      chosen based on planar images is used if WBS demonstrated any equivocal or suspicious uptake.

      Finally, WBS and double-bed SPECT/CT images are used for interpretation.

      A per-lesion, a per-anatomical region and a per-patient analysis is performed. At each step,
      lesions, regions and diagnostic conclusions are classified using a 3-level scale, as negative
      for malignancy, equivocal or suspicious for metastasis
