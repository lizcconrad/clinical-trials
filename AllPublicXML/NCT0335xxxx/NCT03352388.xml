  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition or its risk is common among older people, especially among those receiving home
      care services. It impairs the quality of life of the older people and results in significant
      costs to society. To maintain adequate nutrition, increased meal frequency is important. In
      addition to main meals, regular consumption of tasty, convenient, nutrient- and energy-dense
      snacks is recommended. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of dairy- and
      berry-based snack consumption on nutritional and functional status and quality of life among
      vulnerable older people at home care.

    <description>Nutritional status is assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) test which is a validated and standardized tool for detecting malnutrition and its risk in older people. Scores 24.0 - 30.0 indicate normal nutritional status, scores 17.0 - 23.5 risk of malnutrition and scores &lt; 17.0 malnutrition. Change in the MNA score is determined.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life is assessed by the 15D instrument. It is a generic, standardized instrument consisting of 15 dimensions: moving, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, elimination, usual activities, mental functioning, discomfort/symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity. Each dimension is divided into five levels by which more or less an attribute is distinguished. In this study 15D is used as single index score measure. The single index score (15D score) is calculated from the health state descriptive system through the use of an additive three-stage valuation model based on the multiattribute utility theory. The preference weights for the 15 dimensions, and their levels have been elicited from representative population samples. The 15D score is on a 0-1 scale, where 1 stands for &quot;full health&quot; and 0 being dead. Change in the 15D score is determined, and a change of ±.03 is clinically important.</description>
