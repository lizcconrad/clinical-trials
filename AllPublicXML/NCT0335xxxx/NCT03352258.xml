  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease associated with
      dementia, with a constantly increasing prevalence associated with an aging population.
      Amyloid deposition is considered the first molecular event occurring in AD: as already showed
      in an animal model, a low-dose radiotherapy (RT) course is capable of reducing AD-associated
      amyloid-Î² plaques and improve cognitive function. This pilot study wishes to investigate in
      10 patients with a diagnosis of prodromal or early probable AD and with evidence of amyloid
      pathology the effectiveness of a short course low dose RT radiotherapy to reduce amyloid
      deposits in the human brain using molecular imaging (18F-Florbetapir) to show the
      effectiveness of the treatment on the specific target.
