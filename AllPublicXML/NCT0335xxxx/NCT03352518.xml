  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral raman data paired with validated
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will collect spectral raman data on device every 15 minutes for 10 hours a day for
      five days. The five days will be distributes with in a timeframe of ten days. A Flash Glucose
      Monitor will be used as a comparator. In addition to this, four daily capillary Blood Glucose
      readings will be collected.
