  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a national, open label, multicenter, randomized split-mouth study in patients
      from 18 to 70 years of age to compare the efficacy and acceptability of lidocaine gel
      compared to injection anesthesia with articaine (infiltration anesthesia for the upper jaw
      and infiltration or nerve block anesthesia for the lower jaw). It is planned that about 90
      patients with a proven moderate periodontitis will be enrolled in 5 German study centers.

      Dynexan Mundgel® (lidocaine hydrochloride) is a topical anesthetic gel containing lidocaine
      that is commercially available as an anesthetic for temporary, symptomatic treatment of pain
      at the oral mucosa, gingiva and lips. The gold standard for scaling and root planing (SRP) is
      still the use of injection anesthesia. This raises the question what kind of anesthesia
      patients would prefer if they had a free choice.

      For this study Ultracaine® D-S 1:200,000 (articaine hydrochloride/epinephrine hydrochloride)
      was selected as the injectable comparator drug because it is the most frequently used
      anesthetic drug for infiltration and nerve-block anesthesia in Germany at present.
