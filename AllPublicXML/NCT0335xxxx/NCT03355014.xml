      This study is to compare the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the
      fixed-dose combinations of gemigliptin/metformin HCl sustained release 50/1000 mg (25/500 mg
      x 2 tablets) in comparison to each component gemigliptin 50 mg and metformin HCl extended
      release 1000 mg (500mg x 2 tablets) under fasting and fed conditions in healthy male

      This study will be conducted in separtes 2 Parts.

      Part I is designed to compare the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
      of the fixed-dose combinations of gemigliptin/metformin HCl sustained release 50/1000 mg
      (25/500 mg x 2 tablets) in comparison to each component gemigliptin 50 mg and metformin HCl
      extended release 1000 mg (500mg x 2 tablets) under fasting condition.

      Part II is designed to compare the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
      of the fixed-dose combinations of gemigliptin/metformin HCl sustained release 50/1000 mg
      (25/500 mg x 2 tablets) in comparison to each component gemigliptin 50 mg and metformin HCl
      extended release 1000 mg (500mg x 2 tablets) under fed conditions.

      In total, 70 subjects will be enrolled in this study;Part I: 40, Part II :30 subjects.

      the study design and arms are the same in both parts.
