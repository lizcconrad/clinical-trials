      Primary objective is to assess the relative bioavailability of three formulations of
      nifurtimox 30 mg tablets exhibiting different in vitro dissolution profiles (slow, medium,
      and fast, whereby &quot;medium&quot; represents the drug product currently used in clinical Phase 3
      studies) under fed conditions in adult male and female patients with Chagas' disease.

      A secondary objective of the study is to assess the relative bioavailability of nifurtimox
      after a single oral dose of 30 mg and 120 mg To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      nifurtimox To investigate the safety and tolerability of nifurtimox..

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and 12 weeks after the last administration of study drug. The definition
             of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator and on
             local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited
             to: (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii) diaphragm
             or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv) hormone-based
             contraception. Subjects must agree to utilize two reliable and acceptable methods of
             contraception simultaneously.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with confirmed last menstrual period by anamnesis and
             negative serum pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG]) at screening
             and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, such as surgically sterile women with either
             written documentation of surgical sterility or negative serum pregnancy test (βhCG) at
             screening and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.

          -  Male subjects who agree not to act as sperm donors for 12 weeks after last
             administration of study drug.

          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18 and &lt;29.9 kg/m².1.

          -  Written informed consent must be provided before any study-specific tests or
             procedures are performed.

          -  Male/female patient diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease:

          -  Previous diagnosis of acute or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to
             screening for the study. The diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by
             clinical findings, supported by antibody titers if available. If there is a known
             history of acute disease, it is preferable to have documentation of parasites on the
             blood smear, if available.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas' disease without
             active GI condition) for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, elimination, and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.

          -  Acute Chagas' disease. (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of
             the disease).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or excipients of the
             preparations)

          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes,
             decompensated heart failure, GI conditions that would interfere with the absorption of
             the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, gastroesophageal
             reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal junction), conditions that
             could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism or elimination (renal, hepatic
             such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any clinically relevant active
             infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4 weeks before the screening
             visit, e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of significant respiratory (e.g.
             interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular,
             psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, metabolic (e.g. diabetes),
             and dermatological or connective tissue disease.

          -  Use of systemic or topical medicines or substances which oppose the study objectives
             (including clinical treatment with nifurtimox and benznidazole) or which might
             influence them within 4 weeks before the first study drug administration, e.g. an
             investigational drug, any drug altering GI motility and/or gastric pH (e.g. antacids,
             anticholinergic, para-sympatholytics), any drug known to induce liver enzymes (e.g.
             dexamethasone, barbiturates, St. John's Wort [hypericum perforatum]), any drug known
             to inhibit liver enzymes (e.g. ketoconazole, macrolides).

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the ECG such as a second- or third-degree
             atrioventricular block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec or of the QT
             interval over 450 msec using Bazett's formula (QTcB). (Clinically stable subjects with
             Chagas'-related heart disease and pacemaker in place for &gt;1 year and evaluated by a
             cardiologist ≤6 months before the first dose of study drug will not be excluded.)

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;140 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a
             minimum of 3 minutes).

          -  Diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 or &gt;90 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a
             minimum of 3 minutes).

          -  Findings that would exclude the subject in the investigator's judgment, e.g. enlarged
             liver, irregular heartbeat, undiagnosed acute illness, and melanoma.

          -  Positive pregnancy test.

          -  Positive results for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV 1+2).

          -  Positive urine drug screening..
