  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irradiation of the parotid gland with subsequent long-term xerostomia is a well-recognized
      complication after radiotherapy for head and neck (HAN) cancers. A number of studies have
      shown that IMRT could minimize the radiation dose to the parotid glands and hence the risk of
      developing xerostomia. The benefit of IMRT has also been demonstrated in prior dosimetric and
      non-randomized studies in NPC patients. In 2007, the investigators have published the
      prospective randomized study of IMRT versus 2DRT in early stage NPC patients. In the study,
      IMRT had lower incidence of observer-rated severe xerostomia, higher parotid and whole saliva
      flow rate, than patients in 2DRT arm at 1 year after treatment. However, there was no
      significant difference in patient-reported outcome, i.e. subjective xerostomia scoring,
      between the 2 arms. The underlying reason for the incoherent findings in terms of objective
      and subjective xerostomia outcome remains uncertain. One of the possible explanations for
      this observation could be the better parotidsparing with IMRT alone may not entirely
      sufficient to maintain oral cavity lubrication while the other mucin-secretory salivary gland
      protection is also essential. Another possible explanation for the insignificant improvement
      in patient-reported outcome with IMRT is the short follow-up time. Gradual recovery or
      improvement in various quality of life parameters was not uncommonly seen several years after
      definitive radiotherapy for HAN cancer patients. There is much interest in studying the long
      term clinical outcome, especially the treatment-related complications, for the patients who
      had randomized and treated in the prior presented prospective study.

      In this study, the long term results, in particular the xerostomia rating will be assessed
      and compared in NPC patients who had participated in the prior reported prospective
      randomized study of IMRT vs 2DRT.
