  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics have been proposed as useful therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of
      irritable bowel syndrome patients. Bacillus clausii is a probiotic that has been used for the
      treatment of acute diarrhea among adults and pediatric patients, as well as an adjunctive
      therapy for the treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. It has been proposed that
      Bacillus clausii is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome-related symptoms
      (especially diarrhea and bloating) in non-controlled trials. The aim of the proposed
      investigation is to determine whether the administration of Bacillus clausii during two weeks
      plus dietary advice compared to antispasmodics plus dietary advice would be an effective and
      safe alternative.

    <description>Decrease of at least 50% of symptom severity score - The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale, which consists of five visual analogue scale- questions: their values range from 0 to 100, thus the total score ranges from 0 to 500. Based on previously published studies, clinical response will be defined as a decrease in at least 50% of the initial score</description>

    <description>An increase of at least 30% in the symptomatic score based on daily follow up. The score that will be used is the The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale, which consists of five visual analogue scale- questions: their values range from 0 to 100, thus the total score ranges from 0 to 500.</description>
