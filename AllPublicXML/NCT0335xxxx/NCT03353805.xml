    <textblock>
      The terrorist attack on the ram truck, which occurred on 14 July 2016 on the Promenade des
      Anglais in Nice, involved a significant number of casualties in the civilian population: 86
      dead including 10 children and adolescents, and 434 wounded. The attack harmed families
      gathered for a festive event, the national holiday fireworks, and affected both adults and
      children of all ages. The people directly involved in the attack number in the thousands:
      wounded, threatened with death, bereaved, direct witnesses, workers - including firefighters
      and health personnel (in situations of prolonged extreme tension or insecurity).

      Following the attacks in Ile-de-France in January and November 2015, Public Health France
      conducted in 2015 and 2016 two large-scale studies to estimate the psycho-traumatic impact
      for those involved in the attack, to know the use of care devices to provide useful
      information, and ultimately provide information to improve the management devices in place.
      IMPACTS carried out following the attacks of January, ESPA 13 November carried out following
      the attacks of 13 November 2015, relate to two main types of population:

        -  Non-responders (civilian population) present on or near scenes of crime or their
           relatives.

        -  Persons intervened to secure the premises or provide assistance, or provide
           psychological support the same day or within 3 weeks.

      IMPACTS was conducted face-to-face with investigators and concerned 232 participants, 45
      people of the medico-psychological relief (Samu, Cump, Hôtel Dieu) between 6 and 10 months
      after the events. A second wave of interviews took place from 16 to 20 months after the
      events.

      ESPA 13th November took place via a web-based questionnaire and 800 participants took part,
      including 67 CUMPs, 121 hospital staff and 26 people from Samu between 9 and 12 months after
      the events.

      Based on the expertise of Public Health France and the model developed for the ESPA study on
      November 13th, the Public Health Department of the University Hospital of Nice wished to
      carry out a specific study among the health professionals of the University Hospital of Nice
      and the Hospitals pediatrics of Nice CHU-Lenval, as well as students of the Faculty of
      Medicine of Nice Sophia-Antipolis.

      Many professionals of all categories were directly impacted: either at the scene of the
      attack as a civilian population or as professionals, or in the care services that received
      the victims and families (including services of the Pasteur2 hospital, Lenval Hospital on the
      Promenade des Anglais).

      The population of medical students is also included in the study, and external students in
      particular have made a significant contribution to the Institut Médico-Légal.

      This involvement could be done directly (presence as hospital staff at the scene of the
      attack, care of the victims or their relatives, in the emergency and care services), but also
      indirect (close and knowledge affected by the attack, specific repercussions in the local
      context, forced changes in the organization of work). It is therefore all hospital
      professionals, medical students (external, internal) and paramedical students who will be
      involved in the study.
