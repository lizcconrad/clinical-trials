  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy of directional DBS
      electrode technology and whether electrophysiology biomarkers can predict effective contact
      segments for chronic therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be remarkable for treating symptoms of Parkinson's
      disease, improvement varies across clinical trials, individual patients, and over time. A
      major limitation to the advancement of DBS therapy is that there are no established
      biomarkers to tailor stimulator settings in individuals. Emerging segmented (&quot;directional&quot;)
      lead technology allows current steering, a new opportunity to improve tolerability and
      efficacy by shaping the DBS electrical field. This novel lead design has 8 contacts rather
      than the 4 available with currently available leads. How do the investigators optimally
      adjust stimulation parameters when there are far more potentially useful settings than can be
      practically evaluated in clinic? How do the investigators know that DBS settings in a given
      patient are optimal or appropriate? The investigators have pioneered minimally invasive,
      rapidly acquired biomarkers to solve these important problems. Using electrocorticography,
      electroencephalography, and subcortical local field potentials, the investigators will
      measure whether resting or stimulus-evoked electrophysiology can serve as a predictive
      biomarker to guide activation and adjustment of a directional DBS system. The purpose of this
      randomized, double-blind crossover study is to measure the clinical efficacy of directional
      versus omnidirectional stimulation and to explore whether electrophysiology biomarkers can
      rapidly predict effective, well-tolerated contacts for directional DBS therapy.
