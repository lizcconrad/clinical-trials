    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory prospective study investigating if addition of a COX-2 inhibitor can
      increase efficacy of ulipristal in disrupting ovulation at peak fertility. We will compare
      the proportion of women with ovulatory disruption after taking the study medications with
      those women's own placebo cycles and also to previously established/published rates of
      ovulatory disruption of ulipristal alone.9 Given the established efficacy of ulipristal
      during the follicular time period as well as the theoretical mechanism of meloxicam to
      disrupt cumulus-oocyte expansion is a late step in ovulation, we hypothesize that this
      medication could emerge as the best candidate for an oral on-demand contraceptive option.
