      INMA - INfancia y Medio Ambiente [Environment and Childhood] Project is a research network of
      several Spanish groups that created a project with the aim to study the paper of the more
      relevant environmental pollutants in the air, water and diet during the pregnancy and
      beginning of life, and their effects in the growth and development.

      The INMA Project is based on the experience acquired by groups that studied several cohorts
      with different objectives: the cohort of Riera d'Ebre (n=102), an area with high levels of
      organochlorine compounds and mercury, evaluated the relationship between these exposures and
      the neurological development of the children; the cohort of Menorca (n=492), studied the
      relationship between the early exposure to irritating of the air and allergens with the
      development of allergy and asthma; and the cohort of Granada (n=668), that studied the
      incidence of reproductive disorders in men in relation to the exposure to endocrine
      disruptors.

      Based on the experience of these previous cohorts, other 4 new cohorts were designed to
      evaluate the impact of environmental exposures in children's health: Valencia (n=787),
      Sabadell (n=622), Asturias (n=485) and Gipuzkoa (n=612), that followed the same protocol. The
      population of the study are pregnant women of the general population who lived in each area
      of study (Ribera d' Ebre, Menorca, Granada, Valencia, Sabadell, Asturias, and Gipuzkoa and
      their children. Each cohort had different periods and types from recruitment. In the cohorts
      of Ribera d'Ebre and Granada, the mothers were recruited during the admission to the hospital
      at the moment of the childbirth. In Ribera d'Ebre, the recruitment was between March 1997 and
      December 1999, whereas in Granada it was between October 2000 and July 2002. In Menorca, all
      the eligible women who went to the prenatal visit in some of the sanitary centres of the
      island (private or public) were invited to participate in the study, and the recruitment
      lasted a year starting in July 1997. In the 4 new cohorts the recruitment took place during
      the first prenatal visit (between weeks 10 and 13 of gestation) in the public hospital of
      reference or in the health centre of the area. The periods of recruitment went from February
      2004 to June 2005 in Valencia, from July 2004 to July 2006 and May 2007 to July 2007 (there
      was an additional round of recruitment) in Sabadell, from May 2004 to June 2007 in Asturias,
      and from April 2006 to January 2008 in Gipuzkoa.

        The mothers were recruited between 1999 and 2008. The recruitment took place during the
        first prenatal visit (between weeks 10 and 13 of gestation) in the public hospital of
        reference or in the health centre of the area. The pregnant women included in the study
        were: Ribera d'Ebre (n=102), Menorca (n=492), Granada (n=668), Valencia (n=787), Sabadell
        (n=622), Asturias (n=485) and Gipuzkoa (n=612).
