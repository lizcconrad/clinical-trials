          -  Subject is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is an acceptable
             candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

          -  Subject has either:

               -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease with one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%,
                  abnormal fractional flow reserve (FFR), abnormal stress or imaging stress test,
                  or elevated biomarkers prior to the procedure

               -  OR

               -  Documented silent ischemia based on one of the following: abnormal fractional
                  flow reserve (FFR), abnormal stress or imaging stress test, or elevated
                  biomarkers prior to the procedure

          -  Subject is willing to comply with all protocol-required follow-up evaluation
             Angiographic Inclusion Criteria (visual estimate)

          -  Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated
             reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥2.5 mm and ≤4.0 mm

          -  Target lesion length must be &gt;34 mm and ≤44 mm (by visual estimate)
