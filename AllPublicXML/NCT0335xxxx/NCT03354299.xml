  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis still becomes a major issue in Indonesia. Malnutrition has been observed in
      liver cirrhosis patients as it deteriorates liver function and cirrhosis itself. Malnutrition
      in liver cirrhosis can increase morbidity and mortality rates.

      Patients with liver cirrhosis have increased energy expenditure and endogenous fat oxidation
      reaction which is used as the basic energy sources. Energy obtained from fat was accounted
      for 86% of the total energy sources in this population. Fatty acid is also known to be an
      efficient energy backup for hepatocytes and other cells because it generates higher adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) than other sources.

      Supplementary diet for patients with liver cirrhosis is considered beneficial for preventing
      hypercatabolism. To fulfill their nutritional needs, patients with liver cirrhosis is advised
      to take an extra food, such as a late night snack (LNS) with a total carbohydrate of around
      50 g (equivalent to 200 kkal). Considering that most of the energy source in patients with
      liver cirrhosis came from fat, so the additional sources of energy having a high fat content
      were considered to be potentially highly beneficial to address the patients' nutritional
      status, as well as to reduce the risk of hyperglycemia after a meal and hypoglycemia after a
      long night fasting period time.

      Coconut milk contains many saturated fatty acids belonging to the medium chain
      triacylglycerol (MCT) group. The characteristics of MCT are quite different from long chain
      triacylglycerol (LCT). MCTs are more easily absorbed than LCTs, and are mostly absorbed in
      the form of free fatty acids, in both healthy and liver cirrhosis populations.

      This study wants to investigate the effects of coconut milk supplementation on improving the
      nutritional status of patients with liver cirrhosis. The patients were divided into 2 groups,
      groups I received 25 g of sugar plus 50 cc of coconut milk (200 kkal) as late night snacks
      (LNS); and group II received 50 g of sugar alone (200 kkal) as LNS. Investigators think that
      the group who received coconut milk supplementation has better nutritional status than the
      other group.

      This study investigated the effects of coconut milk supplementation on improving the
      nutritional status of patients with liver cirrhosis. Design was randomized controlled trial.
      Investigators randomized the patients into 2 groups. Group I received 25 gram of sugar + 50
      cc coconut milk and group II received 50 gram of sugar alone. Both of groups received 200
      kkal as late night snack. Subjects were cirrhosis patients with Child Pugh A and B, who
      develop malnutrition using BMI criteria or experience unintentional weight loss. The outcome
      was nutritional parameters after 1 month supplementation.

      Estimated sample was 60 patients with 30 subjects in group I and 30 subjects in group II.
