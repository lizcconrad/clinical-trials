  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators looked at the population of hemiplegic stroke participants hospitalized
      with GHIV : the investigators assessed the postural control of the participants of the chair
      using MCPAA, and assessed the pain of the participants while sitting in a wheelchair. The
      investigators then had to the participants try positioning equipment and then prescribed it
      once the choice was made. The investigators then reassessed postural control and wheelchair
      pain with this positioning equipment.

      For each hemiplegic participants with wheelchair user stroke, the investigators collect :
      date of birth, date of stroke, side of hemiplegia. The wheelchair propulsion mode, the degree
      of autonomy (FAC and Enjalber scales), the way bed - wheelchair transfers are made.
      Assessment of wheelchair pain in the spine and Ischia with EVA. Time to travel 10 meters in a
      wheelchair. Postural control of the wheelchair is evaluated by the MCPAA. The investigators
      then carry out tests of positioning equipment : backrest, cushion, form elements and belt.
      This material is tried for several days. If it is appropriate (improvement on the postural
      control and on the pains), otherwise another material is tried.

      When the choice is made, the material is prescribed. The participant is seen again 3 months
      after the delivery of his personal material, and the same evaluation is redone.

    <description>The Adult Seated Postural Control Measure 2.0 (MCPAA 2.0) is a clinical evaluation tool for sitting postural control of adult clients using a locomotion aid. It thus allows the evaluation of the two variables inherent to the postural control sit, the alignment of body segments and the influence between movement and posture. It can also be used to evaluate the changes in seated postural control due to changes over time or to an adaptation of the sitting posture.</description>

    <description>Assessment of wheelchair pain in the spine and ischia by a self-evaluation scale (EVA). The self-evaluation scale (EVA) is used to assess participant pain.
It is in the form of a straight line of 100 mm. This scale is composed on the reverse side of a horizontal line from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;maximum pain imaginable&quot;. The left side corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot;, the right end corresponds to &quot;maximum pain imaginable&quot;. The participant indicates, with the cursor, his level of pain on the line. The pain score is displayed on the front of the scale.</description>
