  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to analyze and understand the meaning of explicit requests to
      hasten death (euthanasia and assisted suicide) from older people living in an Establishment
      of accommodation for dependent old persons.

      This involves conducting interviews with patients, carers to whom the request has been
      expressed and a relative chosen by the patient. This study aims to describe the request over
      time. This will be done through two series of interviews, one as soon as it is first
      expressed, then one week later.
