  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure (TCPO2) at exercise is, to our
      knowledge, the only method to estimate during the exercise the importance of ischemia segment
      of limb by segment of limb bilaterally and carry on. The diagnosis of thoracic outlet
      syndrome causing remains difficult and dependent operator in ultrasound because of the risk
      of false positive (loss of signal) or false negative (insufficient effort, inappropriate
      movement).

      Our main hypothesis is the existence of significant measurable ischemia in the forearm by
      transcutaneous oximetry during the maneuvering of the &quot;candlestick&quot;.

      In the event of failure of this maneuver, the other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos,
      Tinel and Adson will be realized.

      In this study we want to evaluate the possibility of using dynamic transcutaneous Oximetry as
      a tool for evaluating ischemia in case of suspicion of thoracic outlet syndrome causing.

      Patients referred for suspected thoracic outlet syndrome causing and healthy asymptomatic
      subjects will be included.

      After signing the consent, the subject will have a clinical and paraclinical examination.
      Age, sex, height, weight, side of clinical symptomatology will be collected. Medical history
      current treatments will also be noted.

      The examination of transcutaneous oximetry dynamic measurement with palmar face of both
      forearms during two consecutive maneuvers known as the &quot;candlestick&quot; (hands up). The most
      symptomatic arm value in patients and the dominant arm in the control group will be noted. In
      case of DROP between 0 and -25 mmHg, in addition to the maneuvering of the &quot;candlestick&quot;, the
      other maneuvers such as those of Wright, Roos, Tinel and Adson will be realized.

      For patients, the microcirculation measurement by the TIVI system will be performed on the
      hands during the operation of the candlestick. The results of any additional examinations and
      / or pre- and post-operative consultations will be collected.
