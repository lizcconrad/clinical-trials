  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional comparative study at the Department of Reproductive Medicine at
      Ghent University Hospital. Patients with previous embryo developmental problems are eligible
      for the study. Patients will undergo an ICSI-AOA treatment and will also be screened for
      genes important in the oocyte activation and embryonic development process. Also, the calcium
      releasing pattern of the patients' spermatozoa will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assisted Oocyte Activation (ICSI-AOA) will be the treatment for these patients to overcome
      their previous embryo developmental problems. This protocol artificially induces calcium
      rises in the oocyte, which mimics the natural oocyte activation process induced by the sperm
      factor PLCzeta. If 6 or more mature oocytes are collected at oocyte retrieval, 50%ICSI and
      50% ICSI-AOA will be applied. If less than 6 mature oocytes are collected, ICSI-AOA will be
      applied to all oocytes. Regardless of the treatment group (ICSI or ICSI-AOA), the best
      embryo(s) will be transferred back. Rest embryo(s) will be vitrified for future cycles.
      Patients will be followed up.

      Furthermore, an additional sperm sample will be produced to investigate the calcium inducing
      pattern of the patients' spermatozoa. Thereby, mouse and/or human (research-donated control
      oocytes) will be pre-incubated with a Ca2+ sensitive dye. Next, human spermatozoa will be
      injected into these mouse/human oocytes and the calcium pattern will be recorded under an
      inverted epifluorescence microscope.

      Both partners will give a saliva sample to screen for mutations in the PLCzeta gene (male),
      the DUX4 gene (male and female) and possible other genes which are involved in and necessary
      in the early steps of oocyte activation and embryo development (such as DUX4 gene, PADI6
      gene,...).

    <description>Clinical setting: Patients will undergo 100% ICSI-AOA if less than 6 mature oocytes are collected upon oocyte retrieval. If 6 or more mature oocytes are retrieved, 50%ICSI and 50%ICSI-AOA will be applied.
Furthermore, patients will give a saliva sample to do genetic screening. Genes important during oocyte activation and embryo development will be investigated.
Also, calcium pattern analysis of the patients' spermatozoa will be executed.</description>

    <description>Male patients will donate a sperm sample. Calcium pattern analysis will take place by injecting the patients' sperm into mouse and/or human (in vitro matured) oocytes (research-donated control oocytes). This will estimate the sperm capability to induce calcium oscillations in the oocyte.</description>
