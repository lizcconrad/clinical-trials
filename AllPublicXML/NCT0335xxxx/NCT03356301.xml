  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular sustained physical activity creates a cardiac remodelling : it is athlete's heart. In
      our preliminary work published in 2016, the investigators demonstrated in a small population
      of triathletes that there is also a vascular remodelling named athlete's artery. Moreover,
      the investigators know that left ventricle and aorta behave together like a couple. So they
      want to study by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging the impact of triathlon on the
      cardiac AND aortic remodelling.

    <description>Every triathlete will realize three cardiac MRI exams.The second of those will be done at the fitness peak, 2-3 weeks before the main objective of the sports season. Training will be increased between the study beginning and the first MRI, and the second exam. After each cardiac MRI, an applanation tonometry examination will aslo be performed.</description>

After each cardiac MRI, an applanation tonometry examination will aslo be performed.</description>
