  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients between 6months and 6years old will be included. They are scheduled for
      elective general or urologic surgery at a single thetiary medical center. Before the
      operation, the researcher interviews the parents of the pediatric patients to check whether
      they have the upper respiratory tract infection and asks them to fill out a questionnaire
      about the severity of their symptoms. The researcher will get the symptom score of the upper
      respiratory tract infection in the questionnaire. The degree of anesthesia indeced
      atelectasis is measured using lung ultrasound. Pulmonary ultrasound is performed after
      endotracheal intubation and at the end of the operation dividing the patient's thorax into 12
      regions. The investigator grades the degree of atelecatisis at each region form 0 to 3
      points. After the end of the operation, check whether the respiratory adverse effects
      occurred during emergence and recovery at the post anesthesia care unit.

    <measure>The degree of atelectasis due to general anesthesia using lung ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigator will measure the degree of atelectasis using lung ultrasound at 2 minutes after endotracheal intubation and at 5minutes the end of the operation.</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesia induced atelectasis is diagnosed when the ultrasound findings as B-line (appears hyperechoic lines perpendicular to the pleura) and consolidation(loss of pleural line and hypoechoic area) are identified. The chest is divided into 12 regions: three longitudinal lines (parasternal, anterior, and posterior axillary) and two axial lines (above the diaphragm, and 1cm above the nipples) in each hemithorax. The investigator grades the degree of atelecatisis at each region form 0 to 3 points. The degree of juxtapleural consolidation was graded: (a0) no consolidation; (a1) minimal juxtapleural consolidation; (a2) small-sized consolidation(&lt;50%); and (a3) large-sized consolidation(&gt;50%). The degree of B-lines was divided into four grades: (b0) fewer than three isolated B-lines; (b1) multiple well-deÔ¨Åned B-lines; (b2) multiple coalescent B-lines; and (b3) white lung.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of respiratory adverse effects after the operation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes after extubation at the post anesthesia care unit</time_frame>
    <description>After the end of the operation, check whether the respiratory adverse effects occurred when the patient is extubated and 10, 30 minutes after extubation at the post anesthesia care unit. Respiratory adverse effects are bronchospasm and larnyngospasm. We analyze the symptom score of upper respiratory tract infection in pediatric patients who showed respiratiory adverse events and suggest the cut off value of the score with high risk of respiratory adverse events by multivariate logistic regression.</description>
