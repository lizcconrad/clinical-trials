  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, the Third International Consensus proposed a new strategy to screen aggravating risk
      in patients with septic shock. This strategy is based on quick-SOFA and the SOFA score. The
      main objective is to compare the prognostic performance of SEPSIS 3 against the previous
      strategy SEPSIS 2 to predict the admission in intensive care unit or the intra-hospital
      death.
