  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than ninety percent of adults in Taiwan are suspected to carry periodontal disease,
      which causes bad breath, swollen and bleeding gums, plaque and even tooth loss. Half of the
      patients, however, are ignorance these clinical syndromes because of no obvious pain. A lot
      of researches show that periodontal disease is related to diabetes mellitus. Periodontal
      disease causes rise of blood sugar, and more than 3 times as diabetes mellitus patients as
      healthy people have serious periodontal disease.In this study, the investigators collect
      periodontal pocket and saliva samples of participants, and selecting six periodontal
      disease-associated bacteria strains, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Fusobacterium
      nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Treponema denticola (Td),
      Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Tannerella forsythia (Tf) as diagnostic markers. Participants
      will get bacteriostasis mouthwash at mouth 2. The investigators will compare the differences
      of blood biochemistry value and oral bacteria strains after using the mouthwash.Using
      real-time PCR and MALDI Biotyper, the investigators will establish the database of oral
      microorganisms in diabetes mellitus patients, providing periodontal disease clinical markers
      of high-risk groups and the basis for personal medicine of therapy in the future.
