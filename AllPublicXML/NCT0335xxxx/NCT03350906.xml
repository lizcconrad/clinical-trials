  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to understand how chronic inflammation affects muscle function and
      responses to exercise.They are also trying to determine if suppressing chronic inflammation
      using omega-3 fatty acids (n3-PUFA) restores skeletal muscle function and exercise
      responsiveness in older adults.

      Participants will be divided into two groups. Men and women between the ages of 20-35 years
      and 65-85 years. Participants in the older age group will be randomly assigned to receive
      groups (n3-PUFA or placebo (soybean oil)) in a double-blind manner. Before and after the
      intervention, all participants will complete an outpatient study day (body composition, blood
      draw, treadmill test, strength test) and an inpatient study day (muscle biopsies, fat
      biopsies, indirect calorimetry, exercise test, mixed meal test). During the intervention
      phase of the study, participants will be instructed to swallow 2 softgels twice per day with
      meals (morning and evening) for a total of 4 softgels per day. Every 4 weeks, participants
      will report to the Clinical Research and Trials Unit (CRTU) to pick up a new prescription and
      return any remaining capsules from the previous prescription. On the day they pick up
      prescription refills, participants will report to the CRTU for a fasting blood sample. The
      duration of the intervention will be 6 months.

    <measure>Change in Interleukin-6 (IL-6)</measure>

    <description>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be used to help evaluate a person who has a condition associated with inflammation, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or with infection, such as sepsis. It may also be used in the evaluation of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. IL-6 is a cytokine, a protein produced by immune cells that acts on other cells to help regulate and/or promote an immune response. It also stimulates the production of acute phase reactants, proteins that increase in the blood with conditions that cause inflammation or tissue injury. Circulating IL-6 can be found in the blood of normal individuals in the 1 pg/mL range, with slight elevations during the menstrual cycle, modest elevations in certain cancers (melanoma) (10 pg/mL), and large elevations after surgery (30-430 pg/mL).Units: ng/ml</description>

    <description>Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha is a cell signaling protein (cytokine) involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. TNF is important to the body because it helps regulate the response of the immune system to a foreign object, especially to the present cancerous tumor. It promotes inflammation, produces other cells used in the inflammatory response, and can help cells heal. The normal range is 5 to 27.2 pg/ml.Units: pg/ml</description>
