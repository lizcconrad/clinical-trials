  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TAK-831 is superior to placebo in improving
      the average percentage of conditioned responses during the eyeblink conditioning (EBC) test.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      people with schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment sequences which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 500 mg followed by matching placebo

        -  Matching placebo followed by TAK-831 50 mg

      The first 16 participants will receive TAK-831 500 mg during the treatment period in which
      they are assigned to TAK-831. Following an interim analysis, there will be a study-wide
      decision about whether to treat the additional 16 participants with TAK-831 500 mg during the
      active treatment period to or treat them with TAK-831 50 mg during this period. After the
      interim analysis, the participant and study doctor will not be aware of which TAK-831 dose is
      being used.

      This single center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 81 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.
      Each treatment will be administered for a period of 8 consecutive days, separated by a 14 to
      21-day washout. After the second treatment period, a final follow-up safety assessment visit
      will be conducted approximately 10 to 14 days after the last administration of study drug.

    <measure>Average Percentage of Conditioned Responses During the Eye Blink Conditioning (EBC) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>EBC is a method used to investigate cerebellar function. In EBC, a conditioned stimulus (CS), a tone precedes but co-terminates with an unconditioned stimulus (US), an airpuff to the eyelid. Learning is demonstrated when an eyeblink (the conditioned response [CR]) occurs prior to the onset of the US. The percentage can range from 0% (no conditioned learning has occurred) to 100% (all responses are conditioned).</description>

    <measure>Mean Computed Probability that the Pattern of Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) Blood Oxygen Level-dependent (BOLD) Activation During the Task Set Switching (TSS) Paradigm came from a Participant Receiving add-on TAK-831 Treatment at that Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>TSS Paradigm will assess the effect of TAK-831 on brain function during the performance of an executive function task, which is known to be impaired in schizophrenia. Participants with schizophrenia have lower activity in multiple brain regions and a higher rate of error compared to controls in a task such as TSS which requires shifting of attention to a new but previously irrelevant stimulus, and in some versions reconfiguring responses to the stimuli. It will be performed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</description>

    <measure>Mean fMRI BOLD Signal in the Ventral Striatum During the Anticipation Period of Reward Trials versus the Anticipation Period of the Neutral Trials of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The MID task is a reward anticipation paradigm that robustly engage the ventral striatum, a key area associated with coding incentive reward. Dysfunctional processing of reward information is associated with motivational impairments in schizophrenia. Motivational impairment is a key aspect of negative symptoms, and has been associated with reduced activity in the ventral striatum. In the MID task, participants are instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a light-flash on display screen. The flash is preceded by an icon that informed participants about consequences of their response. Two conditions are included in paradigm, as follows: 1) Win condition: The participant will win a financial reward if response is sufficiently fast. 2) Passive control condition: No response is required.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Mismatch negativity (MMN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>MMN is an event related potential (ERP) evoked in response to unattended changes in background stimulation. MMN reflects an automatic process of detecting a mismatch between a deviant stimulus and a sensory-memory trace. Smaller amplitudes of MMN have been consistently identified in schizophrenia participants. MMN amplitude will be measured at Midline frontal electrode (Fz) of electroencephalogram [EEG].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean P300 Amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The P300 wave is an ERP component that is elicited by the presentation of a novel, behaviorally relevant target stimulus embedded among irrelevant stimuli in a manner similar to MMN, but requiring active listening and responding from participants. Auditory stimuli are presented in an oddball paradigm consisting of 1 standard tone and 1 target tone. Participants are instructed to push a button as quickly as possible when they hear the target tone, but not when they hear the standard tone. P300 reflects allocation of attention and activation of immediate memory. P300 amplitude indexes brain actions when the mental representation of the stimulus environment is updated, while P300 latency indexes stimulus classification speed unrelated to response selection processes. P300 amplitude will be measured at midline parietal electrode (Pz) of EEG.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR) to 40 Hz stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>ASSR are evoked oscillatory responses that are entrained to the frequency and phase of temporally modulated stimuli. Individuals with schizophrenia experience subjective sensory anomalies and objective deficits on assessment of sensory function. These deficits can be produced by abnormal signaling in the sensory pathways and sensory cortex or by later-stage disturbances in the cognitive processing of such inputs. ASSR can be used to assess the integrity of sensory pathways including cortical processing. ASSR will be measured at midline central electrode (Cz) of EEG.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cerebellar blood flow (CBF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>ASL evaluates effects of drug on blood flow to cerebellar grey matter. CBF will be measured using arterial spin labelling (ASL) in cerebellar grey matter. ASL perfusion is a functional MRI technique which allows quantification of tissue blood flow without the use of an exogenous contrast agent. ASL is performed while a subject is lying quietly in the scanner in the absence of any activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Cognitive Battery Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8: For each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The neurocognitive test battery includes Continuous Performance Testing, Visual Memory Testing, Verbal Memory Testing, Symbol-Digit Decoding Testing, Shifting Attention Testing, Stroop Test, and Finger Tapping Test. These tests measure how well one perform in five major domains- Memory, Psychomotor Speed, Reaction Time, Complex Attention and Cognitive Flexibility. The primary measure from each cognitive battery test is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1. A composite score is calculated by averaging all 6 standardized primary measures from the cognitive battery, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. The composite z-score indicates how much higher or lower the participant's cognition is compared to a healthy person.</description>
