  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coffee drinking is frequently reported as a negative outcome in studies on burnout, but the
      effect of an increased coffee intake on resident burnout has not been reported in the
      literature. This study is a prospective, interventional cohort study enrolling up to 50
      residents from the Internal Medicine Residency Program to look at the relationship between
      coffee and resident burnout.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resident burnout is increasingly being recognized as detrimental to both physician well being
      and patient care. It has been linked to an increased rate of medical errors and a reduced
      quality of patient care. In addition, there have been multiple high-profile physician
      suicides in the past years. This has resulted in a renewed focus on physician mental health
      and workload.
