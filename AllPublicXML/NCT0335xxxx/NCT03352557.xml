      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with mild AD. To evaluate the efficacy of
      multiple doses of BIIB092 in slowing cognitive and functional impairment in participants with
      MCI due to AD or with mild AD. To evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB092 after multiple doses
      in participants with MCI due to AD or with mild AD.

    <description>AEs: any sign, symptom, or diagnosis/disease that is unfavorable or unintended, that is new, or if pre-existing, worsens in participants administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAEs: an event that results in death; an event that, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); an outcome that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a participant; an event that requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization; an event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

    <description>The CDR-SB is a validated clinical assessment of global function in patients with AD. Impairment is scored in each of 6 cognitive categories on a scale in which none = 0, questionable = 0.5, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or &quot;box scores&quot;, can be added together to give the CDR-SB which ranges from 0 to 18 (severe impairment).</description>

          -  Objective evidence of cognitive impairment at Screening

          -  Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) global score of 0.5 for MCI due to AD or 0.5 or 1
             for mild AD

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 22 to 30 (inclusive)

          -  CDR Memory Box score of â‰¥0.5

          -  Must consent to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping

          -  Must have 1 informant/study partner

          -  Must have amyloid beta positivity confirmed at Screening

          -  Any medical or neurological/neurodegenerative condition (other than AD) that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, might be a contributing cause to the participant's
             cognitive impairment or could lead to discontinuation, lack of compliance,
             interference with study assessments, or safety concerns

          -  Clinically significant, unstable psychiatric illness

          -  Have had a stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or unexplained loss of
             consciousness in the past 1 year

          -  Relevant brain hemorrhage, bleeding disorder and cerebrovascular abnormalities

          -  History of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure or clinically
             significant conduction abnormalities within 1 year prior to Screening Visit 1

          -  Indication of impaired renal or liver function

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse in past 1 year

          -  Clinically significant systemic illness or serious infection within 30 days prior to
             or during the screening period

          -  Use of allowed medications for chronic conditions at doses that have not been stable
             for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening Visit 1, or use of AD medications at doses
             that have not been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Use of any medications that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may contribute to
             cognitive impairment, put the participants at higher risk for adverse events (AEs), or
             impair the participant's ability to perform cognitive testing or complete study
             procedures.

          -  Contraindications to study procedures
