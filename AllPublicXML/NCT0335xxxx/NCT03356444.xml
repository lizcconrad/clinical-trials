  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic castration-resistant Prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a very late stage of prostate
      cancer with poor prognosis. Although there are several treatment strategies available for
      mCRPC, these drugs are not always effective for every patient. Also, it's still not clear
      what's the best therapeutic choice for a certain group of patients.

      In the previous works of the investigators, a subtype of prostate cancer, intraductal
      carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) was studied. The investigators have reported in their two
      published papers that, IDC-P is an adverse pathological type associated with rapid disease
      progression. They also found in another study that, for patients with IDC-P, Abiraterone
      seemed to have better treatment efficacy than Docetaxel-based chemotherapy as first-line
      treatment for mCRPC, in terms of either PSA-response and PSA-progression free survival. So,
      in this study, the investigators hope to design a prospective study to verify the predictive
      ability of IDC-P in the first-line treatment of mCRPC.

      With disease progression, the drug resistance will inevitably occur in all patients after the
      treatment of CRPC. However, the exact mechanism of this process is not yet known. So, in this
      study the investigators are also trying to explore some of the genes related to the treatment
      efficacy by means of the next generation sequencing.
