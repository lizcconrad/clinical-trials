  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy refers to inflammation of the heart muscle (the
      myocardium). Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that may involve the heart,
      causing inflammation, and potentially resulting in complications including arrhythmia and
      sudden death. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic
      significance of simultaneous combined 18F-FDG PET and cardiac MRI imaging in the evaluation
      of inflammatory cardiomyopathies including cardiac sarcoidosis. Combined PET/MRI imaging may
      allow for detection and quantification of active myocardial inflammation as well as chronic
      fibrosis and scarring. Results of this study may allow for earlier detection of cardiac
      inflammation when compared with methods in current clinical use, and may lead to better
      understanding of the disease processes contributing to adverse outcomes. Elucidation of
      imaging findings associated with future adverse event risk may impact patient management such
      as providing an indication for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, or escalation of
      medical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocarditis or inflammatory cardiomyopathy refers to inflammation of the myocardium.
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology, which can result in
      myocardial inflammation. Approximately 5% of patients with sarcoidosis have clinically
      apparent cardiac involvement, yet autopsy series indicate that cardiac involvement is present
      in up to 25% of cases. This discrepancy suggests that cardiac sarcoidosis may be
      under-diagnosed in clinical practice. Recent studies have demonstrated high diagnostic
      accuracy of both cardiac MRI and 18F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET for detection
      of cardiac involvement. However, cardiac MRI may fail to identify areas of active
      inflammation even with fluid sensitive T2-weighted sequences.

      Fasting 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to identify early cardiac
      sarcoidosis with relatively high sensitivity. To date, simultaneous PET/MRI evaluation of
      cardiac inflammation and sarcoidosis has only been described in limited case reports. The
      objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the utility of simultaneous PET/MRI imaging
      in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and other inflammatory cardiomyopathies.
