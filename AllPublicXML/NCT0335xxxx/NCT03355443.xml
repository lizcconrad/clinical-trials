    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is

      - to explore the usefulness of re-examination and retroflexion on adenoma miss rate (AMR) in
      the proximal colon.

      Other aims include to explore the data below when re-examination or retroflexion is used.

        -  Adenoma detection rate, ADR

        -  Polyp miss rate, PMR

        -  Polyp detection rate, PDR

        -  Withdrawal time, WT

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMR = number of adenomas missing during the first examination/ total number of adenomas in
      both examinations = number of adenomas detected only in the second examination/(number of
      adenomas detected during the first examination + number of adenomas detected only in the
      second examination)

    <description>Routine intubation is performed. After cecal intubation, the cecum and ascending colon is examined with colonoscope tip in forward direction for the first time. Re-intubation is performed after the first examination of the cecum and ascending colon, and then this region of the large bowel is re-examined in the same fashion. After that, the rest of the colon is examined in routine method.</description>
