  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers for men in the U.S. There are some new ways
      to take pictures of the cancer. There are also new ways to use image-guided biopsy and
      therapy. These could help manage prostate cancer. Researchers want to study how imaging can
      provide a profile of prostate cancer. They want to collect data to make diagnosis and
      treatments better.

      Objectives:

      To gather data about the radiological and clinical course of prostate cancer. To study
      imaging-based biomarkers of prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 and older with diagnosed or suspected prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will give permission for researchers to use their medical history and records.
      Their data will be reviewed, collected, and analyzed. These include results of their tests
      and scans.

      Background:

        -  Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become an established method for localizing clinically
           significant prostate cancer, and identification of imaging-based prognostic markers
           represents an active research area.

        -  Multiple treatments are available for patients with localized prostate cancer, including
           radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and focal ablation;
           however, therapy-specific indication and imaging-based response biomarkers are poorly
           understood.

        -  As mpMRI is considered a standard of care , there is no patient consent for research
           related to imaging biomarkers and their correlation with other clinical and pathologic
           features.

        -  Translation of imaging, clinical, and pathological-based features into treatment
           decisions has yet to be fully characterized for development of a decision-support
           system.

        -  Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to enable the collection of data to enable
           research in the development of computer aided diagnosis, decision support and deep
           learning/artificial intelligence research.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate radiological profiling of patients with prostate cancer in support of the
      Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) for identification of imaging-based prognostic markers in
      prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with a diagnosis of prostatic cancer or suspicious for prostatic cancer
           lesions.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

      - Imaging evaluation and clinical profiling of patients with or suspected of prostate cancer
      obtained during visits to NCI and long-term follow up will be collected and analyzed.
