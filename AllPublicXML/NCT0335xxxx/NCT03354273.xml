    <description>Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection. All subjects will receive 2 IV boluses of Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection in a large peripheral vein: 1 at rest and 1 during stress. The dosages of Flurpiridaz (18F) Injection administered at rest and during stress conditions will not exceed a total of 14 mCi (520 MBq) for an individual subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a man or woman ≥18 years of age.

          -  The subject has read, signed, and dated an informed consent form (ICF) prior to any
             study procedures being performed.

          -  At the time of enrolment, the subject has been scheduled via written documentation to
             undergo an ICA for the assessment of CAD.

          -  The subject has undergone a clinically indicated SPECT OR the patient is willing to
             undergo SPECT MPI for the purposes of the clinical study.

          -  The subject is male or is a nonpregnant, nonlactating female who is either surgically
             sterile or is post-menopausal.

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with all study procedures as described in
             the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are pregnant, may possibly be pregnant, or wish (including their
             partners) to become pregnant during the study period, or are lactating.

          -  Patients who are unable to undergo all of the imaging procedures.

          -  Patients who have an established diagnosis of CAD as confirmed by any of the
             following:

               1. Previous myocardial infarction (MI);

               2. Previous cardiac catheter angiography showing ≥50% stenosis;

               3. Previous coronary revascularisation, such as percutaneous coronary intervention
                  (PCI), thrombolysis or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) placement.

          -  Patients incapable of undergoing either exercise or pharmacological cardiac stress
             testing.

          -  Patients who have a current illness or pathology that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would pose a significant safety risk for the patient during cardiac
             stress testing.

          -  Documented history of heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy and/or prior LV ejection
             fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%).

          -  Patients scheduled for or planning to undergo any cardiac interventional procedures
             between enrolment and ICA.

          -  Patients undergoing evaluation for heart transplantation or with history of heart
             transplantation.

          -  Patients enrolled in another clinical study within the 30 days prior to being enrolled
             in this study or scheduled to participate in another clinical study during the 7-day
             follow-up period of this study.
