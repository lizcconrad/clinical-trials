  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is one of the unpleasant symptoms after general anesthesia. The
      patient can be irritable, uncooperate, cry, moan and combative behaviors. Sometimes the
      patient may need to be thrashed to prevent physical harm. The mechanism of EA is still
      unknown. EA is usually self limiting within 45 to 60 minutes after wake up from anesthesia.
      The incidence of EA is much higher in pediatric group when compared with adult. In some
      centre the incidence of EA can be up to 67 % depends on anesthesia technique, race, and
      child's temperament. Kain et al, reported that the patient who had marked EA tended to have
      post operative maladaptive behaviors. These maladaptive behaviors such as insomnia, eating
      disturbance, aggressive behavior and even developmental regression can be happen until one
      year after anesthesia.

      From the previous study, reported that fast emergence was associated with a high incidence of
      agitation.

      This prospective observation study is conducted to determine that emergence time has any
      effect on EA or not. The authors use process electroencephalogram (entropy) to monitor
      emergence time which defined as the time which state entropy level over sixty to eighty.
      Meanwhile, we will evaluate the emergence time by the conventional method which used the time
      from ceasing anesthesia to the time of eye opening by normal voice stimuli.

      The primary outcome of this study is the correlation between emergence time (both from
      Process EEG and clinical presentation) and incidence of emergence agitation. Two secondary
      outcomes will be measured. Firstly, the correlation between emergence time and postoperative
      behavioral changes. Secondly, the relationship between entropy monitoring and clinical
      symptoms.
