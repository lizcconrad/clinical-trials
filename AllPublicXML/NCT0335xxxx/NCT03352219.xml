  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have considerably higher rates of HIV infections than do White, Hispanic,
      Asian, and Native Americans. African Americans accounted for 59% of all diagnoses of HIV
      infection among youth (13-24 years of age) in the United States. Young African Americans also
      have disproportionately high rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
      Therefore, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify interventions to
      reduce the risk of HIV and other STIs among young African Americans. Entertainment-education
      refers to narrative interventions designed to change behavior while providing entertainment.
      Several studies have evaluated the impact of media content on HIV risk behavior. One study
      found that exposure to an entertainment-education based HIV testing campaign was associated
      with increases in HIV testing among sexually active teens 12 months post exposure. Similarly,
      a radio soap opera called &quot;Twende na Wakati&quot; became the most popular television show in
      Tanzania and was highly successful in reducing the number of sexual partners and increasing
      condom use. A narrative video intervention study in STI clinic waiting rooms in three U.S.
      cities found a significant reduction in STI re-infection among patients visiting during
      months when the video was shown compared with patients visiting during months when it was not
      shown. Although these studies show that entertainment-education can be a promising medium for
      behavior change, none of them evaluated the efficacy of a tailored online
      entertainment-education intervention specifically designed for African American youth. To
      address this gap in the literature, this study tested the preliminary efficacy of an
      innovative, theory-based HIV risk-reduction serial drama intervention, Reality Check,
      specifically tailored to young African Americans. We used a randomized controlled trial,
      allocating African Americans 18 to 24 years of age to Reality Check, or an attention-control
      intervention promoting physical activity. Each intervention was delivered as a series of
      videos streamed online and accessible via any Internet-capable device. Participants completed
      surveys online at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 3 months post intervention. We
      hypothesized that, Reality Check would reduce condomless sex during the 3-month
      post-intervention period compared with the attention-matched control group, adjusting for
      baseline of the criterion.

      found that exposure to an entertainment-education based HIV testing campaign was associated
      with increases in HIV testing among sexually active teens 12 months post exposure. Sabido and
      colleagues used &quot;telenovelas&quot; in Mexico to increase participation in a national literacy
      campaign and promote birth control use. Similarly, a radio soap opera called &quot;Twende na
      Wakati&quot; became the most popular television show in Tanzania and was highly successful in
      reducing the number of sexual partners and increasing condom use. A narrative video

      intervention, Reality Check, specifically tailored to young African Americans and aimed at
      decreasing the frequency of condomless sex and promoting HIV testing among young adult
      African Americans. We used a randomized controlled trial, allocating African Americans 18 to
      24 years of age to Reality Check, or an attention-control intervention promoting physical
      activity. Each intervention was delivered as a series of videos streamed online and
      accessible via any Internet-capable device (e.g., smartphone, laptop or tablet). This mode of
      delivery was well suited to young African Americans because high percentages of young African
      Americans own and use Internet enabled mobile phones as their primary way to consume online
      content. We recruited participants through Facebook and Instagram, flyers posted on college
      campuses, college mailing lists, and referrals from participants. Participants completed
      surveys online at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 3 months post intervention. We
      hypothesized that, Reality Check would reduce the frequency of condomless sex during the
      3-month post-intervention period compared with the attention-matched control group, adjusting
      for baseline of the criterion.

    <description>Received streamed 13-episode HIV risk reduction serial drama, Reality Check, developed based on Social Cognitive Theory integrated with findings from focus groups and community advisory boards. Each character has a behavioral trajectory related to HIV. For example, one character modeled negotiating condom use with his partner when she was against it. Messages in the serial drama showed that the characters had normative support for HIV testing and condom use. One character modeled a mastery experience when she overcame her fear and got tested for HIV. Homophobia is addressed when a mother discovers that her son is gay. Over the course of the episodes, the interweaving storylines play out, with all the characters eventually achieving their positive goals.</description>

    <description>Received streamed physical activity promotion videos designed to control for Hawthorne effects, including special attention, consisting of a series of 13 videos from YouTube on physical activity and exercise. The videos, selected to be appropriate for African Americans 18 to 24 years of age, were tailored to be gender specific and hence varied between men and women. The videos focused on the importance of physical activity, coping strategies for lack of motivation to engage in physical activity, and other challenges faced in becoming more physically active, provided specific knowledge and skills regarding how to engage in aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercises, and model aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercises in a variety of settings.</description>
