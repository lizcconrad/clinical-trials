  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a low dose of ATRA will improve
      laboratory tests of liver and bile duct inflammation in patients with PSC. The investigators
      will also look for changes to other blood tests which are related to inflammation, scarring,
      and the immune system.
