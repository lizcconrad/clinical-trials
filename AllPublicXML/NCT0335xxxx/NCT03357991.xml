      This study evaluates the positive and negative predictive value of E6/E7 mRNA expression for
      anal HSIL and its capacity to predict incident HSIL in HIV + MSM. We also analyse the
      cost-effectiveness of this new screening strategy. It is an ambispective study with 355
      participants and a follow-up period of 2 to 5 years.

      Introduction: Anal cancer incidence is increasing in HIV-infected men who have sex with men
      (MSM). There are still no standardized criteria for anal cancer screening. Anal cytology has
      not shown enough sensitivity and specificity in the selection of patients who need more
      invasive procedures, as high resolution anoscopy (HRA). Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7
      oncogenes deregulation is a crucial factor in neoplasic lesions progression.

      Objectives: 1)To assess the negative and positive predictive value of E6/E7 mRNA expression
      for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and its capacity to predict the
      incidence of new HSIL during the follow-up 2)To analyze the cost-effectiveness of E6/E7 as a
      new screening strategy for anal cancer compared with usual strategies (cytology and DNA
      detection).

      Methodology: Ambispective longitudinal study. Participants: HIV MSM from the outpatients HIV
      and STD Unit of Bellvitge Hospital. We include patients visited within the usual outpatient
      practice since January 2015 with a cytology stored following the Hospital protocol, as well
      as patients collected prospectively since January 2017. This methodological approach will let
      to reduce the time of inclusion and maximize follow-up time. Sample size calculated: 355
      participants. Follow-up period: 2 to 5 years. At each visit an anal smear for cytology, HPV
      DNA detection (by Linear Array and Hybrid Capture) and E6/E7 mRNA expression and a HRA with
      biopsy of suspicious areas of dysplasia will be performed. The analysis of cost-effectiveness
      will be made with a Markov model that projects long-term cost and effectiveness for both
      strategies, the E6/E7 and conventional cytology plus detection of High Risk HPV.

      1. Detection of anal HPV

             -  Hybrid Capture® 2 HPV DNA (QIAGEN Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland; EE.UU): enzyme
                linked immunoabsorvent assay based on a sandwich hybridisation that allows a
                qualitative measure of DNA of 13 HPV.

             -  Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Alameda,
                California, EE.UU): it detects a region within the HPV L1 that share 37 anogenital
                HPV genotypes.

             -  Detection of E6/E7 VPH mRNA using APTIMA® HPV Test (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego,
                California, EE.UU): it allows the qualitative detection of HPV E6/E7 mRNA from 14
                high-risk HPVs.

        2. Anal cytology: processed with Thinprep Pap Test (Hologic, Marlborough, Massachusetts,
           USA). The swab is deposited into preserved liquid based cytology: PreservCyt Solution.

        3. HRA with biopsy of suspicious lesions
