      To prospectively examine the relations between adherence scores for three healthful dietary
      patterns, the Alternate Mediterranean diet (AMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension (DASH), and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), and risk of

    <description>The primary outcome, self-reported hearing loss that was moderate or worse in severity, was determined based on responses to the 2009 and 2013 questionnaires on which participants were asked about their hearing. On the 2009 main questionnaire, participants were asked, &quot;Do you have a hearing problem?&quot; (no, mild, moderate, severe), and &quot;At what age did you first notice a change in your hearing?&quot; On the 2013 main questionnaire, participants were asked, &quot;Which best describes your hearing?&quot; (excellent, good, a little hearing trouble, moderate hearing trouble, deaf), and &quot;Have you noticed a change in your hearing?&quot; and, if the response was &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;At what age did you first notice a change in your hearing?&quot;</description>

    <description>Detailed hearing-related information was collected electronically in 2012 supplemental questionnaire from a representative subcohort of NHS II participants (n= 33,102) with and without reported hearing problems, including information on previous evaluation for hearing loss, laterality (unilateral or bilateral), and identified causes of hearing loss (e.g. ototoxic medications, ear trauma, otosclerosis, cholesteatoma, Meniere's disease, chronic ear infection). Data from the HSSQ were used to conduct sensitivity analyses using more refined case definitions (e.g. excluding known etiologies and unilateral hearing loss).</description>

        The Conservation of Hearing Study (CHEARS) examines risk factors for hearing loss among
        participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, an ongoing cohort study of 116,430 female
        registered nurses in the US, aged 25-42 at enrollment in 1989. Participants have been
        followed by biennial mailed questionnaires that elicit updated information on diet,
        lifestyle, and various health outcomes; the follow-up rate over 26 years exceeds 90% of the
        eligible person-time. After exclusions, a total of 70,966 women were included in the
        analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators limited the study to women who provided information on their hearing
             on the 2009 or 2013 questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators excluded those who did not provide responses to the hearing
             questions on either questionnaire, reported a hearing problem that began before
             baseline for the current analysis (1991) or did not report date of onset, or reported
             cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. The investigators also excluded women who
             did not complete the baseline diet questionnaire and who had missing diet information
             for each subsequent time period.

    <ipd_description>For investigators who wish to use the investigators' data, the investigators have adopted a data enclave approach to data sharing within the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Along with a general description of the cohorts and questionnaires that have been used since 1989 (NHS II), guidelines are available upon request for outside users to access the resources of our studies. Typically, an outside user prepares a brief proposal that is reviewed by the Channing investigator group to identify a local investigator to assist the outside investigator. If uncertainty arises as to the merit of a request, the External Advisory Committees makes a final decision. After approval, the investigators facilitate access to our data either through programming support or orientation to the data.</ipd_description>
