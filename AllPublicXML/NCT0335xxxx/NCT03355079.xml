  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of long-term addition of SmofKabiven®
      E to normal oral nutrition after routine dietary counseling. It takes place in lung cancer
      patients under chemo- and/or immunotherapy. Efficacy will be determined primarily by
      calculating the change of patient's body weight from before start of study treatment to end
      of treatment, and comparing this change between both treatment groups.
