  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a medical condition, in which the hair falls out in patches. The hair can
      fall out on the scalp or elsewhere on the face and body. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune
      skin disease, which means that the immune system is recognizing the hair follicles as foreign
      and attacking them, causing round patches of hair loss. It can progress to total scalp hair
      loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis). The scalp is the
      most commonly affected area, but the beard or any hair-bearing site can be affected alone or
      together with the scalp. Alopecia areata occurs in males and females of all ages, and is a
      highly unpredictable condition that tends to recur. Alopecia areata can cause significant
      distress to both patients and their families. In this study, the aim is to assess the effects
      of dupilumab in patients with alopecia areata.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether dupilumab can be a helpful treatment for
      alopecia areata.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of a total of 54 subjects
      with moderate to severe alopecia areata involving 30-100% of the scalp. The researchers
      expect one third of these subjects to have concomitant alopecia areata (AA) and atopic
      dermatitis (AD).

      The researchers' experience in AD, and past experience in psoriasis showed that biomarker
      studies in skin tissues are critical to the understanding of key pathogenic pathways that are
      upregulated in each disease and how well they are suppressed with effective treatment. These
      mechanistic studies coupled with clinical trials are key in the disease to shed light on
      important disease mechanisms, and to explain which molecules are suppressed by each
      therapeutic target. Data shows that IL-13 is significantly upregulated in both AD and AA
      lesions compared to nonlesional skin. It is very important to associate the clinical
      responses with suppression of this cytokine and related molecules as well as other pathway
      cytokines in skin tissues. Both the whole genomic profiling and individual molecular and
      cellular markers are very important in order to understand how well anti-IL-13 will
      change/suppress AA-associated pathways and compare with those that will be suppressed in AD.

      Since this study is designed to gain basic knowledge rather than to yield information
      directly related to patient care, the results are not entered in the participants' medical
      records. If, at a later date, correlations of in-vitro tests and the patients' clinical
      situation suggest that the results do bear on the patients' health, an amended protocol will
      be submitted to the IRB so that results can be made available to the medical record.

    <ipd_description>Since this study is designed to gain basic knowledge rather than to yield information directly related to patient care, the results are not entered in the participants' medical records. If, at a later date, correlations of in-vitro tests and the patients' clinical situation suggest that the results do bear on the patients' health, an amended protocol will be submitted to the IRB so that results can be made available to the medical record.</ipd_description>
