  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the incidence, risk factors and outcomes
      of Hospital-acquired Acute Kidney Injury in Hospital Selayang, a tertiary hospital at
      Malaysia, over 15 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study involving 5-yearly trend from 2002 to 2017 for analysis.
      Laboratory serum creatinine (SCr) results of all patients admitted during study period will
      be retrieved from the hospital Laboratory Information System. A preliminary screening list
      will be generated by using STATA program from the SCr results. The nephrologist will then
      determine HA-AKI and CA-AKI as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collectors will
      collect all relevant data from these patients.

    <description>CA-AKI is defined by any patient who developed AKI (as per definition below) within 48 hours of hospital admission.
Definition of AKI:
i. An increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours OR ii. An increase in serum creatinine to more or equal to 1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days
Definition for baseline creatinine:
i. The baseline creatinine level is defined as the creatinine level at or within 7 days before the hospital admission, OR ii. at the hospital admission OR iii. the lowest creatinine (excluding the post dialysis creatinine if dialysis is initiated) during the index hospitalisation for those whose baseline creatinine were unknown.</description>
