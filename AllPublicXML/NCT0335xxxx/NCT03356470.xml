    <textblock>
      This study uses molecular imaging and novel immune monitoring to identify a biomarker of
      response for melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Prior to
      treatment, FDG and FLT PET/CT will be obtained, together with blood and tumor biopsies from
      each patient. A follow-up FDG and FLT PET/CT will be obtained, together with blood and tumor
      biopsies, 10-12 weeks after starting treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody. Additional tumor
      biopsies and blood samples for immune monitoring will be obtained 4-6 weeks after starting
      treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody as well as 16-18 weeks after starting anti-PD-1 treatment
      for patients still receiving anti-PD-1 antibody at that time.

    <description>F-FLT PET uses a thymidine analogue that accumulates in proliferating tissue. Proliferating tissue could include malignant lesions or immune cells. In this study, FLT PET/CT will be utilized as a molecular imaging tool to detect immune activation after administration of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab or nivolumab.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a metastatic melanoma diagnosis (stage IV) for which treatment
             with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, either alone or in combination with other therapies,
             is planned. No additional laboratory testing is needed for the imaging in this study
             apart from the standard laboratory testing routinely obtained for treatment with
             nivolumab or pembrolizumab, either alone or in combination with other therapies.

          -  Participants must have at least 2 subcutaneous or lymph node melanoma metastases that
             are 2 cm in greatest diameter and are amenable to being biopsied in clinic without
             requiring image-guidance.

          -  Participants must be able to provide informed consent

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception as
             discussed with their oncologist while participating in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not able to receive treatment with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days of the first study FDG and FLT PET/CT and must not be breast feeding for
             the duration of study participation.
