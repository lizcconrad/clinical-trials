  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized trial. Our study aims to study the effects of
      perioperative patient education about compartment syndrome on patients' perception of their
      own pain, amount of opioid medication utilization, and rate of diagnosis of compartment
      syndrome.
