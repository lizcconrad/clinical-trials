        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults ≥18 years of age with more than 24 hours of urinary symptoms attributable to a
             UTI

          2. Able to provide informed consent

          3. Clinically documented pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection:

               1. Pyelonephritis with normal anatomy

               2. Complicated UTI as defined by one or more of the following factors:

             i. The presence of an indwelling catheter ii. &gt;100 mL of residual urine after voiding
             iii. Neurogenic bladder iv. Obstructive uropathy due to nephrolithiasis, tumor or
             fibrosis v. Azotemia due to intrinsic renal disease vi. Urinary retention in men
             possibly due to benign prostatic hypertrophy vii. Surgically modified or abnormal
             urinary tract anatomy

          4. At least two of the following signs or symptoms:

               1. Rigors, chills or fever with temperature (oral, rectal, tympanic, temporal)
                  &gt;100.4º F or 38º C

               2. Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness

               3. Nausea or vomiting

               4. Dysuria, urinary frequency or urinary urgency

               5. Cost-vertebral angle tenderness on physical examination

          5. A mid-stream urine specimen with:

               1. a dipstick analysis positive for nitrite AND

               2. evidence of pyuria as defined by either: i. a dipstick analysis positive for
                  leukocyte esterase AND/OR ii. at least 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter
                  on microscopic analysis of unspun urine AND/OR iii. White blood cell count ≥10
                  cells/high-powered field in urine sediment

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Receipt of effective antibacterial drug therapy for complicated urinary tract
             infection (cUTI) for a continuous duration of more than 24 hours during the previous
             72 hours. Patients who have objective documentation of clinical progression of cUTI
             while on antibacterial drug therapy, or patients who received antibacterial drugs for
             surgical prophylaxis and then develop cUTI, may be appropriate for enrollment.

             resistant to ertapenem

          3. Severe structural or functional urinary tract abnormality responsible for an
             intractable infection which in the opinion of the investigator would require &gt; 10 days
             of therapy or post-treatment prophylaxis (eg. patients with chronic vesiculo-ureteral
             reflux).
