      Compare the effect of capecitabine (cape) + temozolomide (temo) and of 5FU + streptozotocin
      (strepto) given with a new schedule (LV5FU2 + strepto), two of the most used chemotherapy
      regimens in the treatment of well differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors alone or in
      combination with bevacizumab (beva) on progression-free survival (PFS) and compare the
      chemotherapy regimens alone or with beva (two by two design) on the same criteria.

             progression (at least 20% increase of tumor size on a maximum 12 months period of
             follow-up) or other indication of chemotherapy following the National Thesaurus of GI
             Cancerology (Appendix 6) (liver involvement &gt; 50%, symptoms related to the tumour or
             its metastases, Ki67&gt;10%) (Appendix 6)
