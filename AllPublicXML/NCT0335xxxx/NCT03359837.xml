      Primary Objective:

      To test the hypothesis that basal insulin based treatment (G+) is noninferior to twice-daily
      premixed insulin (PM-2) in term of hemoglobin A1c (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) reduction
      from baseline to end of study. The test for superiority can be done if noninferiority is
      achieved.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess efficacy in terms of percentage of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7% and HbA1c &lt;7%
           without hypoglycemia.

        -  To assess efficacy in terms of percentage of patients achieving fasting plasma glucose
           (FPG) &lt;7 mmol/L and FPG &lt;7 mmol/L without hypoglycemia.

        -  To assess safety in term of occurrence of moderate/severe hypoglycemia.

        -  To assess daily blood glucose (BG) variation.

        -  To assess patient satisfaction.
