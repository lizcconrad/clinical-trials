    <textblock>
      Dietary antioxidants might protect from the development of chronic diseases by reducing
      levels of oxidative stress. The investigators therefore investigated the effect of dietary
      Non Enzymatic Antioxidant Capacity, which measures interactions between antioxidants in the
      whole diet, on the risk of 1) myocardial infarction and 2) osteoarthritis.

      Aim: Among an initial sample of 43,880 men and women who participated in the Swedish National
      March Cohort in 1997 the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of dietary Non
      Enzymatic Antioxidant Capacity (NEAC), assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire
      at baseline, on the risk of 1) myocardial infarction and 2) osteoarthritis.

      Identification of cases: Incident cases of myocardial infarction (ICD-10 code I21) and
      osteoarthritis (ICD-10 M15-19) were identified through exact linkages to the Swedish
      registries of population, migration, death, cancer, and inpatient care, using the national
      registration numbers as identifiers.

      Main methods: The investigators fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models with age as
      underlying time scale to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
      for each outcome of interest at different levels of dietary NEAC. The investigators fitted
      multiple imputation models based on chained equations to address missingness of confounder
      variables.
