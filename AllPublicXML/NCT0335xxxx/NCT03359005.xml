  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is
      dismal and unchanged over the last decades.Thus, the investigators explored the activity of
      irinotecan combined with temozolomide in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma
      after the failure of first-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
      ifosphamide and etoposide.

             the judgment of the investigator.

          -  Prior treatment consisted of standard Ewing Sarcoma chemotherapy agents including
             doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and etoposide; metastatic
             relapsed and unresectable progressive disease (PD);

             dacarbazine (DTIC) or any of its components, and irinotecan or any of its components.

          -  Concomitant use of any other investigational or anticancer agent(s).

          -  Pregnant patients or patients who are breast feeding. Subjects capable of pregnancy
             (post menarche and not post-menopausal, defined as over 12 months since final
