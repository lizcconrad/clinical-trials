  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized double blind placebo controlled trial to compare the post-operative pain control
      advantages of post-incisional wound infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine to plain
      bupivacaine in patients presenting for elective caesarean delivery.

    <textblock>
      Participants will include women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, ≥37 weeks
      gestation, ≥18 years old presenting and presenting for elective caesarean delivery with a
      planned spinal anesthetic with a standardized amount of intrathecal morphine (ITM). Exclusion
      criteria include patients: not receiving a spinal anesthetic, receiving a spinal anesthetic
      that required supplemental intraoperative pain medications (ketamine, epidural narcotics,
      intravenous narcotics, etc), on chronic opioids, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA)
      physical status class III or higher (Note: An ASA I patient is defined as a normal healthy
      patient, an ASA II patient is defined as a patient with mild systemic disease and any patient
      that with severe systemic disease or a disease that is incapacitating would be classified as
      an ASA III or higher) or those that have known hypersensitivity to bupivacaine hydrochloride,
      amide-type local anesthetics, or any component of the formation, and any subject with hepatic
      or renal impairment.

      A three-arm study will be used: (a) control group (placebo of normal saline) (b) plain
      bupivacaine group and (c) liposomal bupivacaine group. After patients receive their spinal
      anesthetic and as the Pfannenstiel incision is being closed, an equal volume (20ml,
      administered via two 10ml syringes) of one of the three solutions will be infiltrated into
      the wound by the obstetrician team in a standardized fashion.
