  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intake of processed meat products has been linked to several adverse health outcomes.
      However, estimation of their intake proves difficult. This study aims at identifying
      biomarkers of intake for processed meat products in blood and urine. For this, participants
      of a randomized cross-over dietary intervention will consume highly controlled diets
      containing non-processed pork, different processed meat products or no meat. Urine and plasma
      will be collected and analysed to identify sets of metabolites that are specific for the
      intake of the processed meat products.

      The intake of processed meat has been linked to several adverse health outcomes such as
      cancer. However, little is known about the respective effects of the single products in this
      diverse group.

      Most epidemiological studies rely on self-reported questionnaires to assess the intake of
      different foods. Even though this method is relatively easy to perform, it is prone to errors
      such as memory biases of subjects or difficulties in estimating portion size. The use of food
      specific biomarkers may overcome this limitation by offering an objective quantification of
      dietary exposure. No biomarkers for the consumption of processed meat products have been
      established yet.

      Twelve human healthy adults will participate in a randomized cross-over dietary intervention
      study and will consume three different processed meat products, fresh meat or no meat, each
      during 3 successive days followed by a 10-day washout period. The metabolite profile in urine
      and plasma samples will be analysed to find metabolites that are specific for the intake of
      the processed meat products.

      The identification of these biomarkers in blood and urine will allow a more precise
      estimation of intake of different processed meat products. This will enable a more robust
      estimation of the risk linked to the intake of processed meat products.
