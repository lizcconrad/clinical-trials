  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of fractures in Norway is among the highest in the world, and falls are the
      sixth major contributor to years lived with disability. In elderly, a large part of 900
      deaths from unintentional injuries per 100000 inhabitants per year, are due to falls and
      fractures. Fractures, especially hip fractures among the elderly, often result in pain,
      ailments, and reduced quality of life. In Norway, 11 % of all reports from the specialized
      health services were incidents related to falls. Worldwide, falls are among the most commonly
      reported adverse events in hospitals with prevalence rates in the order of 10 per 1000
      patient days or 5-15 % of the patients, and are associated with both minor and major
      injuries. The results of preventive measures are conflicting.

      In January 2011, the Norwegian health minister launched a national patient safety campaign
      called &quot;In Safe hands&quot;. The campaign had three aims: 1) Reduce patient related adverse
      events, 2) Build sustainable systems and structures for patient safety, and 3) Improve the
      patient safety culture. Hospitals and primary care units were invited to participate in 16
      specific and measurable areas for improvement. One out of four orthopedic departments at Møre
      og Romsdal Hospital Trust, Norway participated actively in a fall prevention program.

      This study compares the changes in fall rates, the employees' perceived patient safety
      culture and the patient experienced safety before and after implementation of the fall
      prevention program at the orthopedic department in one hospital in the Møre &amp; Romsdal
      Hospital Trust, and at the same time points i another hospital in the same Trust but not
      having implemented the program.

      The interventions are multifaceted and include short and long-term activities to prevent
      falls. Fall screening, performed with the Norwegian version of the risk assessment tool for
      falls in elderly &quot;STRATIFY (score 0 - 5), is the main tool. In patients with a score of 2 or
      more, a comprehensive individual plan for fall prevention has been worked out for each
      patient with risk of fall, documented in the medical records, and communicated to the staff
      responsible for the patient. The plan includes practical initiatives like adjusting the beds,
      proper illumination, instructions not to leave the bed unaided, and appropriate shoes. There
      are also long-term measures like the treatment of underlying diseases, changes in medication
      associated with risk of fall, physical training, and healthier dietary habits. During the
      intervention, the process is measured and reported to the national campaign. The national
      intervention was designed for use in hospitals, care facilities and patients living at home.
      Most of the proposed activities aim at preventing falls in a long time perspective.
