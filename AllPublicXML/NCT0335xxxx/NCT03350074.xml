  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains difficult to eradicate with about 240 million
      people living with HBV chronic infection. HBsAg clearance, correlated with a good clinical
      prognosis, is difficult to achieve even with antiviral treatments (3-14 %). HBV envelope
      proteins are essential for entry into hepatocyte and are targeted by the immune system.
      Molecular characteristics of HBV envelope proteins may favour better viral fitness at the
      entry step into hepatocytes and/or HBV escape from host immunity. Here we investigated
      whether variability of HBV envelope proteins can contribute to the differential responses to
      anti-HBV treatment in patients with HBsAg clearance or persistence.

      Our study is a retrospective study of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus, selected
      exclusively at the University Hospital Center of Nancy in the Department of
      Hepato-Gastroenterology (HGE). the patient inclusion criteria were as follows: Adult patients
      with chronic hepatitis B, treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues, mono-infected with HBV
      (without co-infection with HCV, HIV and HDV). For each patient included, biological, clinical
      and therapeutic data were collected retrospectively. Patients with loss of viral load on
      treatment were included in this study. Among them, patients showed either a clearance of
      HBsAg on treatment (&quot;responders&quot;) or the control patients showed a persistence of HBsAg on
      treatment (&quot;non-responders&quot;, control patients).
