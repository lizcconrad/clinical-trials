  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several stakeholders are implied in cancer care pathways and there is a need for coordinating
      their actions. New occupations of care coordination have thus emerged. However, the
      conditions of their efficiency have been too few reported and included discrepancies between
      reports. In this context, the main objective is to propose a modeling of care coordination
      and associated emerging occupations (nurse-based) by comparing theoretical expected outcomes
      to professionals, patients and caregivers representations.

      Several stakeholders are implied in cancer care pathways and there is a need to coordinate
      their actions. New occupations of care coordination have thus emerged, such as nurse
      coordinator in France (IDEC: Infirmière de Coordination). However, the conditions of their
      efficiency are not well known. Moreover, several other complementary approaches and nurse
      occupations have to be identified because of their contribution to care coordination (IDE
      TAS, IPO, IDE AMA, IDE-CO, IDE HAD-CAD, IDE ETP)*. Finally, all together, these interventions
      of care coordination appeared as complex and asked for a theoretical model. Because of this
      high variability of the practices, without an underlying model, the impact of care
      coordination on patient quality of life, safety and efficiency of care is difficult to
      assess. In this context, the main objective is to propose a modeling of care coordination and
      associated emerging occupations by comparing theoretical expected outcomes to professionals,
      patients and caregivers representations.

      The pilot observational study is based on three distinct stages: (1) the definition of care
      coordination in oncology using a literature review and a Delphi consensus study; (2) the
      description of practices, contexts, perceptions and attitudes related to care coordination
      occupations in oncology using a qualitative and a cross-sectional quantitative survey; (3)
      the comparison of the practices to the theoretical model to propose a modeling of care
      coordination occupations in oncology.
