  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for the present study is that patient-based outcomes and gingival blood flow
      will be more favorable for the free gingival graft (FGG) donor sites being covered by the
      test wound dressing material episil compared to the control dressing.

    <measure>Postoperative Pain as Assessed by Number of Participants With a Score of 0-3 (no to Minimal Pain) on a Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain will be determined by the subjects recording their postoperative pain threshold using a Visual Analog Scale with scores from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating minimal pain and 10 indicating severe pain. If no pain is present, a score of 0 will be given. The levels of postoperative pain will be classified as none to minimum if the score is &quot;0 to 3,&quot; moderate for &quot;4 to 6,&quot; and severe for &quot;7 to 10.&quot; None to minimal pain will mean little or no discomfort; moderate is any pain that bothers the subject and mildly affects normal function; and severe will be considered any pain that will not be tolerated and may even disrupt the subject's daily functions.</description>

        <title>Postoperative Pain as Assessed by Number of Participants With a Score of 0-3 (no to Minimal Pain) on a Visual Analog Scale</title>
        <description>Postoperative pain will be determined by the subjects recording their postoperative pain threshold using a Visual Analog Scale with scores from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating minimal pain and 10 indicating severe pain. If no pain is present, a score of 0 will be given. The levels of postoperative pain will be classified as none to minimum if the score is “0 to 3,” moderate for “4 to 6,” and severe for “7 to 10.” None to minimal pain will mean little or no discomfort; moderate is any pain that bothers the subject and mildly affects normal function; and severe will be considered any pain that will not be tolerated and may even disrupt the subject’s daily functions.</description>

        <title>Postoperative Pain as Assessed by Number of Participants With a Score of 0-3 (no to Minimal Pain) on a Visual Analog Scale</title>
        <description>Postoperative pain will be determined by the subjects recording their postoperative pain threshold using a Visual Analog Scale with scores from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating minimal pain and 10 indicating severe pain. If no pain is present, a score of 0 will be given. The levels of postoperative pain will be classified as none to minimum if the score is “0 to 3,” moderate for “4 to 6,” and severe for “7 to 10.” None to minimal pain will mean little or no discomfort; moderate is any pain that bothers the subject and mildly affects normal function; and severe will be considered any pain that will not be tolerated and may even disrupt the subject’s daily functions.</description>

        <description>The laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) technique to measure the blood perfusion of the FGG donor site. The value reported is blood flow at the FGG donor site (operated site) minus blood flow at the contralateral side of the palate (non-operated site). Perfusion Units (PU) are reported, which is blood flow through a given volume or mass of tissue with the unit of measure mL/100g/min.</description>
