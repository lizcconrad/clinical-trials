  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has a major clinical and
      psychological impact in patients treated with chemotherapy. Metabolic, nutritional and
      mechanical complications, as well as psychological repercussions, complicate the therapeutic
      management of the patient and can lead to poor compliance, a deterioration in the general
      condition or even prolongation of hospitalizations and a delay in the implementation of
      chemotherapy cures. The control of induced chemo- and radio-induced nausea and vomiting rests
      above all on their prevention. At present and in most centers, the prevention of nausea and
      vomiting in the pediatric onco-hematology department of the CHU de Nice is based exclusively
      on drug treatments, according to a protocol established according to the emetogenic risk of
      the chemotherapy received.

      We propose a study evaluating the effectiveness of the stimulation of acupuncture points by
      low frequency laser therapy associated with antiemetics in the management of chemotherapy
      induced nausea and vomiting in patients of 2 to 20 years followed in the service of
      analgesics. pediatric onco-hematology.
