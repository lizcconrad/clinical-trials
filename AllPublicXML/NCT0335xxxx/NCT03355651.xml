  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase IV trial to compare the
      efficacy of supplementation with plasma proteins, hydrolyzed collagen (CH), a complex of
      HA-CS (HC-15), and vitamin C combined with a standard rehabilitation protocol versus the
      standard rehabilitation protocol only after arthroscopically-assisted functional ACL
      reconstruction with hamstrings.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects aged between 18 and 55 years with partial or complete anterior cruciate
             ligament (ACL) rupture, diagnosed clinically and by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
             requiring reconstructive surgery.

          -  Patients with symptoms of acute or subacute ACL rupture (such as inflammation of the
             knee and pain with leg movement) or chronic ACL tear, including instability of the
             knee.

          -  Patients with ACL ruptures without osteochondral lesions requiring additional surgery.

          -  Patients with a medical history of therapeutic benefit using analgesic agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with concomitant osteochondral pathology.

          -  Patients treated with intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and/or
             platelet-rich plasma, or with oral glucosamine, CS, HA or CH in the two months prior
             to surgery.

          -  Patients with systemic diseases, those treated with antibiotics or other drugs that
             might alter the healing process, and those who had undergone arthroscopic lavage in
             the 90 days prior to surgery.
