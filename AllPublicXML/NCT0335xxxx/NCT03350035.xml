  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an investigational drug, IV
      ganaxolone, as adjunctive therapy to standard of care to treat subjects with status
      epilepticus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of adjunctive IV ganaxolone in subjects with SE.

      Study drug will be added to standard of care before IV anesthetic during the treatment of SE.

      Subjects will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to receiving study drug as
      adjunctive therapy by continuous IV. Subject's will be followed up for 3 weeks
      post-treatment.
