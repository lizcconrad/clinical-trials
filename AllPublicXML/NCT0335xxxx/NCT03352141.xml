        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female subjects &gt; 22 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.

          -  Treatment area skin fold thickness &gt; 1cm (measured by caliper).

          -  Sufficient treatment area requiring at least 2 cooling cycles.

          -  No weight change exceeding 5% of body weight in the preceding month.

          -  Agreement to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5%) by not making any major changes
             in diet or exercise routine during the course of the study.

          -  Subject has signed a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Excessive skin laxity in the treatment area for which reduction of subcutaneous fat
             may, in the opinion of the investigator, result in an unacceptable aesthetic result.

          -  Prominent platysmal bands at rest which may interfere with assessment of treatment
             area.

          -  Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the treatment area other than localized
             subcutaneous fat, such as swollen lymph nodes or ptotic submandibular glands.

          -  Significant enlargement on the anterior neck that may prevent the proper placement of
             the applicator e.g. enlarged thyroid glands.

          -  Treatment with dermal fillers, radiofrequency or laser procedures, or chemical peels
             in the treatment area (below the mandible) within the past 6 months.

          -  Botulinum toxin or other aesthetic drug injections within the treatment area in the
             past 6 months.

          -  History of facial nerve paresis or paralysis (such as Bell's palsy).

          -  History of a fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction, surgery, lipolytic agents,
             etc.) or implant in or adjacent to the area of intended treatment.

          -  History of prior neck surgery, or prior surgery in the area of intended treatment.

          -  Current infection in and adjacent to treatment area.

          -  Known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, cold agglutinin disease or
             paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.

          -  Known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a response to cold
             exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.

          -  History of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the investigator's
             opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising.

          -  Currently taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements within the past
             month.

          -  Any dermatological conditions, such as scars in the location of the treatment area
             that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation.

          -  Active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system.

          -  Pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 6 months.

          -  Lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Currently enrolled in a clinical study of an unapproved investigational drug or
             device.

          -  Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.
