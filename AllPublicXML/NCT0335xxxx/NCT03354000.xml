  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Online patient portals are becoming ubiquitous in the US. Previous research has documented
      substantial usability barriers, especially among patients with limited health literacy. This
      pilot randomized pilot trial had the goal of determining the effectiveness of an in-person
      training with a scalable online video-based training program to increase portal use among
      patients in a safety net healthcare setting.

      The intervention in this study was a patient portal training curriculum with simple
      instructions and 11 how-to videos for accessing features of an online patient portal. Using a
      deeply participatory approach, this curriculum was created in consultation with a patient
      advisory board from the San Francisco Health Network, a local Medicaid health plan. From June
      until October 2016, 93 patients with 1 or more chronic diseases were randomized to receive
      either: 1) an in-person tutorial with a trained research assistant versus 2) a link to view
      the videos on their own. The primary outcome was portal log-in (yes/no) between 3 and 6
      months post-training, assessed through a portal administrative dashboard within the EHR.
      Secondary outcome included baseline and follow-up survey measures on participants'
      perceptions of the portal use and their care, as well as views of the web-based lessons.
