      This phase I trial studies the side effects of DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401, poly
      ICLC, decitabine, and nivolumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute
      myeloid leukemia. DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 is a vaccine that may help the
      immune system specifically target and kill cancer cells. Poly ICLC may help stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread. Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401, poly ICLC,
      decitabine, and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
      or acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of NY-ESO-1 vaccination (Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein +
      poly-ICLC) fusion given in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously and nivolumab
      3 mg/kg in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).

      SECONDRY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess immune and molecular epigenetic responses following combination therapy with
      nivolumab, decitabine and DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 (NY-ESO-1) vaccination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological
      improvement) in MDS or low blast count AML patients treated with the combination in order to
      provide descriptive characteristics.

      II. To record the overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and time to AML
      transformation (TTT) (for patients with MDS at diagnosis) enrolled on the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intracutaneously and poly ICLC
      subcutaneously (SC) on day -14, on day 15 of courses 1-4, and then on day 1 of every 4
      courses thereafter. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on
      days 1 and 15 and decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses with nivolumab and
      decitabine repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.
