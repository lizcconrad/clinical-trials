  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A stroke occurs when the blood circulation is hampered due an ischemic or hemorrhagic event.
      Previous, a stroke was treated only with anti-aggregation. Over time, multiple studies have
      showed a positive effect of intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA (recombinant tissue
      plasminogen activator) in comparison with the standard treatment (anti-aggregation). Since
      2015, thrombectomy was proven to have an added value in combination with thrombolysis.
      Thrombectomy is an endovascular technique where the thrombus is removed or fragmented.

      Diagnosis and treatment of stroke will have a significant impact on the health-economic
      status of the patient. However, little data is known. Unfortunately, the outcome after
      diagnosis with a stroke is not well documented. Therefore, this follow-up study over a time
      period of one year, will give us a sufficient amount of data to evaluate patients diagnosed
      with a stroke in the hospital of Genk.

    <measure>Modified rankin scale</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in modified rankin scale over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. Modified rankin scale is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke.
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.
0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>

    <measure>Rehabilitation: evaluation muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in muscle strength over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. Muscle strength is assessed in both arms and legs according to the score below.
0: no movement 9: palpable flicker but no movement 14: movement but not against gravity 19: movement against gravity 25: movement against resistance 33: normal The scores for arms and legs are counted together and divided by 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rehabilitation: evaluation arm/hand function</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in arm/hand function over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. 5 small tests are performed. The total score can vary from 0 to 5, with lower scores indicating decreased arm/hand function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rehabilitation: walking capability</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in walking capability over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. Test: if the patient is able to walk, he/she has to walk 10 meters and is recorded as meter per second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rehabilitation: trunk control test</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in trunk activity over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. Trunk control test examines four movements: rolling from a supine position to the weak side and to the strong side, sitting up from a lying-down position, and sitting balance.
Each item is scored as indicated below:
0: no movement 12: movement with corrections 25: normal The total score counts the four tests together. The maximum possible score is 100, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in NIHSS over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>

    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. The European Quality of life system comprises 5 dimensions (EQ5D): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels varying from no problems to extreme problems.</description>

    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. The barthel index is an index that represent the capacity to perform daily activities (feeding, grooming, toilet use, stairs, bathing,...). Total possible scores range from 0 - 20, with lower scores indicating increased disability.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life-stroke specific quality of life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. The Stroke-Specific Quality of Life scale (SSQOL) is a questionnaire that evaluates different activities performed in the last week (language, mobility, personality, writing, thinking, mood, vision,...). Each item is scored with a maximum of 5 points. The higher the score, the more problems the patient will have with their daily activities.</description>
