      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV-infused
      autologous or allogenic HPV-CTLs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer
      especially those high-risk types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 45). Around 50-80% of women are infected by
      HPV within their whole lives. The current treatment of HPV-positive mainly includes drug,
      cryotherapy, laser, microwave, surgery and so on. Some treatments are convenient, but easy to
      cause pain or infection and there is still a greater risk of recurrence after treatment.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral
      antigens has proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of multiple infusions of HPV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes cells in patients.
