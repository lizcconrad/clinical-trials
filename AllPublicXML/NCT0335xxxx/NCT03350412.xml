  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of delivering the right drug to the right cancer patient (precision medicine)
      requires a detailed understanding of how genomic alterations are linked to drug response. The
      purpose of this study is to intercept at point-of-care a large cohort of newly diagnosed mCRC
      patients to determine if it is possible to obtain personalized genetic information from each
      subject's tumor (tissue and blood) to triage treatment choices. In case of target positivity,
      patients will be conveyed, whenever possible, to self-standing, independent,
      hypothesis-driven POC trials as soon as they exhibit resistance to standard of care
      treatment.
