  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Household air pollution (HAP) is a top-priority public health problem in developing
      countries. According to the most recent comparative risk assessment, 3.5 million people die
      prematurely each year as a result of HAP exposures. While uncertainties remain regarding
      causal links between HAP exposures and health, the time is ripe for focused research into
      effective interventions. Limited past research has shown that the demand for clean cookstoves
      is low, and that households continue to use traditional hearths even when they have clean
      stoves. The investigators propose to harness an existing cohort in Ghana to study factors
      that increase the adoption of clean cookstoves, and to test strategies to promote adoption
      and continued use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health conditions resulting from household air pollution (HAP) are responsible for
      approximately 3.9 million premature deaths each year. Exposure to HAP is the third largest
      preventable contributor to illness worldwide. Even so, HAP exposures persist since 3 billion
      individuals worldwide continue to rely on biomass fuel for cooking and heating, especially in
      the developing world. Though the transition away from traditional biomass stoves is projected
      curb the health effects of HAP by mitigating exposure, the benefits of newer clean cookstove
      technologies can only be fully realized if use of these stoves is exclusive and sustained.
      Most studies indicate that the provision of clean cookstoves to these individuals is, on its
      own, insufficient to encourage and foster adoption. In order to better understand how to
      promote clean cookstove adoption, the proposed study aims to (1) develop an educational
      intervention to promote clean cookstove adoption and sustained use and (2) determine the
      influence of liquid petroleum gasoline (LPG) accessibility on product demand.

      Households enrolled into the control and the BioLite arms of GRAPHS (the parent study) will
      receive clean LPG cookstoves for their participation in the study (clinicaltrials.gov
      registration: NCT01335490). The objective of this study is to test the relative impact of two
      approaches to encourage stove use: providing a behavior change intervention and offering
      convenient access to LPG refueling. The investigators hypothesize that these interventions
      will increase overall use of LPG cook stoves.

      Prior evidence on the role of health information in promoting the adoption of
      health-promoting technology is limited, and the results are mixed. Although little work has
      been done to investigate the importance of accessibility to sustained use of cookstoves,
      accessibility remains one of the basic market drivers of product demand.

      A total of 27 communities will be cluster randomized, with 979 study households nested
      throughout the sites. The study arms will be arranged as a 2x2 factorial design, with
      approximately equal numbers of households in each arm.

    <description>The Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-Regulation (RANAS) Model is a health behavior change intervention, which has been successfully used in the area of water, sanitation, and hygiene. It draws from numerous health behavior theories, including the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Health Action Process, and the Health Belief Model. The model posits that the five factor blocks (risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation) that must be aligned toward the new behavior in order to influence change. A series of activities target each block accordingly.</description>

    <description>Product demand is influenced, in part, by accessibility. We are testing the degree to which this is true for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by establishing a direct delivery system for communities randomized to this treatment arm. Individuals in these communities are able to contact a 'delivery agent', contracted by the Kintampo Health Research Centre, who will: 1) retrieve their cylinder, 2) refill with LPG, and 3) return to the participant. The cost of delivery is free to the participant (paid by the study), but the participant is expected to fully pay for their own LPG.</description>
