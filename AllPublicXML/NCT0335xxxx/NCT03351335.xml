    <measure>Improvement in overall lifting of submental (under the chin) and neck tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Lifiting is determined by a quantitative measure of tissue lift in the area using photographs taken with Mirror Photofile software and a Vectra 3D digital imaging System. Improvement is defined as a response rate &gt; 60% whereby a responder is defined as a subject showing a submental lift of ≥13mm2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening on Physician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (PGAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The PGAIS is a 5-point scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pretreatment appearance. The ratings are much worse, worse, no change, improved, much improved, and very much improved.
Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin is defined by the subject response rate (improved, much improved or very much improved) as determined by live assessment compared to baseline photograph.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening on Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (SGAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The SGAIS is a 5-point scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pretreatment appearance. The ratings are much worse, worse, no change, improved, much improved, and very much improved.
Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin is defined by the subject response rate (improved, much improved or very much improved) as determined by live assessment compared to baseline photograph.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin as determined by a masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The blinded Assessor will be with identical sets of photos to be assessed: pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photos, pre and post treatment, will not be marked. Either &quot;no improvement&quot; versus &quot;improvement&quot; will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject satisfaction at 90 days post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction will be assessed by a 7-point scale (extremely dissatisfied, dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, slightly satisfied, satisfied, extremely satisfied)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject reported improvement at 90 days post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Subject reported improvement will be assessed by a 5-point scale (worse, no change, a little improved, improved, much improved).</description>
