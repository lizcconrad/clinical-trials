  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressed during or
      after a previous docetaxel-based chemotherapy, for whom cabazitaxel has been scheduled as per
      clinical practice and label indication.

      In the &quot;TROPIC&quot; Trial, cabazitaxel, administered concomitantly with prednisone 10 mg daily,
      showed a significant advantage vs. mitoxantrone in both Overall Survival (OS) and Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) / radiographic PFS in patients failing docetaxel-based chemotherapy.
      Similar to docetaxel, cabazitaxel has been approved in combination with daily prednisone, but
      the benefits of adding daily corticosteroids to taxane chemotherapy remain to be proven. In
      fact, corticosteroids have a variety of biological effects, and a number of studies in large
      cohorts of patients show that they may have both favourable effects, mediated by adrenal
      androgen and cytokine suppression, and detrimental effects related to their adverse events
      associated with their long-term use as well to the potential promiscuous activation of the
      AR. In fact, prednisone and dexamethasone can activate some AR variants that make tumors
      sensitive to glucocorticoids even at low concentrations. It has been showed that point
      mutations of the AR, which appear to cluster in the ligand-binding domain, are rare in
      therapy naive patients but occur in 15- 45% of patients with castration-resistant disease and
      can increase AR affinity for a wide range of steroids. On the other hand, insofar as safety
      is concerned, omitting daily corticosteroids does not seem to increase toxicity (e.g.
      hypersensitivity reactions). In fact, in the CHARTEED trial, docetaxel was safely
      administered without daily corticosteroids. Safety data about the use of cabazitaxel without
      daily prednisone/prednisone alone are missing.

      The CABACARE study is designed to assess the effects in terms of efficacy, safety as well as
      quality of life of omitting daily corticosteroids in patients treated with cabazitaxel.
      Furthermore, the CABACARE study evaluates the mutational status of the RB gene as well as
      presence of AR-V7 variant. The AR-V7 status assessed in circulating tumor cells has a strong
      predictive value for abiraterone/enzalutamide effectiveness, but its role in patients
      receiving cabazitaxel requires to be defined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:

      Arm A Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, plus prednisone 10 mg orally
      given daily. Premedication must be administered according to Cabazitaxel Package Insert.

      Arm B Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² intravenously (Day 1) every 3 weeks, without daily prednisone.
      Premedication must be administered according to Cabazitaxel Package Insert.

      Each patient will be treated until radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      or patient refusal. Patients will be followed through subsequent therapy lines of treatments
      until death or the study cut-off, whichever comes first.

      Every effort will be made to administer the full dose regimen to maximize dose-intensity.

      Dose reduction and/or treatment delay and/or treatment discontinuation are planned in case of
      severe toxicity. If toxicity occurs, dose of Cabazitaxel can be reduced to 20 mg/mq in both
      arms. If a second dose reduction is required the patient should be withdrawn from study.

      Prednisone doses should not be delayed or modified or stopped (unless there is a
      contraindication to continue, the decision will be let to the investigator's discretion).

      In case a dose reduction is required, cabazitaxel dose cannot be re-escalated. Prophylactic
      use of G-CSF is allowed, as per EORTC / ASCO guidelines and according to physician judgment.
      Patients experiencing neutropenia G 3-4 have to receive G-CSF in prophylaxis in subsequent
      cycles.

      Primary Objective(s)

      To evaluate whether cabazitaxel alone is non inferior in terms of radiographic PFS with
      respect to cabazitaxel plus daily prednisone in patients with castration resistant prostate
      cancer

      Secondary Objective(s)

      Safety in the two treatment arms; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and pain; Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1);
      Biochemical response (assessed considering PSA decrease ≥50% and waterfall plot results);
      Time to PSA Progression (TTPP); Radiographic Time to Progression (rTTP); Overall Survival
      (OS); Association of Overall

      l Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) with AR-V7
      and RB status in circulating tumor cells assessed at flow-cytometry; Time to Skeletal-Related
      Event (SRE);

      Primary end Point

      Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS).

      Secondary end points

      Safety in the two treatment arms; Health-Related Quality of Life HRQL and pain; Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1);
      Biochemical response (PSA decrease ≥50%, waterfall plot); Time to PSA Progression (TTPP);
      Radiographic Time To Progression (rTTP); Overall Survival (OS); Association of Overall
      Survival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) with AR-V7
      and RB status in circulating tumor cells by the use of a DNA test; Time to Skeletal-Related
      Event (SRE).
