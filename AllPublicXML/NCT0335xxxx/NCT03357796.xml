    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate relative bioavailability between 80 mg LY03005
      oral tablets and 50 mg Pristiq® oral tablets after a single dose of each drug in a cross-over
      2-period design under fasting condition in healthy subjects between 18 and 50 years of age.

             venlafaxine;

         14. Subjects who have participated in a previous clinical study of either LY03005 or ODV
             or medicines containing ODV or its precursor, venlafaxine within 30 days prior to
             Screening;

         15. Unwillingness or inability to comply with food and beverage restrictions during study
             participation;
