  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the effect of semaglutide on subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease.This study is comparing the change in early stages of scar tissue in the liver and
      fat deposition in the liver in people taking semaglutide and placebo (a dummy medicine).

      Participants will either get semaglutide or placebo; which treatment participants get is
      decided by chance. Semaglutide is a medicine under clinical investigation. That means that
      the medicine has not yet been approved by the authorities. Participants will need to
      self-inject medicine once daily for 72 weeks. The medicine should be injected under the skin
      in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.

      There are about 3 weeks before participants start the study medicine and 7 weeks after you
      stop it. The study will last for about 82 weeks in total.

      Participants will have 12 clinic visits, 6 phone calls and 4 visits to an MRI centre.

      The study includes MRI scans of the stomach. The MRI scans will take place at a different
      location. Participants will be excluded from the study if the study doctor thinks that there
      are risks for participants health. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan
      to become pregnant during the study period.
