    <textblock>
      Randomised cross-over study seeking to explore the acute physiological (heart rate and blood
      pressure) and perceptual responses (rating of perceived exertion, mood and enjoyment) to
      three novel forms (non-contact boxing, stair stepping and stair climbing) of high-intensity
      interval training (HIT).

    <description>In each of the three sessions a different exercise modality will be conducted, in a randomised sequence. Non-contact boxing involves boxing &quot;punch pads&quot; that will be held by the one of the researchers, while wearing protective boxing gloves. Each exercise modality will be conducted following a high-intensity interval protocol (4 x 60 seconds of exercise interspersed with 60 seconds of rest). During each exercise bout participants will be encouraged to exercise at an intensity that elicits a heart rate of ≥85% of maximum, which will always be followed by 60 seconds of passive recovery. Participants will complete a 5 minute warm-up and a 2 minute cool down and stretch after the exercise bouts have been completed.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete 3 sessions of exercise. In each of the three sessions a different exercise modality will be conducted in a randomised sequence. Stair stepping involves stepping on to and off a 35 cm Reebok exercise bench, repeatedly. Each exercise modality will be conducted following a high-intensity interval protocol (4 x 60 seconds of exercise interspersed with 60 seconds of rest). During each exercise bout participants will be encouraged to exercise at an intensity that elicits a heart rate of ≥85% of maximum, which will always be followed by 60 seconds of passive recovery. Participants will complete a 5 minute warm-up and a 2 minute cool down and stretch after the exercise bouts have been completed.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In each of the three sessions a different exercise modality will be conducted, in a randomised sequence. Stair climbing involves continuously ascending the stairs located in a public access staircase. Each exercise modality will be conducted following a high-intensity interval protocol (4 x 60 seconds of exercise interspersed with 60 seconds of rest).
During each exercise bout participants will be encouraged to exercise at an intensity that elicits a heart rate of ≥85% of maximum, which will always be followed by 60 seconds of passive recovery. Participants will complete a 5 minute warm-up and a 2 minute cool down and stretch after the exercise bouts have been completed.</description>
