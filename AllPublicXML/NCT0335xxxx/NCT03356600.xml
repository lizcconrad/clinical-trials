    <description>The Mini-mental state examination checklist includes 30 problems. Answer the correct question, get 1 points, answer wrong or answer not know, get 0 points, the scale of the total score is 0-30. If the score is 27-30 points, cognitive function is normal; if the score is less than 27, there is cognitive dysfunction. If the score is 21-26 points, there is a mild cognitive impairment. If the score is 10-20 points, there is moderate cognitive impairment. If the score is 0-9 points, there is severe cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>The COWA tests verbal fluency and executive function.Within 1 minutes, the subjects say how many words contain one word or within the specified category, each acceptable word counts 1 points, and the repeated words are scored without repetition. The higher the score, the better the function.</description>

    <time_frame>these neurocognitive function tests assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R assesses aspects of verbal learning and memory, including immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition.In the HVLT-R test, the range of learning score and delayed recall score was 0-12 points, and the greater the score, the better the function.</description>

    <description>Apatinib:
Within 1 week before radiotherapy, the dose of Apatinib were 500mg/daily .During radiotherapy,the dose of Apatinib were 250mg/daily.
After radiotherapy, if the subject did not have a level 3 or above adverse reaction, investigators consider increasing doses to 500mg.
Radiotherapy:
The subjects with 1 to 4 metastases receive stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic radiation therapy ,and the subjects with more than 4 metastases receive stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole-brain radiation therapy.</description>
