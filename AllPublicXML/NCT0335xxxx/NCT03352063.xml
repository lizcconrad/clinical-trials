  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged sitting has been shown to effect the response to a high fat tolerance test (HFTT)
      after acute exercise. This study will evaluate the effect of prolonged sitting on response to
      a HFTT after a short term training period.

    <description>Subjects will complete a short term training protocol while sitting &gt;11 hours per day. This training will be preceded by a VO2max test to aid in setting the correct intensity for training. Subjects will be asked to complete three high fat tolerance tests. One to establish a baseline, the second to determine the acute effects of training, and a third at the completion of training to determine the cumulative effect of exercise training.</description>
