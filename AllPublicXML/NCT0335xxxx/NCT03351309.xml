    <description>Qualitative interviews with a subset of TCBT participants A subset of TCBT participants will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews about their perception of the TCBT intervention. Following the first 5 participants randomized to TCBT, each Veteran randomized to the TCBT intervention will be given the opportunity to participate in a qualitative interview (until 8 interviews are completed). Qualitative interviews will be conducted over the telephone and audio-recorded for transcription. Each interview will take approximately 15 - 25 minutes.</description>

    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale measures endorsement/symptoms of generalized anxiety.
The scores for each individual question range from 0 to 3 (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day). A total score can range from 0-21.
A score of 5 is a cut-off for mild anxiety, 10 is a cut-off for moderate anxiety, and 15 is a cut-off for severe anxiety. Higher values represent worse outcomes.
To compute a total score, all items with endorsements of 1 or greater are added together for a composite score of 0-21.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36
36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36) measures eight constructs related to quality of life:
Physical functioning
Role limitations due to physical health
Role limitations due to emotional problems
Energy/fatigue
Emotional well-being
Social functioning
Pain
General health
Each item is recoded to reflect score ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 is the least favorable and 100 is the most favorable. Each item corresponds to a specific construct. Items associated with each construct are averaged to retrieve a construct score. Scores are then converted into z-scores.
Higher z-scores reflect a more favorable health status.</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Brief satisfaction items regarding TCBT intervention (Only for participants assigned to receive TCBT)
Overall, how satisfied are you with the TCBT?
How satisfied are you with the TCBT for reducing your pain or helping you cope with your pain?
How satisfied are you with the TCBT for improving your functioning? (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied).</description>
