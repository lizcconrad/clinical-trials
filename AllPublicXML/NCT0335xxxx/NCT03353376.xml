    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, non blinded, one center (University hospital) trial, 60
      patients (28 with type 1 and 32 with type 2 diabetes) with a mean duration of diabetes of
      22.5 Â± 11.7 years were randomly assigned to group (6 patients per group) or individual usual
      care for one year. Primary end-point included change in Hba1c and visits to out-patients
      clinics, secondary endpoint included change in body mass index, blood pressure levels, waist
      circumference, non HDL Cholesterol, diabetes related and quality of life questionnaires and
      hospitalizations.
