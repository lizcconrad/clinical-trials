  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20% of all cancers may be associated with a bacterial or viral infection. In some
      instances, the infection may be one of the reasons why the cancer developed in the first
      place. One such example is infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the development
      of cervical or oral cavity cancer.

      A viral infection that is chronic may not cause a person symptoms, and may be able to escape
      detection by a person's own immune system. One of the medications being studied in this
      clinical trial (Valproic acid) may be able to unmask a chronic viral infection from a
      person's own immune system, therefore making the virus susceptible to attack by the immune
      system. In this study Valproic acid is being combined with an immune therapy, Avelumab.
      Avelumab is an antibody that targets a person's own immune cells, or lymphocytes. Lymphocytes
      must be activated to fight infections or cancer, but after activation they are deactivated.
      Avelumab prevents the deactivation of a lymphocyte, in effect &quot;turning off the off-switch.&quot;
      This leads to a re-energizing of a person's immune system, hopefully leading to an attack by
      the immune system on a person's cancer.

      Avelumab is known to be an effective treatment for a variety of cancers, although it has not
      yet been tested in all cancers. By combining Valproic acid, a treatment which targets the
      virus that contributed to the development of this type of cancer with Avelumab the
      investigators hope to enhance the ability of Avelumab to restore the body's own immune
      defense against the cancer.

             HPV-associated disease.

          -  Patients must be capable of providing consent to enrolment and treatment.

          -  Patients with a performance status of ECOG 0-1(51) will be eligible for enrolment (see

             subject.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
