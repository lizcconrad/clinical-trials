  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a gastrointestinal acute Graft versus host disease (GVHD) received a
      first-line standard treatment of corticosteroids. For patients who do not respond or progress
      after an initial response have a high mortality. There is an interest in identifying
      effective second line therapy for these patients corticosteroid-resistant acute GVHD. Fecal
      microbiota transfer might be a beneficial treatment in this clinical situation with a poor
      prognosis and limited therapeutic options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who develop a first episode of Stage 3 or 4 Gastro-intestinal Acute
             Graft-versus-Host (GI-aGVHD) with gut predominance (Przepiorka D, 1995), resistant to
             a first line therapy with steroids (lack of improvement after 5 days or progression
             after 3 days of treatment with corticosteroids at 2 mg/Kg methylprednisolone
             equivalent dose) (SR GI-aGVHD)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Patients able to have a minimum of 12 hours discontinuation of systemic antibiotics in
             order to perform the allogeneic FMT (for patient who received antibiotics MaaT Pharma
             advises against the use of antibiotics (commonly used) with significant digestive
             excretion (for example but not limited to: metronidazol, ceftriaxone, tazocillin,
             levofloxacin))

          -  Signature of informed and written consent by the subject or by the subject's legally

          -  Other systemic drugs than corticosteroids for GVHD treatment (including
             extra-corporeal photopheresis). Drugs already being used for GVHD prevention (eg.
             calcineurin inhibitors) are allowed.
