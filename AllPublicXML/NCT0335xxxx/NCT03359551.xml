  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroideremia (CHM) is a rare, X-linked recessive, degenerative disease of the retina which
      begins in childhood with loss of night vision and gradually progresses to legal blindness by
      the fifth decade. There are no approved treatements for CHM and the disease is poorly
      characterised given its rare nature and scarscity of available data. The objective of this
      study is to collect natural history data from a large cohort of CHM patients in order to
      evaluate possible efficacy measures that could be utilised in future interventional trials of
      novel therapies.
