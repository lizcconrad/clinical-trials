          4. According to contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, with solitary tumor smaller than 5 cm in
             diameter; with multiple tumors (no more than 3 masses), the largest dimension is less
             than 3 cm;

          9. The patients are volunteered for the study, sign informed consent form and cooperate
             with Investigator to collect data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiographic testing shows cancer cells have not been eliminated after four weeks of
             Local Ablation;

          2. The occurrence of embolism occurs in large blood vessels on liver, patients with
             extrahepatic metastatic of HCC or liver transplantation;

          3. Patients who are about to receive or already received chemotherapy or molecular
             targeted therapy;

          4. Patients who are about to receive TACE treatment for HCC;
