  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of employing
      an experiential training approach that targets community mental health therapists' attitudes
      toward and use of exposure therapy. In addition to assessing attitudes and use of exposure
      therapy, the study will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention,
      and assessment processes, as well as the acceptability of the experiential training relative
      to training-as-usual. To assess these outcomes, community therapists will be randomized to
      experiential training or training-as-usual. A subset of therapists from each arm will also
      complete qualitative interviews to further assess acceptability of the training approaches.
      The training-as-usual condition will include a traditional one-day workshop that focuses on
      principles of exposure and incorporates active learning strategies. The experiential training
      will include a one-day workshop that teaches principles of exposure and has therapists
      themselves undergo a one-session phobia treatment for spiders. Therapists in both training
      conditions will be asked to attend weekly consultation phone calls for a three-month period
      following the trainings.

    <time_frame>Pre-training; 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale is a 21-item self-report measure that assesses therapists' negative beliefs about exposure therapy. Agreement with each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (disagree strongly) to 4 (agree strongly), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicate more negative beliefs about exposure.</description>

    <description>The ETCUS measures therapist-reported use of nine exposure therapy procedures, such as providing the rationale for exposure therapy, creating a hierarchy, and completing in-vivo exposures.</description>
