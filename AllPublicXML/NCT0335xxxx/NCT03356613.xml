  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to develop paramedical research culture, the paramedical staff need adapted tools
      and methods. The GenI project (Research ideas generation) has for main objective the design
      and validation of a tool that will allow the identification of paramedical research ideas.
      This tool will be built based on paramedical staff views. Our hypothesis is that the use of
      the GenI tool will help to detect research ideas in paramedical health care that could lead
      to research projects.

    <description>Each research idea will be evaluated by an independent expert group on the &quot;utility, innovation and feasibility&quot; aspects (likert in 4 points) in order to compare the research ideas generated by paramedical groups (with the support of the GENI tool) and the research ideas generated by research experts groups.</description>
