    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BI
      409306 once daily compared with placebo given for 28 weeks in patients with schizophrenia on
      antipsychotic treatment. The study is designed to show superiority of BI 409306 over placebo
      in preventing relapse of schizophrenia symptoms.
