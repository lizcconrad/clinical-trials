  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter randomized-controlled trial in 3 tertiary care hospitals
      including Ramathibodi Hospital, Phramongkutklao Hospital and Rajavithi Hospital. The study
      involved screening of obstructive sleep apnea in high risk pregnancy during 1st and 2nd
      trimesters. Randomization to either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or usual
      antenatal care (ANC) until delivery will be done. Efficacy of CPAP on pregnancy outcome will
      be analysed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening for sleep disordered breathing (Respiratory disturbance index, RDI ≥ 5 events/hour)
      with type 2 sleep test will be performed in eligible subjects during early1st trimester (&lt;16
      weeks). Repeat sleep study will be done if the RDI in 1st trimester is less than 5. If the
      subjects meet the inclusion criteria without any of the exclusion criteria, randomization
      into either receiving CPAP treatment or usual ANC will be done. The pressure of CPAP machine
      is determined using autoCPAP machine algorithm at 90 percentile. Adjustment of CPAP machine
      is repeated at 24-28 week gestations. Subjects in both groups received standard usual care
      during ANC and outcomes were measured with similar case record forms.

The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form an acronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration). Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.</description>
