      Assessment of the quality of follicular fluid and early embryo via chemical markers.

      The selectin of an embryo for transfer is currently based on detailed morphological
      assessment and scoring system. morhpokinetics introduced recently to IVF laboratories can
      define annotations and provide an algorithm for optimal cleavage rates and embryonic
      development. however more data and validations are requested when it comes to choosing the
      best single embryo from a cohort of available similarly graded embryos. Consequently,
      non-invasive quantitative methods for embryo selection prior to transfer have been sought. In
      the current study metabolic profile of follicular fluid and the embryos produced in IVF
      procedure will be assessed

    <description>High correlation between the studied markers and the currently used morphological assessment of the quality of embryos and oocytes will define the potential of the studied markers as a mean for embryo and quality assessment.
The current study is pioneer in the field of assessment of embryos and follicles and this group of markers have not been studied previously, therefore we prefer not to clarify more details</description>
