  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a low-intensity,
      patient-centered activity regimen (PCAR) that prioritizes education and communication over a
      12-week period in advanced stage lung cancer patients. The primary outcomes will include
      number of patients increasing their overall step count over the study period and adherence to
      step count recommendations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life (QoL), dyspnea,
      and depression scores before and after the intervention as well as a patient feedback
      questionnaire (to guide further interventions). The goals are to increase overall step count
      and obtain adherence of &gt;50% of participants.

    <description>Exercise Adherence will be defined as (the number of weeks a subject follows the activity prescription)/(the number of &quot;usable&quot; weeks). A week is considered &quot;usable&quot; if 5/7 days of step counts are available, and days with &lt;200 steps/day are considered not usable.</description>

    <time_frame>change from pre- to post-intervention (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via self-report using the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, Version 3). The scale measures quality of life in 30 questions with 15 subscales:
5 functional scales (subscale range 0-100; higher score = better functioning) that measure physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning.
3 symptom scales (subscale range 0-100; higher score = better functioning) that measure fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain;
6 scales, each with range 0-100; higher score = higher symptom burden, that measure dyspnea, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties.
1 global health status/Quality of Life (QoL) scale, range 0-100, higher score = better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre- to post-intervention (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via self-report using the Modified Medical Research Council. Dyspnea Scale, a single-item scale scored 0-4; higher score indicates worse dyspnea.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre- to post-intervention (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via self-report using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Depression Module (PHQ-9). a 9-item questionnaire that assesses depressive symptoms over the preceding two weeks. Each item is scored 0-3 (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot;; 1 = &quot;Several days&quot;; 2 = &quot;More than half of days&quot;; 3 = &quot;Nearly every day&quot;). A total score is calculated by taking the sum of questions 1-9, and a higher score indicates worse depression.</description>
