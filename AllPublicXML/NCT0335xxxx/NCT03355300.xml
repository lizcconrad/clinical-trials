    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed all activities through Visit 6 (End of Study) of INS011-17-103.

          2. Patient and/or parent(s)/caregiver(s) fully comprehend the informed consent form (ICF)
             and assent form, understand all study procedures, and can communicate satisfactorily

             regulations, and local requirements.

          3. A female patient is eligible to participate in the study if she is premenarchal, or of
             childbearing potential with a negative urine pregnancy test at the Screening Visit. If
             sexually active, she must agree to either complete abstinence from intercourse or use
             acceptable methods of contraception throughout the study and for 4 weeks after
             completion of study participation or discontinuation from investigational product.

          4. A sexually active male patient or partner of enrolled patient must be willing to use
             acceptable methods of contraception throughout the study and for 4 weeks after
             completion of study participation or discontinuation from investigational product.

          5. In the opinion of the investigator, the parent(s)/caregiver(s) is (are) willing and
             able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedules, including venipuncture,
             and the visit schedules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or parent(s)/caregiver(s) have daily commitments during the study duration
             that would interfere with attending all study visits.

          2. Experienced an anoxic episode related to study drug requiring resuscitation during
             their previous study.

          3. Developed an adverse event thought to be related to CBD in the previous study and for
             whom the Investigator determines that continuing treatment with CBD would not be in
             the best interest of the patient.

          4. Evidence of other clinically significant disease such as unstable hepatic,
             hematological, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immunological, or pulmonary
             diseases or ongoing malignancies.

          5. Compromised respiratory function or severe respiratory insufficiency.

          6. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values within the past 14 days.

          7. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is unsuitable in any other way to
             participate in this study.
