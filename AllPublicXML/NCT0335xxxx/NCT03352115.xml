  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, and
      post-operative pain management is a challenge for otolaryngologists. A 2013 black-box warning
      on codeine following tonsillectomy has drawn attention to potential concerns with all
      narcotics in these patients, and many surgeons try to avoid narcotics. The use of
      intra-operative corticosteroids has been proven to be beneficial in reducing post-operative
      morbidity, and some small studies have shown possible benefit to the use of post-operative
      oral corticosteroids as well, although the results of these studies are mixed. To date, no
      one has looked at whether the use of post-operative oral steroids may reduce or eliminate the
      need for narcotics. We aim to determine whether the addition of oral steroids to our
      post-operative pain regimen can reduce the need for narcotic pain medications.

    <textblock>
      I. Background

      Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States with the
      predominant indications being obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis1. While it is
      usually performed on young and otherwise healthy children, postoperative morbidity is
      ubiquitous occurring in nearly 20% of children with the most frequent complaints being throat
      pain, otalgia, fever, poor oral intake, nausea and emesis, and secondary hemorrhage2.
      Historically, Tylenol with codeine was commonly used for pain control post-operatively in
      children. However, in 2013 the FDA issued a black box warning on codeine following
      tonsillectomy due to reports of multiple deaths and morbidities in children3. Since that
      time, there has been increased awareness of the dangers of opioids in general and many
      surgeons are trying to minimize or eliminate the prescription of opioids to children
      following tonsillectomy.

      It has been found by multiple studies that intra-operative use of steroids during
      tonsillectomy has beneficial effects in children. A Cochrane Review updated in 2011 presented
      a meta-analysis of 19 randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded studies and concluded
      that routine use of a single intra-operative dose of dexamethasone reduces post-operative
      morbidity. The studies found a decrease in post-operative emesis and a higher likelihood of
      advancement to a soft or solid diet on the first postoperative day. Eight of the studies used
      the Visual Analog Scale (ranging from 0-10), which found a reduction of post-operative pain
      of more than one point. No adverse effects related to intra-operative corticosteroid use were
      reported and a single dose of steroids is believed to be virtually harmless4. Despite the
      utility of corticosteroids intra-operatively, there is currently a paucity of studies
      investigating the potential effects of a short post-operative course of oral (PO) steroids on
      pain control and other morbidities of tonsillectomy. Of the available literature, a short
      course of prednisolone of up to 1 week in patients without specific contraindications was
      found to provide a significant benefit in pain relief, return to normal diet, return to
      normal activity, and re-epithelialization of the tonsillar fossae, in an assessment of 69
      pediatric patients5. Another study by Macassey et al. compared 5 days of oral prednisolone to
      placebo by assessing pain, nausea, vomiting, return to normal function, and sleep duration
      and quality. This study did not find a difference in any of the study parameters between the
      two groups6. To our knowledge, there have been no studies specifically looking at how the
      addition of a post-operative course of oral steroids impacts patient's necessity for narcotic
      pain medications.

      Due to conflicting reports and a general paucity of literature to support or refute routine
      postoperative steroid use in children following tonsillectomy, it will be useful to determine
      the efficacy of this otherwise ubiquitous and benign medication on pain control, time to
      return to normal diet, dehydration, post-operative infections, and post-operative bleeding in
      our patient cohort; these are the most common complaints and complications following
      tonsillectomy surgery. Therefore, similar to the above-referenced studies5,6 we will be
      evaluating all of these endpoints in our patients. However, in addition to these endpoints we
      will also look at the need for post-operative narcotics. Given the recent black box warning
      on Tylenol with codeine use in children following tonsillectomy3, many surgeons are
      understandably hesitant to prescribe any narcotics to children following tonsillectomy. Our
      study will evaluate the potential role of steroids to reduce or possibly even eliminate the
      need to prescribe these children narcotics.

      II. Objectives

      We propose a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study comparing the
      post-tonsillectomy morbidity and analgesic/narcotic use in children 4 to 18 years old
      receiving a 5 day-course of oral prednisolone versus those receiving placebo. We plan to
      approach patients and parents preoperatively to assess their willingness to participate in
      the study. Following tonsillectomy, parents will be asked to complete a patient log,
      detailing the child's post-operative course. This log will document the quantity of narcotics
      and other pain medications used, daily pain assessments using the validated Wong-Baker facies
      tool, return to regular oral diet, and return to regular activities. Complications such as
      dehydration, post-operative infection, and post-operative bleeding requiring an emergency
      room visit will also be assessed in a post-operative survey, which will be completed at the
      post-operative office visit.

      Because the use of a single dose of intraoperative steroids is a widely accepted practice, we
      believe there is a value in investigating whether a short postoperative course of steroids
      adds further benefit to a child's post-tonsillectomy course, especially because it is a safe
      and inexpensive intervention, and may reduce the need for post-operative narcotics. Given the
      significant concerns with narcotics in this cohort of patients and the recent black-box
      warning, there is great interest among pediatric otolaryngologists in minimizing narcotic
      use. This study has significant potential to change the paradigm of post-operative pain
      management after tonsillectomy to minimize or even avoid the use of narcotics.

      The primary endpoints for this study include frequency and total amount of narcotic and
      non-narcotic pain medication required, time to return to normal diet, and time to return to
      normal activity. Secondary endpoints will include the rates of post-operative emergency
      department visits, dehydration, and post-operative tonsillar hemorrhage.

      III. Methods

      We propose a prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled control trial to assess
      the effects of oral prednisolone on the post-operative course following tonsillectomy.

      Recruitment At the pre-operative visit, a member of the patient care team (resident, nurse
      practitioner, or attending physician within the Pediatric Otolaryngology department) will
      assess the willingness of the patient and parents to hear more about the study. Study details
      will be made available to the parents and child, with the understanding that their child will
      be randomized into a group receiving post-operative steroids or a group who receives placebo.
      It will be emphasized that study participation is voluntary and without participation
      children will receive our current standard of care, which is a single intra-operative dose of
      dexamethasone but no post-operative oral steroids. It will be made clear that the parents are
      able to withdraw from the study at any time. If they agree to take part in the study, parents
      will be asked to record all pain medications taken by their child in the five days following
      surgery as well as keep a record of diet and activity. Informed consent will be obtained for
      participation in the study at the first visit. Parents will also be asked to bring the study
      medication bottle and the pain medication bottle to the follow-up visit to ensure compliance.
      A survey assessing secondary endpoints will be completed at the post-operative follow-up
      visit. Study details and patient logs will be available in English only.

      Subjects Pediatric patients aged 4-18 undergoing tonsillectomy at the Children's Hospital of
      Michigan by Dr. Bianca Siegel, Dr. Nathan Gonik, or Dr. Mallory O'Niel will be eligible to
      participate in this study.

       12. Pregnancy

      Pre-operative Visit (Visit 1) If the patient and family agree to participate after an
      explanation of the project (see Recruitment above), and meets all criteria for participation,
      they will be enrolled in the study. An informed consent document, oral assent document (if
      applicable), and written assent document (if applicable) will then be obtained and a copy
      will be given to the patient and/or parent. Only one parent will be required to provide
      consent for the surgery and for participation in the study as typically only one parent
      accompanies children to our clinic. A physical examination will be performed to note the
      patient's tonsil size. Pre-operative sleep study findings in patients with suspected
      obstructive sleep apnea will be recorded as well. Any concurrent medications will be
      recorded. The patient's information will be sent to the participating pharmacist for
      randomization into an experimental arm (5 day course of post-operative oral steroids -
      prednisolone) and a control arm (5 day course of post-operative ORA-Sweet © placebo)
      Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio at Visit 1 by the participating pharmacist,
      using www.randomization.com. The patients as well as the surgeons and the remainder of the
      research team will be blinded to the randomization. Prescription documents for the study
      medication and placebo will be created by the participating pharmacist prior to the start of
      the study. Once a patient is enrolled, a prescription will be sent to the participating
      pharmacist who will then randomize the patient to receive either prednisolone or the
      equivalent volume of OraSweet © solution to serve as a placebo. Details of randomization as
      well as which patients received the study medication will be kept by the participating
      pharmacist and can be available for review by the institutional review board or any governing
      agencies at their request.

      Day of Surgery (Visit 2) On the day of surgery all patients will receive a single
      intravenous, weight-based dose of dexamethasone intra-operatively, as this is the current
      standard of care. Tonsil size will, once again be noted at this visit and updates to
      concurrent medications will be recorded. Any adverse events intraoperatively or immediately
      post-operatively will be recorded. In female patients over age 9, it is hospital policy that
      the patient undergoes a urine pregnancy test prior to undergoing surgery. This will be
      recorded and, if positive, the patient will not undergo surgery and will be disqualified from
      the study. After surgery, the participating pharmacist will then deliver the appropriate
      volume of study medication (1mg/kg/day prednisolone divided BID (twice per day)) or for 5
      days post-operatively to start on post-operative day 1. The control group will receive the
      same volume of OraSweet© placebo also to start on post-operative day 1. Each group will
      receive an additional quantity of 3 doses in the event of emesis and a need to redose.
      Parents will then be asked to monitor their child's post-operative pain, oral intake,
      activity, and quantity of pain medication given for 5 days using patient logs created for
      this research endeavor (attached). The patient will then be discharged home or admitted for
      overnight observation if pre-operative sleep study scores indicate a severe obstructive sleep
      apnea (AHI &gt;10) based on recommendations by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and
      Neck Surgery Foundation or at the surgeon's discretion.

      Post-operative visit (Visit 3) The first follow up visit will occur 2 weeks after surgery. At
      this visit, we will collect the patient logs used by the parents as well as the study
      medication bottles to ensure compliance or to determine continued eligibility in the study.
      At this visit, we will perform a physical examination to ensure healing of the wounds as well
      as record any adverse events and other, concurrent medications. Parents will also be asked to
      complete a brief survey, asking about the post-operative course and any complications
      (attached). We will then transfer the paper patient log recordings into an electronic format
      kept securely on the secure DMC server. Once statistical power has been reached, we will use
      these data to evaluate whether a 5-day course of post-operative steroids improves
      post-operative pain and decreases time to normal activity and oral intake. If patients
      develop any postoperative complications, the standard of care for that complication will be
      undertaken.

      Medication Details On the day of surgery, medication will be prepared for the patients by the
      participating pharmacist, which the parents will receive in the recovery room. The medication
      bottle will either contain 15 mg/5 mL prednisolone elixir (Prednisolone group) or ORA-Sweet ©
      Syrup (Placebo group). The medication will be provided in a marked bottle by the pharmacy.
      The medication will be supplied specifically for this study and will be stored at room
      temperature in the investigational drug room in the inpatient pharmacy until needed.
      Medications will be ordered specifically for this study and will have its own medication lot
      independent from the regular hospital supply. A weight-based dose of 1 mg/kg/day of
      prednisolone elixir rounded to the nearest whole number and divided BID (twice per day ) for
      5 days will be given with a maximal dose of 60 mg per day for the intervention group. This
      dosing schedule is similar to other common pediatric uses of prednisolone including acute
      asthma attacks. The placebo group will take the equivalent volume of OraSweet © Syrup
      placebo. An additional volume of 3 doses will be provided to ensure proper redosing in the
      event of emesis. Marked oral syringes will be provided by the pharmacy for ease of dosing.
      The study medication or placebo is to begin on post-operative day 1 and will continue twice
      daily through post-operative day 5. It will be suggested that all medications be taken with
      food to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Other post-operative medications will be
      standardized and all will receive oxycodone elixir (0.05 mg/kg every 4 hours (Q4hr) as
      needed), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg every 4 hours (q4hr) with a maximum dose of 500mg per dose)
      and ibuprofen (10 mg/kg every 6 hours (Q6hr with a maximum of 400mg per dose) to be used
      regularly. No post-operative antibiotics will be given as this is currently recommended
      against by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Parents
      will be advised to use acetaminophen and ibuprofen as primary medications for pain control,
      and to use oxycodone only if inadequate pain relief with alternating acetaminophen and
      ibuprofen.

      Sample Size Determination Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate for any
      differences between the control and experimental groups using an analysis of covariance
      design. For a 2 group design with 2 covariates and a medium-to-large effect size (alpha
      0.05), a sample of about 80-180 participants would be needed to achieve a power of 0.80 or
      above. Therefore in order to allow for some drop-out, our goal is to achieve a sample size of
      200 participants.

      Patient logs Attached are the patient logs that are to be used for this research study. Aside
      from the Wong-Baker Faces scale, the remainder of the items in the patient logs to be used
      are non-validated as no such tool currently exists for use of this purpose. Parents will be
      asked to fill out a daily log for 5 days post-operatively focusing on aspects of pain
      control, medication administration, activity level, and oral intake. Parents will be asked to
      evaluate the child's pain on each post-operative day. Pain will be assessed in all patients
      using the validated Wong-Baker FACES scale, which has been incorporated into our study
      patient logs. Parents will be given a packet with written instructions and space to record
      the child's pain level on each post-operative day, as well as space to record their pain
      medication administration. They will also be given an activity and diet diary to monitor the
      child's activity and diet.

      Post-operative Survey Parents will be given a survey to complete at the post-operative visit
      (Visit 3). The survey will be completed while they are at the office, so that we can clarify
      or ask any further questions as needed. The survey will assess general compliance with the
      study, as well as ask about any complications, including bleeding, ED visits, or hospital
      admissions. This will allow us to capture any potential visits to outside emergency rooms
      which we would not otherwise be aware of. If the parents indicates &quot;yes&quot; to the question
      about whether they visited an emergency room, further details will be elucidated.

      Data analysis Outcome measures will include: the amount of post-operative narcotics required
      in the 5 day post-operative period, amount of other non-narcotic analgesic medications
      (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) required in the 5 day post-operative period, time to return to
      normal activity, and time to return to normal diet. Complications such as post-operative
      bleeding, dehydration that requires an emergency department visit, and post-operative
      infection requiring antibiotics will be monitored as well. As study subjects with
      complications return to the Children's Hospital of Michigan Emergency Department, the study
      team will be notified by the on call otolaryngology resident and appropriate measures can be
      undertaken. Complication rates will be compared between the two study groups.

      Drug Safety Monitoring Plan Adverse effects associated with post-operative oral steroids or
      complications from tonsillectomy will be monitored via the research team using the data
      collection sheets. During the period that the study is ongoing, Dr. Bianca Siegel will
      compile all information on adverse events every three months beginning after the first 20
      patients. The pharmacy will reveal the randomization groups and statistical analysis will be
      performed to determine any significant difference in adverse events between the two groups.
      Statistical analysis will be performed by a Wayne State University biostatistician. We will
      monitor specifically for serious adverse events such as dehydration or post-operative
      tonsillar hemorrhage. If a statistically significant increase in serious adverse events is
      found between the study group and the placebo group, the study will be aborted. We will also
      abort the study if there is a non-statistically significant difference, but a noticeable
      trend of increased adverse events in the study group. Early in the study, our small sample
      size may result in a lack of statistical significance despite a large increase in relative
      risk of serious adverse events.

      IV. Benefits

      The potential physical benefits to a subject participating in this study include:

        -  Decreased narcotic use

        -  A faster return to normal activity

        -  A faster return to normal diet

        -  Decreased post-tonsillectomy complication rates

        -  Improvement in severity or resolution of obstructive sleep apnea

        -  Improvement in rates or resolution of recurrent tonsillitis/pharyngitis

      The potential benefits to society include:

        -  Data-based information on the improvement of a normally very painful post-operative
           tonsillectomy course following administration of prednisolone, with decreased necessity
           for narcotic prescriptions

        -  The potential for a new standard of care for improving tonsillectomy surgical outcomes.

        -  Decreased costs to society from readmissions following tonsillectomy

      V. Risks Short-term corticosteroid use is general considered safe. The most common adverse
      reactions to steroids in the pediatric population include gastrointestinal upset,
      hyperactivity, agitation, mood swings, and insomnia (up to 10%). Other, more infrequent risks
      include adrenal suppression, delayed wound healing, glucose intolerance, myopathy, neuritis,
      and weight gain (1-5%). These adverse events typically resolve with the discontinuation of
      the corticosteroid. There are some reports of avascular necrosis of the hip, although these
      are exceedingly rare. Corticosteroids, including prednisolone, are used for a variety of
      pulmonary, rheumatological, and musculoskeletal pathologies in children and have stood the
      test of time for safety and efficacy. These risks are mitigated by the short duration of use
      of the medication, the encouragement to take the medication with food, the recommended dosing
      schedule, and proper preoperative counseling and education regarding administration of
      prednisolone.

      As a part of this study and the current standard of care following tonsillectomy at DMC
      Children's Hospital of Michigan, subjects will be prescribed acetaminophen (Tylenol ®) and
      ibuprofen (Motrin ® or Advil ®) if acetaminophen is not tolerated. Oxycodone will also be
      prescribed for additional pain coverage as needed as a normal part of the post-operative
      course. A list of the more common and serious risks of each of the medications is as follows:

        -  Acetaminophen: swelling, itching, liver failure (very uncommon)

        -  Ibuprofen: nausea, vomiting, swelling, ringing in the ears (3-9%)

        -  Oxycodone: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, sedation

      There are risks associated with undergoing tonsillectomy including, but not limited to,
      dehydration, bleeding, infection, trouble swallowing, painful swallowing, sore throat,
      temporary voice changes, difficulty breathing, and, very rarely, death. These risks can be
      lessened by good oral hydration and adequate pain management after surgery.

      Social risks are unlikely to occur during the course of this study, but there is a small risk
      of breach of confidentiality. In order to maintain your child's confidentiality, all of their
      identifiable information will be kept separate from study documents.
