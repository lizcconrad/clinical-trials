  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the possible effects that a motor limitation at the
      peripheral level might have on the ability to visually discriminate others' actions.

      Previous literature has shown that specific motor skills (motor expertise) facilitate the
      visual discrimination of domain-specific actions, and that these motor experts' superior
      abilities might be mediated by areas not only responsible for the visual recognition of
      movements (as it happens in non-expert subjects) but also involved in motor planning.
      Similarly, impairment in the motor system due to neurological damage modulates not only the
      ability to perform movements but also the ability to discriminate and predict the temporal
      course of observed actions.

      Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that the motor representations of gait,
      despite being a hyper-learned motor pattern, might be subjected to modification as a result
      of an impairment of walking caused by a peripheral functional limitation in the lower limbs
      as the one characterizing orthopaedic patients who underwent a surgical operation for total
      knee arthroprosthesis. In this protocol, patients are thus required to perform visual
      discrimination tasks based on the observation of movements performed with either the upper or
      lower limbs, and their performance is expected to correlated with their functional
      impairments in movement execution.

      These results would indicate that the (in)ability to perform a movement might have an impact
      on its representation at the central level and on internal motion simulation capabilities,
      which also influence the ability to visual discriminate others' actions through
      action-perception transfer: this would suggest that rehabilitation in orthopaedic patients
      should take into account (and restore) such a central impairment in motor representations.
