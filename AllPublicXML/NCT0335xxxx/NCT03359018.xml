  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and unresectable high-grade
      osteosarcoma is dismal and unchanged over the last decades. We have already finished a
      prospective trial about apatinib for advanced osteosarcoma(NCT02711007) and find it has a
      objective response rate of aproximately 45% with median progression-free survival around 5
      months. Thus, the investigators explored apatinib activity together with anti-PD1 therapy in
      order to induce durable response in patients with relapsed and unresectable osteosarcoma
      after the failure of first-line or second-line chemotherapy.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, similar to pazopanib, but with a binding affinity 10 times to VEGFR-2
      comparing with pazopanib or sorafenib.

      SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients &gt;14 years, progressing after standard treatment, will be eligible to receive 250 or
      500 mg of apatinib once daily together with SHR-1210 3mg/kg (no more than 200mg) iv every 2
      weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free
      survival (PFS) at 4 months and overall survival(OS). Secondary objectives were clinical
      benefit rate (CBR), defined as no progression at 6 months and safety.
