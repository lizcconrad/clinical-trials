      Overall aim: To demonstrate that weight loss through vBloc Therapy in combination with usual
      care will achieve better glycemic control for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes than
      usual care alone.

      Duration: Participants will be asked to participate in a 12 month study that involves a
      baseline visit and research follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Sample Size: 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. Of these, 30 will be randomized
      to vBloc therapy and 30 will be randomized to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vBlocT2D study is a two arm, randomized, controlled, unblinded clinical trial in which 60
      adult patients with T2D with moderate to extreme obesity (BMI 35-45 kg/m2) and suboptimal
      glycemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7-10%) without significant diabetic
      complications, will be randomized to usual care alone (n=30) or vBloc therapy plus usual care
      (n=30) to assess the superiority of vBloc therapy plus usual care than standard usual care
      alone in improving diabetic control. The vBloc therapy will be delivered through an
      electrical and reversible vagal blocking device (the Maestro Rechargeable System) implanted
      using laparoscopic surgery. The device was approved by the FDA in 2015 for weight loss in
      adults with BMI 40-45 kg/m2, or BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 with one or more obesity-related co-morbid
      conditions. The study will recruit patients over a 12-month period and follow each individual
      for 12-months post intervention. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c at 12-months post
      randomization. The secondary outcomes are changes in weight, waist and hip circumferences,
      blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity and β-cell health measured through oral glucose
      tolerance testing, dietary intake, eating behaviors, physical activity, quality of life and
      potential circulating biomarkers. Medication use, clinical labs and adverse events will be
      compared as well.

    <description>The vBloc device will be placed using a laparoscopic procedure. The participants will be followed according to standard clinical practice and vBloc therapy protocol under the supervision of study surgeons. . Pre-operative testing will be conducted per surgeon's evaluation. Participants will receive weight management education according to the vBloc Therapy protocol.</description>
