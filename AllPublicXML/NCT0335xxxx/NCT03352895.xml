      Participants'll include 140 adult patients with CKD and receiving hemodialysis in our
      hospital, and divided them into 2 groups. Control group will receive placebo medication
      therapy; resveratrol group will receive oral resveratrol (100 mg per day). All participants
      will receive either treatment for 1year, and receive examinations of pure tone audiometry,
      speech reception thresholds, and speech discrimination score.

    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often suffered from hearing impairment,
      vertigo/dizziness, cognitive degeneration, cardiovascular diseases. In addition, compared to
      patients without CKD, the longevity of patients with CKD was also shorter. The mechanism
      underlying the complications of CKD were very complicated, but were generally associated with
      uremic toxins, tissue hypoxia, free radicals damages. Meanwhile, some co-morbidities, for
      example, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, would also worsen the
      complications of CKD. However, only limited methods were reported to have beneficial effects
      on renal function and its complications. For, example, controlling co-morbidities of CKD,
      avoiding nephrotoxic substances, and dialysis.

      Resveratrol, it could prevent deterioration of cardiovascular diseases and cancer
      progression. But, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on hearing impairment, tinnitus,
      vertigo/dizziness, cognitive degeneration, cancer development, death in patients with CKD
      were also unclear.

      This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of resveratrol on hearing impairment
      in patients with CKD by a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial design.

      Participants'll include 140 adult patients with CKD and receiving hemodialysis in our
      hospital, and divided them into 2 groups. Control group will receive placebo medication
      therapy; resveratrol group will receive oral resveratrol (100 mg per day). All patients will
      receive either treatment for 1year, and receive examinations of pure tone audiometry, speech
      reception thresholds, and speech discrimination score.
