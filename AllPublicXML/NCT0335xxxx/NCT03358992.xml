      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are insensitive in evaluating primary
      sarcoma originated from bone treated with chemotherapy or targeted therapy, which did not
      have the definition of measurement methods either. This study evaluates whether clinical
      imaging findings of sarcoma after preoperative chemotherapy correlate with tumor responses by
      pathological evaluation by Huvos classifications and develops reliable, quantitative,
      clinical response criteria.

      A total of 1570 lesions were evaluated by clinical imaging including X-ray, computed
      tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan or PET/CT preoperatively treated with
      chemotherapy. All patients had surgery in our center and get pathological evaluation by tumor
      necrosis rate. Statistical diversity analysis was performed by different pathological groups
      and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves，ROC were done to find the dividing clinical
      parameters (Cut-off values) to distinguish different pathological groups.The cut-off values
      of change rate of maximum diameters of tumor located in extremities were 86%, 50.7% and 0.02%
      for Huvos Ⅳ,Ⅲ,ⅡandⅠgroups. The differentiation was not obvious using bone scan to distinguish
      different pathological responses. And the cut-off value for SUVmax value for Huvos
      Ⅲ,ⅡandⅠgroups were 60.7% and 31.4%.After Multidisciplinary discussion in multiple sites of
      China, we finally designed a evaluation system based on our data. This study is desgined to
      prospectively compare the sensitivity and specificity of this Clinical evaluation of primary
      sarcoma originated from bone with other clinical evaluation system,such as RECIST 1.1, Choi
      and PERCIST.
