    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of an intravenous (IV)
      induction and subcutaneous (SC) maintenance administration of ustekinumab on the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of a cocktail of representative probe substrates of cytochrome P450
      (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2) in participants with moderate to
      severe Crohn's disease (CD).

          -  Participant must have a body weight in the range of 45 to 110 kilogram (kg) inclusive
             and have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2)
             inclusive

          -  Have moderate to severe CD or fistulizing CD of at least 3 months duration, with
             colitis, ileitis, or ileocolitis, confirmed at any time in the past by histology,
             and/or endoscopy

        For Healthy Volunteers

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening and Day-1

          -  If a woman of childbearing potential, she must have a negative serum beta-human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening; and a negative urine

        Exclusion Criteria For CD Participants

          -  Has complications of CD such as symptomatic strictures or stenoses, short gut
             syndrome, or any other manifestation that might be anticipated to require surgery in
             the next 3 months, could preclude the use of the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
             to assess response to therapy, would possibly confound the ability to assess the
             effect of treatment with ustekinumab, or would alter the absorption of the probe
             cocktail

          -  Currently has or is suspected to have an abscess. Recent cutaneous and perianal
             abscesses are not exclusionary if drained and adequately treated at least 3 weeks
             prior to baseline, or 8 weeks prior to baseline for intra-abdominal abscesses,
             provided that there is no anticipated need for any further surgery. Participants with
             active fistulas may be included if there is no anticipation of a need for surgery and
             there are currently no abscesses identified

        For Healthy Volunteers Participants

          -  Has an abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than (&gt;) 2* upper limit of normal
             (ULN)

          -  Has had major surgery (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 8 weeks before
             screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned
             during the time the participant is in screening or is expected to participate in the
             study (5 weeks)
