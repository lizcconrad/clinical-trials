      Evaluation for the range of smallest leg angulation with femoral artery and vein overlap with
      femoral central catheterization in pediatrics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In pediatrics, femoral vein catheterization often overlaps with the femoral artery.

      In this case, the risk of artery puncture is high, vein collapse when artery puncture 2nd,
      3rd times exceeds the success rate of catheterization becomes low. In previous study,
      comparing 0, 30, and 60 degrees with frog leg position, there was a study that the overlap
      was the smallest at 60 degrees. A previous study was a simple frog leg position and a study
      in fragmented predetermined angles. On a continuous measurement, we planned the study under
      the assumption that there is a more definite range of optimal angulation.

      Ultrasound probe in the state of Inguinal crease, we find a part without bifurcation of
      femoral artery and femoral vein in frog leg position(external rotation + flexion increase).
      Increase the leg angle and check the vein and arterie relations.

    <description>Ultrasound probe in the state of Inguinal crease, we find a part without bifurcation of femoral artery and femoral vein in frog leg position(external rotation + flexion increase).
We will increase the angle of the legs to find a range of arteries and veins that do not overlap. In case of overlap at all angles, we will find the overlapping range less than one-half of the arterial radius.</description>
