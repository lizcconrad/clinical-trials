      To investigate the regression model of positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by
      injecting and tracing carbon nanoparticles (CNs) in fusion node prior to NAC in patients with
      breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximate 20% of breast cancer survivors develop cancer-related arm lymphedema (BCRAL)
      which causes substantial functional impairment and psychological morbidity with no effective
      treatment. While the etiology of BCRL is complicated, the findings of a meta-analysis
      reviewing 72 studies demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), more extensive
      breast surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, being overweight or obese and physical inactivity
      were consistently associated with increased BCRAL risk. One of the primary factors, the
      extent of ALND is positively correlated with BCRAL. Over the past 20 years, the increasing
      number of patients with early-stage breast cancer can avoid the risk of arm lymphedema caused
      by ALND in cases where the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are negative for cancer cell. Sentinel
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a feasible and accurate tool
      in patients with operable T1-3, N1 and clinically node-negative breast cancer after therapy.
      Some studies, however, regarded the false negative rate (FNR) of 14% for SLNB after NAC as
      unacceptable when compared with the below 5% rate produced by the pioneers of SLNB. The
      placement of clips at the diagnosis of node-positive disease with removal of the clipped
      nodes during SLNB reduces the false negative rate FNR after NAC. Additionally, about 9%
      patients with positive node and T0-2 breast cancer have residual positive node in level III
      region after NAC. Therefore, it is essential to explore the regression model post NAC in
      patients who are node positive prior to NAC. Carbon nanoparticles (CNs) suspension contains
      nanosized polymeric carbon granules with an average diameter of 150 nm and ensures the
      passing of CNs through the lymphatic vessels (diameter 120-500 nm) rather than blood
      capillaries (diameter 20-50 nm) due to their molecular size. In the present study, CNs
      suspension was injected into fusion nodes guided by ultrasound in patients with advanced
      breast cancer before NAC, total ALND (from level I to III) and breast surgery were then
      performed after NAC. The distribution of CNs traced in axillary nodes was investigated to
      establish the regression model of positive nodes in relation to NAC.

    <description>After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whether positive nodes remission (transform to negative), from Level III to Level II, and from Level II to Level I. This means that if the nodes at Level I are negative, the nodes at Level II or Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level II are negative, the nodes at Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level III are positive, the nodes at Level I and Level II will be positive.</description>

    <description>If the chemotherapy is sensitive, the number of black-stained nodes will increase from Level I, Level II, to Level III. If the chemotherapy is resistance, the number of black-stained nodes will remain the original number or a little increasing locally.</description>
