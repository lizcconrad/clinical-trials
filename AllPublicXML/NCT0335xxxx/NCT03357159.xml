  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that combination of ATLG with PTCy in matched or mismatched
      unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will reduce acute and chronic GVHD
      incidence. Furthermore it will allow shortening of the length of post-transplantation
      immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) administration (currently administrated in
      addition to ATG as GVHD prophylaxis in daily common practice)

    <intervention_model_description>The patients will get conventional GVHD prophylaxis consisting of ATLG 15mg/kg total (5mg/kg day) on days -3 to -1 pre transplantation. Cyclophosphamide at 25mg/kg dose will be administrated at day +3 post infusion of the stem cell (SC) graft to the first 3 patients. If no &gt; grade II toxicity* occurs, the next 3 patients will receive cyclophosphamide at 25mg/kg dose at day +3 and +4 post SC graft infusion. If no &gt; grade II toxicity*occurs, the next 3 patients will receive cyclophosphamide at 37.5 mg/kg dose at day +3 and +4 post SC graft infusion. If no &gt; grade II toxicity* occurs, the next 3 patients will receive the target dose of cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/kg dose on day +3 and +4 post SC graft infusion. The residual 18 patients will receive cyclophosphamide at the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) established in the first part of the study. Patients will also receive GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a cyclosporine and cellcept starting on day +5 after transplantation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The study will include 2 phases. In the first phase escalated doses of post-transplant cyclophosphamide up to a maximal dose of 50 mg/kg administered on day +3 and +4 (target dose) will be added to a standard GVHD prophylaxis consisting of anti-human T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATLG, Grafalon®, formerly ATG-Fresenius S, Neovii Pharmaceuticals) 15mg/kg total (5mg/kg day) on days -3 to -1 pre transplantation in order to find the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in combination with pre-transplant immunosuppression by ATLG. The second phase will use the MTD cyclophosphamide dose identified in the first phase.</description>

             adequately co-operate

          5. Bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dl, transaminases &gt; 3 times upper normal limit
