  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional status depletion is associated with complications such as increased morbidity and
      mortality, worsening of patients' quality of life and increased length of hospital stay.
      Thus, nutritional therapy defined as the set of therapeutic procedures for maintenance or
      recovery of the nutritional status of the patient, becomes a procedure of extreme importance
      in the hospital setting. It should be carried out by an interprofessional team, in order to
      ensure adequate patient care. Aim: This study intends to evaluate the reality of Nutritional
      Therapy in Brazil, 18 and 14 years after the introduction of the resolution n ° 272 and the
      RDC n ° 63, respectively, regarding the practice of this important therapy and the existence
      of interdisciplinary teams. Method: Descriptive, observational and national study. In each
      Brazilian state was selected the capital, and drawn a city of average and other one of small
      size. Next, a public, private and university hospital in each municipality was randomly
      selected. Data collection will be done by means of a questionnaire, based on the Secretary of
      Sanitary Surveillance of the Ministry of Health resolution n ° 272 and the RDC n ° 63. The
      questionnaire will be applied by the researchers, and directed to the health professionals
      involved in the Nutritional Therapy practice in each of the selected hospitals.
