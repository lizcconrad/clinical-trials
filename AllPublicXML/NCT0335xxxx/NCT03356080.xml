    <description>Morphologic CR - patient independent of transfusions
Absolute neutrophil count(ANC) &gt;1000/ Microliter(mcL)
Platelets ≥100,000/mcL
No residual evidence of extramedullary disease
Cytogenetic CR - cytogenetics normal (in those with previously abnormal cytogenetics)
Molecular CR - molecular studies negative
CR with incomplete blood cells count recovery(CRi) - There are some clinical trials, particularly those that focus on the elderly or those with antecedent myelodysplasia, that include a variant of complete response referred to as CRi. This has been defined as &lt;5% marrow blasts, either ANC &lt;1000/mcL or platelets &lt;100,000/mcL, and transfusion independence but with persistence of cytopenia (usually thrombocytopenia).</description>

patients with CR after the first course of induction therapy (DLAAG) will continue to receive 1 cycle of consolidation therapy, while those with therapy failure will continue the second course of induction therapy. If CR is not achieved, quit the study.
Patients who achieve CR after induction therapy will be in accordance with the guidelines, such as the proposed active treatment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</description>
