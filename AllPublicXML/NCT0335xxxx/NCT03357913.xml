  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary transplantation is the reference treatment for chronic terminal respiratory failure
      in patients with cystic fibrosis. These are mainly bi-pulmonary transplants (cardiopulmonary
      transplants are exceptional). The annual number of pulmonary transplants in France for cystic
      fibrosis is about 90. In 2013, the transplant involves a total of more than 600 patients with
      cystic fibrosis. The average age at the time of the transplant is 28.5 years (2013 data,
      French cystic fibrosis register), compared to 58 years for patients transplanted to all
      pathologies. Cystic fibrosis accounts for 25% of adult bi-pulmonary grafts. Pediatric
      transplants are currently very rare.

      The median survival after pulmonary transplantation in cystic fibrosis is currently 8.5 years
      (and 10 years when considering patients surviving 3 months, ie excluding early mortality).
      Cystic fibrosis is the pathology associated with better survival after pulmonary
      transplantation given the young age of patients (28.5 years on average).

      The non-respiratory comorbidities associated with transplantation, all underlying pathologies
      combined, and referenced in the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung
      Transplantation (ISHLT) are: hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, Dyslipidemia,
      cancers. Their frequency increases with the survival time of transplanted patients. Cystic
      fibrosis is associated with non-respiratory comorbidities, the frequency of which increases
      with age - diabetes, osteoporosis, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy, neoplastic pathologies -
      and may become worse after transplantation.

      The main objective is to estimate the incidence of non-respiratory co-morbidities after lung
      transplantation in the cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis grafted in the Rhône-Alpes
      region.
