  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deprescribing is a systematic method of withdrawing potentially inappropriate or unnecessary
      medications and is warranted in the elderly due to the high prevalence of polypharmacy. In
      particular, symptomatic control medications, such as acid suppressants, laxatives and
      painkillers, are frequently prescribed and continued, though such medications are rarely
      needed on a long-term basis.

      Therefore, the study objectives were to determine the cost savings, effects and feasibility
      of implementing a systematic process of deprescribing medications for symptomatic management,
      namely, acid suppressants, laxatives, analgesics, and antiemetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deprescribing is a systematic process of identifying and withdrawing drugs, which are
      potentially or currently causing more harm than benefit to patients, based on each individual
      patient's condition, treatment goals and level of functioning. Deprescribing needs to be
      patient-centric with shared decision-making between patients or caregivers and the
      multidisciplinary care team. Five distinct steps of deprescribing have been elucidated, and
      they comprise: 1) performing a comprehensive patient medical/medication history; 2)
      considering the overall risk and appropriateness of drugs; 3) assessing possibility of and
      planning drug discontinuation; 4) initiating and documenting drug discontinuation; and 5)
      monitoring effects and providing patient support.

      Deprescribing is necessary in elderly aged 65 years and above due to the higher prevalence of
      polypharmacy and unnecessary and inappropriate medication use, compared to younger age
      groups. In Singapore, statistics from an acute restructured hospital in 2013 showed that 50
      percent or more of inpatients were discharged with at least five chronic medications.

      The discontinuation of medications has been trialled in earlier studies without causing
      significant adverse effects or symptom recurrence. Positive outcomes demonstrated include
      enhanced cognition, improved health and reduced falls. However, it is necessary to
      investigate the effects and feasibility of deprescribing in the present local setting, where
      healthcare perceptions, and associations between medication discontinuation and patient
      clinical outcomes may be different from other studied populations.

      Therefore, this randomized controlled intervention study was conducted in a community
      hospital in Singapore to determine the cost savings, effects and feasibility of implementing
      a systematic process of deprescribing medications for symptomatic management, namely, acid
      suppressants, laxatives, analgesics, and antiemetics.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was conducted as an open trial with two parallel groups. A total of 200 patients were randomized to an intervention (deprescribing) or control (usual care) group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization of patients was performed after recruitment by an independent administrator using GraphPad randomization sequence software ©2017. Doctors were free to make any changes to patients' medication regimens as they wished in both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pharmacists assessed the appropriateness of target symptomatic medications and potential for discontinuation. After discussion with pharmacists and consideration of patients' and caregivers' preferences regarding discontinuation or dose reduction, doctors would deprescribe these symptomatic medications. Symptom recurrence, adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWEs), and the need for drug re-initiation or initiation of new symptomatic control medications after deprescribing were monitored and documented in the 1st, 2nd and 6th weeks.</description>
