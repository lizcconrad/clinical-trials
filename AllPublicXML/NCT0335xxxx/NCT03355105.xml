  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of neuromuscular diseases, the weakness of the respiratory muscles makes
      difficult to manage periods of congestion due to a less effective cough. It exposes the
      patient to bronchial superinfections that may require hospitalization. The use of cough
      assistance is therefore essential in order to avoid acute situations such as bronchial
      superinfections. Mechanical Insuflation-Exsufflation (MI / E) is an instrumental technique
      commonly used by therapists in a hospital or at the patient's home in order to facilitate the
      airway mucus clearance. The choice of the pressure settings of the IM / E is a decisive point
      because it conditions the effectiveness of the generated cough. It'is important to take into
      account the presence of any collapse in the use of IM / E in order to ensure the most
      effective cough given by the patient. Actually, except the common impression of the
      physiotherapist and the patient, there is no &quot;simple&quot; way for detecting and objectifying the
      threshold of collapse in the upper airways.

      The aim of this study is to compare two modalities for the regulation of the level of the
      MI-E exsufflation, taking into account the presence of a collapse: a subjective &quot;S&quot;
      adjustment based on the clinical judgment of the therapist and the patient and an objective
      &quot;O&quot; adjustment based on the flow-volume curve generated during the cough.

      This is a bicentric, prospective crossover, randomized, open label trial. The study will
      focus on 50 adult patients with stable neuromuscular conditions, outside the congestion
      period requiring cough help.

      Patients will be recruited from among the neuromuscular disease patients followed for their
      respiratory management in the home ventilation unit of the Raymond Poincaré Hospital
      Intensive care Unit or in the Aincourt Neurological Rehabilitation Service attached to the
      Vexin Intercommunal Hospital Group.

      The cough help performed with the MI / E will be evaluated according to two conditions of
      adjustment of the exsufflation pressure: a subjective adjustment (modality S) and an
      objective adjustment (modality O), whose order will be randomized to control a phenomenon of
      tiredness causing confusion.

      A respiratory technician and two therapists will participate to the protocol. The therapist
      &quot;clinician&quot; and &quot;evaluator&quot; role will be defined by a draw.

      The protocol will take place during the same day of hospitalization in two stages:

        -  T0: validation of the eligibility criteria and inclusion of patients in the study.

        -  T1: evaluation of coughing performance according to the two modes of exsufflation
           pressure adjustment. Adjustment modality &quot;S&quot; according to the clinical impression of the
           &quot;clinician&quot; therapist and the patient, and the &quot;Cough Peak Expiratory Flow&quot; measured by
           the MI / E. Adjustment modality &quot;O&quot;: according to the analysis of the flow / volume
           curve measured using a spirometer and a pneumotachograph.

    <description>The exsufflation pressures will be progressively increased starting from -20 cmH2O with 10 cmH2O increments up. 3 coughing operations will be realised for each level, until obtention of 10% of AUC decrease or a PCF collapse of at least 10% over the last 2 levels and without exceeding -70 cmH2O. The selected landing will be the one allowing the largest PCF without presence of collapse. An intermediate bearing between 2 bearings may be tested in order to approach an optimum adjustment threshold less than 5 cmH2O.</description>
