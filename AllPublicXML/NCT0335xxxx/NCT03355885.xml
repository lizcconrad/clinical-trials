  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early-onset pneumonia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is frequent. An association
      between early-onset pneumonia and an increase in morbidity has been reported in this
      population. The diagnosis of early-onset pneumonia inpatients with out-of-hospital cardiac
      arrest may be challenging as diagnosis criteria are unspecific in this setting. On the other
      hand some studies have reported an association between early antibiotics and better prognosis
      in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest suggesting that early diagnosis and treatment
      of pneumonia would benefit to patients. Nonetheless, adminitration of antibiotics to any
      patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest would expose to antibiotic patients without
      infection and woould participate to increase in antibiotic resistance.

      Therefore, the PP-ACR study aims to evaluate the impact of a diagnosis algorithm including
      blinded sampling protected brushes on early-onset pneumonia treatment and patient prognosis
      after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
