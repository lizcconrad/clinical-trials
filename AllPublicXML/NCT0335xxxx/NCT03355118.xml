  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical observational study investigates perioperative oxygen consumption and delivery
      in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. The primary objectives are to characterise the
      perioperative oxygen delivery, consumption and potential markers of oxygen debt. Secondary
      objective is to estimate the correlation between oxygen delivery/consumption and
      postoperative outcomes to guide the design of a future trial.

      Background Intra- and postoperative fluid therapy aims to achieve or maintain pre-specified
      thresholds of oxygen delivery/blood flow which can be accomplished by use of fluids with or
      without inotropic drugs. The used thresholds of oxygen delivery were suggested over 40 years
      ago, in considerably younger patients compared to the current patients. Update of the
      characteristics of perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption is reasonable in modern
      clinical settings.

      Primary outcome:

      relative changes of oxygen consumption induced by anaesthesia

      Secondary outcomes:

      relative changes of oxygen consumption and delivery during surgery and postoperatively,
      oxygen extraction ratio (measured and estimated), potential markers of oxygen debt frequency
      of in-hospital postoperative complications, mortality (30 Days)

      Population:

      Men and women ≥65 years undergoing major/complex surgical procedures, when intra-operative
      cardiovascular monitoring is justified according to clinical decision.

      Intervention: no study related intervention, general anaesthesia and surgery according to
      clinical routine

      Blindning: no blinding

      Study size:

      Pilot study 1: feasibility assessment of study protocol of intra-operative measurements (n=
      max 10) Pilot study 2: feasibility assessment of study protocol of postoperative measurements
      (n= max 10) Main study: 60 subjects Planned analysis of oxygen consumption after 20 monitored
      subjects

      Study duration:

      Duration of haemodynamic monitoring 24-36 hours Duration of observation of clinical outcomes:
      7-10 days, mortality at 30 days postop.

      Investigational events:

      monitoring of oxygen consumption and delivery monitoring of postoperative clinical outcomes
      monitoring of markers of tissue injury

      Assessments, Procedures and Schedule of Investigational Events:

      Subjects are identified by the operation planning list and assessed for eligibility. The
      study information will be given verbal during the first hospital visit. Subjects who give
      written informed consent will be included in the study.

      Measurements:

      oxygen consumption by indirect calorimetry via face mask (in awake state) and via expiratory
      extension tube of anaesthesia machine (unconscious state) cardiac output monitoring via
      arterial line (LiDCO) blood samples: arterial and venous blood gase samples, Troponin-T urine
      samples: N-gal

      Clinical outcomes:

      Data collection from medical records on postoperative complications using the POMS screening
      survey at days 3,7 and 10. Postoperative mortality at day 30.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women aged ≥65 years

          2. Major/complex surgery (BUPA AXA classification of surgical severity)

          3. Central and arterial venous catherization for hemodynamic monitoring.

          4. Written informed consent

          5. Available research team for the measurements If two subjects are eligible the elder
             one will be chosen. If there are two subjects aligible of different gender and almost
             the same age, the subject with a gender that is underrepresented by two or more will
             be chosen. This is consistent with the purpose of including subjects with as high age
             as possible without interfering with recruitment.

             monitor)
