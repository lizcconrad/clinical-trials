    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to evaluate a new portable medical device, the Creavo Vitalscan
      Magnetocardiograph (Vitalscan) on patients who have had a confirmed myocardial infarction
      (heart attack) within the previous 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a non-contact, passive, imaging technique that detects the
      magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity of the heart. The MCG technology has
      been evaluated in several clinical studies, demonstrating its potential usefulness in the
      detection of patients with stable angina and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including non-ST
      segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

      Previous studies have been completed using earlier versions of the Vitalscan device. Results
      showed that the device could differentiate between patients with confirmed ischaemic heart
      disease (IHD) and NSTEMI, those with non-IHD experiencing chest pain and healthy
      (non-ischaemic) control subjects.

      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the difference between abnormal MCG images from
      patients with a confirmed and recent myocardial infarction (MI)and normal images from
      previously obtained healthy volunteer controls scanned with the current device, so that
      comparisons can be made to the data acquired from the previous studies.

        Patients who have had a confirmed myocardial infarction within 12 weeks of the initial
        event under the care of South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed myocardial infarction within 12 weeks of the initial event

          -  Patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at Warwick Hospital on the point of
             discharge or patients already discharged from the CCU attending the cardiac
             rehabilitation classes

          -  18+ year old male or female

          -  Patient is willing and able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Atrial fibrillation

          -  Thoracic metal implants (cardiac stents allowed)

          -  Pacemaker or internal defibrillator

          -  Pregnancy (if after 20-week period)* or lactation

          -  Patient unable to lie down (i.e. supine position up to a maximum 25 degree tilt) or
             stay still on the examination bed

          -  Patient unable to understand the informed consent process and/or has a poor
             understanding of English (e.g. English-speaking relative/translator not available)

               -  There should not be any effect on pregnancy due to the non-invasive nature of the
                  device. Pregnancy after the 20-week period excluded from the study due to the
                  size and position of the foetus and unknown possibility of picking up the foetal
                  heartbeat, rendering the scan non-usable for study requirements
