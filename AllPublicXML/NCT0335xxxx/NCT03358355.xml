      The GIFT pilot study will investigate the optimal subcutaneous dose and safety of
      subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin in older people with peripheral artery disease
      (PAD).

    <textblock>
      The pilot GIFT Trial will obtain preliminary evidence to identify the optimal dose of
      subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin in people with PAD. The results of this pilot
      study may be used to design a randomized trial of unacylated ghrelin, in subsequent study, to
      improve functioning and prevent mobility loss in older people with PAD.

      In our primary specific aims, we will 1) establish the association of increasing doses of
      subcutaneous unacylated ghrelin with circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin 2) assess the
      safety of increasing doses of subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin in six patients
      with PAD age 55 and older. We will relate peak and Area Under the Curve values of unacylated
      ghrelin to brachial artery FMD values. To achieve these aims, six PAD participants age 55 and
      older will receive a single subcutaneous injection of unacylated ghrelin at doses of 10
      ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg, respectively, on three separate days at least one week apart.
      Unacylated ghrelin levels will be measured at baseline and at defined intervals after each
      subcutaneous injection (30 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 8 to 12 hours
      and 24 hours). Brachial artery FMD will be measured at baseline, before the unacylated
      ghrelin injection, approximately six hours, and 24 hours after each unacylated ghrelin
      injection. Blood will be collected and stored for potential later analyses of circulating
      biomarkers, such as inflammatory biomarkers.

      This is a Phase I study to guide dose finding for a pilot study of unacylated ghrelin in
      people with PAD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. PAD patients age 55 and older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above or below-knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, and wheelchair confinement.

          2. Cardiovascular event during the previous three months. [Note: Participants who have
             undergone coronary revascularization for a cardiac event during the previous three
             months may still qualify.]

          3. Major medical illnesses including renal disease requiring dialysis, or cancer
             requiring treatment in the previous year.

          4. Participation in another clinical trial or completion of a clinical trial in the
             previous month, unless they were in the control group of the previous trial.

          5. Unwilling to attend nine study visits over approximately six months.

          6. Surgery including lower extremity revascularization or orthopedic surgery in the
             previous month or anticipated surgery in the next three months.

          7. Greater than 15 mmHg difference in blood pressure in both arm pressure measurements
             during the ankle brachial index (ABI), diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, or unable to
             have the blood pressure checked in both arms.

          8. Blood pressure &lt; 90/50 at baseline.

          9. Non-English speaking, a visual impairment that limits ability to read the consent, or
             a hearing impairment that interferes with study participation.

         10. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.
