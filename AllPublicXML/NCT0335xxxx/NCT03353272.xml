  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite similar treatment outcomes for surgery or conservative care, the number
      of surgeries for the care of rotator cuff (RTC) related shoulder pain has increased. With the
      increase in surgery, there is an increased risk of harms, increased costs, and high re-tear
      rates. Patient expectations are beliefs or attitudes that include pre-treatment thoughts and
      beliefs regarding the need for specific treatment methods and the timing and intensity of
      these methods. Brief interventions designed to alter and enhance treatment expectations for
      conservative care and have been shown to improve patient expectations, but to date, no
      studies have explored whether such interventions can influence patient decisions to pursue
      surgical care. The investigators propose a comprehensive intervention that involves Patient
      Engagement Education, and Restructuring of Cognitions (PEERC) that is designed to change
      expectations, will reduce the likelihood that patients will choose to have shoulder surgery
      and improve functional outcomes. The cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches that form
      the core of our PEERC protocol are patient-centered and are designed to empower the patient
      in their own recovery process.

      Purpose/Aims: To examine the effect of the PEERC protocol on the decision to have surgery
      (primary), and improve global well-being, pain catastrophizing, pain, functional outcomes,
      and follow up expectations (secondary).

    <description>Numeric Pain Scale- The NRS for pain is scaled from 0 to 10 (11 point scale) and is based on pain intensity. Overall pain intensity will be queried where 0/10 represents no pain and 10/10 represents the worst pain possible.</description>

    <description>The Global Rating of Change (GRoC)40 asks patients to report their global rating of change (GROC) relative to baseline in 3 categories: overall, in pain, and in physical function, using a 7-point ordinal scale (where -7 much worse and +7 much better).</description>

    <description>The PCS is a 12-item questionnaire ranking types of thoughts and feelings one has while in pain. Items are ranked from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time).</description>

    <measure>Change in SPADI - Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in MODEMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MODEMS patient expectation scale has been used by a number of studies and has shown validity in predicting outcomes in conservative and surgical interventions. As we previously stated, the instrument is a Likert-based scoring tool with a mean score of 5 out of 5 (indicating high expectations of positive outcomes) and a mean score of 1 out of 5 (indicating very poor expectations of positive outcomes)30</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the impairment-based care plus PEERC condition will also receive the PEERC protocol. This protocol, informed by principles of CBT, involves three components: 1) engagement, 2) education and 3) cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation. A health coach who is responsible for engaging patients, educating them about pain modulatory mechanisms, and reinforcing cognitive and behavioral coping skills, will deliver the PEERC protocol.</description>
