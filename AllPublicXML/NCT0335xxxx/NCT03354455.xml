  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a within‐subject cross‐over design, we will include 20 patients with Parkinson disease
      (PD) and peak‐of‐dose dyskinesia.

      Patients will be studied after withdrawal from their normal dopaminergic medication.

      On two separate days, each patient will receive off‐line, effective (high‐intensity) or
      ineffective (low‐intensity) 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the
      presupplementary motor area (preSMA) before functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). Immediately
      after the patient will perform a Go/No-Go task during fMRI in the the OFF state for 9
      minutes. Then the scan is paused and the patient will receive 200 mg fast‐acting oral
      levodopa and undergo whole‐brain task‐related fMRI at 3 Tesla until peak‐of‐dose dyskinesia
      will emerge.

      During task‐related fMRI, patients has to click on a mouse with their right hand (Right‐Go),
      left hand (Left‐Go), or no action (No‐Go) in response to arbitrary visual cues.

      The patients will also be tested for different aspects of impulsivity using
      neuropsychological questionnaires and computerized tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common form of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) manifests when levodopa levels are
      highest and is referred to as peak-of-dose dyskinesia. 50% of patients experience LID after
      4-6 years of treatment, reaching a frequency of 40% after 4-6 years. The main risk factors
      for developing LID are disease duration, levodopa dose and age-at-onset, but none of these
      factors alone can predict whether and when an individual patient with PD will develop LID.
      There is converging evidence that exogenously administered levodopa induces non-physiological
      release and reuptake of dopamine in the striatum. This non-physiological dopaminergic
      stimulation gives rise to aberrant plasticity in the striatum that causes a sensitization of
      the cortico-basal ganglia system to levodopa. Dyskinesia often severely affects patients'
      quality of life requiring advanced treatment.

      Adopting a novel pharmacological fMRI (ph‐fMRI) approach, our group recently identified a
      functional signature of LID in the human brain: To bypass any problems due to movement
      artefacts, fMRI was performed in the time-span between the administration of levodopa and the
      onset of dyskinesia. Ph‐fMRI revealed that a single oral dose of levodopa caused an abnormal
      cortico‐striatal activation and connectivity pattern in pre‐SMA and putamen in LID patients
      relative to PD patients without LID. We predict that 1 Hz rTMS of pre-SMA will attenuate the
      levo-dopa-induced overactivity in the pre-SMA and putamen and normalise the pre-SMA-putamen
      connectivity pattern. This may possibly involve an altered interaction with the right
      inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG).On two separate days, each patient will receive effective
      (high-intensity) or ineffective (low-intensity) 1 Hz rTMS (i.e. control rTMS session) of the
      pre-SMA before fMRI (Off-line rTMS).

      Pharmacological fMRI (ph-fMRI): Immediately after rTMS the patient will perform a Go/No-Go
      task during fMRI in the the OFF state for 9 minutes. Then the scan is paused and the patient
      will receive 200 mg fast‐acting oral levodopa and undergo whole‐brain task‐related fMRI at 3
      Tesla until peak‐of‐dose dyskinesia will emerge. During task-related fMRI, patients press a
      computer mouse with the right hand (Right-Go), left hand (Left-Go), or no action (No-Go) in
      response to arbitrary visual cues.

      We want to include 20 patients in the final analysis of the study. In a previous comparable
      study we experienced a drop-out rate around a third. We therefore aim to enrol 30 patients.
