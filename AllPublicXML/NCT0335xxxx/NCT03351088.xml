  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its introduction, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) have become the standard
      surgical approach for the treatment of prostate cancer in the United States and then in
      Europe. Continuous refinements of surgical technique has been described in order to maximise
      outcomes while minimizing morbidities.

      The management of DVC is a crucial steps during RARP. It could be done prior or after its
      transection thanks to haemostatic effects of the pneumoperitoneum. This topic has been
      already investigated by some authors. However, no high quality evidence is available to opt
      in favour of either of the two approaches. Findings about estimated blood loss, positive
      surgical margins and urinary recovery differ among these studies and only one is a randomized
      controlled trial in a laparoscopic setting with a limited number of patients.

      Therefore, our objective was to evaluate in a prospective randomised setting whether a
      delayed ligation of the dorsal vascular complex impacted on perioperative, functional and
      oncological outcomes as compared to preventive ligation during robot-assisted radical
      prostatectomy.

    <description>Preventive ligation of DVC is done after the opening of endopelvic fascia and before bladder neck dissection. DVC is ligated at the level of the apex with a 8-fashion single stich (1-0 Monocryl® CT-1 stich) trying to preserve puboprostatic ligaments and the muscle fibres of the rabdosphincter. DVC is then dissected at the end of prostatectomy before the section of the urethra.</description>
