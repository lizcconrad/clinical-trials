    <textblock>
      The effect of microbial exposure on healthy human subjects will be investigated. Changes in
      cytokine and IgE and vaccine response will be measured. The hypothesis is that microbial
      exposure increases the measured responses.

    <textblock>
      The effect of microbial exposure on healthy human subjects will be investigated. The
      volunteers will either receive material containing a microbial inoculum, or they will receive
      nothing. Changes in cytokine and IgE and vaccine response will be measured. Subjective
      well-being will be recorded. Changes in microbial community will be followed. The hypothesis
      is that microbial exposure increases the measured responses.

    <description>In the end of the experimental period and 2-4 weeks later, all study participants fill a questionnaire. It will be asked if the volunteers experienced a negative change in mental well-being during the study period. Similarly, they will be specifically asked for itches, skin symptoms and signs of infections. And index (how may yes-answers) will be compared between treatment and control groups.</description>
