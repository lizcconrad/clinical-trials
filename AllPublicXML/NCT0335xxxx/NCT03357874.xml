  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a potent and fast-acting P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist recommended as
      first-line agent in ACS (2). This drug was associated with a 20% relative reduction in the
      rate of MACE in ACS patients undergoing PCI compared to clopidogrel. This benefit came
      without any increase in major bleedings compared to clopidogrel (6).

      In the PLATO trial, a limited number of kidney failure patients were included (21%) and
      patients with terminal CKD were excluded. A sub-group analysis focused on CKD patients was
      performed. Only 214 patients with CKD below stage 4 (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) were
      included (7). No patient with terminal CKD or undergoing chronic hemodialysis was included.

      Of importance, kidney function impairment is frequent and affects up-to 40 % of ACS patients.
      In addition, CKD is a powerful independent predictor of ischemic complications during ACS
      (8-9).Indeed, CKD patients have a very high risk of MACE following ACS with an odd ratio
      between 2 and 3 compared to patients with normal kidney function and event rates above 40% at
      one year follow-up (8-13). Of importance these patients more often have high on-clopidogrel
      platelet reactivity which was strongly associated with a worse clinical outcome (3,14-16). In
      CKD patients HTPR was associated with death after PCI (15). Accordingly ticagrelor which
      overcomes these limitations of clopidogrel could be associated with a major clinical benefit
      in severe or terminal CKD patients.

      Most of ticagrelor and is active metabolites are excreted through the feces. Preclinical data
      suggested that renal impairment had little effect on systemic exposure to the
      drug(EMEA/H/C/1241 (28)). Recent pharmacodynamic and kinetic studies confirmed these
      preclinical data on the safety of ticagrelor in severe and end-stage CKD (17-19).

      Therefore based on the rational above and to the lack of relevant clinical data, the optimal
      P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist for patients with stage 4 and 5 and patients undergoing chronic
      dialysis remains undetermined in ACS treated with PCI.

      We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy ticagrelor and clopidogrel in patients with stage 4
      and 5 or on chronic hemodialysis undergoing PCI for ACS.
