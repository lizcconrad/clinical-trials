  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of sugammadex for the
      reversal of both moderate and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by either rocuronium
      or vecuronium in pediatric participants. The primary efficacy hypothesis of this
      investigation is that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine in reversing moderate NMB in
      pediatric participants as measured by time to recovery to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of
      ≥0.9.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B. In Part A, pharmacokinetic (PK)
      sampling will be conducted to identify the pediatric dose providing sugammadex exposure
      similar to adults. For Part B participants, the efficacy of sugammadex (i.e. time to recovery
      of the TOF ratio) will be assessed. Further, safety analyses will be conducted in both Parts
      A and B. Following completion of Part A, an interim analysis (IA) of the PK and safety data
      will be performed. Once the appropriate doses are confirmed and safety data is assessed for
      the 2 doses of sugammadex, then Part B will commence.
