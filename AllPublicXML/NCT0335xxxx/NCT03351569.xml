    <textblock>
      Single patient randomized double blind trial to assess whether intravenous immunoglobulin can
      improve the clinical outcome of a case suffering from Unverricht-Lundborg disease (clinical
      and genetic diagnosis).

      The patient was randomized to be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin or placebo 1:1
      (crossover) once a month for at least one year.

      Main objective: improvement of the action myoclonus. Secondary objectives: Improvement in the
      overall score and in individual sections of the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale at one year;
      patient preferences based on results at the end of the trial.

      The first analyst was scheduled at one year from the start of the trial. The program was to
      discuss the patient's analysis data and to let the patient decide in three possible ways: to
      continue the trial, to continue treatment with immunoglobulins, to suspend the treatment.
      Depending on the decision, it was planned to follow the patient throughout the year after the
      analysis, at least for one year.

    <measure>Improvement of at least 20% of the action myoclonus at one year, measured with section 4 (Action Myoclonus) of the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly for one year</time_frame>
    <description>The range for Action Myoclonus Score is 0 (best) - 160 (worst, , i.e. more severe involuntary movements). Percent change = 100 X (Placebo UMRS4 - Treatment UMRS4) / Placebo UMRS4).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS) overall score improvement.</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly for one year</time_frame>
    <description>The total value of the UMRS (range from 0 - best - to 365 - worst) is composed of the sum of 6 sections: (1) Patient Questionnaire (range 0-48), (2) Myoclonus at rest (range 0-108), (3) Stimulus Sensitivity (range 0-17), (4) Myoclonus with Action (range 0-160), (5) Functional Tests (0-28), (6) Global Disability Score (range 0-4).</description>
