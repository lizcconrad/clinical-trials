      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide in comparison to
      placebo in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change in participants with T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus) inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the effects of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide with placebo on
           glycemic control.

        -  To compare the effects of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide with placebo on body
           weight.
