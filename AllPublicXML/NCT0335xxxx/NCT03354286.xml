        the CEP 302 Trial:

          1. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes according to ADA diagnostic criteria

          2. Time since diagnosis of at least six months

          3. Age between 2.00 and 6.99 years at enrollment

          4. Parental consent to participate in the study

          5. Completion of the CEP 302 Trial and in the continuation phase of the Medtronic CEP 302
             Trial using the Medtronic MiniMed 670G pump with Enlite3 sensor.

        To be eligible for the study, a parent must meet the following criteria:

          1. Parent or legal guardian of a child with type 1 diabetes meeting the &quot;child&quot; criteria
             outlined above.

          3. Parent comprehends written English.

          4. Parent understands the study protocol and signs the informed consent document.

        The presence of any of the following is an exclusion for the study (since enrollment in the
        CEP 302 Trial):

          1. Child has a medical disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will interfere
             with completion of any aspect of the protocol (e.g., pregnancy, kidney disease,
             adrenal insufficiency, skin condition that may hinder sensor application).

          2. Child has a neurologic disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will affect
             completion of the protocol

          3. Current use of oral glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the judgment of the
             investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the study

          4. Child is unable to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study
