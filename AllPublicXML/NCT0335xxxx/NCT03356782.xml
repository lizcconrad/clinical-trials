  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CAR T
      cells immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or late staged. Another
      goal of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the therapy that combines CAR T
      cells and IgT cells to treat sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with late staged and/or recurrent sarcoma have poor prognosis despite complex
      multimodal therapy. Therefore, novel curative approaches are needed.This study will combine
      two different ways to fight sarcoma: antibodies and CAR-T cells. Several immune checkpoint
      antibodies have been examined on various tumors with good outcomes. Sarcoma is known to
      express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells. Thus, in
      this study, the 4SCAR-IgT cells targeting sarcoma surface antigens will be infused in dose
      escalation cohorts.This study will assess the feasibility, safety, efficacy and side effects
      of CAR T cells immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or late staged.
