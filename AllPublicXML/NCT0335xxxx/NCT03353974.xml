  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is often characterized by the presence of balance and cognitive
      impairments. Cognitive functions play a key role in balance control. Simultaneously
      performing cognitive tasks decreases walking and balance ability (Dual-Task cost).
      Rehabilitative treatment of patients with MS does not have to consider separately the motor
      and cognitive aspects. Video-Game Therapy (VGT) is a novel tool that allows a multimodal
      training approach. VGT typically provides augmented feedback during training that can
      contribute to learning motor skills. The main objective of this exploratory study will be to
      test the effects of a commercially available VGT on balance and cognitive function in
      ambulatory MS patients compared to a standardized balance platform training (BPT). Secondary,
      we will explore the effects of VGT and BPT on other domains that are usually impaired in MS
      population and that can be improved by motor rehabilitation, such as psychological
      well-being, fatigue and Quality of Life. Another specific aim will be to better explore the
      neuronal correlate during video game therapy using the Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy
      (fNIRS). Finally, patient motivation and satisfaction during VGT and BPT will be monitored
      with a specific questionnaire.

    <description>Subjects belonging to the experimental group will receive a Video Game Therapy (VGT) protocol using the Xbox console. They will receive 18 sessions of treatment within 6 weeks (3 sessions per week); each session will last 1 hour. Patients will be required to concentrate in games whose major purposes are increasing balance, selective attention and attention shifting. During sessions the patient will be carefully controlled by a researcher who will prevent the risk of falling</description>

    <description>Subjects belonging to the control group will receive the same amount of therapy (18 sessions) using a balance platform (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY). Balance/rebalancing, postural stability and weight-shifting exercises ill be administered with and without visual feedback. During the first session, the tasks will be performed at an &quot;entry level,&quot; and the exercise progression will be adjusted over time according to the patients' functional level (intermediate and difficult level). Balance platform therapy offered visual feedback and knowledge of performance (augmented feedback). The physiotherapist, as during VGT, provided additional external feedback.</description>
