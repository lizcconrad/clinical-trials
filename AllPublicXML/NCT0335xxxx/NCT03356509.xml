  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use stress inducing tasks to determine if there are significant improvements
      in mood, chocolate cravings, and attentional bias to chocolate in overweight/obese chocolate
      abusers following rest and a bout of high intensity interval exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether a single high intensity interval
      exercise (HIIE) bout, following two stress-inducing tasks, reduces addictive behavior to
      chocolate. Volunteers must complete the consent form before being able to participate in two
      days of testing (exercise day and control day) which will be presented in randomized order.
      The two days will be separated by a one to 7 day washout period. Subjects will be required to
      submit a three day chocolate diary then abstain from chocolate on the 4th day. They will also
      be asked to record everything they eat and drink on the day before and the morning of the
      study and list three types of chocolate they crave most. Two stress-inducing tasks will be
      performed on both days followed by completion of either 26 minutes of HIIE or seated resting
      condition followed by the completion of two mood and craving questionnaires. They will
      finally be asked to complete a task that measures the amount of attention they pay to
      chocolate. Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine the effect of either
      exercising or not on addictive behaviors to chocolate.

    <measure>Attentional Bias (AB) to chocolate using a modified visual dot probe task (Kemps et al, 2009)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>AB will be measured using a modified visual dot probe task, which consists of measuring reaction times to neutral images versus chocolate images (Kemps et al, 2009). Neutral images will consist of non-chocolate related items (i.e. office supplies). After 5 practice trials, 60 critical trials will be displayed which consist of either chocolate or neutral images (presented side by side). A black fixation cross will appear behind one of the images, and the subject has to respond as quickly as possible to which image the cross is located behind. The faster the subject responds to the cross behind the chocolate image, the higher their attentional bias is to chocolate. AB will be measured on both days following both the exercise and control conditions.</description>

    <measure>Affective Valence measured by The Feeling Scale (Hardy &amp; Rejeski, 1989)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Feeling Scale measures affective valence using an 11 point range from -5 to +5 with higher values indicating more pleasure. It is administered on both days following both the exercise and the control condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affective Activation measured by the Felt Arousal Scale (Svebak &amp; Murgatroyd, 1985)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Felt Arousal Scale measures affective activation using a 6 point range from 1 to 6 with the higher values indicating greater activation and arousal. It is administered on both days following both the exercise and the control condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cravings for chocolate using the State Food Cravings Questionnaire (Cepeda-Benito et al, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures the acute intensity of chocolate cravings using 15 items with 3 items per dimension. The five state dimensions of food cravings are: an intense desire to consume food, anticipation of positive reinforcement from eating, anticipation of relief from negative states and feelings as a result of eating, lack of control over eating if food is eaten, and craving as a hunger/physiological state. The dimensions will be evaluated using a 5 point Likert scale with the higher score meaning more intense cravings for chocolate. The questionnaire will be administered on both days following both the exercise and the control condition.</description>
