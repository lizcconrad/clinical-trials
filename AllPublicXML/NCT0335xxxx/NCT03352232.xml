  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study safety, feasibility and outcomes of combining osteopathic manipulative therapies
      with hyperbaric oxygen therapy in reducing the functional deficits in stroke survivors in
      subacute and chronic phases post ischemic stroke. To document the same as part of a pilot
      project in anticipation of further investigational studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to show that hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with
      osteopathic manipulative therapies improve outcomes in patients who have persistent
      neurological deficits after ischemic stroke compared to historical norms.

      The secondary objectives of this study is to demonstrate safety and feasibility of treating
      patients post stroke with hyperbaric oxygen and osteopathic therapies as well as determine
      improvements in multiple assessment scales of motor function, depression, activities of daily
      living(ADL) and pain

    <intervention_model_description>There will be two populations based on when they experienced a stroke. Subacute stroke patients will have suffered an ischemic stroke within 3 months of enrollment and have persistent neurological deficits. The second group will be patients who suffered an ischemic stroke more than 6 months (chronic) from time of enrollment and have persistent neurological deficits compromising activities of daily living.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is defined as breathing 100% oxygen at increased atmospheric pressure. Osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) is used for myriad ailments including contractures, pain, spasticity. Patients in intervention arms will receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2ATM (atmospheres) for 90minutes daily for up to 6weeks. In addition, they will receive osteopathic manipulative therapies twice a week during the same treatment phase.</description>
