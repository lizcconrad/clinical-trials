  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study in adult subjects with
      advanced solid tumors for whom standard therapy is not available for their stage of disease.
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
      (preliminary anti-tumor activity and gene expression analysis) of SM08502 administered
      orally, once daily, for 28 consecutive days. Dosing in 28-day cycles will continue within
      each subject, up to 6 cycles total, unless the subject is withdrawn from the study for one of
      many different reasons.
