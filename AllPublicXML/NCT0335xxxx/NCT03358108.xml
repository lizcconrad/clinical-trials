  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre observational follow-up study of PegIFN treatment
      unstained response in nucleoside experienced patients with Chronic Hepatitis B.Patients will
      join this study after finished following clinical trail about A Study of Combination or
      Sequential Treatment With PEGASYS (Peginterferon Alfa-2a) and Entecavir in Patients With
      HBeAg Positive Chronic Hepatitis B(OSST trail),A Real-World Study of Pegylated Interferon In
      Nucleoside-treated Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B (COST study), Combination Therapy With
      Interferon Plus Interleukin 2 and Hepatitis B Vaccine in Chronic Hepatitis B
      Patients(Endeavor study),A Prospective Clinical Trial in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients
      Nucleotide Analogues Experienced (Anchor A Study),Sequential/Combination Therapy in
      Nucleoside or Nucleotide Analogue (NA)-Suppressed Chronic Hepatitis B Patients (NPGV
      study).We plan to compare the HBsAg negative rate and maintenance rate,the occurrence of
      liver cirrhosis and the occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) related to hepatitis
      B virus(HBV) within five years between interferon group (including interferon alone or
      interferon combined with other drugs) and nucleoside analogues.Patients were divided into two
      groups based on whether they received interferon or not.

      Patients who treated with nucleoside analogs, and previously took part in the
      OSST,COST,Endeavor, Anchor NPGV studies, were included in the observational study after they
      finished. The patients entered the following two observation groups based on previous
      studies: Group A: formerly interferon group (including interferon alone or interferon
      combined with other drugs); Group B: formerly nucleoside analogue treatment group. Each group
      was followed for five years.All patients were followed up for physical examination (vital
      signs, whole body examination) and laboratory assessment (HBsAg quantification, HBeAg
      quantification, HBV DNA, HBV immunology marker, blood routine, blood biochemistry, alpha
      fetoprotein, Fibroscan, liver Doppler) in every six month.
