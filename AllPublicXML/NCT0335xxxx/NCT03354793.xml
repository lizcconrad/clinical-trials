      The aim of this study is to compare the rate of obstetric complications at first spontaneous
      pregnancy among women with endometriosis, with the rate of obstetric complications at first
      spontaneous pregnancy among women without endometriosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women followed up for a surgical or clinical/sonographic diagnosis of endometriosis in 11
      italian referral Centres for the treatment of endometriosis, completed a questionnaire
      regarding their previous pregnancies. The same questionnaire was completed by women,
      attending a routine gynecologic visit, in whom surgery or clinical/sonographic evaluation
      excluded endometriosis.
