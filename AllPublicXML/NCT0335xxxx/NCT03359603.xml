  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases in clinic. It
      usually occurs in middle-aged people, especially women. An estimated lifetime risk for KOA is
      approximately 40% in men and 47% in women. KOA is a chronic disease which can lead to obvious
      pain, joint stiffness, limitation of activity and even disability, with significant
      associated costs and effects on society, health systems, and individuals. The use of
      acupuncture as an approach for the management of chronic pain, is receiving increasing
      recognition from both the public and professionals. However, there are no universally
      accepted treatment frequency criteria in previous studies. The number of acupuncture
      treatments is no more than twice per week in most previous studies, while it is usually 3-5
      sessions per week in clinical practice in China. The aim of this study is to compare the
      effects of different EA sessions (3 sessions per week versus once per week) in a pilot
      randomized controlled trial of KOA.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the 24-session treatments group
      (group A), patients will receive EA 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. The EA stimulation
      lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 2/100 Hz and a current intensity depending
      on the participant's comfort level (preferably with skin around the acupoints shivering
      mildly without pain). It involves having needles inserted into acupoints which are stimulated
      manually for 10 seconds to create &quot;De Qi&quot; sensation and paired alligator clips will be
      attached to the needle holders at LR8-GB33 and two other customized acupoints. Disposable
      needles (Huatuo) and the HANS-200A acupoint nerve stimulator (Nanjing Jisheng Medical Co.,
      Ltd. production) will be used.

      Patients in the 8-session treatments group (group B) will receive EA once per week for 8
      weeks. Other interventions are the same as group A. Assessments will be conducted at baseline
      and 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after randomization.

      It is expected that the interventions will alleviate the sufferings of the patient. The risks
      of participation are minimal. Occasionally, acupuncture can make people feel nauseous or
      experience a temporary increase in pain either during or after treatment. Rare side effects
      during acupuncture treatment include fainting, infection and subcutaneous hematoma (pooling
      of blood under the skin). Participants will be warned of these potential side-effects before
      consenting to have acupuncture.

      Patients will be allowed, or required, to back out of the trial based on the following:

        1. A major protocol violation;

        2. Development of a serious disease;

        3. Adverse events related to electro-acupuncture;

        4. Request to be back out of the trial. The purpose of the study is to accumulate clinical
           data, obtain the outcome data of the intervention method and prove the feasibility of
           the study protocol.

      Sixty patients will be selected as the sample size according to clinical experience.

    <description>the percentage of patients with improvement in average pain (numerical rating scale, NRS) at least 2 units and in Western Ontario and Mcmaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function subscale score at least 6 units at 8 weeks. Pain NRS was a self-administered instrument, a number selected from 0-10 by participant. Intensity of pain range (over past week): 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain. Higher score indicating severe pain. The WOMAC function subscale referred to the participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC function subscale was comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in the study knee. The WOMAC function subscale score for each question ranged from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signified worse physical function. An overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 68 (maximum), with higher scores indicating worse physical function.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated by use of 5 obligatory and 3 customized acupoints. Obligatory points (ST35, EX-LE5, LR8, GB33 and Ashi) will be used in all patients. Other 3 customized acupoints should be chosen by the physicians on the basis of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis for acupuncture channels related to the individual pain area, with the intent of optimizing efficacy. ST34, ST36, ST32, ST40 and EX-LE2 will be used for pain at stomach meridian. GB31, GB36, GB34, GB39 and GB41 will be used for pain at gallbladder meridian. BL39, BL40, BL57 and BL60 will be used for pain at bladder meridian. LR7, SP9, SP10, KI10, SP4, SP6, LR3 and KI3 will be used for pain at three yin meridians of foot. Needles will be stimulated manually for 10 seconds to achieve&quot;De Qi&quot;. Paired alligator clips will be attached transversely to the needle holders at LR8-GB33 and two other customized acupoints. Other needles will be manipulated for 10 seconds during the treatments.</description>
