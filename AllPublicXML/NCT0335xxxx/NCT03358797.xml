  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arab women present increased risk for diabetes, with a 70% greater risk for adult-onset
      diabetes and a significantly younger age at onset compared with Jewish Israelis. In fact, the
      rate of diabetes for Arab women in Jerusalem is 4 times higher compared with their Jewish
      counterparts. Group lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)
      have documented effectiveness in preventing diabetes; however, many fail to demonstrate
      outcome maintenance. We predict that integrating leadership skills training into the gold
      standard DPP would improve the long-term outcome maintenance. A pre-post study design will be
      utilized, where all community participants will be exposed to intervention components. The
      sample was selected from pre-existing groups in the local community center, based on their
      leadership potential.

      The purpose of this study is to design, implement and evaluate a community based lifestyle
      intervention that integrates a leadership skills training for Palestinian women living in
      East Jerusalem. A pre-post study design will be utilized, where all community participants
      will be exposed to intervention components. The sample was selected from pre-existing groups
      in the local community center, based on their leadership potential (n=39). The
      Community-Based Lifestyle Intervention (CBLI) was developed by integrating leadership skill
      training to the gold standard Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). According to social
      cognitive theory, engaging in lay leadership can help maintain health behaviors by providing
      leaders with social support, behavioral reinforcement, outcome expectancies, reciprocal
      determinism, and building self-efficacy. Fostering social change and empowering individuals,
      mobilizing community members is also an effective, low cost method for widespread impact on
      health behavior and health outcomes within the members' community. This is particularly true
      for women and minority populations. All intervention components were adapted to the specific
      culture, language, gender, and religious sensitivities of Palestinian female society.

      The program will consist of 22 sessions presented by multiple professionals (nutritionists,
      exercise trainers, health coaches, and psychotherapists). Session content includes
      Mediterranean diet education, social support, food tasting and cooking, goal setting,
      self-monitoring, planning, conscious eating, leadership and lay leader training,
      initiative-taking, group dynamics, project design, community needs assessment, and project
      evaluation. The study is implemented in partnership with local community centers.

      It is hypothesized that Arab women who participate in this community intervention will have
      improved - and maintained- healthy eating behaviors (i.e. Mediterranean Diet), reduced
      unhealthy eating behaviors (i.e. Western diet), increased engagement in physical activity and
      reduced risk of obesity (weight, BMI).
