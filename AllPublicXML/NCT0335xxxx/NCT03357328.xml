  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This intervention study will investigate the effect of therapy light rooms on sleep,
      circadian rhythms, mood, behavioural problems and function in nursing home (NH) patients with
      dementia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with dementia often have fragmented night-time sleep, prolonged night-time awakenings
      and increased daytime sleep. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (e.g.
      agitation, depression) are also common. Noticeably, both sleep problems and BPSD are related
      to a disturbed circadian rhythm. Light is the most important input to the circadian system,
      and exposure to sufficient daylight is important for entrainment of the circadian rhythm to
      the surroundings. Dementia patients living in nursing homes (NH) are less exposed to daylight
      than dementia patients living at home. Bright light therapy is a promising treatment in these
      patients as it may improve sleep, BPSD, and independent functioning. However, traditional
      bright light treatment has not been routinely employed in NH patients or patients with
      dementia. This may be related to difficulties in achieving adherence to the traditional
      treatment and thus the benefit of bright light therapy for people with dementia still remains
      unclear.

      DEM.LIGHT uses modern LED (light-emitting diodes) technology that enables light therapy with
      the least possible interference of the day-to-day life in NHs, as the treatment is not
      confined to a light source presupposing behavioural compliance. Ceiling-mounted LED-sources
      can be programmed in terms of timing, light intensity and colour temperature. DEM.LIGHT uses
      this to provide therapy light rooms with a dynamic light condition that better emulates
      natural light throughout the day. The study is a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the
      effect of therapy light rooms on various measures of physical and mental health in NH
      patients with dementia. Data will be collected at baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks of
      treatment, and at the end of the intervention period (24 weeks).

    <intervention_model_description>4 nursing home units will receive the intervention (ceiling mounted LED-light in the living room) and 4 will receive the control condition (&quot;standard light&quot;). The trial lasts for 24 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline and after 8, 16 and 24 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Care Provider)</masking>
    <masking_description>Although the placebo effect might not be an issue in those with severe dementia, the treatment may affect staff, creating bias such as the Hawthorne effect. Potential changes in staff routines and behaviours in response to the treatment may affect outcome, making a control condition necessary. In this controlled trial, we will compare patients receiving the intervention (therapy light rooms) with control units receiving placebo light (&quot;standard light&quot;). The researchers will install the same standard light solution (100 lux at eye level, 3000K) in all control units. This represents the placebo light intervention, which at the same time ensures a constant standard light condition in all control units.</masking_description>

    <description>This group (4 NH units, about 35 patients) will receive light therapy administered via LED technology. The light will vary in intensity and colour temperature throughout the day. Ceiling-mounted LED-lights are installed in the living rooms of participating nursing home units. Between 07:00 and 10:00 light of 400 lux at eye level, with 4000 K, will be provided. Between 10:00 and 15:00 the light will comprise 1000 lux at eye level, with 6000 K. From 15:00 to 18:00 the light will comprise 400 lux at eye level and 4000 K. When light is on from 18:00 to 07:00, standard light (about 100 lux at eye level, 3000K) will be administered.</description>
