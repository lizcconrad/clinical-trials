  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired physical function and muscle dysfunction are a major consequence of COPD, which may
      be associated with increased mortality, poor quality of life and increased health care use.
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2881078, an SARM over 13 weeks of dosing in older male subjects
      and post-menopausal female subjects with COPD and muscle weakness. This study will also
      assess the effect of GSK2881078 on physical strength and function after 13 weeks of
      treatment. Approximately 100 subjects with COPD and muscle weakness will be randomized into
      two cohorts of 50 male subjects and 50 female subjects. Within each cohort, subjects will be
      randomized to receive GSK2881078 or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. All subjects will participate
      in a standardized home exercise program, which will consist of daily walking, along with
      several resistance or weight-bearing exercises, such as bicep curls, upright rows, step ups
      and a sit-to-stand maneuver. The study will consist of a screening/Baseline period of up to
      30 days, a 13-week treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period of 6 weeks.

             room visit.

          -  Any moderate/severe COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit.

          -  Subjects on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), defined as prescribed continuous oxygen
             use for &gt;14 hours/day.

          -  Clinically diagnosed history of drug or alcohol abuse within 5 years prior to
             randomization.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Participation in a formal pulmonary rehabilitation exercise program outside or inside
             the home, either currently or completed within the previous 6 months.

          -  For subjects who opt to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at participating study
             sites, there must be no contraindications to MRI, for example known claustrophobia or
             a pacemaker. Specific MRI contraindications will be determined by the type of MRI
             scanner available at each site and study personnel should confirm local eligibility
             requirements.
