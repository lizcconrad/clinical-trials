  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, controlled study to compared the Efficacy and Safety of
      XELOX combined with Apatinib versus XELOX as post-operative chemotherapy in locally advanced
      gastric signet ring carcinoma with D2 dissection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove that as for disease free survival time, and safety,
      Apatinib with XELOX(Oxaliplatin with Capecitabine) has a better effect over that of XELOX
      adjunct therapy group for postoperative chemotherapy of locally advanced gastric signet ring
      carcinoma with D2 dissection.
