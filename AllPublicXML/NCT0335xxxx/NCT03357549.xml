  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is the ideal feeding for the newborn. The success of the initiation and
      maintenance of breastfeeding can be influenced by different factors, as breastfeeding
      self-efficacy. Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) is a form of collaborative guidance,
      person-centered approach aimed at strengthening the motivation to adopting healthy
      initiatives and can increase the self-efficacy.

      The hypothesis is that an BMI to promote breastfeeding, during immediate postpartum plus
      telephone support at the first and third postpartum months, will significant increase in the
      adherence and duration of breastfeeding compared with the habitual education action applied
      at the same time. Also, the BMI will increase the breastfeeding self-efficacy of the
      particpants, and this breastfeeding self-efficacy will be a mediator of the effect between
      the IMB and the breastfeeding duration.

      The general self-efficacy of the participants will change the size of the effect of BMI.
