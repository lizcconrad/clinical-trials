      Objective: Determine tolerance of immediate oral intake (8 hours posterior to the beginning
      of treatment) against traditional management (early feeding at 48hr) in patients with mild
      acute pancreatitis of biliary origin.

      Double blind, randomized clinical trial

    <textblock>
      The investigators included patients 15 - 85 years old, any sex. Diagnosis of mild acute
      pancreatitis according to the Ranson, APACHE II and BISAP.

      Signed infromed consent to participate in the study. All participants had a hepatic and
      biliary ultrasound to determine the biliary etiology.

      The investigators excluded patients with pancreatitis of nonbiliary etiology, pregnant,
      severe pancreatitis, cholangitis or choledocholithiasis demonstrated during the hospital stay
      or with other comorbidities.
