  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate a feeding technique, sham feeding, to promote
      adequate oral skills in order to prevent oral aversion and/or poor oral skills due to the
      delay in oral feeds for surgical reasons. Sham feeding is intended for infants who are
      expected to have a prolonged course without normal enteral feeding by mouth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of literature and research on which to base interventions that intend to
      preserve and develop oral and motor feeding skills in the post-operative patient population
      during the critical window of opportunity to establish proper oral skills. Due to the lack of
      positive oral feeding stimuli (i.e. prolonged airway management, nasogastric tubes, and
      airway and upper GI suctioning), these patients are at risk to develop oral aversions that
      may negatively impact long-term outcomes.

      Parents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) report feelings of stress and loss of
      control associated with medical interventions. When normal oral feeding is contraindicated,
      there may be impairment of parent-child bonding and mothers may be less dedicated to
      providing milk for the infant. Impaired bonding has been shown to affect the parent-child
      relationship and the child's development long after discharge.

      Sham feeding has been shown to be safe and shorten time to oral feeding in infants with
      esophageal atresia with delayed esophageal repair. Anecdotal evidence from Le Bonheur
      suggests that sham feeding in post-operative gastroschisis patients improves parental
      satisfaction and engagement.

      There is no literature to describe the use of sham feeding in neonates other than those with
      esophageal atresia. Anecdotal reports from our institution and others institutions suggests
      that it increases parental engagement and improves parental satisfaction among patients with
      other bowel pathology.

      This is a cohort study with historical controls within a single level IV NICU. Participants
      will be offered sham feeding by breast or bottle and observed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Neonates at least 34 weeks post-menstrual age who have a history of gastrointestinal
             surgery, require no respiratory support more than 2 lpm by nasal cannula, and have an
             anticipated prolonged course with contraindication to normal oral or enteral feeding.
             They must have a diagnosis of gastroschisis awaiting return of bowel function, bowel
             atresia or other obstruction with anticipated feeding contraindication longer than 30

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lack of consent or parental consent.
