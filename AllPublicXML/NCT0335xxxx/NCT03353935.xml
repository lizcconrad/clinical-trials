  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent surgery for deep endometriosis were submitted to procedures aiming at
      sparing the pelvic autonomic nervous system. They were observed prospectively followed and
      interviewed in order to evaluate functional outcomes after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical tretament for deep endometriosis can produce lesions at the level of the pelvic
      autonomic system.

      Before surgery and 3-12 months after the nerve-sparing surgical procedures, patients were
      assessed for urinary, sexual and fecal function, in order to evaluate whether sparing of the
      nerves during the intervention had a beneficial impact on post-operative pelvic function.
