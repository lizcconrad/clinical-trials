  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subtalar fusion is commonly performed in post-traumatic subtalar osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, tarsal coalition and primary subtalar
      osteoarthritis. Patients with osteoarthritis or severe dysfunction involving both the ankle
      and the subtalar joint may benefit from an tibiotalocalcaneal fusion (TTC) or an ankle
      replacement and subtalar fusion. With the development of new prosthetic designs and of
      surgical techniques, total ankle replacements (TAR) became a reasonable alternative to fusion
      with functional and quality of life improvements. A gait analysis of patients that underwent
      TAR and simultaneous subtalar fusion allows to study with precision and reliability the ankle
      range of motion (ROM). On the contrary, in healthy subjects or in patients that underwent
      isolated TAR this is not possible because the ankle ROM is influenced by the ROM of the
      subtalar joint in such a way that it is not possible to analyze the two joints separately.
      Also, excluding the role of the subtalar joint, it is possible to accurately analyze and
      compare the consequences on ankle kinematics of two different prosthetic designs.

      Patients who previously have underwent TAR and simultaneous subtalar fusion are
      retrospectively reviewed. Minimum follow-up after the surgery is 12 months.
