    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib when giving together
      with lenalidomide in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Ibrutinib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving ibrutinib and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for ibrutinib in combination with
      lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To do an early assessment of the activity of the combination of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in
      patients with MDS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      To examine the pharmacodynamic and biological effects of the combination of ibrutinib and
      lenalidomide in MDS.
