    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, three-arm, comparative study with a provider-crossover design. The
      first arm will comprise the standard of care pain regimen after discharge, which comprises
      PRN oxycodone, tramadol, and acetaminophen. The second arm will comprise a multimodal pain
      regimen; however, patients will still be routinely provided PRN oxycodone and tramadol to use
      on an as needed basis. The third arm will comprise a multimodal pain management protocol,
      which does not routinely allow for opioid consumption. However, patients will be provided a
      one week supply of oxycodone and tramadol for emergency pain relief only.
