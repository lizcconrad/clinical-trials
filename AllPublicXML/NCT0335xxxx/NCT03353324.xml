  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with new onset retinal vein occlusion in less than 3 month whom has visual acuity
      less than 20/40 and central macular thickness more than 250micrometer and non perfused areas
      of retina more than 10 DD are included in over study and devided into 2 groups randomizely,
      Group A under gone 3 intravitreal injection of bevacizumab monthly and examine monthly for
      Visual acuity and central macular thickness, if in month four or more the CMT is more than
      250 micrometer and the visual acuity is less than 8/10 the injection is repeated and follow
      up in this manner is continued until 9 months.

      Group B is as the same of group A but patients in this group undergone laser photocoagulation
      of retinal non perfused areas based on FAG wide field imaging .

      After 9 month follow up the outcomes such as Vusal acuity, Central macular thickness,
      intraocular pressure, neovascular formation are compared,
