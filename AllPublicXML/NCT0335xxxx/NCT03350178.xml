  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU patient's complications are notably due to multiple infections with high risks of sepsis.
      Those infections would be worsened by any antibiotic resistance mechanism. Thus, reducing MDR
      portage in health care unit is a global strategy that will benefit for the patients and the
      health system organization. Fecal Microbiota transfer and restoration is a promising strategy
      to achieve this purpose.
