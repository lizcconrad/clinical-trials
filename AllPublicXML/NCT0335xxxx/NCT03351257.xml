  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a maior cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.Colonoscopy and
      removal of all adenomas is the most efficient method to prevent colorectal cancer.The most
      colorectal polyps detected are small(&lt;10mm) and diminutive(≦5mm) during colonoscopy.At that
      size,the are overwhelmingly hyperplastic or adenomatous,and rarely harbour high-grade
      dysplasia,cancer or sessile serrated adenoma/polyp.Traditional white-light endoscopy cannot
      reliably distinguish between small adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps,thus,real-time
      recognition of the polyp histology during colonoscopy has the potential to minimize both the
      costs and complications associated with endoscopic biopsy and polpectomy.Linked color
      imaging(LCI),a new system for endoscopy modality,creates clear and bright endoscopic images
      by using short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light on the
      basis of magnifying blue laser imaging(BLI) technology. it is easier to recognize a slight
      difference in color of the mucosa. This is a study to investigate the impact of Linked color
      imaging endoscopes on the in vivo histology prediction of colonic polyps.

      This is a prospective study comparing the accuracy of linked color imaging(LCI) and standard
      white light colonoscopes in the diagnosis of small and diminutive colorectal polyps.
