  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore whether a 3D camera data can provide a more accurate baseline
      measurement (compared to 2D images with manual measurement) to support better clinical
      decision making in referrals to tissue viability.

    <textblock>
      Chronic and non-healing wounds are a significant problem to manage in community and represent
      a significant workload in community nursing. The current management for non-healing wounds
      includes referral to the tissue viability service, using a 2 D photographic image with
      assessment information. This study will pilot the use of a 3 D camera and associated software
      that introduces measurement and monitoring of wounds as a specific intervention. The
      introduction of 3 D measurement and monitoring of wounds will be compared with usual care.
      With a target recruitment of 30 patients via tissue viability, the pilot will report on the
      feasibility of using this outcome measure and the effectiveness of monitoring on wound
      closure or improvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a non-healing wound and be over 18 years of age the criteria for
             non-healing wounds is as per 5.1 on the community nursing referral criteria when
             considering referral of patients to tissue viability:

        'would expect that the wounds are deteriorating, chronic, non-healing or static or there
        are problems with the dressing regime'

        Patients must be willing to provide written informed consent

        Patients must have a registered Sheffield General Practitioner and be referred to tissue
        viability for a static or deteriorating wound

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with circumferential leg ulcers

        Patients with deep narrow sinus where the opening is less than 10mm

        Wounds on the face where the image would include the eyes or distinguishing features
