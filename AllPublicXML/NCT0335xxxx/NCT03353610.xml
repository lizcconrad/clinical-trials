  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a sporadic, sudden, and recurring
      tachycardia that is caused by an altered electrical conductivity in the heart. It causes
      palpitations and a rapid heart rate, which may induce fear in the patient and negatively
      impact the patient's quality of life. Therefore, most patients experience not only physical
      symptoms of PSVT, but also dramatic psychological burdens.

      As PSVT drug development efforts advance, it has become increasingly important to document
      the impact of PSVT in a systematic way, in terms of the disease natural history and clinical
      characteristics of PSVT episodes, as well as the psychological impact of the condition as
      reported by patients over time. In order to meet the needs for ongoing, systematic data
      collection on PSVT, a multinational registry, The PSVT Place Registry
      (www.PSVTPlaceRegistry.com), is being implemented and will be initially comprised of data
      entered directly by patients. The long-term registry is designed with a participant-focused
      approach to enable continuity of data collection and minimization of impact from changes of
      participants' health care providers. The registry may be expanded at a later time to include
      physician-reported data.

      The information from the registry is planned to be a resource for participants with PSVT,
      their families and support networks, their doctors, and the research community to better
      understand PSVT-related symptoms and awareness, PSVT diagnoses, patient self-management,
      medical treatments for PSVT, and impact of PSVT on quality of life from the patient
      perspective.

    <ipd_description>The details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and presentations based on the data from this registry are described in the registry's publication guidelines.
The Sponsor and/or designee will prepare periodic summaries of descriptive analyses of the data collected in the registry, as required by the appropriate regulatory authority such as disposition data, summary demographic, clinical, or quality of life data. Since enrollment in the registry is from the general population and may be variable, and there is no planned end date for data collection, there is no pre-specified timeline established for preparation of the data summaries. Thus data may be summarized when there is a sufficient length of data for a sufficient amount of participants to constitute a valuable data presentation. In addition, data may be summarized periodically for presentation at professional conferences and sessions, as appropriate.</ipd_description>
