  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is very common after spinal anaesthesia. Many studies have investigated the role of
      adding adjuvants to the local anaesthetics to decrease the incidence of post-spinal
      shivering. Non of the studies n the literature review have investigated the role of different
      dose of local anaesthetic alone in reducing the incidence of post-spinal shivering. In the
      present study the investigators aimed to compare the effect of different local anaesthetic
      dose in reducing post-spinal shivering.

      After approval of the ethics committee, department of anaesthesia, Menoufia University and
      written informed consent, a hundred full-term pregnant ladies undergoing elective cesarean
      section were enrolled in this study.

      The pregnant ladies were randomly assigned using a computerised software to one of two
      groups, low dose bupivacaine (LB) and high dose bupivacaine (HB), 50 patients each according
      to bupivacaine dose. Group LB received low dose bupivacaine (8 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine)
      Group HB received high dose bupivacaine (10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine).

      Vital signs including heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure intra-operatively until the
      end of surgery.

      The severity of shivering was the primary endpoint. Shivering was graded using a scale: 0, no
      shivering; 1, piloerection but no visible muscle activity; 2, muscular activity in one group
      of muscle; 3, muscular activity in more than one muscle group but not generalized movement;
      and 4, shivering involving the movement of the whole body. Shivering score was recorded for
      the whole study period.
