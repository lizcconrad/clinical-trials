  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low physical activity is associated with in hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration (HDF)
      patients. Previous studies showed the benefits of intradialytic exercise for improvement of
      physical fitness and hemodialysis adequacy. However, the effect of intradialytic exercise on
      physical activity has not been explored. This current open-labelled randomized controlled
      trial is conducted in HDF patients to determine the effect of intradialytic exercise program
      for 6 months on daily physical activity measured by tri-axial accelerometer (wearable
      device).

      The study is an open-labelled randomized controlled trial which compare the changes of daily
      physical activity measured by tri-axial accelerometer (wearable device) between the HDF
      patients in intradialytic exercise group and control during the 6-month period. After
      inclusion in to the study, all of the participants will be evaluated before randomized. The
      investigators will prescribe the exercise program for each participant in the exercise group.
      The exercise program use intradialytic cycling which will be gradually increased to at least
      30 minutes with moderate intensity. The participants in control group will receive dialysis
      as usual without intradialytic exercise prescription. The participants will go on the program
      for at least 6-months period. In each session, any adverse event or side effect will be
      reported.
