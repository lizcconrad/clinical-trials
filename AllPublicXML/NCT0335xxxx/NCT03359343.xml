  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linked color imaging (LCI)ï¼Œa new endoscopy modality, creates clear and bright images by using
      short wavelength narrow band laser light. LCI can make red area appear redder and white areas
      appear whiter. Thus, it may be possible to distinguish adenoma and non-adenoma polyps based
      on color evaluation of LCI images. This study aimed to assess the correlation between
      histology results and LCI images. Moreover, the investigators conducted a pilot study to
      explore the clinical potential of LCI to distinguish adenoma and non-adenoma polyps and the
      accuracy of an automatic computer-aided diagnosis system using LCI imagine to predict
      histology polyps when compared to human experts physicians.

      This study consists of a retrospective analysis and a pilot study. In the retrospective
      study, the investigators tried to find out an correlation between LCI images and histology
      results for polyp lesions. And a computer-aided analysis of the images was conducted to
      demonstrate the correlation objectively. Thereafter,a pilot study was performed to explore
      whether the previous correlation could be easily learned to distinguish adenoma and
      non-adenoma polyps by comparing the results of experts diagnosis of LCI image and
      non-experts. Also, in the pilot study, the investigators assessed the accuracy of an automate
      histology diagnosis method for polyp LCI images using the computer-aided system when compared
      to human experts physicians. Throughout the entire research, histology results are regarded
      as gold standard.
