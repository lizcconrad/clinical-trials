  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 2 µg/kg of oral dexmedetomidine (DEX) and
      0.5 mg/kg dormicum as premedication among children undergoing dental procedures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involved 52 children between 3-7 years of age, ASA I , who underwent full-mouth
      dental rehabilitation. The DEX group (n=26) received 2 µg/kg DEX in apple juice, and the
      control group (n=26) received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam in apple juice.

      The patients' scores on the Ramsey sedation scale (RSS), parental separation anxiety scale,
      mask acceptance scale, post-anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAEDS), and hemodynamic
      parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test,
      student t test, and analysis of variance in SPSS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ramsey Sedation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes after premedication</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation level is evaluated due to patient behavior. 1= Patient is anxious and agitated or restless or both, 2=Patient is cooperative, oriented, and tranquil, 3=Patient responds to command only, 4=Patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap, 5=Patient exhibits sluggish response to light glabellar tap, 6=Patient exhibits no response.A Ramsay sedation score '1' was considered as unsatisfactory and &quot;≥ 2&quot; was considered as satisfactory sedation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Separation Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Behavior of the child on seperation from the parents was assessed according to a four-point scale, i.e., the parental seperation anxiety scale (PSAS): 1= Easy seperation, 2=Whimpers but easily reassured, 3=Cries and cannot be easily reassured, but not clinging to parents, 4=Cries and clinging to parents. A PSAS score of 1 and 2 were considered as 'successful parental seperation'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mask Acceptance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before induction</time_frame>
    <description>Mask acceptance was evaluated using a four-point scale, i.e., mask acceptance scale (MAS):
1=Excellent (unafraid, cooperative, and accepts mask easily), 2=Good (slight fear of mask , easily reassured), 3=Fair (moderate fear of mask, not calmed with reassurance), 4=Poor (terrified, crying, or combative). The score of 1 and 2 considered as 'satisfactory' mask acceptance.</description>
