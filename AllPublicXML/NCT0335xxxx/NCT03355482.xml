  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory evaluation of MRI as a reliable, sensitive, and accurate outcome
      measure for clinical trials in SLE arthritis. Forty patients with SLE and moderate to severe
      synovitis (minimum of 3 tender and 3 swollen joints in wrists and hands) will be randomized
      to new or increased methotrexate therapy plus a single injection of Depomedrol or a matched
      placebo at baseline. Methotrexate will be injected subcutaneously once per week at ascending
      doses. The study will evaluate a range of outcomes discernable by MRI at 3 months and 6
      months after baseline. We will also compare MRI findings, clinical endpoints, and biomarker
      changes in patients that were treated with Depomedrol vs. matched placebo at baseline.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a six month, double blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial of subcutaneous
      methotrexate vs methotrexate plus baseline Depomedrol in patients with SLE and &gt;/= 3 tender
      and 3 swollen joints in the hands and wrists. Patients who are already taking methotrexate
      &lt;/= 15 mg/week may qualify and will have a &gt;/= 2.5 mg/week dose increase at baseline,
      receiving subcutaneous dosing whether on oral or sc dosing prior to entry. Those not taking
      methotrexate at baseline will initiate open label treatment in ascending doses beginning at
      15 mg/week. All patients will increase methotrexate weekly up to 25 mg as tolerated or until
      resolution of arthritis. Decreases are allowed as needed.

      After randomization, patients may choose to stop or continue any NSAIDs, hydroxychloroquine,
      or up to 10 mg prednisone if these were being used at screening. All other lupus-specific
      treatments or medications will be withdrawn. Optimization of methotrexate dose must be
      completed by Month 2. If additional immune- suppressive medications or steroids become
      necessary during the trial, patients remain evaluable for the primary endpoint, which is
      defined by clinical response regardless of treatment. In secondary analyses of Depomedrol vs.
      placebo, patients treated with rescue interventions will be censored when comparing changes
      in mean/median synovitis, osteitis RAMRIS or tendinitis scores in the two treatment groups,
      and they will be included as non- responders in dichotomous endpoints (SRI-4, BICLA). These
      analyses will also provide useful data for many of the other endpoints (comparisons of MRI vs
      joint counts and other measures which are valid regardless of treatment). Thus, although off
      protocol medications will not be encouraged, they will not require removal from the study.

                  repeat this test during the screening period or later rescreen.

               8. Any other laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
                  place a patient at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          4. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reactions: Known allergy or a history, in the opinion of
             the investigator or patient, of an unacceptable adverse sensitivity to gadolinium,
             methotrexate or unacceptable difficulties tolerating intramuscular or subcutaneous
             injections. Patients may elect lower doses of Depomedrol (1/2 or ¼ the dose) however
             if there is concern about tolerability of the large dose injection.

          5. Prohibited Treatments and/or Therapies:

               1. Patients who have received treatment with an investigational biologic within 28
                  days (or less than 5 terminal half-lives of elimination) of the Day 1 dose.

               2. Patients who have received cyclophosphamide within 3 months of the Day 1 dose or
                  bolus parenteral steroids &gt;/= 500 mg within 1 month of screening.

               3. Use of rituximab within 6 months prior to Day 1; if &gt; 6 months have elapsed since
                  last rituximab dose, reconstitution of total peripheral B cell counts to
                  predosing range should be documented. If there were no predose levels obtained
                  then B cell counts must be minimally 200 x 106/l which characterizes most SLE
                  patients (Odendahl et al. J Immunol 2000;165:5970-5979).

               4. Ongoing treatment (after the baseline visit) with immune suppressants (such as
                  azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, calcineurin inhibitors or
                  belimumab). These may be stopped or tapered as soon as informed consent
                  procedures have been completed at the screening visit.

               5. Prednisone &gt; 20 mg po qd (or equivalent) at the time of the screening visit or &gt;
                  10 mg po qd (or equivalent) at or after randomization (steroids will additionally
                  be tapered during the study if tolerated). Hydroxychloroquine is not exclusionary
                  if the investigator or patient is unwilling to stop it, but taper will also be
                  encouraged if the patient improves. NSAIDS are not exclusionary, but patients
                  will be asked not to take them on the morning of each monthly visit, until the
                  visit is concluded.

          6. Other Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Prisoners or patients who are involuntarily incarcerated.

               2. Patients who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
                  physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.

               3. Known contraindication or intolerance or risk of MRI procedures (e.g. permanent
                  pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, other implanted electronic devices,
                  aneurysm clips and other metal implants, procedure-limiting claustrophobia
                  (unless mitigated by the circumstances of the testing MRI for small joints) and
                  severe renal impairment (estimated GFR &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2).
