  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve inactive disease based on the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An ASDAS inactive disease response is a score of &lt;1.3 on a composite index to assess disease activity in Ankylosing Spondylitis. Parameters include spinal pain, the patient's global assessment of disease activity, peripheral pain/swelling, duration of morning stiffness and C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L. In this study, ASDAS is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve a clinically important improvement on the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A change from baseline in ASDAS score of ≥1.1 is considered a clinically important improvement in disease activity in Ankylosing Spondylitis. In this study, ASDAS is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated assessment tool using 0 through 10 scales (0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;worst problem&quot;), to characterize six clinical domains pertaining to five major symptoms of AS perceived by the patients. Computed composite scores of 4 or greater indicate suboptimal disease control. In this study, BASDAI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients who achieve Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index 50 (BASDAI-50)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI-50 represents a change from baseline (improvement) of at least 50% in BASDAI score. In this study, BASDAI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve an ASAS 20 response (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 20 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame at least 20% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevant to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. In this study, ASAS20 is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of participants who achieve an ASAS 40 response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 40 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame at least 40% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevant to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. In this study, ASAS40 is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients who achieve an ASAS partial remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS partial remission criteria are defined as a value not above 2 units in each of the four main domains on a scale of 10. In this study, ASAS partial remission is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ASAS - Health Index over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS-HI is a self-administered questionnaire and measures functioning and health over 17 aspects of health and 9 environmental factors in patients with spondyloarthritis. Patients score each item as &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;I do not agree&quot;. In this study, ASAS-HI is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) - Fatigue over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It is administered at Visits 4
- 19. &quot;. In this study, FACIT-Fatigue is used to estimate the difference in response between 150mg and 300mg of secukinumab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>These assessments will be implemented in terms of physical examination and vital signs outcomes, clinical laboratory results, nature and frequency of the observed adverse events and serious adverse events, frequency and severity of any injection site reactions, ECG outcomes and the detection of immunogenicity.</description>
