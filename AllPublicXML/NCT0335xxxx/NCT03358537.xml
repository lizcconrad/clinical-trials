  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, endoscopists' blinded comparison of bowel colonoscopy cleansing and
      tolerability of a prespecified low-residue diet compared with a clear liquid diet and
      Polyethylene Glycol bowel preparation. Outcome measures included efficacy of bowel
      preparation, patient preparation tolerability and side-effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An adequate examination is dependent on the bowel colonoscopy cleansing of stool. There are
      many different colon preparations, however endoscopists traditionally recommend the patient
      remain on a clear liquid diet for at least 24 h prior to their colonoscopy to reduce
      continued residue inflow into the colon from the small bowel, in addition the large volume
      preparation with PEG. The most common problems leading to less than adequate colon cleansing
      include lack of compliance with the clear liquid diet and difficulty taking the large volume
      preparation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of bowel colonoscopy preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of cleansing was recorded using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), a four-point scoring system applied to each of the three broad regions of the colon (right=cecum and ascending, transverse= including the hepatic and splenic flexures and left=descending, sigmoid and rectum) during withdrawal. The point was assigned as 0= unprepared to 3=entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining. Successful colon cleansing was considered when BBPS were &gt;2 per segment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patient tolerability was assessed using Viera scale (Likert), which measures the intensity of the symptoms related to the bowel preparation including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension and anal discomfort. The six-point scale ranging from 0-1=no complaints or some; 2-3=moderate and 4-5=severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Data on satisfaction were collected with a 1 to 10 visual analogue scale. Volume PEG consumed were evaluated as quartile (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) prior colonoscopy.</description>
