    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial of gene transfer for treating Beta-thalassemia using a
      self-inactivating lentiviral vector to functionally correct the defective gene(s). The
      objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the gene transfer clinical protocol.

    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is considered the most common genetic disorder worldwide. Beta-thalassemia is
      caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene which encodes the beta-globin protein, leading to
      the ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis and anemia. Currently, the only cure for
      thalassemia is bone marrow transplantation from a related, compatible donor, which has,
      however, the significant risk of transplant related mortality, graft versus host disease and
      limited source. Therefore, gene transfer, achieved by transplantation of the patient's own
      stem cells that have been genetically-modified with the corrected gene, could potentially
      cure thalassemia.

      This study will use an experimental gene transfer procedure performed in a laboratory to
      insert the related gene into the participant's autologous stem cells using a
      self-inactivating lentiviral vector. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the gene transfer procedure and to determine the ability of the
      gene-corrected cells at generating new, healthy blood cells in individuals.
