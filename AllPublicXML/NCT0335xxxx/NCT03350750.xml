      The Placebo-Controlled Effectiveness in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH)
      Shunting (PENS) trial is a multi-center blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design
      investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery to study the shunt effectiveness in
      iNPH patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary intervention will be setting the FDA-approved Certas Plus with Siphonguard,
      programmable CSF shunt valve to active (open shunt group)(setting 4)(110 mm H2O) or placebo
      (closed shunt group)(setting 8)(&gt;400 mm H2O)in a 1:1 ratio. By the time of the primary
      objective evaluation at four months, the closed shunt group will have zero months of active
      treatment, and the open shunt group will have four months of active treatment. At four
      months, shunts for subjects in the closed shunt group will be adjusted to setting 4. To
      maintain blinding, all patients will be adjusted/ mock adjusted to the active setting in a
      similar fashion. Patients from both groups will not be adjusted before four months of active
      treatment, unless judged medically necessary by the treating team. Following four months of
      active treatment, all subjects in each group will have shunt adjustments according to
      clinical standards at each center.

    <intervention_model_description>The primary intervention will be the initiation of the randomized initial shunt valve opening pressure setting to create a delayed treatment group in half of the study patients.
Randomization will be to active or placebo (closed) shunt settings. At the time of the standard four-month evaluation, all subjects will be similarly non-invasively adjusted to bring all subjects in both groups to the active setting while maintaining blinding of the subjects. All settings will be verified by the adjusting neurosurgeon.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>After subject enrollment and follow up have been completed, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) of the study will prepare a final study database for analysis. A releasable database will be produced and completely de-identified in accordance with the definitions provided in the Health insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Namely, all identifiers specified in HIPAA will be re-coded in a manner that will make it impossible to deduce or impute the specific identity of any patient. The database will not contain any institutional identifiers.
The DCC will also prepare a data dictionary that provides a concise definition of every data element included in the database. If specific data elements have idiosyncrasies that might affect interpretation or analysis, this will be discussed in the dictionary document.
In accordance with policies determined by the investigators and funding sponsors, the releasable database will be provided to users in electronic form.</ipd_description>
