      Study approval: The study was submitted for approval by Scientific and Ethical Committee at
      Faculty of Medicine, Sohag University. An informed written consent will be obtained from all
      participants.

      Study design: randomized controlled trial. Study population: the study will include patients
      who attend the outpatient Clinic of Dermatology &amp; Venereology and Andrology, Faculty of
      Medicine, Sohag University in corporation with Farshot General Hospital. Women who are
      pregnant or lactating, children aged 2 years or less and patients with acute or chronic
      disease that might affect skin barrier function will be excluded.

      Patients and methods:

      Study participants will be randomly divided into two treatment groups: group A will receive
      0.03% tacrolimus ointment and group B will receive hydrocortisone acetate 1% ointment twice
      daily for 6 months.

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and monthly intervals for 6 months and at 3 months
      after stopping treatment.

    <measure>Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>basline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of vitiligo involvement for each body region is calculated by using the palmar method. The palmar method uses the palmar surface area of the patient's hand as an estimation guide and defines the surface of the patient's hand including fingers to be 1% of the total body surface area.
The extent of residual depigmentation is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%.
At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeds the depigmented area; at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present.
VASI= ∑ [HAND UNITS] × [RESIDUAL DEPIGMENTATION].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vitiligo Disease Activity (VIDA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>): is a six-point scale for evaluating vitiligo activity.
In this score grading is based on disease activity and time period. Grading is as follows: + 4: (activity lasting 6 weeks or less); score +3: (activity lasting 6 weeks to 3 months); score 2: (activity lasting 3-6 months); score1: (activity lasting 6-12 months); score 0: (stable for 1 year or more); score -1: (stable with spontaneous repigmentation for 1 year or more).
A low Vitiligo disease activity score indicate less vitiligo activity.</description>
