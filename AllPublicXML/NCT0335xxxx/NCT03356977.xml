  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-week study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of
      crisaborole ointment 2%, applied twice daily (BID) in subjects who are 3 months to less than
      24 months of age with mild-to-moderate AD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 125 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects must have mild-to-moderate AD involving
      at least 5% treatable %BSA assessed on Baseline/Day 1. Treatable %BSA will be defined as the
      percent of a subject's total body surface area that is AD-involved, excluding the scalp.

      In addition, a cohort of at least 16 of the 125 subjects will be included in a subgroup for
      PK assessment. These subjects must have moderate AD and a minimum of 35% treatable %BSA,
      excluding the scalp, and must complete all PK assessments to be included in the PK analysis.
      Of these subjects, approximately 3 subjects who are less than 9 months of age will be
      enrolled. Subjects discontinuing for reasons other than treatment emergent adverse event (
      TEAE) may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor to ensure 16 subjects complete the PK
      assessments. Only selected study sites will participate in the PK assessment.

      Scheduled study visits/telephone contacts for all subjects will occur at Screening (up to 28
      days prior to Baseline/Day 1), Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (end of
      treatment/early termination), Day 36, and Day 57 (end of study).

    <description>Incidence of treatment emergent AEs (including application site reactions) and SAEs. The investigator is to record all directly observed AE's and all AEs spontaneously reported by the subject's parent(s) / legal guardian. In addition, each study subject's parent(s) / legal guardian will be questioned about the occurence of AEs in a non-leading manner.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Day 29 (end of treatment/early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Standing height will be measured using a wall mounted device or alternatively, Length is measured from top of the head to the heel of one foot. Clinical significance will be determined at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Day 29 (end of treatment/early termination).</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be measured using a scale with appropriate range and resolution which must be placed on a stable, flat surface. Subjects must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing and jackets so that only light clothing remains. Clinical significance will be determined at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <description>Vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be obtained with participant in the seated or supine position, after the subject has been seated or lying face up for 5 minutes. Clinical significance of vital signs will be determined at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with clinically significant changes from baseline in ECG.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Day 8, Day 29 (end of treatment/early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>A single supine 12-lead ECG will be performed at each of the timepoints. Assessment should be performed after the subject has rested quietly and precede measurements of vital signs and blood draws. ECG interpretation will be provided to the site by a central reader, assessing relevance of abnormal findings. The investigator will assess the findings based on the subject's clinical presentation and determine clinical significance for a given subject.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters.</measure>
