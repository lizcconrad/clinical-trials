      The purpose of this research is to use the &quot;Removing Blood Stasis Decotion&quot; of traditional
      Chinese medicine treating the acute stage of cerebral hemorrhage with stroke associated
      pneumonia to explore the impact of &quot;Removing Blood Stasis Therapy&quot; on intestinal microbial
      flora either within the time window from 6 to 72 hours onset.

      objective: to investigate the impact and immunologic mechanism of using the &quot;Removing Blood
      Stasis Decotion&quot; treatment in SAP after Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage with the concept of
      Intestinal Micro Ecological Regulation.

      Methods: from 2017.01 to 2022.12, 240 cases of AICH, 306 cases of hypertension will be
      included in 7 research centers. The AICH patients are randomly into 3 groups within 6 to
      72hrs from onset, thus there are 3 groups and the treatment will last for 10 days: group
      A，Removing Blood Stasis herbal medicine(8 herbals); Group B, herbal medicine without
      Poxuezhuyu activating herbal(6 herbals); Group C, placebo medicine of Chinese medicine.All
      the patients will be treated according AHA guideline of AICH and will be set to the brain CT
      and chest X-ray at the onset, 24h later and 10-14days after treatment. The venous blood，feces
      Specimen and the sputum will be collected in the time point of 6 to 72hrs within onset , 24h
      later, and 10-14days after treatment.So the rate of enlargement of brain hematoma and the
      development of SAP in the 72h later, mortality rate in the two weeks and the disability rate
      in the 90 days can be evaluated.

    <masking_description>Our randomized program was completed by the key research laboratory of clinical research from the Traditional Chinese medicine Hospital of Guangdong Province. We design 306 cases into three groups: Group A, B, C in the proportion of 1:1:1. Group A is the experimental group used RBS, which include 8 herbals. Group B is the experimental group used PBS, which include all the herbals in Group A except Leech and Tabanus, rhubarb. Group C is a placebo group. This study adopts a stratified random sampling method and intra slice randomization on the basis of using PROC PLAN progress on SAS V9.2. On the other hand, this trial measures and the control measures will be made blind doubly. The surface of the opaque random envelopes will indicate the information of the test name, hospital name and the entry sequence number of patient. The research process of incorporating patient, dispensing medicine depending on the random envelopes and ect will all be supervised by the researchers each other.</masking_description>
