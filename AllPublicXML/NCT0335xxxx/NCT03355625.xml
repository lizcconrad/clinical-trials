  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to describe platelet function in adult patients treated with
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A clarification of the platelet function in these
      critically ill patients contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms underlying their
      coagulopathy.

      The present study is a substudy to the study entitled; &quot;Coagulopathy During Extracorporeal
      Membrane Oxygenation&quot; (pending Clinical Trial ID number).

      The knowledge of platelet function during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains
      sparse. In the present study, the aim is to investigate platelet function in adult patients
      treated with ECMO using flow cytometry. The investigators hypothesize that platelet function
      increases from day 1 to day 3 in patients treated with ECMO. The secondary aim is to
      investigate the association between platelet function and the incidence of bleeding episodes
      and thrombosis during ECMO treatment.

      The present study is a substudy to the study entitled; &quot;Coagulopathy During Extracorporeal
      Membrane Oxygenation&quot; (pending Clinical Trial ID number).
