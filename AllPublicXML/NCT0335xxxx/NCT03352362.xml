  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the postoperative pain control using non - opioidal
      analgesics in children. We will investigate the effect of single use and combination of
      caldorol(ibuprofen) compare to denogan(propacetamol) in children.

      Participants who receive the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair between 6 months and 6 years
      old are divided 3 groups(caldolor, denogan, combination). Each groups are received a
      medication by protocol during surgery. After operation patient's pain score and use of
      additional analgesics are recorded in postanesthesia care unit and general ward.
