    <textblock>
      Total mesorectal excision (TME) has been prevailingly accepted as a crucial surgical
      intervention within the latest oncological therapeutic regime for mid-low rectal cancer.
      However, surgical dissection under the restricted pelvic anatomical structure, added by
      obesity and many other general factors, remains challenging for classical open and
      laparoscopic patterns, particularly in male cases. The introduction of transanal total
      mesorectal excision (TaTME) offers an optimal pattern for the surgical resection of mid-low
      rectal cancer, circumventing the conventional anatomical limits while bringing forward
      considerable advantages by direct dissection. Noteworthy, the surgical techniques of TaTME is
      initially established, with the mortality/morbidity and the oncological safety unverified.
      The studies that focus on the comparison between TaTME and laparoscopic TME (LaTME) remain
      sparse. Therefore, the features of TaTME, both in short and long terms, await further
      consolidation by clinical trials. Herein, this single centered, interventional study protocol
      is established to collect initial clinical data on both the safety and efficacy of the TaTME
      in comparison with LaTME in East Chinese patients with mid-low rectal cancer.

      Background: Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is increasingly accepted as one of
      the alternative patterns for the resectable rectal cancer worldwide since its first
      appearance. For mid-low rectal cancer, TaTME features superior viewpoints and direct access
      to mobilize the primary lesion without the pelvic anatomic limits. Therefore, the matured
      TaTME technique could deliver satisfactory clinic outcomes in both surgical and oncological
      senses. However, the studies that designed to compare the feasibility and repeatability of
      TaTME with conventional laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LaTME) remain sparse and
      limited.

      Study Objective: Evaluation of short-term mortality and morbidity, long term overall survival
      and disease-free survival as well as quality of life in rectal cancer patients in East China.

      Study Design: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial with a
      central monitored electronic data processing system. Corresponding randomization, data
      collection and comparative analysis will be conducted based on the research group discussion.
      According to the non-inferiority principle, the power is 80% and the α is 0.05 with 10%
      margin delta (δ). Total patients will be 258, with 129 in each group given 10% lost in
      follow-up.

      Study Endpoints: The primary outcomes measures will be the Disease-free survival (3-years).
      The secondary outcomes measures will be overall survival (3-years), mesorectal completeness
      (the quality of the TME specimen, complete, near complete, incomplete), positive
      circumferential resection margin (CRM), number of retrieved lymph nodes, morbidity rate,
      mortality rate.
