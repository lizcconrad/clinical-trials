  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shifts in accommodation at decreasing luminance levels are considered as principle cause for
      night myopia. Previous studies with laser optometers quantified the dark focus of
      accommodation up to 3 D. In addition to the measurement of dark focus, the aim of this study
      was to investigate the influence of an imaginary target at finite distances on the state of
      accommodation at scotopic luminance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accommodation was measured by using an open-field autorefractor (WAM 5500, GRAND SEIKO). Full
      corrected right eyes of 39 subjects aged from 18 to 40 years were investigated in this
      randomized, cross-sectional study. Accommodation measurements in photopic luminance were
      taken for 6 m of empty field and for optotype fixation at 2 m, 1 m and 0.5 m. At scotopic
      luminance, dark focus of accommodation was examined directly after darkening and after 10 min
      of dark adaptation. After adaptation, subjects had to visualize imaginary targets in the four
      distances while accommodation was measured.
