  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing use of high-fidelity simulation is limited by the imbalance between the
      growing number of students and the human resources available in such a way that all residents
      cannot play a role during scenarios. The learning outcomes of observers need to be studied in
      more depth. Previous studies have provided controversial results but overall no significant
      differences in learning outcomes can be demonstrated between observers and participants
      engaged as players in scenarios.

      Moreover, preliminary data suggest that learning outcomes of observers might be improved by
      using an observer tool during the scenario. However, no high-quality study has yet shown if
      this assumption is verified.

      In the present study, 3rd-4th year residents in anesthesia will be randomized before high
      fidelity scenarios to act as observers only or active participants in some scenarios and
      observers in others.

      The main outcome parameter will be the learning outcomes by comparing data obtained before
      and after the sessions by using questionnaires specifically dedicated to the knowledge of
      technical skills in the management of crisis scenarios.

      The increasing use of high-fidelity simulation in France during the anesthesia curriculum is
      limited by the imbalance between the growing number of students and the human resources
      available in such a way that all residents cannot play a role during scenarios. This leads to
      a new situation in which not all residents can be an active participant in scenarios with
      some remaining observers all along the simulation sessions. Based on Kolb experiential
      theory, this situation should lead to a decreased knowledge acquisition. Previous studies
      have however provided controversial results but overall no significant differences in
      learning outcomes can be demonstrated between observers and participants engaged as players
      in scenarios.

      Moreover, preliminary data suggest that learning outcomes of observers might be improved by
      using an observer tool during the scenario. However, no high-quality study has yet shown if
      this assumption is verified.

      In the present study, after informed consent will be obtained, 3rd-4th year residents in
      anesthesia will be randomized before high fidelity scenarios to act as observers only or
      active participants in some scenarios and observers in others.

      The main outcome parameter will be the learning outcomes by comparing data obtained before
      and after the sessions by using questionnaires specifically dedicated to the knowledge of
      technical skills in the management of crisis scenarios. In addition, self-efficacy of the
      simulation sessions will be explored through the responses to additional questionnaires
      evaluating the change in non-technical skills after the sessions.

    <description>Participants in this arm will be given the observer tool (OT) before the scenario and will be explained how to use it, i.e. observe all details of the scenario on the screen and tick on the OT all actions which are done by active participants.The observer tool will also be used to engage observers during the debriefing session.
The scenario will then be observed in a screen (i.e. the scenario is played by active participants in an adjacent room using direct video-recording and transmission.</description>
