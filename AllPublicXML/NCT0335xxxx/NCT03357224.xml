      Trial assessing atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) as treatment option for patients with mycosis
      fungoides/sezary syndrome having progressed under or after previous therapy

      For this study, we invite patients suffering from mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome who
      have progressed after initial therapy or have failed to respond to previous therapy.

      Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are cancers in which lymphocytes* become malignant
      (cancerous) and affect the skin. In mycosis fungoides, the disease is generally limited to
      the skin, and people develop flat or raised areas on their skin where the lymphocytes have
      accumulated. Sometimes even larger aggregations of lymphocytes occur in the skin or lymph
      nodes, resulting in tumors. In Sézary syndrome, the skin is often reddened or itchy, and some
      abnormal lymphocytes circulate in the blood.

      * Lymphocytes are a type of immune cells that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the
      blood. Lymphocytes have a number of roles in the immune system, including the production of
      antibodies and other substances that fight infections and other diseases.

      In standard practice, the disease will be treated with conventional chemotherapy that
      unfortunately has a limited lasting benefit. In this study, we want to see if a new treatment
      option can optimize and improve response and make benefit last as long as possible. This new
      treatment option is immunotherapy, using atezolizumab (Tecentriq).

      Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single
      type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or
      normal cells that may help cancer cell grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill
      the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Atezolizumab blocks a
      protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) from binding to its receptor found on the
      surface of lymphocytes. It helps to restore the immune activity of the body against the
      cancer.

      Atezolizumab is already used to treat adults with a cancer that affects the bladder and the
      urinary system, called urothelial carcinoma, and a cancer that affects the lungs, called
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      In this trial, patients will receive atezolizumab for one year unless the tumor starts
      growing again or this is not considered suitable for them anymore or they wish to stop the
      treatment.

             therapy for CTCL according to treatment guidelines (e.g. Interferon-alpha-2a (INF-2α)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0-1

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function prior to receiving the first dose of study
             treatment:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL (&lt;100 g/L) or hematocrit &gt;30% (&lt;0.30 v/v);

          -  White blood cell count &gt;3.0 x 109/L (&lt;3000/mm3);

          -  Absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1.5 x 109/L (&lt;1500/mm3);

          -  Platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L (&lt;100,000/mm3);

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min based on the Cockcroft Gault calculation or
             serum creatinine less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values less than 2
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum total bilirubin lower or equal 1.5 x ULN (Patients with suspicion of Gilbert
             disease who have serum bilirubin level lower or equal 3 x ULN may be enrolled).

          -  Clinically normal cardiac function based on the institutional lower limit of normal
             for-left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed either by multi-gated acquisition
             scan or cardiac ultrasound, 12 lead ECG without clinically relevant abnormalities.

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum (or urine)
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment.

        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of
        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight,
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.

          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control
             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at
             least 5 months after the last dose of treatment. A highly effective method of birth
             control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1%
             per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:

          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
             injectable, implantable)

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

          -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

          -  Vasectomized partner

          -  Sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient)

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             dose of study treatment and until 6 months after the last study treatment.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             International Conference on Harmonization/ Good Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP), and
