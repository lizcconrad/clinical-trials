    <textblock>
      One of the missions of the Memory of Resources and Research Center (CMRR) is to establish a
      diagnosis of expertise in patients with amestic, language or behavioral cognitive complaint.
      Thanks to the dosage of specific biomarkers in the cererbrospinal fluid (CSF), it is
      currently possible to determine the underlying process of the disease in vivo by assess the
      pathological amyloid and Tau profile. To obtain these very sensitive and specific biomarkers,
      clinicians need to perform lumbar puncture (LP). . This exam is easy and reproducible but the
      gesture image remained negative despite some advances in the materials and care..

      Within the Department of Neurology of Montpellier, the recommendations of the Haute Autorité
      de Santé (HAS) about pain management in adults are applied. A transdermal device of
      lidocaine-pilocaine (type EMLA) is applied 120 minutes before the LP . In addition, an
      equimolar oxygen-nitrous oxide (MEOPA) mixture could be added. Then, patients benefit from a
      helping relationship before and during the gesture dedicated to reduce anxiety.

      Until recently, non-medicinal techniques (relaxation, hypnosis ...) were not recommendedin
      cases of major anxiety or analgesia deemed insufficient. Many studies have shown the
      efficiency of hypnoalgia in invasive gestures in young children. The University Hospital of
      Montpellier have developed training about hypnoanalgesia and have been implemented for
      patients with neurological disorders in our unit. A reduction and even a suppression of pain
      and a limitation of the apprehension of the gesture have been judged satisfactory both for
      the patient, the practionner and the nurse practicing regularly the LP. However, this
      evalusation remained subjective and clinically-based. Thus, it seems relevantto analyse the
      effect of this technic in order th test the following hypothesis: hypno-analgesia
      (non-medicinal technique of care) associated with EMLA patch is more effective than the
      helping relationship associated with EMLA patch to reduce the pain that may inverse during
      the LP for diagnosis in patient with mild to moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease.

      The main objective was to assess whether the use of hypnoanalgesia technic during the LP
      procedure comparing to commun procedure reduce the pain of the patient evaluated by the
      hetero-evaluation ALGOPLUS scale.

      Secondary objectives were to evaluate the differences between the hypno-analgesia and the
      helping relationship on:

        -  pain assessed by the Simple Verbal Scale (EVS);

        -  pain assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (EVA);

        -  pain and stress measured by conductance analysis;

        -  the anxiety score assessed by a STAI self-assessment questionnaire (State-Trait Anxiety
           Inventory, STAI-Y);

        -  the rate of failure during the LP procedure.

      Methodology :

      A monocentric randomized controlled, open-label (with an evaluation of the blind
      randomization of the randomization arm) with two parallel arms:

        -  the arm named &quot;hypno-analgesia + EMLA patch&quot; = cutaneous anesthesia associated with
           hypno-analgesia.

        -  the arm called &quot;helping relationship + EMLA patch&quot; = cutaneous anesthesia associated
           with a helping relationship The estimated number of patients was 100. Analysis of the
           primary outcome measure: The score of the ALGOPLUS scale will compared between the two
           groups of patients using the Chi2 test after checking the validity conditions of the
           test.

      The project will last 36 months and the duration of the inclusions 24 months. The LP will be
      carried out during one day of hospitalization as part of the diagnosis assessments. No
      specific follow-up is scheduled.
