  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD),interleukin-6 (IL-6) may play an important
      role in facilitating plasma cells to produce pathological aquaporin 4 (AQP4) autoantibody.
      Inhibition of IL-6 signaling pathway by Tocilizumab (ACTEMRAÂ®), a humanized monoclonal
      antibody may have shown beneficial clinical effects in a few patients with NMOSD.

      Larger scale clincial trials may be needed to observe its efficacy and safety. Here, by
      choosing azathioprine, one of the most frequently used medication in case of relapses, the
      investigators compare the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in preventing NMOSD attacks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators primarily aim to observe the time to first relapse from initiation of
      tocilizumab or azathioprine treatment. The proportion of participants who experience
      relapse-free in one year follow-up will be compared.

      The secondary outcomes are to determine: The safety profile of tocilizumab and azathioprine
      in participants with NMO and whether tocilizumab improves visual function, Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS), et al.
