  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the safety and performance of Silimed® silicone gel breast implants
      with a textured surface and Silimed® silicone gel breast implants with polyurethane coated
      surface. Female patients who underwent primary breast augmentation using Silimed® breast
      implants will be followed-up through 10 years. The safety of each type of Silimed® breast
      implant is going to be assessed by estimating the known and unexpected short- and long-term
      risk / adverse event rates. The performance of each type of Silimed® breast implant is going
      to be assesses by estimating the satisfaction and quality of life after implantation.

        Women aged 18 years old or older who have undergone breast augmentation using Silimed®
        silicone gel-filled breast implants with textured surface or Silimed® silicone gel-filled
        breast implants with polyurethane foam coated surface.

          -  secondary enlargement of the breasts,

          -  pregnant or breastfeeding,

          -  neoplasia of any type not yet treated or being treated at the time of implantation,

          -  infection in activity not yet treated or in treatment at any site at the time of
             implantation,

          -  reporting or recording of adverse reactions or intolerance to polyurethane or silicone

          -  immune diseases affecting active connective tissue or under treatment (eg lupus
             erythematosus, discoid lupus, scleroderma, etc.) at the time of implantation,

          -  signs of inflammation of the breast or implant site at the time of implantation,

          -  high surgical risk or complications in the immediate postoperative period prior to
             implantation,

          -  drug use that increase the risk of immediate postoperative complications (eg drugs
             that interfere with coagulation) prior to implantation,

          -  participant can not have participated in another clinical trial up to 6 months before
             implantation

          -  any other condition that, based on the investigator or designee, may prevent the
             provision of informed consent, make study participation unsafe, compromise adherence
             to the protocol, complicate the interpretation of data from the study outcome, or
             otherwise interfere with the achievement of study objectives.
