  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the DBS to the
      fornix/NbM among patients who are diagnosed as AD according to a series of evaluations
      including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and molecular imaging examinations; The
      secondary goal is to compare the efficacy among the two treatment groups of different
      targets.
