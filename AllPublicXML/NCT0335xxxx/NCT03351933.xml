  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single-arm study in which approximately 28 Hepatitis A
      virus (HAV)-seronegative healthy subjects will be enrolled. There will be a screening period
      of up to 28 days during which subjects will be screened for enrollment in the study.

      Healthy subjects will receive a single intramuscular (IM) dose of GamaSTAN (0.2 mL/kg),
      followed by a pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling period of 150 days (approximately 5 half-lives).
      The protective levels of anti-HAV antibodies will be assessed up to 60 days after the
      administration of GamaSTAN. A PK curve will be obtained during the PK sampling period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single-arm study design, in which approximately 28
      subjects will receive the same study treatment (0.2 mL/kg dose via IM injection). There is no
      reference therapy in this study.

      The study will be explained to each subject prior to the subject providing written informed
      consent. All subjects will be screened to ensure that all the inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria are met.

      A sufficient number of healthy male and female subjects will be qualified by screening
      assessments and procedures for reporting to the clinical site on Day -1. The healthy subjects
      will receive a single IM dose of GamaSTAN (0.2 mL/kg) on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged
      from the clinic on Day 2, following the scheduled assessments and procedures, and will return
      to the clinical site for the remaining ambulatory PK samples and safety monitoring, and again
      for the final visit (Day 150).

      The total duration of study participation for subjects who complete the study will be
      approximately 178 days.
