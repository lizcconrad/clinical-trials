      Using American Fertility Society classification of intrauterine adhesions, the efficacy of a
      new crosslinked hyaluronan gel in reducing intrauterine adhesion formation after dilatation
      and curettage for delayed miscarriage in women without previous dilatation and curettage was
      examined.

      Study Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a new crosslinked hyaluronan gel in reducing
      intrauterine adhesions formation after dilatation and curettage.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Settings: Six hospitals for maternal and child health
      care in China. Patients: Three hundred women undergoing dilatation and curettage for delayed
      miscarriage without previous dilatation and curettage.

      Interventions: Women were randomly assigned into either dilatation and curettage alone group
      or dilatation and curettage plus new crosslinked hyaluronan gel application group with 1:1
      allocation.

      Measurements and Outcomes: All patients were evaluated using American Fertility Society
      classification of IUAs during the follow-up diagnostic hysteroscopy, scheduled 3 months after
      dilatation and curettage procedure. The primary outcome was the number of women with IUAs,
      and the secondary outcome was the adhesion scores and the severity of IUAs.
