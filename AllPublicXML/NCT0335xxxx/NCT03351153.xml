      To verify that CT scan and X-ray can predict the collapse of the necrotic femoral head before
      hip arthroplasty and effectively guide the surgical management.

    <textblock>
      Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common and frequently occurring disease. The
      main clinical manifestations are hip pain and dysfunction. The etiology and pathogenesis of
      ONFH caused by various reasons are the problems that have not been solved yet in the field of
      orthopedics. If want to achieve satisfactory therapeutic effect, surgical choice is
      essential. It is very important for prognosis to master the indications of operation and take
      appropriate treatment measures, especially the great difference between palliative surgery
      and hip arthroplasty.

      To determine whether the femoral head collapses and the degree of collapse of the articular
      cartilage of the femoral head can help physicians to select an optimal surgical plan. Chinese
      scholars commonly believe that if the femoral head collapse is less than 2 mm, investigators
      can choose autologous bone graft, allogeneic bone graft and other palliative surgery. If the
      femoral head collapse is more than 2 mm, investigators can choose total hip arthroplasty.
      However, above standard has not been extensively accepted worldwide.
