  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 concentrations of NVK-002 compared to
      Vehicle (placebo) for slowing the progression of myopia in children over a 3 year treatment
      period.

      Stage 2: To observe safety and efficacy in subjects re-randomized to one (1) year of
      treatment with NVK-002 or Vehicle following 3 years of treatment in children with progressive
      myopia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 3-arm randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study
      conducted in 2 stages.

      Stage 1 is a safety and efficacy phase of 3 years in duration, during which subjects will be
      allocated to 1 of 3 study medications.

      Stage 2 is a randomized cross-over phase of 1 year in duration, during which subjects will be
      re-randomized to receive 1 of the 3 study medications, with subjects initially randomized to
      Vehicle only eligible for randomization to low or high-dose NVK-002.

      Treatment arms are:

        -  NVK-002 low dose concentration

        -  NVK-002 high dose concentration

        -  Vehicle (placebo)

    <masking_description>If subjects meet eligibility criteria at the Screening/Baseline visit (Day 0), subjects will be randomly assigned to masked study medication.
The study will be double masked. The study medication will be provided in identical-appearing laminated pouches with no labeling indicating the identity of the study group or the contents of the ampules. The laminated pouches will contain identical-appearing ampules. Study subjects and study management personnel will be masked to the identity of treatment until after the final database lock.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children aged 3 to â‰¤ 17.0 years.

          2. Myopia SER of at least -0.50 D and no greater than -6.00 D myopia in each eye as
             measured by cycloplegic autorefraction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If present, astigmatism more than -1.50 D in either eye.

          2. Current or history of amblyopia or strabismus.

          3. History of any disease or syndrome that predisposes the subject to severe myopia
             (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Stickler syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity).

          4. History in either eye of abnormal ocular refractive anatomy (e.g., keratoconus,
             lenticonus, spherophakia).

          5. Serious systemic illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject
             ineligible.

          6. Chronic use (more than 3 days per week) of any topical ophthalmic medications
             (prescribed or over the-counter) other than the assigned study medication.
