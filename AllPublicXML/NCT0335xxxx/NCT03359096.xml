      A new, well-tolerated treatment for obstructive sleep apnea - tongue stimulation - is a
      device which opens the airway during sleep and can provide treatment for patients unable to
      use the mask and hose treatment. The study will evaluate the effect of this new treatment on
      blood pressure and heart-related measures to see if it lowers patients' risk of heart
      problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea, repetitive airway blockage during sleep, affects 1 in 10 Americans.
      If left untreated, it results in decreased quality of life and increased risk of heart
      problems. Only half of these people are able to use the main treatment (CPAP) which involves
      wearing a mask and hose at night. A new, well-tolerated treatment - tongue stimulation - is a
      device which opens the airway during sleep and can provide treatment for patients unable to
      use the mask and hose treatment. The study will evaluate the effect of this new treatment on
      blood pressure and heart-related measures to see if it lowers patients' risk of heart
      problems.

    <description>Prior to enrollment in this study, the HGNS will have been implanted as part of clinical care, and a therapeutic voltage setting will have been determined via overnight sleep study The pulse generator, using technology from cardiac pacemakers, utilizes the signal from the pressure sensor for timing of stimulation to the tongue nerve. Patient will undergo activation of the implanted device one month post-operatively. A functional threshold (in volts) is obtained based on tongue motion during device stimulation. For the next month, the patient will have steadily increased stimulation strength by 0.1V every 2-3 nights within the preset range until the upper limit is reached.</description>
