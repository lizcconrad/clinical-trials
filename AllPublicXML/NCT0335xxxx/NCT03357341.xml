  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility of collecting increasing amounts of
      clinical study data from subjects through sensor and web/app based methods and integrating it
      with data from their EHR to facilitate more efficient and meaningful research with acceptable
      quality. Approximately 100 subjects with asthma and 100 subjects with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) will be enrolled in this prospective study. The subjects will be
      identified through integrated EHR records following which eligible subjects will receive
      study devices and training on proper use of the devices at Baseline visit. Data will be
      collected remotely from subject reports, devices and sensors over six months.
