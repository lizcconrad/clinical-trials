  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy
      subjects with multiple intravenous administration of the neuroprotectant YC-6 compared to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tPA administration within 3-4.5 hours after stroke onset has been the only approved therapy
      and thus no more than 7% of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) victims worldwide benefited from tPA.
      A neuroprotectant, YC-6, showed therapeutic effects in preclinical animal models of AIS,
      indicating its potential as alternative or combined treatment against human AIS.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to explore safety and
      tolerability in healthy Chinese adult volunteers with dose-escalating intravenous infusion of
      YC-6 for 7 consecutive days. 6 subjects for YC-6 and 2 for placebo will be allocated in each
      level. Blood and urine samples of each subject will be used in determination of
      pharmacokinetic properties of the investigational drug.
