    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participants, between 18 and 65 years of age, who have a diagnosis of
             moderately to severely active RA for at least 6 months as defined by at least 6
             swollen joints (66 joint count) and at least 6 tender joints (68 joint count) at
             Screening and Baseline (Day 1), and DAS28-CRP&gt;3.2 at Screening. If a joint has both
             swollen and tender symptoms, then the joint will be included in both the swollen
             joints and tender joint categories.

          2. Current treatment for RA:

               1. Must be currently receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a
                  dose of 10 25 mg per week for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1. The dose should
                  be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients must have had an
                  inadequate response to small molecule or biologic DMARD therapy.

               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as per
                  local practice) or equivalent during the entire study (mandatory co-medication
                  for MTX treatment).

               3. Inadequate response to biologic DMARDs: anakinra and etanercept must be withdrawn
                  at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1; tocilizumab must be withdrawn at least 12 weeks
                  prior to Day 1; other agents must be withdrawn at least 12 weeks or 5 half-lives
                  (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1.

               4. Inadequate response to small molecule DMARDs (other than MTX): Leflunomide must
                  be withdrawn at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1 or a minimum of 2 weeks prior to Day
                  1 if after 11 days of standard cholestyramine washout. Lower than 400 mg/day of
                  oral hydroxychloroquine or lower than 250 mg/day of oral chloroquine is allowed,
                  but the dose should be stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1 until Week 24
                  (if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been discontinued, they must have been
                  withdrawn at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1). Other DMARDs must be withdrawn at
                  least 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

               5. Tripterygium wilfordii: ongoing therapy is allowed, but the dose should be stable
                  for at least 12 weeks prior to Day 1 until Week 24; if discontinued, T.wilfordii
                  treatment must have been withdrawn at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

               6. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids, the dose must not
                  exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline
                  (Day 1) the dose must remain stable until Week 24; if discontinued, oral
                  corticosteroids must have been withdrawn at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

               7. Intra-articular and parenteral corticosteroids are not permitted within 6 weeks
                  prior to Baseline Day 1 and throughout the trial (until Week 24), with the
                  exception of IV administration of 100 mg methylprednisolone 30 minutes prior to
                  each infusion as this is part of the trial procedures.

               8. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable for
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1; if discontinued, NSAIDs must have been withdrawn
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

          3. Males or females of child-bearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception for 12 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial
             (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, patch, intrauterine device, physical barrier).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. ACR functional Class IV or wheelchair/bed bound.

          2. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including
             known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection and Positive HIV.

          3. Active tuberculosis (e.g., chest X-ray images of active tuberculosis); for those who
             have used TNF-α antagonist or in the opinion of the investigator, QUANTIFERON®-TB GOLD
             will be tested and the positive patients will be excluded.

          4. Congestive heart failure (Class III or IV of New York Heart Association)

          5. Interstitial lung disease (except mild).

         12. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease such as, but not limited to,
             nervous system, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders which, in the
