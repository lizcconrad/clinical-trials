  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open-label controlled study in which the Pocket-X Gel, a
      periodontal in-situ gelling product, or Pocket-X Chip, a periodontal film, will be applied to
      periodontal pockets in one/two mouth segment(s) of participants following scaling and root
      planing on the entire mouth, while the contra-lateral segment(s) will serve as control. The
      aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of Pocket-X Gel and Pocket-X Chip
      in improving the healing of the gingiva and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the
      periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing.

      This study is a prospective open-label study that investigates the safety and efficacy of
      Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ gelling product and Pocket-X Chip, a periodontal film, in
      improving the healing of the gingiva and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the
      periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing.

      The study includes 2 different arms. Both groups will undergo 1-4 sessions of scaling and
      root planing, which is the conventional treatment for periodontal disease. One group will
      undergo treatment with Pocket-X Gel, which will be inserted into periodontal pockets present
      in one/two of the participants mouth segments, following scaling and root planing. The other
      mouth segments will not undergo further intervention. Another group will undergo treatment
      with Pocket-X Chip, which will be inserted into periodontal pockets present in one/two of the
      participants mouth segments. The other mouth segments will not undergo further intervention.

      The rationale for the study is the hypothesis that a physical barrier inserted into
      periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing would assist in maintaining the pocket
      clean by preventing bacteria from re-entering the cleaned pocket, thus allowing the gums to
      properly heal and seal the pockets while preventing further inflammation.

    <description>Pocket-X Gel is a biodegradable in-situ gelling product that is inserted into a pre-cleaned periodontal pocket where it quickly turns into a gel that adheres to the periodontal pocket and acts as a filler and physical barrier against bacterial re-colonization at the site of application. Administration of this product typically causes no discomfort. The product naturally degrades after 1-3 weeks.</description>

    <description>Pocket-X Chip is a biodegradable film that is inserted into a pre-cleaned periodontal pocket where it absorbs fluids and swells. The film then acts as a filler and physical barrier against bacterial re-colonization at the site of application. Administration of this product typically causes no discomfort.
