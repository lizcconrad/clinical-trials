  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the present study is to verify in a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge
      (DBPCFC) test that highly purified barley starch ingredient do not cause allergic reaction in
      subjects most potential to get allergic reaction due to ingredient. Hypothesis is that none
      of the cereal (mostly primarily wheat) allergic subject recruited to the study will obtain
      allergic reaction neither to placebo nor to the test ingredient. Scoring of symptoms during
      the challenges will be based on PRACTALL.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age = 1-20 years

          -  Diagnosed or suspected cereal allergy (at least to one of the following cereals wheat,
             barley or rye)

          -  Response to cereal proteins confirmed within 2 months in an oral food challenge (OFC)*
             OR response to cereal proteins confirmed in an OFC more than 2 months ago but
             clinically verifiable and documented ongoing cereal allergy at the time of inclusion
             OR diagnosis confirmed in an OFC with wheat performed as part of the study procedures.

          -  Voluntarily signed informed consent (including willingness to refrain from cereal
             containing foods for 1 week before intervention period and be exposed to cereal
             proteins in the test for eligibility)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complex food allergy which make elimination diet impossible to accomplish

          -  Patients experiencing unstable or exacerbated atopic disease, such as asthma, atopic
             dermatitis (AD), urticaria, or allergic rhinitis.

          -  Diseases and conditions that might affect safety. Patients should not be challenged if
             they have chronic medical the event of anaphylaxis/treatment of anaphylaxis. Examples
             of such conditions include unstable angina pectoris, cardiac disease or dysrhythmias,
             severe chronic lung disease.

          -  Pregnancy should be ruled out by testing or based on history (e.g, before menarche) as
             appropriate

          -  Use of oral corticosteroids. Inhaled and topical steroids or anti-inflammatory
             medications, such as calcineurin inhibitors or leukotriene antagonists and b-agonists,
             used at the lowest doses possible and on an established schedule by using fixed doses
             of medication to maintain a low and stable baseline of atopic disease. Latter
             medication can usually be continued because their use is unlikely to significantly
             influence challenge outcomes and their withdrawal might result in exacerbations,
             affecting disease management and challenge interpretation.

          -  Use of antihistamines during the last 4 days before DBPC challenge or period of 5
             half-lives of specific agent.

          -  Prolonged high dose steroids, omalizumab, or possibly other new drugs to control
             atopic disease upon decision of investigator.

          -  Aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme
             inhibitors, alcohol, antacids and Î²-blockers upon the decision of the investigator

          -  Any chronic condition or its medication that affect immune system
