  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators describe a simple and efficient method to give a premedication in the
      delivery room, using the umbilical vein, directly punctured through Wharton's jelly.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The umbilical vein is punctured to inject drugs efficiently. The access is simple, the
      umbilical vein is clearly visible, and a blood reflux can be found easily. The investigators
      used the same equipment required for a peripheral venous injection: 24 gauge cannula,
      antisepsis, compress, and a syringe with the prepared anesthetic drugs. The investigators
      report 5 cases of intubations in the delivery room using this method to administer the
      premedication.

    <description>All participants were preterm infants intubated in the delivery room for Infantile Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS). The purpose of this research is to determine a premedication of intubation. This consists of describing a simple and effective method for premedication in the delivery room, using the umbilical vein, directly perforated through the Wharton jelly.</description>
