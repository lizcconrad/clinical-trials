  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant mortality is still relevant despite the improvement and the accessibility of hospital
      care. Premature birth are two fold higher than in metropolitan France. Some factors has been
      suspected such as precariousness, alcoholism, congenital malformation, care accessibility,
      epidemic environment ... Nevertheless, the impact of these factors on foetal death or
      new-born death are not yet sufficiently quantified to provide appropriate care and prevention
      action in Reunion Island.

      Through the analysis of interview of the mothers that have lost their infant during pregnancy
      or just after birth, the study aims to draw a picture of the pregnancy cares offer and
      pregnancy conditions in Reunion Island.

      This study is an non interventional case-control study. Socio-economic conditions, pregnancy
      care and prevention are screened to identified the major cause of foetal or new-born death in
      Reunion Island. These data are still lacking and will be useful to identify which public
      health actions that should be organized.
