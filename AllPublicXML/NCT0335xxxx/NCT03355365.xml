  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Cross-over Study designed
      to determine efficacy of multiple intrathecal administrations of autologous mesenchymal stem
      cell-derived neural progenitor cells (MSC-NP) compared to placebo in patients with
      progressive multiple sclerosis. Efficacy will be measured through assessment of disability
      outcomes. Study participants will receive six intrathecal injections of culture-expanded
      autologous MSC-NPs at two month intervals in one year and six lumbar punctures as placebo
      treatment in a second year.

    <description>Changes in disability assessed based composite score of EDSS, timed 25 foot walk (T25FW), and nine hole peg test (9HPT) (EDSS-Plus). Improvement will be defined by at least one of the following three measures: ≥0.5 improvement in EDSS, ≥20% improvement in T25FW, and ≥20% improvement in 9HPT in either dominant or non-dominant upper limb. Scores will be compared individually between baseline and post-treatment. Assessments will be made at baseline and 3 months after the 6th treatment/placebo in each crossover group (month 0, 13, and 27).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MS as defined by the McDonald criteria

          -  Diagnosis of primary progressive or secondary progressive MS

          -  Between the ages of 18-70 years

          -  Significant disability shown by an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of greater
             than or equal to 3.0, and less than or equal to 6.5, that was not acquired within the
             last 12 months.

          -  Stable disease state as evidenced by a lack of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on an MRI
             and by a stable MRI disease burden (number of T2 lesions and size of lesions) in the
             last six months and no significant change in EDSS (1 point or more) in the last 12
             months

          -  Must agree to undergo four MRIs: at the time of enrollment, after year 1, after year
             2, and after year 3

          -  Patients either within the geographical area or who are able to arrange reliable
             travel during the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  EDSS greater than 6.5

          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers, or any woman intending to become pregnant in the next
             three years

          -  All patients will have screening blood tests done. Only patients whose values are in
             the normal range as determined by the laboratory norms based on age and sex will be
             allowed to participate. Exceptions may be made for borderline normal laboratory values
             manifesting no clinical symptoms at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Use of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of
             study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure

          -  Any patients with a history of or with active malignancy

          -  Use of steroids within three months of the study start date, as this would suggest an
             active disease state

          -  History of cirrhosis due to increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) infection

          -  Significantly uncontrolled hypertension because of increased risk for stroke or CNS
             hemorrhage.

          -  Patients with active thyroid disease resulting in hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
             (Only well controlled patients with labs in the normal range will be included) because
             of hormone influence on cell growth

          -  History of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to
             increased risk of CNS infection

          -  Preexisting blood disease (such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia,
             thrombocytopenia, or significant anemia) due to invasive nature of bone-marrow
             aspiration

          -  Previous or current history of a coagulation disorder

          -  Any metal in the body, which is contraindicated for MRI studies

          -  Patients with alcohol or other substance abuse problems

          -  Other major disease that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would preclude
             participation in the study

          -  Patients with Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis, HIV-1, or HIV-2.

          -  Any evidence of significant cognitive dysfunction based on a screening history and
             physical examination because it would preclude giving a truly informed consent

          -  Patients who are enrolled in another clinical trial for MS treatment or who have
             received any study drug/biologics within the last 6 months

          -  Patients who are anticipated to have difficultly accessing the intrathecal space
             related to scoliosis, obesity, or any other relevant factors determined by the PI.
