  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-centre observational study over one year investigating the mechanisms of muscle
      homeostasis in patients with acute skeletal muscle atrophy following major aortic surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients who are critically ill develop a syndrome of muscle weakness called Intensive
      Care Unit Acquired Paresis. This syndrome involves the development of severe muscle wasting
      and weakness and affects all skeletal muscles including the muscles which help one breathe.
      Muscle wasting and weakness whilst critically ill cause prolongation of mechanical
      ventilation, longer stays on the ICU, reduced mobility and prolonged rehabilitation in
      survivors. It has also been shown to increase the risk of death on ICU, due to an inability
      to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Most patients recover; however in some, the
      effects last for many years and patients may not recover fully.

      Although there is some understanding of why this syndrome develops, the molecular processes
      underlying the muscle wasting are not well understood. From the current scientific evidence,
      the investigators have identified a group or family of proteins believed to be important in
      the development of this condition, the activity of which are regulated by disease processes
      thought to lead to Intensive Care Unit Acquired Paresis (e.g. infection, inflammation,
      oxidative stress, immobility).

      This research aims to investigate the role of these proteins in human tissue from patients
      who are at risk of Intensive Care Unit Acquired paresis. Even patients who do not go on to
      develop the full syndrome, in the early stages of ICU care, show some signs of muscle changes
      and loss of strength.
