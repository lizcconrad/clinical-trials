      The main objective of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of Psorax35
      supplementation in patients with mild to moderate Psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common, genetically predisposed, inflammatory and proliferative disease of the
      skin, the most characteristic lesions consisting of chronic, sharply demarcated, dull-red
      scaly plaques, particularly on extensor parts of limbs and in the scalp. Psoriasis can be
      divided into mild, moderate or severe psoriasis based on the extent of the skin changes

      Psorax35, which is extracted from herring roe are shown to improve the condition of people
      with psoriasis.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect, safety, and mechanism of action of
      Psorax35 on mild to moderate Psoriasis and comorbidities associated with psoriasis through a
      32-weeks study.

      The participants will be randomized into one of two arms; Psorax35 and Placebo. The study
      will include a total of 6 treatment visits involving Blood samples, Photo documentation,
      Psoriasis and Severity index (PASI), Body surface area (BSA), Physician's Static Global
      Assessment (PSGA), Life quality index (EQ-5D, VAS and DLQI), Blood pressure, Blood rate, Body
      Mass Index (BMI), Waist circumference, Waist/hip ratio, and 24 hrs dietary recall. At visit 4
      Blood samples, Blood pressure, Blood rate, BMI, Waist circumference, Waist/hip ratio, and 24
      hrs dietary recall are not included.
