  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis-associated Tumor is very rare bone tumor. The investigator set up the
      biobank to ensure every patient has the chance to participate in future research
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Samples of blood and other stored material such as slides,frozen tissues or leftover
      diagnostic material.

      Questionnaire information, including health history, growth and development, physical
      activity and family medical history information.

      If patients have been diagnosed with a neurofibromatosis-associated tumor or another
      condition the investigator is interested inï¼Œ the investigator will ask the patient to release
      medical record information relating to diagnosis and treatment of
      neurofibromatosis-associated tumor, other cancers, blood disorders, and similar conditions.

      The investigator will collect specimen and blood. If the investigator finds out that the
      sample doesn't have enough cells to be useful, the investigator may call for an additional
      sample.
