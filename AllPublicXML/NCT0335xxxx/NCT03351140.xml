  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct in-person qualitative interviews of subjects who
      have different tumor types to identify and assess relevant PROMIS physical function items
      that can be utilized in future studies. Health Research Associates (HRA) will conduct
      qualitative interviews in subjects with a variety of cancer types. PROMIS is a set of
      self‐report measurement tools, developed by the United States (US) National Institutes for
      Health (NIH). The most recent version of PROMIS Physical Function Item Bank contains 165
      items assessing a range of abilities and its subset, a 45-item PROMIS Function Cancer Item
      Bank which contains questions relevant to subjects with cancer. Approximately 150 subjects
      with five tumor types will be recruited. HRA will conduct the interviews that will be
      audio-recorded for transcription and analysis. Five tumor types that will be focused on are
      Breast, Prostate, Non‐Small‐Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Multiple Myeloma, and Diffuse Large
      B‐Cell (DLBCL) or Follicular Lymphoma. Interviews will be conducted in English language in
      private areas within clinic site or rented meeting facilities and will last approximately for
      60-90 minutes.

    <description>Subjects will participate in a qualitative interview lasting up to 90 minutes. The interviews will include a concept elicitation component to explore details of the subject's perceived disease condition, functional limitations and impacts on daily life and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). In addition, a card sorting exercise will be used to evaluate the relevance and comprehension of PROMIS Physical Function items.</description>

             condition or disorder that could compromise his/her ability to give written informed
             consent and/or prevent or interfere with the Subject's ability to successfully
             participate in a face‐to‐face interview and provide meaningful and non‐confounded
