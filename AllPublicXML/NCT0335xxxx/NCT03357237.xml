  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastroenteritis (GEA) is an inflammation of the intestinal mucosa that clinically
      translates into an acute episode of diarrhea and vomiting and is generally associated with an
      intestinal infectious disease. It is one of the most common diseases in children and an
      important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The important loss of liquids can lead
      to dehydration, acidosis and hydroelectrolitic alteration. Infants are more vulnerable to
      gastrointestinal infection and its consequences, dehydration and malnutrition.

      There is no specific treatment, so it is exclusively symptomatic

      A new type of products considered as mucoprotectors has been developed, such as gelatin
      tannate or xyloglucan, still with little data to establish recommendations on its use in the
      GEA. They would be able to reproduce in the intestine a muco-adhesive film or sheet
      protective It must be considered in this sense that mucus is the first barrier that protects
      the gastrointestinal tract against microorganisms or antigens and that bacterial invasion is
      related to the opening of narrow junctions.

      Xyloglucan was approved in Europe as a medical device IIa to restore the physiological
      functions of the intestinal wall in the form of capsules for adults and envelopes for
      children.

      A randomized, blinded study with a control group is proposed in this project to establish
      solidly the efficacy of xyloglucan in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children.

      The main variable of evaluation will be the duration of diarrhea, defined as the time it
      takes to normalize the consistency of stools (according to the Bristol or Amsterdam scale) or
      their number.

      Clinical trial in phase IV with medical product type IIa and CE marking, used in the same
      conditions in which it is marketed.
