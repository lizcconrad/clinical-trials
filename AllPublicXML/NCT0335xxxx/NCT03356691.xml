      Background: Complementary Spiritist Therapy (ECT) based on a range of therapeutic resources
      including prayer, spiritist &quot;passe&quot;, fluidotherapy (fluidic water or magnetized water),
      spirit education. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ECT in individuals at
      UFTM Hospital de Cl√≠nicas.

      Methods: Randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly. Patients will then be allocated
      into groups:

        -  The group submitted to ECT (prayer, spiritual education, spiritist &quot;passe&quot; and fluidized
           water or prayer or spiritist &quot;passe&quot; or laying on of hands with intent to heal or laying
           on of hands with intent to heal or fluidized water or no-fluidized water or Control
           group (CG) will not be submitted to any intervention.

      Distribution of subjects according to the group to be worked and place of data collection:

      Group to be worked:

      patients hospitalized in the medical and surgical clinic, orthopedics, neurology, emergency
      adult , gynecology and obstetrics and employees of the clinic hospital

                person alternating with passing their hands repeatedly on or over the person,
                positioned lying in the dorsal position, distance about 10 to 15 cm and apply the
                spiritist pass for 2 to 3 minutes. Individuals will be directed to direct the
                thoughts in heath during the intervention;

             4. Fluid Therapy by means of magnetized or fluidized water: you will be asked to stand
                in front of the table containing a tray with 20 ml water cups, to place hands on
                the cups wishing health and healing intentions, for approximately 2 minutes .

      The total time of interventions will be about 10-15 minutes.

        -  The control group (CG) will not be submitted to any intervention.

        -  The Spiritist &quot;passe&quot; be submitted to Spiritist &quot;passe&quot;: To carry out the spiritist
           pass, the passers-by will be asked to position themselves in front of the participant,
