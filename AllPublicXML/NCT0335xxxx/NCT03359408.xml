  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sectorisation of the German health care system causes inefficient treatment, especially in
      elderly with cognitive impairments. At time of transition from hospitals into primary care it
      lacks, among others, coordination of post-operative care or timely communication between
      healthcare providers. This results in deterioration of disease and comorbidities, higher
      rates of re-admission and institutionalizations. Models of collaborative care have shown
      their efficacy in primary care. Main goal is to test the effectiveness of Dementia Care
      Management (DCM) for people with cognitive impairment to improve treatment and care across
      the in-hospital and primary care sector.

      The study design is a complex, longitudinal, multisite randomized controlled trial. It was
      designed to treat a hospital-based epidemiological cohort of people above the age of 70 with
      an adaption of DCM, a treatment proven to be effective in primary care, to the discharge
      setting. As part of this, specifically trained study staff will develop, implement and
      monitor a treatment and care plan, based on comprehensive assessments during the hospital
      stay, recommendations at discharge and unmet needs at home. For the 3 months after discharge
      study staff will coordinate treatment and care in close cooperation with the discharging
      hospital, treating physician and other care providers.

      Expected results from the study should facilitate the implementation of intersectoral care
      management systematically on a large scale. Thus, the benefits shown in the trial would be
      available to a larger population. Results will not be limited to PCI, but rather to any
      people transitioning between the in-hospital and the primary care sector. Thus, the benefits
      would be available to elderly people in general.

    <textblock>
      The German health care system is sectorized with health service providers offering a)
      outpatient treatment and care, b) inpatient treatment and care or c) rehabilitation. While
      treatment and care within these sectors can be considered to be of high quality, there is a
      lack of widely available approaches to deliver treatment and care across sectors. Treatment
      paths for people with chronic diseases or the requirements of elderly people suffering from
      multimorbidity need frequent transitions between sectors. However, in Germany boundaries of
      sectors are considered rigid and transitions between sectors are a threat to treatment
      continuity, which results in inefficient treatment. As this problem has been identified and
      described by the Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in the Health Care System
      (Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der Entwicklung im Gesundheitswesen) already in 20121,
      different approaches have been proposed. This study addresses the lack of integrated
      cross-sectoral approaches to overcome the challenges caused by the sectorized German health
      care system.There is sound scientific evidence internationally and nationally that
      collaborative concepts of care can improve treatment and care of people with dementia in
      primary care (Thyrian et al. 2017). Those concepts are person-centered in the sense of a)
      taking into account the individual needs, circumstances and priorities, and b) aiming at
      outcomes relevant to the individuals life, like everyday functionality, (health related)
      quality of life and social inclusion.

      The trial is a complex, longitudinal, multisite randomized controlled trial (intervention vs.
      care as usual). Recruitment of the study population will be conducted in two participating
      hospitals. After meeting the eligibility criteria, participants will be asked for written
      informed consent and randomized in either the intervention group or control group. With all
      participants a basic baseline assessment will be conducted (T0) in the hospital followed by a
      comprehensive assessment at the time of hospital discharge (T1). The intervention group will
      then receive the intervention, the control group care as usual. Further data assessments will
      be conducted at all participants´ home 3 months after discharge (T2) and at the participants´
      home 12 months after discharge (T3). A process evaluation will also be applied in this study.
      Data assessment will be conducted by specifically trained study staff. Places of assessment
      are chosen for the highest possible convenience for the participants. Data assessments will
      include a) primary data from the participants being assessed, computer-assisted, face-to face
      and paper-pencil, b) secondary data from patient records in the hospital and from treating
      physicians.

      The main research question of this protocol addresses the effectiveness of Dementia Care
      Management (DCM) in the intersectoral setting for people with cognitive impairment (PCI) in
      treatment and care across the in-hospital and primary care sector. The investigators will
      test the hypothesis if PCI receiving DCM initiated in hospitals and continued after discharge
      into ambulatory care do have better health and social outcomes after one year than PCI not
      receiving DCM. The patient-oriented minor hypotheses of this protocol are: ICM improves (a)
      health related quality of life sustainable, (b) social functioning and integration and (c)
      adequate treatment and care for dementia and co-morbidities in the ambulatory setting. It
      reduces (d) the risk for drug related problems in cognitive impairment and comorbidities and
      (e) the risk for re-admission to the hospital. The intervention prevents (f) incident
      delirium - given better awareness in respect to precipitating factors. The healthcare
      provider-oriented minor hypotheses are: ICM (a) reduces re-admission rates and thus saves
      costs in the inpatient setting. It increases (b) the chances to delay institutionalization
      significantly and thus saves costs from perspective of statutory health insurance. It (c)
      improves communication and exchange between treatment and care provider from different health
      care sectors sustainable. Furthermore, this protocol evaluates the process of implementing
      ICM along the main research question: How is ICM evaluated and rated among the different
      groups affected by it? Specific research questions are: What are the perceived benefits for
      (a) the providers (in the inpatient setting, (b) providers in the ambulatory setting, (c) the
      PCI and their caregiver? Is ICM evaluated as (d) improving communication and exchange between
      treatment and care provider from different health care sectors sustainable? And last not
      least, (e) what are the enablers and barriers to implement ICM in routine care?

    <description>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings 1997) will be used. The NPI represents an interview by proxy on twelve dimensions of neuropsychiatric behaviors, i.e. delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. The presence (0= no, 1= yes) is asked. If present, the severity (rated 1 through 3; mild to severe) and frequency (1 to 4, rarely to very often) of each neuropsychiatric symptom are rated on. Thus the score for each dimension ranges from 0 = not present, 1= mildly and rarely to 12 = severe and often. A total NPI score is calculated as the sum of the frequency by severity scores of each domain range: 0 to 144, the higher the more neuropsychiatric symptomatic).</description>
