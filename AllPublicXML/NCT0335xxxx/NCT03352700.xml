  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled study, consecutive outpatients scheduled for elective
      colonoscopy were randomized into two groups. Group A patients (n = 300) used only 3L PEG
      before colonoscopy. Patients in group B (n = 300) were additionally advised to Dyclonine
      Hydrochloride Mucilage plus 3L PEG, The overall quality of colonoscopy cleaning was evaluated
      using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale by a single endoscopist who was blinded to the
      intervention. Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and adenoma
      detection rate (ADR). Difficulty of procedure, and adverse events were also evaluated.

    <description>The amount of intraluminal air bubbles was classified into four grades as shown below: Grade 0 = No or minimal scattered bubbles; Grade 1 = Bubbles covering at least half the luminal diameter; Grade 2 = Bubbles covering the circumference of the lumen; Grade 3 = Bubbles filling the entire lumen.
