  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized blinded study to assess the sedative effect of 150 mg TID tolperisone
      and 10 mg TID cyclobenzaprine compared to placebo on simulated driving performance and
      cognitive functioning in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose 3-way cross-over study of the
      safety and cognitive effects of multiple doses of 150 mg tolperisone administered TID in 30
      male and female healthy volunteers. Treatment groups include 450 mg tolperisone (i.e., 150 mg
      administered three times daily), 30 mg cyclobenzaprine (i.e., 10 mg administered three times
      daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive 3 days of each treatment.

      Subject participation will be approximately 3 weeks as outpatients with 3 days each week as
      overnight clinic participants.

      In this crossover study, treatment effects will be assessed following the second initial
      dose, the morning following nighttime dosing (to assess residual next day effects), and at
      steady state (i.e., following AM dosing on Day 3).

      Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1. Approximately one hour after the second dose
      on Day 1, subjects will be administered the cognitive test, followed by the driving simulator
      examination.

      On the morning of Day 2, prior to dosing, subjects will be readministered the cognitive test
      and driving examination to assess residual next day effects.

      Subjects will repeat cognitive testing and the driving examination on the morning of Day 3,
      after administration of the AM study medication, to evaluate the cumulative effects of 3 days
      of dosing.
