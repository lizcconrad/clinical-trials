  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the outcomes of phaco-DMEK (Descemet Membrane
      Endothelial Keratoplasty ) according to a sequential versus a combined procedure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included patients who underwent DMEK combined or not with cataract surgery between
      January 2014 and march 2016. Were excluded patients with other ocular comorbidity, and those
      who had graft after a first graft failure. The main outcome was BVCA measured at one year.
      The post-operative follow up was down at D7, M1, M3, M6, and M12. Secondary outcomes were;
      the mean time to visual recovery and influence of the delay between cataract removal and
      DMEK.
