      Cohort composed of mothers, who visited to prenatal care between 24 and 28 weeks of
      gestation, between 2001 and 2006. After the child was born then, we collected information at
      birth outcome and conducted mail surveys at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Regular check-up was
      conducted at 3, 5, and every year after 7 years of age(last check up point: 15 years old). In
      check-up survey, after an 8-hour overnight fast, blood and urine samples (3 ml EDTA-blood and
      5 ml serum) were obtained from subjects by venepuncture. following parameters were checked:
      physical growth, blood pressure. metabolic biomarker(Total cholesterol, HDl-cholesterol,
      TG(triglyceride), glucose, uric acid, etc.), K-CBCL(Korea-child behavior checklist), 24 hour
      recall method for nutrition, FFQ(Food Frequency Questionnaire), Questionnaires including
