  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish factors that influence the view at endoscopy. To achieve this
      patients, who have been already booked for endoscopy, will complete a questionnaire prior to
      their procedure. Demographic and endoscopist factors will also be ascertained.

      The view at endoscopy will then be reviewed and scored against a rating scale, which will be
      validated as a first phase of the study. Factors can then be sought that are associated with
      a good endoscopic view.
