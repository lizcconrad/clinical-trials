  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2983559, a selective receptor interacting
      protein 2 (RIP2) kinase inhibitor, to humans. This will be randomized, double-blinded
      (sponsor open) and two part study (A and B). Part A of the study is single ascending dose
      crossover design with two separate cohorts (1 and 2). In Part A, 9 single dose levels will be
      explored. In Cohort 1, 10 healthy subjects will randomized to receive single oral doses of
      either GSK2983559 or placebo in a ratio of 4:1 in 5 way cross-over design with 5 treatment
      periods. In Cohort 2, 8 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive single oral doses of
      either GSK2983559 or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 in 4 way cross-overs design with 4 treatment
      periods. In Cohort 2 there will be an additional period (period 5-open label) for assessing
      GSK2983559 under fed conditions. There will be 48 hours wash-out period between each dose
      escalation period. Part B is repeat ascending dose sequential group design. It will contain 4
      Cohorts of and dosing will be done sequential dosing. Subjects in Part B will receive once
      daily (QD) dose or twice daily dose (will be decided based upon the pharmacokinetic, safety
      and tolerability observed in Part A). There will 58 subjects involved in this study. Total
      duration of Part A will be approximately for 11 Weeks and Part B will be approximately for 15
      Weeks.

          -  Live or attenuated vaccine(s) within 30 days of randomization, or plans to receive
             such vaccines during the study or plans to receive a vaccine within 30 days + 5
             half-lives of the last dose of study medication.

          -  Regular alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the study defined as: An average
             weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is equivalent

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. As
             potential for and magnitude of immunosuppression with this compound is unknown,
             subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) should also be excluded.
             Subjects positive for HBsAg and/or positive for anti-HBc antibody (regardless of
             anti-HBs antibody status) are excluded.

             the subject may have the test repeated once, but they will not be eligible for the
             study unless the second test is negative. In cases where the QuantiFERON or T-spot
             test is positive, but a locally-read follow up chest x-ray, shows no evidence of
