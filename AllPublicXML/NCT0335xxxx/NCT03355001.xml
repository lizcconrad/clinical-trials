  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Monosyn® Quick non-interventional study (NIS) has been designed to implement an action
      within the framework of a proactive post-market surveillance system.

      The aim of this NIS is to collect systematically and proactively different clinical
      parameters regarding safety, effectiveness and performance of Monosyn® Quick suture material
      under the daily clinical practice when used as intended.

    <description>Effectiveness parameter: Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) The POSAS consists of two parts: a Patient Scale and an Observer Scale. Both scales contain six items that are scored numerically and make up a 'Total Score' of the Patient and Observer Scale. Each item of both scales has a 10-point score, with 10 indicating the worst imaginable scar or sensation. The lowest score is '1', and corresponds to the situation of normal skin (normal pigmentation, no itching etc), and goes up to the worst imaginable. The Total Score of both scales can be simply calculated by summing up the scores of each of the six items. The Total Score will therefore range from 6 to 60. Besides the six items the 'Overall Opinion' of the scar quality is scored separately of both patients and observers. [http://www.posas.org]</description>
