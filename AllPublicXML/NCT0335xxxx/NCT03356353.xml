  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) move blood from the left ventricle
      (the largest chamber of the heart) to the aorta (the body's main artery) to help the heart
      better meet the needs of the body and to improve survival for patients with advanced heart
      failure (HF). The ability of the right ventricle (the large chamber on the right side of the
      heart) to keep up with the improved blood flow following LVAD greatly effects how well a
      person does following surgery. It is understood that a high pulmonary artery pressure
      (pressure in the blood vessel that takes blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs)
      measured before surgery, indicates that a higher risk of right heart failure exists after
      LVAD implantation.

      This is important because right heart failure after surgery is related to longer intensive
      care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, increased morbidity (other health problems) including
      organ failure and worse outcomes following heart transplant, and increased death rates.

      Sildenafil (RevatioÂ®) has been approved by Health Canada in the treatment of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in patients with connective tissue
      disease. Sildenafil has not yet been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of pulmonary
      hypertension in heart failure. Sildenafil lowers blood pressure in the lungs and lessens the
      workload of the right ventricle (the right side of the heart). The purpose of this study is
      to determine if lowering blood pressure in the lungs, in heart failure patients at risk for
      developing right heart failure after LVAD implant, lowers the incidence of right heart
      failure, shortens ICU and hospital stays and reduces morbidity (other health problems) and
      mortality (death rates).

      This is an open label, single arm study. Everyone who participates in this study will receive
      sildenafil before and after LVAD surgery. It is expected that 24 patients who are scheduled
      to have LVAD implantation for advanced heart failure will be enrolled from 6 sites across
      Canada. Participants will be followed in the study for about 2 months.

    <textblock>
      Initially implanted as a bridge to transplantation, LVADs are increasingly used for the
      purpose of destination therapy. About 250 patients/year will receive LVAD device therapy in
      12 implanting Canadian centres. Outcomes after LVAD implantation are critically dependent on
      right ventricular (RV) function. Development of right heart failure (RHF) in LVAD patients
      has a direct effect on mortality and is associated with a prolonged length of intensive care
      unit (ICU) and hospital admission. RHF in LVAD patients leads to increased morbidity and is
      associated with worse outcomes after cardiac transplantation. Despite improvements in
      surgical and medical management the incidence of RHF after LVAD implantation has plateaued at
      approximately 20-30%. A critical concept in the prevention of post-operative complications
      involves appropriate patient selection and prophylactic measures directed toward risk factors
      for development of RHF. To mitigate the risk of RHF after LVAD implantation, many implanting
      centres are increasingly utilizing pulmonary vasodilating agents in the post-operative
      period. Despite little evidence to support this approach, the phosphodiesterase-5A (PDE5)
      inhibitor Sildenafil is now empirically administered for reduction of PVR in some centres
      after LVAD implantation. Duration of therapy varies but may extend beyond 3 months and in
      some cases may continue indefinitely or until the time of heart transplant. A small,
      single-centre, open label study demonstrated that Sildenafil effectively reduced PVR in LVAD
      patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension post-operatively, however only hemodynamic
      endpoints were examined. Importantly, the investigation of this strategy was limited to those
      with elevated PAP, irrespective of their clinical condition or pre-implantation hemodynamic
      profile. There is a clear need for further research to establish the safety and efficacy of
      pulmonary vasodilators to either treat or prevent RHF in the LVAD patient population.

      The investigators hypothesize that the vasodilatory effects of sildenafil can prevent or
      reverse the effects of elevated RV afterload and consequent RHF following LVAD implantation,
      and that preoperative initiation of therapy in an at-risk population is feasible and will be
      well tolerated. As such, there is a large potential for sildenafil to meet an unmet
      therapeutic need for patients following LVAD implantation.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of
      sildenafil therapy initiated prior to and continued after LVAD implantation for the purpose
      of reducing PVR in patients at increased risk for development of RHF by INTERMACS criteria.
      The feasibility of introducing sildenafil in this clinical setting along with the ability to
      reduce PVR will be assessed.

      Secondary Objectives: a) To determine the efficacy of sildenafil to reduce the need for
      prolonged inotropic support and post-operative ICU admission duration b) To determine the
      tolerability and feasibility of the proposed dosing strategy c) To determine the impact of
      sildenafil therapy on renal function and systemic arterial blood pressure d) To assess the
      impact of sildenafil therapy on the likelihood of development of post-operative RHF by
      INTERMACS criteria

      STUDY METHODS:

        1. Single-arm, open-label, prospective, multi-centre, interventional, feasibility and
           efficacy, pilot study of sildenafil in patients undergoing LVAD implantation.

        2. This multi (6)-centre, Canadian trial is investigator initiated and industry sponsored.
           The study design, coordination and conduction and other study tasks including monitoring
           will be performed by the study investigators.

      Following enrolment into the study, subjects will have their data (i.e. weight, blood
      pressure, pulse, lab work, medications, RHC data, ECG, physical exam), collected as
      standard-of-care (SOC), included in their study chart. Participants will be started on
      sildenafil at V1. If tolerated, subjects will be maintained on sildenafil pre and post-LVAD
      implementation. On day 14 (+/- 2 days) subjects will have a RHC to evaluate right heart
      function post-LVAD implantation. Subjects will return to the VAD (Ventricular Assist Device)
      Clinic for regular visits following discharge until day 55 (EOS) for similar data collection.
      Subjects will keep a daily sildenafil dosage diary from hospital discharge until day 55.
      Subjects will receive a brief telephone call at day 85 post LVAD implantation to evaluate
      safety and outcome data.
