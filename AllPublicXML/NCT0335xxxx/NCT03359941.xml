  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with vertebral compression fractures (VCF) may experience pain, limitation of daily
      activities, and various complications (e.g., insomnia, constipation, urinary infection,
      depression, diminished quality of life).

      Objective:

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of acupuncture
      treatments to achieve pain relief and functional recovery in patients with VCF.

      Patients who have subacute or chronic vertebral compression fracture in one or more
      thoracic/lumbar vertebral body are eligible. Patients who have willingness to participate and
      provide written informed consents will be treated to the Pusan National University Korean
      Medicine Hospital with once to three times per weak for six weeks approximately. (total 12-18
      sessions)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>VAS will be used to assess pain intensity reflecting average patient-perceived pain during the previous 24 hours. The scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction with treatment using the Patient Global Assessment(PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Response options include very much satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neutral, somewhat dissatisfied, and very much dissatisfied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Back-specific dysfunction using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks from the first treatment, 12 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire has 10 items to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section is scored on a 0-5 score. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life using the Quality-of-Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks from the first treatment, 12 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>QUALEFFO is used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The questionnaire includes 26 items in 5 domains; pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function using Time Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>TUG measures the time taken to stand from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, and return to sitting in the chair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events related to integrative treatments as a measure of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>under treatment, 6 weeks from the first treatment, 12 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Expected or unexpected adverse events will be measured during the allocated intervention process and during the entire follow-up period. Both the types of adverse events and their frequency of occurrence will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of medication for pain control during treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>under treatment, 6 weeks from the first treatment, 12 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Information on the use of medication will be collected by directly asking the patient at every visit. Medication type, dose, and frequency will be recorded and assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients who received surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks from the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients who participated in the trial but finally received surgery during the study period will be counted.</description>
