    <textblock>
      This is a 2‑arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double‑blind, international, multicenter
      study comparing the efficacy of DCC-2618 to placebo in patients who have received treatment
      with prior anticancer therapies. Prior anticancer therapies must include imatinib, sunitinib,
      and regorafenib (3 prior therapies). Approximately 120 patients will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio to DCC‑2618 150 mg QD or placebo

                  thromboplastin time ≤1.5 x ULN. Patients on a stable, maintenance regimen of
                  anticoagulant therapy for at least 30 days prior to study drug administration may
                  have PT/INR measurements &gt;1.5 x ULN if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the
                  patient is suitable for the study. An adequate rationale must be provided to the
                  Sponsor prior to randomization.

         10. Resolution of all toxicities from prior therapy to ≤Grade 1 (or baseline) within 1
             week prior to the first dose of study drug (excluding alopecia and ≤Grade 3 clinically
             asymptomatic lipase, amylase, and creatine phosphokinase laboratory abnormalities).

          4. Patient has known active central nervous system metastases.

          5. New York Heart Association class II - IV heart disease, active ischemia or any other
             uncontrolled cardiac condition such as angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring therapy, uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure.

             transporters within 14 days or 5 x the half‑life (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dose of study drug.

         13. Major surgeries (eg, abdominal laparotomy) within 4 weeks of the first dose of study
             drug. Following major surgeries, &gt;4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, all
             surgical wounds must be healed and free of infection or dehiscence.

         14. Any other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary
             disease, active infection, or any other condition, which in the judgment of the
             Investigator, could compromise compliance with the protocol, interfere with
             interpretation of the study results, or predispose the patient to safety risks.

         15. Known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C infection only if the patient is
             taking medications that are excluded per protocol, active hepatitis B, or active
             hepatitis C infection.

         16. If female, the patient is pregnant or lactating.

               -  requirement for intravenous alimentation active gastrointestinal bleeding,
                  unrelated to cancer, as evidenced by hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena in the
                  past 3 months without evidence of resolution documented by endoscopy or
                  colonoscopy.
