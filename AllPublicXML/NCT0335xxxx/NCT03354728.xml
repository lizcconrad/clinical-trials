    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of multi-antigen cytomegalovirus
      (CMV)-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine and to see how well it works in treating pediatric
      patients with positive cytomegalovirus who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant.
      Multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine may help people resist CMV
      life-threatening complications.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the optimal dose of multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine
      (Triplex) in CMV-positive pediatric patients receiving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched
      or mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (Phase I)

      II. To evaluate the safety profile of Triplex in this patient population. (Phase I)

      III. To determine if Triplex reduces the frequency of CMV events when compared to historical
      data. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize CMV reactivation and disease by assessing: time to CMV reactivation,
      duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (defined as
      &gt; 100 days and =&lt; 365 days post HCT), use of anti-viral drugs triggered by rising CMV viremia
      or viremia &gt;= 3750 IU/mL, cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.

      II. To evaluate the impact of Triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing the
      incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), relapse, non-relapse
      mortality (NRM), all-cause mortality, infections.

      III. To investigate the impact of Triplex on cellular immunity by investigating: the level,
      function and kinetics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity, the changes in adaptive natural killer
      (NK) cell population and highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, and changes in GVHD
      biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on
      days 28 and 56 post-HCT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 365 days.
