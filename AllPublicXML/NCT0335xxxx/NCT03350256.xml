  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of microdosing BurstDR
      stimulation in spinal cord stimulation (SCS) patients with chronic intractable back and/or
      leg pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microdosing BurstDR consists of periods during which stimulation is delivered with standard
      BurstDR stimulation parameters alternated with periods during which no stimulation is being
      delivered.

      In this study the investigators propose to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of BurstDR
      microdosing, and determine optimal microdosing programming parameters in chronic pain
      patients, who are eligible for SCS therapy.
