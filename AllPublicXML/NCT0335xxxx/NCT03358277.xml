      Objectives:

        1. To investigate the effectiveness of adjuvant with aripiprazole to methylphenidate for
           disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in youths with
           attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

        2. To investigate the neural basis of chronic irritability in youths with functional
           magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

        3. To compare the clinical characteristics of youths with comorbid ADHD and DMDD to youths
           with ADHD only

      Background:

      Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in children and adolescents with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common clinical challenge and leads to
      severe impact and burden on both the patients and their family. Although methylphenidate
      (MPH) showed good efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, there is still lack of well-established
      pharmacological treatment for DMDD. Furthermore, little research focuses on the effect of
      pharmacological treatment on neural correlates of chronic irritability. Previous literature
      suggested the potential role of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of DMDD. Therefore,
      this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of adjuvant of aripiprazole (APZ) to MPH in
      patients with comorbid ADHD and DMDD. In addition, the investigators explored the clinical
      manifestation and neural basis of DMDD using inventories, neuropsychological tests and
      neuroimaging studies.

      Methods:

      The investigators enrolled patients with ADHD+DMDD (n = 31) and ADHD only (n = 27). Those
      subjects were evaluated with inventories of emotional and behavioral problems,
      neuropsychological tests, as well as fMRI with challenging tests which aimed to induce
      frustration at baseline assessment. Then, subjects of ADHD+DMDD group received 6 weeks'
      combination treatment of MPH+ APZ with flexible dosage according to clinical judgment. All
      the initial evaluations were administered again after treatment. The comparison of clinical
      characteristics and neuroimaging findings between ADHD+DMDD group and ADHD only group will be
      conducted. In addition, the effectiveness of treatment will be analyzed. The effects of
      pharmacological treatment on neural correlates of chronic irritability will also be
      investigated.

    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) subscale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a widely used caregiver report form identifying problem behavior in children. The patient is rated on 113 items scored on a 3-point Likert-type scale. CBCL consists of eight empirically-based syndrome subscales. The range of subscale scores (summed) are: Aggressive Behavior (0-36), Anxious/Depressed (0-26), Attention Problems (0-20), Rule-Breaking Behavior (0-34), Somatic Complaints (0-22), Social Problems (0-22), Thought Problems (0-30), and Withdrawn/Depressed (0-16). The higher score suggests the more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Scaleâ€”version IV (SNAP-IV) total and subscale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SNAP-IV is a widely used caregiver report form identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children. The patient is rated on 26 items scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale. SNAP-IV consists of three subscales: inattention (items #1-#9, range of subscale summed score 0-27), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (items #11-#18, range of subscale summed score 0-27), and symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (items #19-#26, range of subscale summed score 0-24). The higher score suggests the more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An self-reported inventory to evaluate children's and adolescents' emotional and social impairment. It includes five subscales: depression, anxiety, anger, disruptive behaviour, and self-concept. Each subscale consists of 20 items, and each item is scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale. The range of each subscale scores (summed) is 0-60. The higher score suggests the more severe symptoms.</description>
