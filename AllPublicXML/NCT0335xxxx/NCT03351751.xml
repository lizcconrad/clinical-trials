    <description>Treatment-related AEs are any untoward medical occurrences attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. A serious adverse events (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28-35 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to study drug is assessed by the investigator. Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category are counted once within the category.</description>
