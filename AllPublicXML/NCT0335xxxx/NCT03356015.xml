  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High quality bowel preparation is essential for successful colonoscopy. This study aimed to
      assess the impact of the dose of Polyethylene Glycol(PEG) on the quality of bowel
      preparation. This prospective, endoscopist-blinded, randomized, controlled study was
      conducted. 3L-group received 3 bags of PEG and were instructed to drink 1L at 19:00 in the
      evening before the day of colonoscopy at a rate of 250 mL every 15 minutes, and to drink the
      remaining 2L 4 to 6 h before colonoscopy at the same rate. 4L-group received 4bags of PEG and
      were instructed to drink 2 L at 19:00 in the evening before the day of colonoscopy at a rate
      of 250 mL every 15 minutes, and to drink the remaining 2L 4 to 6 h before colonoscopy at the
      same rate. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation according to the
      Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). The secondary outcomes included polyp detection rate
      (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), tolerance, and subjective feelings of patients.
