  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives in this study are to identify patterns of cognitive impairment pre-
      and post-transplant, to assess the similarities of scores of the three cognitive assessments
      in myeloma patients who undergo autologous stem cell transplant, and to determine if patients
      prefer the self-assessment, Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) or the healthcare
      applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) assessment.
