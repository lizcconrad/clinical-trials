      A muti-center study to compare the safety and efficacy of anterior cervical discectomy and
      fusion, cervical artificial disc replacement and hybrid surgery for bi-level cervical
      spondylosis.

    <textblock>
      Patients with bi-level cervical spondylosis undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and
      fusion, cervical artificial disc replacement and hybrid surgery in the muti-center hospital
      were retrospectively reviewed.The safety and efficacy were evaluated based on scores of the
      Neck Disability Index (NDI), visual analog scale (VAS), and Japanese Orthopedic Association
      (JOA) and the range of motion of both operative segments and adjacent segments,not only in
      the preoperative,but also in the 5 days,6 months,12 months and the 5 years after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) Cervical degenerative pathology with symptomatic radiculopathy or myelopathy at
             two consecutive segments from C3 to C7 which not responding to conservative treatment
             for 6 weeks. (2) Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), complete cervical
             spine radiography and computed tomography (CT) showed anterior compressive pathology.
             (3) None or slight osteophyte at the posterior edge of vertebrae. (4) None significant
             spinal stenosis or posterior compression.
