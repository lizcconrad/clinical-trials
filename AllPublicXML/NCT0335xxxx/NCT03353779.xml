      This study will observe the relationship between platelet function testing and clinical
      outcomes. Meanwhile we aim to identify optimal cut-off values in different platelet function
      testing, including IPF, TEG and VerifyNow, to predict MACCE during12-months in complex PCI
      patients.

        Patients with complex PCI were defined as having at least 1of the following features :3
        vessels treated,≥3 stents implanted, ≥3 lesions treated,bifurcation with 2stents implanted
        ,total stent length &gt;60 mm or chronic total occlusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented undergoing complex PCI in 1 year prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any condition/circumstance which in the opinion of the investigator could
             significantly limit the complete follow up of the patient (e.g. tourist, non-native
             speaker or does not understand the local language where interpreter services are not
             reliably available, psychiatric disturbances, alcohol or drug abuse).

          -  Presence of serious/severe co-morbidities in the opinion of the investigator which may
             limit life expectancy (&lt;1 year).

          -  Current participation in a blinded randomized clinical trial.
