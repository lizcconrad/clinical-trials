    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensory-motor cortical excitability response
      to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) on Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR) muscle during muscle
      hyperalgesia provoked by nerve growth factor (NGF).

      The purpose of this study is to assess changes in sensory-motor cortical excitability during
      experimental muscle hyperalgesia across several days provoked by injections of nerve growth
      factor (NGF) into the Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR) muscle and delayed onset muscle soreness
      (DOMS) of the ECR muscle.

      It was hypothesized that muscle hyperalgesia across several days would result in:

      i) Increased sensory cortical excitability, based on somatosensory evoked potentials by means
      of electrical stimulation of the radial nerve, (increase of central-parietal evoked-potential
      P45 and decrease of frontal evoked-potential N30); ii) Increased corticomotor excitability of
      a ECR (increase map volume and number of active sites), assessed as motor evoked potentials
      induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation in primary motor cortex (M1); iii) Reduction of
      alpha oscillation based on nociceptive stimulus-evoked suppression of alpha activity in
      sensory regions (recording electrodes on contra-lateral parietal area);
