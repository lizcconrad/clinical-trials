  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common, and is defined as &quot;persistent or regular inability to
      achieve or maintain penis erection for satisfactory intercourse.&quot; Approximately 3% to 71% of
      males have this problem as they age, and it is predicted that 320 million males worldwide
      will have ED by 2025. However, sex remains a topic that is too sensitive for most people to
      discuss openly. With advances in the sciences, medicine, and related studies, almost 95% of
      ED cases are treatable. ED therapies include oral medication, vacuum erection devices,
      intracavernosal injection, testosterone supplementation, surgery, and psychological
      counseling. In addition, germanium (Ge), titanium (Ti), and π elements are noble metals that
      can be used to produce far-infrared radiation, and are widely used to promote blood
      circulation. There has been little application of these metals to treatment of ED, but their
      use is worth investigating. This clinical trial recruited 30 subjects (a test group of 20 and
      control group of 10). Cellulosic textiles, incorporating noble metals (Ge, Ti, and π
      elements), developed by Green Energy Nano Technology Co., Ltd, were used in the test group,
      while commercially available regular textiles were used in the control group. In this
      clinical trial, the efficacy of the test products (improvement in ED) was assessed using
      questionnaires. Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile
      Function (IIEF-5) and the validated Portuguese version of the Quality of Erection
      Questionnaire (QEQ); premature ejaculation was assessed using the Premature Ejaculation
      Diagnostic Tool (PEDT); prostate symptoms were assessed using the International Prostate
      Symptom Score (IPSS). The questionnaires were completed once a month and followed up for 3
      months. The incidence of severe adverse effects was analyzed to assess product safety.
