  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study of various doses of SCH 619734 in subjects receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
      Ondansetron and dexamethasone will be concurrently administered with SCH 619734 before
      initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. Subjects will record nausea and vomiting in the SPNV
      Subject Diary through Day 6. The quality of life assessment as measured by the Functional
      Living Index-Emesis Questionnaire (FLIE) will be used to measure the effect of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on daily life. Blood samples for SCH 619734
      pharmacokinetic assessments will be collected. The study is to be conducted in conformance
      with Good Clinical Practice.
