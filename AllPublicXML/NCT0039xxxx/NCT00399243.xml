    <textblock>
      This study's hypothesis is the 4mg StatDose sumatriptan is effective for the acute treatment
      of cluster headache and provides good safety and tolerability across multiple doses of the
      study medication as well as across multiple attacks of cluster headache. This study seeks to
      determine the safety and efficacy of the commercially available 4mg StatDose formulation of
      sumatriptan as an acute treatment of cluster headache. Patients are allowed to use repeated
      dose of the study medication for a given headache if they have had a partial response to the
      first dose. They may treat up to 3 attacks of cluster headache with the study medication.
      Safety assessment will be through adverse event reporting and physical examination. Patients
      with both episodic cluster headache as well as chronic cluster headache will be studied.
      Patients must either not have started preventive treatment for cluster headache or be on a
      stable dose of preventive medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial of sumatriptan 4 mg using the StatDose injector system for the
      treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache.

      Patient entering the trial must either be in the first 3 weeks of an episodic cluster
      headache cycle or have chronic cluster headache. Patients with episodic cluster headache may
      have not begun taking preventive medications at the time of study or must be on a stable
      regimen of preventive medications. Patients with chronic cluster headache must be on a stable
      regimen of preventive medications.

      Patients must be in good health with no contraindications to the use of sumatriptan such as
      either having or having increased risk factors for CAD or CVD. They may not take during the
      time of the study preventive medications that are 5HT1B/1D agonists. Episodic use of
      triptans, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is permitted provided they are not used within 24
      hours of use of the study medication.

      Patients will be required to treat 3 acute attacks of cluster headache with the study
      medication or to use more than 1 dose of study medication to fully treat an individual attack
      of cluster headache with a maximum of 3 doses of the study medication within a 24 hour time
      frame.

      Efficacy of the study medication will be determined from diary data collected. Safety data
      will be determined by adverse events reported by the patient.
