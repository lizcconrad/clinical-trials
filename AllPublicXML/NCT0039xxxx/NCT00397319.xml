  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate specific markers of cardiovascular risk before and after growth hormone
      replacement therapy in a population of growth hormone deficient adults, as compared to an
      age, gender, and BMI-matched healthy population.

      Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. The effects of such a deficiency include decreased exercise capacity and
      tolerance, impaired cardiac function, a central fat redistribution, increased peripheral
      arterial resistance, and an unfavorable lipid profile. These effects have been found to be
      reversed with appropriate replacement therapy with recombinant human growth hormone. We plan
      to utilize several experimental systems to further investigate the role of growth hormone
      (GH) in maintaining cardiovascular health. In particular, we would like to further understand
      the interaction of GH with Plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (a major activator of the
      fibrinolytic system) as well as the role of GH in the maintenance of vascular function.

    Inadequate retention of GHD adults to maintain power to study the effect of GH on fibrinolysis.
