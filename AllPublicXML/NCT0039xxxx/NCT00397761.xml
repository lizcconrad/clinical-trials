      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and paclitaxel (albumin-stablized
      nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II/III trial is studying how well giving capecitabine together with
      paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) works in treating women undergoing
      surgery for stage II or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of pathological complete response (i.e., tumor completely gone) in
           women with previously untreated, unresected, stage II-IIIB breast cancer treated with
           neoadjuvant therapy comprising capecitabine and paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized
           nanoparticle formulation) (Abraxane^速).

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine overall clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive up to 4 courses of capecitabine and paclitaxel (nanoparticle
      albumin-stabilized formulation) (Abraxane^速) in the absence of disease progression. Patients
      then undergo definitive surgical resection of the tumor off study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
