    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of G-CSF in treating patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) - a fatal neurological degenerative disease that causes adult-onset,
      progressive motor neurons loss in the spinal cord, brain stem and motor cortex. Patients
      develop progressive wasting and weakness of both upper and lower limbs, bulbar and
      respiratory muscles. Usually death from respiratory failure typically is within 3-5 years of
      diagnosis. Although there are various treatments for ALS, riluzole is the only approved
      treatment to delay the disease progression. G-CSF is an approved drug that is used to
      increase white blood cell counts. Moreover, G-CSF and its receptor are expressed by neurons.
      It acts anti-apoptosis by activating several protective pathways, stimulates neuronal
      differentiation of adult neural stem cells in the brain, and improves long-term recovery.
      G-CSF is a novel neurotrophic factor, and a highly attractive candidate for the treatment of
      neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS.

      Patients 18 to 65 years of age who have had mild to moderately severe ALS for 0.5 to 2 years
      of duration may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history and possible review of medical records, physical examination, blood test, urine and
      stool analyses, electrocardiogram, electrophysiological examination, neurological imaging
      and, for women, a pregnancy test.

      Participants will have drug therapy according to randomized number. One group receives G-CSF
      while other group receives placebo. All of the participants receive riluzole treatment. For
      the procedure, patients are given a medication to lessen anxiety and any discomfort. Patients
      receive drug injections every 3 months for 5 days. The G-CSF dosage is 5Î¼g/kg/day. Physical
      examination and interview, Appel ALS scale and ALS-Functional Rating Scale will be done in
      14, 28 days and 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Electrophysiological examination will be tested per 3
      months. Blood samples will be collected on treat 5, 14, 28 days and 3, 6, 9, 12 months.
