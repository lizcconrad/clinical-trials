  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis causes contact activation of the coagulation pathway (1). For this reason,
      unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins are administered in daily practice to prevent
      thrombosis of the dialyzer and blood circuit, but the dose commonly used causes systemic
      anticoagulation. This can cause serious complications in patients with high risk of bleeding.
      Regional and low-dose heparinization, use of prostacycline, regional citrate anticoagulation
      (RCA), and high-flow-rate hemodialysis without anticoagulation have been shown to reduce
      bleeding complications. Each of these methods, however, is characterized by its own technical
      difficulties, limitations, or complications.

      The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of heparin-coated
      polyacrylonitrile membranes (AN69ST) and regional citrate anticoagulation in hemodialysis
      patients at risk of bleeding

      1. Open label single centre prospective randomized trial including 33 patients aged over 18
           years with chronic kidney disease stage 5 requiring intermittent hemodialysis at the
           University Hospital Leuven and at risk of bleeding. Exclusion criteria were: any
           haemostatic disorder favouring either bleeding or clotting, anti-vitamin K or heparin
           treatment, heparin induced thrombocytopenia and haemodynamic instability. Written
           informed consent before enrolment.

        2. Random allocation (by sealed enveloppe) to RCA with a calcium free dialysate (RCA-Ca0),
           RCA with a calcium containing dialysate (RCA-Ca1,5) or to anticoagulant-free hemodiaysis
           with a heparin-coated polyacrylonitrile membrane (Nephral 300STÂ®).

        3. At the end of each dialysis session, arterial and venous drip chambers and the filter
           will be inspected for visible signs of coagulation. Corresponding to the standard care
           at our dialysis unit, a semi-quantitative score with a range from 0 (no signs of
           clotting) to 4 (complete occlusion) will be used for evaluation of the dialyzer. By
           definition, the drip chamber will be considered clotted when a thrombus was visible
           after the rinse back procedure. A fibrin ring against the wall of the drip chamber will
           be considered normal.

        4. Blood samples for assessment of prothrombin fragment F1+2 and d-dimers will be collected
           from the inlet blood catheter prior to hemodialysis initiation and during hemodialysis
           at T15, T120 and T238.
