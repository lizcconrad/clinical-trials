      This is a feasibility study to examine combination therapy with Trastuzumab (T),
      Cyclophosphamide (CY), and an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting whole cell breast cancer vaccine in
      patients with Stage IV HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer. The main purposes of this
      study are to test the safety, clinical benefit, and bioactivity of vaccine therapy in
      combination with Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing
      Stage IV breast cancer. This study will also to test whether the Cyclophosphamide can
      eliminate the suppressive influence of regulatory T cells, and whether Trastuzumab can
      increase antigen processing and presentation. These drug activities may make the immune
      system react better and enhance the effects of the vaccine in treating breast cancer. The
      vaccine consists of two irradiated allogeneic mammary carcinoma cell lines genetically
      modified to secrete human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This
      open label, single arm study is designed to recruit up to 40 subjects to identify 20 research
      subjects with HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer eligible for study treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women (American Cancer Society, 2005). In
      the year 2005, the American Cancer Society has estimated that 212,240 new invasive cases of
      breast cancer will be diagnosed, and predicts 40,410 deaths will result from breast cancer.
      While 80% of patients present with locoregional disease involving the breast and/or axillary
      lymph nodes, about half develop disseminated disease and ultimately die from it. Stage IV
      breast cancer is typically managed with hormonal agents or conventional cytotoxic drugs.
      Tumors quickly become resistant to these treatments. Immunotherapy is a particularly
      attractive strategy for overcoming drug resistance and can be integrated with existing
      therapeutic modalities in an additive or synergistic fashion. Immunotherapy is a type of
      treatment for cancer based on the idea that the immune system can be activated to destroy
      cancer cells that might be resistant to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. A vaccine is a
      kind of immunotherapy that delivers an antigen (something that activates the immune system)
      so that the immune system recognizes cells with that antigen as foreign and destroys any
      cells that display that antigen.

      The allogeneic breast tumor cell vaccine consists of two types of breast tumor cells
      developed from the tumor cells of patients with breast cancer. The human
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene was used to genetically modify
      the breast tumor cells to secrete GM-CSF. GM-CSF is a substance made by the body that helps
      the immune system recognize a tumor and destroy it. The vaccine cells were irradiated to
      prevent them from growing or dividing. The cells themselves are not radioactive. The cells
      are stored frozen until the day of vaccination. The total number of cells in each vaccine
      will be 500,000,000, divided into twelve injections given in the thighs and arms. The choice
      of twelve injections for each vaccine is based on the volume of the vaccine and a finding
      that the body has a better chance to respond to the vaccine if it is injected into a number
      of different areas.

      We propose to test the safety and bioactivity of an allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer
      vaccine when given in a specifically timed sequence with Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab,
      two drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer. In this study the Cyclophosphamide is used at
      lower doses than usual to help the vaccine to activate the patient's immune system.
      Trastuzumab will be given at doses that are commonly used to treat breast cancer and it may
      also increase the immune response. The dose and scheduling of Cyclophosphamide and
      Trastuzumab used are based on testing the drugs with a GM-CSF-secreting vaccine in mice that
      get breast cancer, and are the ones that enabled the vaccine to induce the most potent
      anti-tumor immunity. The dose of vaccine cells is based on the safety of the same dose of a
      similar GM-CSF-secreting vaccine for pancreatic cancer. This breast cancer vaccine has also
      been given to people with breast cancer by itself, and with Cyclophosphamide and another
      chemotherapy drug, Doxorubicin. To date, people have had no vaccine-related serious side
      effects, but not enough people have received the vaccine to know if it treats breast cancer.
      The vaccine is experimental and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). However, the FDA has permitted its use in this research study. This is
      the second study of this breast cancer vaccine and the first study to test this vaccine with
      Trastuzumab.

      The main purposes of this study are to test the safety, clinical benefit, and bioactivity of
      vaccine therapy in combination with Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab in patients with
      HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer. This study will also to test whether the
      Cyclophosphamide can eliminate the suppressive influence of regulatory T cells, and whether
      Trastuzumab can increase antigen processing and presentation. These drug activities may make
      the immune system react better and enhance the effects of the vaccine in treating breast
      cancer.

      The study is open to men and women with HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
      Concurrent hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonates (standard breast cancer therapy that is not
      chemotherapy or other investigational therapy) is allowed. Patients may have received
      Trastuzumab in the past or continue on it while participating in this study. About 40 people
      with HER-2/neu positive breast cancer will enter in the study. About 20 will pass the
      screening tests and receive the vaccine.

      Research subjects will receive a fixed dose of the allogeneic breast tumor vaccine consisting
      of two irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines transfected with the GM-CSF gene in a
      specifically timed sequence with a low dose of Cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab. Patients
      will receive 300 mg/m2 of Cyclophosphamide on day -1, and the vaccine on day 0. Weekly
      Trastuzumab will be timed to coincide with Cyclophosphamide administration. Research subjects
      will receive three monthly vaccination cycles, with a fourth and final (boost) vaccination
      cycle three months from the third cycle.

      Blood samples to measure GM-CSF levels will be taken on the day of vaccination, every day for
      4 days, and then on day 7 after vaccination. Blood samples to evaluate the safety of the
      vaccinations will be taken about once a week for one month following each vaccination. During
      studies of the breast vaccine and similar vaccines in renal cell cancer, prostate cancer,
      pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, local symptoms of swelling and redness
      developed at the vaccine site between 2 and 7 days after vaccination. In this study, if the
      subject's vaccination site shows swelling over 1 cm in diameter, a skin biopsy will be taken.
      The skin biopsy will be evaluated to determine to what types of cells are important to the
      immune response. Based on our previous preclinical and clinical data, the biopsy will be
      taken on day 3, and possibly on day 7, after the first and third vaccinations. Other tests
      and evaluations include history and physical examination, vital signs, CT of the chest,
      abdomen, and pelvis, nuclear medicine bone scan, pre-vaccination biopsy, blood for immune
      monitoring, and a skin test for delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) that is like a PPD test
      and involves injecting pieces of a protein antigen (HER-2/neu) that is delivered by the
      breast cancer vaccine. The purpose of the DTH test is to evaluate whether the research
      subject has developed a systemic immune response to the breast cancer vaccine. Tumor core
      needle biopsies will be obtained at baseline, and on days 0 and +14 of vaccine cycle 1 only.

      Patients will be evaluated clinically and with laboratory testing for evidence of disease
      progression after each cycle or when otherwise clinically indicated. Computed tomography (CT
      scan) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and nuclear medicine bone scan will also be performed
      to evaluate disease status prior to starting the study, after vaccine cycle 3 and prior to
      and after vaccine cycle 4. About every three months cardiac function will be evaluated.

    <description>Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of HER-2/neu (Carter et al., 1992) that is now one component of the standard of care for both early and late stage HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancers. It exerts a pleiotropic antitumor effect by multiple mechanisms (Emens, 2005). The antibody decreases heterodimer formation with other members of the EGFR family, thereby indirectly inhibiting signaling through the ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Arteaga, 2003). It also inhibits tumor neovascularization (Izumi et al., 2002), and augments apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (Lee et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2003). Trastuzumab prevents cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2/neu, thus abrogating the constitutive activation of the remaining membrane-associated intracellular domain.</description>
