  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this study is that failure to recognise the role of lactose
      intolerance among patients has led to inappropriate dietary advice and treatment with drugs
      that contain lactose as a filler. These failures exacerbate symptoms and lead to the
      unnecessary use of immune suppressant drugs.

      This study will identify the threshold at which symptoms of lactose intolerance develop, to
      provide appropriate advice and treatment in the management of patients.
