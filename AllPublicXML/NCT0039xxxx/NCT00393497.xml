      The primary objective of this study is:

      â€¢ To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm volume in
      patients with ipsilateral lymphedema

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm
           interstitial fluid pressure (IFP)

        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in extracellular
           fluid (ECF) volume based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) by lymphometer

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of VEGF inhibition in this patient population

        -  To assess the clinical benefit in patients with ipsilateral lymphedema treated with
           vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition by evaluating patient responses to
           a quality of life questionnaire (FACT-B+4 lymphedema questions)

        -  To determine the impact of VEGF inhibition on circulating VEGF levels in patients with
           lymphedema

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have unilateral lymphedema of the ipsilateral arm attributed to prior surgical
             treatment or radiation therapy for breast cancer that is severe enough to warrant
             therapy in the opinion of the subject and treating physician.

          2. All subjects must have greater than a 3 cm total difference in arm circumference
             between the affected and unaffected arm measured at five defined points:

               -  each wrist at its narrowest point

               -  each arm 30 cm proximal to the tip of the middle finger

               -  each arm 40 cm proximal to the tip of the middle finger
