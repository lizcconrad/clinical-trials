      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to
      kill tumor cells. Giving the vaccine in different ways may make a stronger immune response
      and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying two different ways of giving vaccine
      therapy to compare how well they work in treating patients with stage IIB, stage IIC, stage
      III, or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and feasibility of particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED)
           immunization comprising mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine in patients with stage IIB, IIC,
           III, or IV melanoma.

        -  Compare the immunologic response induced with PMED vs intramuscular jet injection
           methods of vaccination in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Observe patients with measurable tumor for evidence of any antitumor response generated
           after vaccination.

        -  Assess for disease relapse in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine by particle-mediated epidermal
           delivery on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 22, 24, 26, 29, 43, 45, 47, 50, 64, 66, 68, and 71.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mouse gp100 plasmid DNA vaccine by intramuscular jet injection
           on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 22, 24, 26, 29, 43, 45, 47, 50, 64, 66, 68, and 71.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

    <description>T-cell response: Peripheral blood lymphocytes will be tested for reactivity against gp100 using an IFN-y ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining or MHC tetramer assay. If T-cell reactivity is induced, additional samples may be drawn to determine the duration of this reactivity. Follow-up blood samples require only 20-30 ml. MHC tetramer assays and intracellular flow cytometry studies may also be performed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with measurable disease, the RECIST criteria for anti-tumor effect will be used. Lesions will be defined as measurable if they can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm by spiral CT scan.Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <description>In patients with measurable disease, the RECIST criteria for anti-tumor effect will be used. Lesions will be defined as measurable if they can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm by spiral CT scan.Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
