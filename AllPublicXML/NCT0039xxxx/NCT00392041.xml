      The purpose is to assess the efficacy of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia and other
      symptoms of fibromyalgia. It is hypothesized that participants receiving eszopiclone will
      report greater improvement in total sleep time, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, physical
      functioning, and emotional distress than will those receiving placebo.

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly syndrome. Although the
      pathophysiology of FM is not yet well-understood, sleep disturbance is a prominent feature of
      most theories. Eszopiclone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of insomnia, but
      has not been studied in the treatment of FMS. The purpose is to assess the efficacy of
      eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia and other symptoms of fibromyalgia (FMS) in FMS
      patients. Participants will be randomly selected to receive eszopiclone or placebo. It is
      hypothesized that participants receiving eszopiclone will report greater improvement in total
      sleep time, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, physical functioning, and emotional distress than
      will those receiving placebo.

          3. Reports sleep maintenance insomnia (total sleep time of &lt; 6.5 hours or sleep
             impairment consisting of 3 of 7 nights per week for a month by history) or sleep onset
