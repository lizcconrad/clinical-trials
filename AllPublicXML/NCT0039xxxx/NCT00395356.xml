  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to measure the effect of an approach including phases of active
      weight loss broken by weight stabilisation periods (named intermittent weight loss) on the
      metabolic profile.

      First, the intermittent weight loss approach will contribute to create an artificial
      transitory steady state during the weight loss treatment that will help to minimize the
      adverse effects of the standard approach on muscle mass and resting metabolic rate. Second,
      despite a comparable fat mass loss, the intermittent weight loss approach will improve the
      metabolic profile to a greater degree compared to the standard approach. Finally, the
      intermittent weight loss approach will be associated with less weight regain after the
      treatment since the beneficial effect on muscle mass and metabolic rate.

      Excessive levels of body fat are associated with metabolic disturbances predictive of an
      increased risk of coronary heart disease (CAD). It is presently unclear as to the magnitude
      of weight loss needed to accrue metabolic benefits. Despite the effectiveness of weight loss
      to reduce obesity levels, studies have shown that only minor decreases in body weight (5-10%)
      are needed to clinically improve CAD risk factors. Our data suggested that a 10% reduction in
      body weight is as effective in improving the metabolic profile as a 20% decrease in body
      weight. Thus, the question are : “ Is it possible to further improve the metabolic profile
      over that 5-10% weight loss threshold?” and “Could several 5-10% body weight loss
      (intermittent weight loss approach) have additive effects on the metabolic profile?”. We
      would like to follow-up on these observation to better understand 1) the association between
      weight loss and improvements in the metabolic profile and 2) why minor decreases in body
      composition and body fat distribution are as effective as more important reduction.
