  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if the investigators can use certain tests (eustachian tube
      function tests and gas exchange tests) to predict whether or not a child who had tubes
      surgically placed in their eardrum because of middle-ear disease will redevelop the disease
      again after the tubes quit working.

      This study will enroll children 3-6 years of age with tympanostomy tubes inserted for otitis
      media with effusion (OME)and measure middle ear gas demand, middle ear volume and eustachian
      tube function longitudinally between the time of tube insertion and extrusion/nonfunctioning.
      The data will be used to test the hypotheses that: gas transfer across the middle ear mucosa
      decreases in phase with resolution of middle ear inflammation and effusion; gas transfer
      across the middle ear mucosa is increased by an episode of otorrhea; eustachian tube function
      is unaffected by tympanostomy tube insertion, and measurement of eustachian tube function and
      trans-middle ear mucosa gas transfer predicts disease recurrence and presentation after tube
      extrusion/nonfunctioning. The results of these studies will be used to support or refute
      tested components of existing models of middle ear pressure-regulation and to develop test
      protocols for risk assignments with respect to disease recurrence in individual ears after
      tympanostomy tube extrusion/nonfunctioning.
