  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition associated with a low level of parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) in the blood. Hypoparathyroidism can be genetic and show up in childhood, or it can
      occur later in life. If it occurs later, it is usually due to damage or removal of the
      parathyroid glands during neck surgery. PTH helps control the amount of calcium in blood,
      kidneys, and bones. Low levels of calcium in the blood can cause a person to feel sick. It
      can cause cramping or tingling in the hands, feet, or other parts of the body. A very low
      blood calcium can cause fainting or seizures.

      The standard treatment for hypoparathyroidism is a form of vitamin D (calcitriol) and calcium
      supplements. Keeping normal blood levels of calcium can be difficult. Sometimes there is too
      much calcium in the urine even if the calcium levels in the blood are low. High calcium in
      the kidneys and urine can cause problems such as calcium deposits in the kidney
      (nephrocalcinosis) or kidney stones. High levels of calcium in the kidney may keep the kidney
      from functioning normally. Treatment with PTH will replace the hormone you are missing. Your
      disease may be better controlled on PTH than on calcium and calcitriol.

      Researchers at the NIH have conducted prior studies to establish synthetic human parathyroid
      hormone 1-34 (HPTH) as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Other studies have shown that PTH
      may improve calcium levels in blood and urine. The primary purpose of this research study is
      to evaluate the effects of synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (HPTH) replacement
      therapy on bone in adults and teenagers with hypoparathyroidism.

      The study takes 5 (Omega) years to complete and requires 12 inpatient visits to the National
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. The first visit will help the study
      team decide whether you are eligible. This visit will last 2 to 3 days. After taking calcium
      and calcitriol for 1 - 7 months you will return to the NIH Clinical Center for the baseline
      visit. The baseline visit is the visit that you will start your PTH; you will also undergo a
      bone biopsy during the visit. The baseline visit may last 7 to 10 days. You will then take
      PTH twice a day for 5 years. You will be asked to return to the NIH clinical center every 6
      months for 10 follow-up visits. During one of the follow-up visits, you will have a second
      bone biopsy taken from the other hip. That second biopsy will be done after 1 year, 2 years,
      or 4 years of taking PTH; the researchers will assign the timing of the second biopsy
      randomly. You will be asked to go to your local laboratory for blood and urine tests between
      each follow up visit. At first the blood tests will occur at least once a week. Later, you
      will need to go to your local laboratory for blood tests at least once a month and urine
      tests once every 3 months. The local laboratory visits and follow-up visits at the NIH
      Clinical Center will help the study team determine whether the HPTH treatment is controlling
      your hypoparathyroidism.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the skeletal effects of hormone
      replacement therapy with HPTH in hypoparathyroidism.

      Study Population

      This study will enroll up to 69 subjects with physician-diagnosed hypoparathyroidism.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Design

      This study will treat hypoparathyroid individuals with synthetic human PTH 1-34 (HPTH) for up
      to 5 years, periodically assessing skeletal changes through biochemical markers and
      iliac-crest bone biopsies, which will allow for ultrastructural, cellular, and molecular
      analyses.

      With respect to HPTH treatment, this study is a single group, within-subjects, repeated
      measures treatment trial. With respect to all bone biopsy analyses, the design is a parallel
      group design with each subject allocated to one of the 3 biopsy follow-up times: 1, 2 or 4
      years after initiation of HPTH therapy. Post-baseline biopsy timing will be randomly assigned
      (1:1.2:1.4, respectively) to each subject, stratified by gender and by menopausal status,
      when relevant. Changes from baseline (time 0) to 1, 2 and 4-years will be compared. Subjects
      who were on conventional therapy in the former version of the protocol will also be
      randomized into the new study design. In contrast to new subjects, whose biopsy is performed
      at the end of the conventional care run-in period, the pre-conventional care biopsy will be
      used as the baseline for the those subjects entering the new design after having been on
      conventional care in the older protocol. Because it is not known with certainty what effects
      duration of time on conventional therapy will have on biopsy results, randomization will also
      be stratified on status of prior study participation. The subjects who were on HPTH therapy
      at the time of the protocol redesign are followed as a separate group under this protocol.

      Outcome Measures

      Primary:

           collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide.
