  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study offers narrowband UVB light therapy to patients who have 5% of their body involved
      with vitiligo.

      The hypothesis is that Narrowband UVB promotes melanocyte proliferation in vitiligo lesions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive phototherapy, with narrowband UVB, three times a week for six
      months, or a total of 78 treatments. 6mm punch skin biopsies (2) will be done prior to
      starting therapy, once during treatment (2) and at the completion of the study (2). Clinical
      assessments and photography will be done parallel to the skin biopsies. Results (clinically
      and histologically) will be analyzed.
