      Our study examines which different brain regions are involved in child absence seizures and
      how they are related to attention and cognition.

      The fundamental mechanisms of altered brain function and impaired attention in childhood
      absence epilepsy (CAE) are not known. Absence seizures consist of brief 5-10 seconds episodes
      of unresponsiveness, associated with a 3-4 Hz &quot;spike-wave&quot; discharge on electroencephalogram
      (EEG). CAE affects 10-15% of children with epilepsy. In addition to the deficit during
      seizures, many children also suffer from milder attention impairment between absence
      episodes, which may not be due entirely to medications. Impaired attention during and between
      absence seizures has a major negative impact on patient quality of life due to deficits in
      school performance, potential for injuries, and social stigma.

      Recent studies suggest that impaired cognition in so-called &quot;generalized&quot; absence seizures
      may, in fact, depend on dysfunction in specific brain networks. Our central hypothesis is:
      abnormal function in focal brain regions, such as the anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal
      cortex and medial thalamus, causes impaired attention both during and between seizures in
      CAE. If confirmed, this may lead to innovative regional therapies targeted at improving
      impaired attention in CAE. Specifically, we hope to determine which specific cortical and
      sub-cortical networks are selectively involved when patients show impaired attention. Using
      simultaneous EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will determine which
      brain regions are involved in absence seizures while using a continuous performance task
      (CPT) to test attention vigilance in the same patients. A few neuropsychology tests will then
      follow. Patients will be reimbursed $100 as well as all travel and parking expenses.
