  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare three standard treatment programs commonly offered to patients with
      breast cancer. The three programs being compared are 1) Mindfulness Meditation-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR), 2)Supportive- Expressive Group Therapy (SET), and 3) A one day
      stress-management seminar. The purpose of this study is to determine if these three
      treatments have different effects on psychological well-being, the immune system, and the
      amount of stress hormones in the bloodstream.
