    <measure>Change in Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) Between Pre- and Post-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan of Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>CNR = (signal intensity [SI] lesion - SI normal tissue) / standard deviation (SD) background. SI lesion is the signal intensity in the lesion, SI normal tissue is the signal intensity in the normal tissue, and SD background is the standard deviation of the background noise. The signal intensity (SI) on the pre-contrast and on the post-contrast MR scans was to be measured in the enhanced lesion, normal tissue and background.</description>

    <measure>Change in Number of Detected Lesions From Pre- to Post-contrast MRI Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of lesions in the magnetic resonance scans was recorded before and after injection of contrast agent for the investigators and all 3 blinded readers (reader 2, reader 3 and reader 4).</description>

    <measure>Change in Diagnostic Confidence From Pre- to Post-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in diagnostic confidence was assessed based on post-contrast compared to pre-contrast scans as &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot; or &quot;worsened&quot; for the investigators and all 3 blinded readers (reader 2, reader 3 and reader 4).</description>

    <measure>Change in Lesion Contrast Enhancement From Pre- to Post-contrast MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of contrast enhancement was recorded on a 4-point scale as follows: 1 = No: lesion is not enhanced. 2 = Moderate: lesion is weakly enhanced. 3 = Good: lesion is clearly enhanced. 4 = Excellent: lesion is clearly and brightly enhanced. In case of more than one lesion, the lesion with maximum enhancement was to be assessed. The change in lesion contrast enhancement was assessed based on post-contrast in comparison to pre-contrast scans for the investigators and all 3 blinded readers (reader 2, reader 3 and reader 4).</description>

    <measure>Change in Lesion Delineation Between Pre- and Post-contrast MRI Scan of CNS Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion delineation was recorded on a 4-point scale as follows: 1 = None: no or unclear delineation of the boundary between lesion and surrounding tissue; 2 = Moderate: some aspects of border delineation covered; 3 = Good: almost clear delineation, but not complete on relevant slices; 4 = Excellent: sharp and complete delineation. In case of more than one lesion, the lesion with maximum enhancement was assessed. Change in lesion delineation was assessed based on post-contrast in comparison to pre-contrast scans for investigators and all 3 blinded readers (reader 2, reader 3 and reader 4).</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately before injection (pre-contrast) and 2-5 min after injection (post-contrast)</time_frame>
    <description>CNR = (SI lesion - SI normal tissue) / SD background. SI lesion is the signal intensity in the lesion, SI normal tissue is the signal intensity in the normal tissue, and SD background is the standard deviation of the background noise. The signal intensity (SI) on the pre-contrast and on the post-contrast MR scans was to be measured in the enhanced lesion, normal tissue and background.</description>

        <title>Change in Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) Between Pre- and Post-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan of Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions</title>
        <description>CNR = (signal intensity [SI] lesion – SI normal tissue) / standard deviation (SD) background. SI lesion is the signal intensity in the lesion, SI normal tissue is the signal intensity in the normal tissue, and SD background is the standard deviation of the background noise. The signal intensity (SI) on the pre-contrast and on the post-contrast MR scans was to be measured in the enhanced lesion, normal tissue and background.</description>

        <population>Per Protocol Set (PPS): All patients who have received contrast injection and are not invalid cases. Two participants in each treatment group had missing values for signal intensity for central nervous system lesions at pre- and post-contrast and could thus not be considered for evaluation.</population>

        <description>The degree of contrast enhancement was recorded on a 4-point scale as follows: 1 = No: lesion is not enhanced. 2 = Moderate: lesion is weakly enhanced. 3 = Good: lesion is clearly enhanced. 4 = Excellent: lesion is clearly and brightly enhanced. In case of more than one lesion, the lesion with maximum enhancement was to be assessed. The change in lesion contrast enhancement was assessed based on post-contrast in comparison to pre-contrast scans for the investigators and all 3 blinded readers (reader 2, reader 3 and reader 4).</description>
