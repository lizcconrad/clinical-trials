  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that episodic amiodarone treatment (i.e. amiodarone treatment 1 month prior
      until 1 month after cardioversion) is associated with a lower morbidity and a higher quality
      of life compared to continuous prophylactic amiodarone treatment while atrial fibrillation is
      still effectively suppressed. The latter means that at the end of the study permanent atrial
      fibrillation is prevented in comparable percentage of patients (70%) in both treatment
      strategies. However, this will be accomplished at the cost of a higher number of electrical
      cardioversions (2-3) in the episodic treatment group compared to the continuous treatment
      group.

      Primary objective

      To determine differences in adverse event rates between patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation who are randomized to episodic amiodarone treatment (EAT) strategy and patients
      who are randomized to continuous amiodarone treatment (CAT) strategy, while atrial
      fibrillation is still effectively suppressed.

      Adverse events can be related to:

        1. amiodarone use

        2. atrial fibrillation itself or underlying heart disease.

      Secondary objective

      To determine differences in quality of life between patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation who are randomized to the EAT strategy and patients who are randomized to the
      CAT strategy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation for at least 48 hours- 1 year (present
             episode).

          2. Older than 18 years of age.

          3. Ventricular rate during AF &gt; 75 beats per minute, documented on rest-ECG without rate
             control.

          4. At least two weeks of oral anticoagulation therapy before screening.

          5. Written informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Contra indications for amiodarone (severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or QTc
             &gt; 440ms).

          2. History of relapse of AF during adequate amiodarone treatment (i.e. adequate
             amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma levels).

          3. Concomitant treatment with class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone should not
             have been used during the last 3 months.

          4. Other (non) cardiac QT prolonging drugs (if not possible to discontinue).

          5. First episode of persistent atrial fibrillation.

          6. More than three relapses of persistent atrial fibrillation necessitating electrical
             cardioversion during the last three years.

          7. Known sick sinus syndrome.

          8. History of second or third degree AV conduction disturbances.

          9. Intraventricular conduction disturbances (QRS&gt; 140ms).

         10. Pacemaker treatment.

         11. Hemodynamically significant valvular disease.

         12. Patients with heart failure with symptoms according to NYHA class III or IV.

         13. Unstable angina pectoris.

         14. Recent myocardial infarction (&lt; 3 months).

         15. PTCA, CABG, other cardiac surgery or major non-cardiac surgery within the last three
             months.

         16. History of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

         17. Serious pulmonary, hepatic, haematological, metabolic, renal, gastrointestinal, CNS or
             psychiatric disease.

         18. Pregnant and non-pregnant women who are pre-menopausal and are not practising an
             acceptable method of contraception.

         19. Treatment with any other investigational agent.

         20. Presence of any disease that is likely to shorten life expectancy to &lt; 1 year.

         21. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardise the evaluation
             of efficacy or safety or be associated with poor adherence to the protocol.
