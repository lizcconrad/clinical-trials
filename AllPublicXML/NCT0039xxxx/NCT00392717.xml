  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral obesity is strongly associated with dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia, low
      HDL-cholesterol and mildly elevated LDL-cholesterol) and insulin resistance, key
      characteristics of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recent evidence has clearly established that
      the risk of CVD is increased in subjects with the MetS. The precise reason for this remains
      unclear, but appears to be closely related with dyslipidaemia. Effective management of
      dyslipidaemia is important to reduce the risk of CVD in these subjects.

      Hypothesis: Inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis by statins and triglyceride synthesis
      by fish oils improve lipoprotein metabolism in visceral obese men.

      The study employed a factorial study design, stable isotopy and mathematical modelling to
      examine the independent and combined effects of decreasing cholesterol substrate availability
      with atorvastatin and decreasing triglyceride substrate availability with fish oils on
      lipoprotien kinetics (apoB, apoA, apoC-III and chylomicron remnants) in insulin-resistant men
      with visceral obesity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Obesity was defined as a waist circumference &gt;100 cm, waist:hip ratio &gt;0.97 and BMI
             &gt;29 kg/m2.

          -  Subjects were selected for having insulin-resistance, defined as a homostasis model
             assessment (HOMA) score (21) &gt;5.1 (i.e. one SD above the mean for a reference
             population of 22 lean, normolipidemic healthy males of similar age).

          -  All subjects had plasma triglyceride &gt;1.2 mmol/L and cholesterol &gt;5.2 mmol/L at
             screening while consuming ad libitum, weight-maintaining diets

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  diabetes mellitus, apolipoprotein E2/E2 genotype, macroproteinuria, creatinemia,
             hypothyrodism, or abnormal liver enzymes.

          -  Subjects did not consume fish oil supplements or drank more than 30g alcohol/day.

          -  None reported a history of CVD, or was taking medication or other agents known to
             affect lipid metabolism.
