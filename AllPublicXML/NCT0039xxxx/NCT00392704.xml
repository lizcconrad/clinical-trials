  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two new cancer treatment drugs called targeted therapies will be added to standard treatment
      for head and neck cancer to see if an improvement can be made in the effectiveness of
      treatment for this type of cancer. Treatment will include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and
      targeted therapy taken over a period of 4 months.

      In this trial, patients will receive induction treatment with combination
      chemotherapy(paclitaxel/carboplatin/infusional 5FU) plus bevacizumab. After 6 weeks of
      treatment, patients will be reevaluated and will then receive concurrent radiation therapy,
      chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel),bevacizumab, and erlotinib.

      Induction Treatment:

      Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 by vein over 1-3 hours on Day 1 &amp; Day 22 Carboplatin AUC 6.0 by vein over
      1 hour on Days 1 and 22 Bevacizumab 15mg/kg by vein over 60-90 minutes on Days 1 and 22 5-FU
      200mg/m2 as a 24 hour continuous infusion via pump on Days 1 through 43.

      Combined Modality Treatment:

      Radiation therapy is given daily, Monday through Friday for approximately 7 weeks. Erlotinib
      150mg by mouth daily during the entire course of radiation (approximately 7 weeks) Paclitaxel
      50mg/m2 by vein over 1-hour weekly for 6 weeks beginning Day 1 of radiation therapy
      Bevacizumab 15mg/kg by vein over 30-90 minutes on Days 50 and 71 at the same time of
      radiation therapy

One to three weeks after completing neoadjuvant therapy, patients began treatment with concurrent chemoradiation, bevacizumab, and erlotinib. Radiation therapy began on day 1, with 1.8-Gy single daily doses, Monday through Friday, to a total dose of 68.4 Gy. Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 was administered by 1-hour IV infusion on days 1 and 22. Erlotinib 150 mg by mouth daily began concurrently with radiation therapy and continued daily during the 7-week course of radiation.</description>
