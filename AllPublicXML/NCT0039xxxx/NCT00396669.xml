  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine (DA) plays a critical role in nicotine (and other) addiction and this drug is known
      to release DA in brain areas mediating reward and motivational processes. Although imaging
      studies show that release of DA follows smoking, little is known regarding how common genetic
      polymorphisms for three genes associated in some studies with smoking (dopamine D2 receptor,
      dopamine and serotonin transporter) interact with smoking status and modulate individual
      differences in nicotine-induced DA release and dopamine receptor occupancy, in vivo. The
      current proposal combines brain imaging and genomics ('imaging genomics') towards partially
      unraveling the complex relationship between smoking phenotype and common polymorphisms.
      Understanding whether genetic factors contribute to inter-individual variability in smoking
      is crucial for interpreting imaging results in the context of disease pathology. We
      hypothesize that a model of vulnerability to addiction based on interactions between
      genotype, receptor and transporter availability and in vivo nicotine-induced DA release will
      elucidate some of the fundamental neurochemical and neurogenetic circuits underlying
      addiction.

      Dopamine plays a critical role in nicotine(and other) addiction and this drug is known to
      release DA in brain areas mediating reward and motivational processes. Although imaging
      studies show that release of DA follows smoking, little is known regarding how common some
      genetic polymorphisms proposed to play a role in nicotine dependence (e.g. DRD2, DAT and the
      serotonin transporter or SERT) interact with smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, light
      smoker, present smoker) and modulate individual differences in nicotine-induced DA release
      and dopamine receptor occupancy, in vivo. Individual differences in dopaminergic tone could
      result in an under-stimulation of reward circuits which could put subjects at greater risk
      for seeking drug stimulation (that releases DA) as a means to compensate for this deficit and
      to temporarily activate these reward circuits. The current proposal combines brain imaging
      and genomics towards unraveling the complex relationship between smoking phenotype and common
      polymorphisms. Understanding whether genetic factors contribute to inter-individual
      variability is crucial for interpreting imaging results in the context of disease pathology.

      Nicotine dependence is a complex process including initiation of smoking, persistence and
      difficulty in quitting. By comparing receptor occupancy, nicotine-induced DA release, and
      common genetic polymorphisms across smoking behaviors we will better understand the complex
      interactions between genetic makeup, personality and the several stages of nicotine
      addiction.
