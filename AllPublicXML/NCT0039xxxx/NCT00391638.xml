  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBe seroconversion is an important goal for anti-HBV treatment, since it is associated with a
      non progressive liver infection and a better clinical outcome. However, the rate of HBe
      seroconversion is low in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, mostly treated by tenofovir and
      emtricitabine. This study will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a one-year
      Peg-interferon alpha 2a additional treatment in patients already treated by tenofovir and
      emtricitabine without reaching HBe seroconversion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many HBV-HIV co-infected patients are currently treated with dual activity drugs such as
      tenofovir and emtricitabine, often in combination. However, despite the potent antiviral
      activity of these drugs, the rate of HBe seroconversion is quite low, and not always
      sustained over time. HBe seroconversion is an important goal for anti-HBV treatment, since it
      is associated with a non progressive liver infection and a better clinical outcome. On the
      other hand, treatments with antiviral and immuno-modulator activity such as Peg-interferon,
      are infrequently used in co-infected patients, despite promising data in the field of HBV
      mono-infection with increased rates and sustained HBe seroconversions. This pilot study will
      evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a one-year Peg-interferon alpha 2a additional
      treatment (180 micro-g once a week, by injection), in 55 patients already treated by
      tenofovir and emtricitabine for at least 6 months, and who did not reached HBe seroconversion
