  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of 4 artemisinin-based combinations
      (ACT) [amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ+AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPQ),
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and chlorproguanil/dapsone plus artesunate] for single and
      repeat treatments of uncomplicated malaria in children. Safety will be determined by
      registering adverse events and grading, laboratory, and vital signs evaluations. Their
      incidence will be compared between the different study arms.

      TO BE NOTED: following GlaxoSmithKline decision to discontinue the clinical development of
      the fixed-doses combination of Lapdap (Chlorproguanil-Dapsone) and artesunate, the Lapdap
      plus Artesunate arm was immediately discontinued in this study, on 17th February 2008. A
      formal amendment has been submitted to all the concerned ECs and competent authorities. The
      leading EC approved the amendment on 2nd June 2008.

      TO BE NOTED: since the batches of the study drug DHAPQ expire at the end of October 2008, and
      because of the unavailability of a new batch of DHAPQ from the manufacturer, the recruitment
      in the DHAPQ arm had to be discontinued on 30th October 2008. A formal amendment has been
      submitted to all the concerned ECs and competent authorities.

             only for the recruitment in the first follow up. For the second follow up, children
             having been included in the first follow up are eligible, regardless of their age.

          -  Body weight of 5 Kg and above.

          -  Microscopically confirmed, monoinfection of Plasmodium falciparum (parasitaemia ≥

             follow up and passive case detection.

          -  Parents' or guardians' willingness and ability to comply with the study protocol for
             the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug study (antimalarial or others) during
             the previous 30 days.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs.

          -  Severe malaria.

          -  Danger signs: not able to drink or breast-feed, vomiting (&gt; twice in 24hours), recent
             history of convulsions (&gt;1 in 24h), unconscious state, unable to sit or stand.

          -  Presence of intercurrent illness or any condition (cardiac, renal, hepatic diseases)
             which in the judgement of the investigator would place the subject at undue risk or
             interfere with the results of the study, including known G6PD deficiency.

          -  Severe malnutrition (defined as weight for height &lt;70% of the median NCHS/WHO
             reference).

          -  Ongoing prophylaxis with drugs having antimalarial activity such as cotrimoxazole for
             the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in children born to HIV+ women.
