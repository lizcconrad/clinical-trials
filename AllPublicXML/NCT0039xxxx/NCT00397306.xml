      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of a bioimpedance method for determination of dry
      weight in dialysis patients. Additionally normal tissue hydration in non-Dialysis patients is
      investigated in healthy subjects and patients with chronic kidney disease in stages K/DIGO
      I-IV
