      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and azacitidine
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute
      myeloid leukemia. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving vorinostat
      together with azacitidine may kill more cancer or abnormal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of vorinostat in combination with azacitidine in
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and some select patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) (step 1).

      II. To identify doses of both vorinostat and azacitidine for safe combination of the 2 agents
      that can be administered in repetitive cycles over time for use in phase II studies.

      III. To determine the response rate of patients treated with the combination of
      suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (vorinostat) and azacitidine at the doses established
      as safe and effective in Step 1 in an expanded cohort of patients with MDS.

      IV. To obtain preliminary data on the effects of treatment with the combination of vorinostat
      and Aza C (azacitidine) in patients with MDS on a series of biologic surrogate markers
      including: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation of specific genes (e.g. p15); histone
      acetylation; hematopoietic progenitor growth and differentiation; the fate of the MDS clone
      and changes in gene expression by array profiling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine effect of treatment with the combination on time to response, time to leukemic
      transformation and frequency of transformation to leukemia in patients with MDS during the
      phase II segment of the study.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and vorinostat
      orally (PO) 2-3 times daily on days 3-5, 3-9, or 3-16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at
      least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then
      every 2 months thereafter.
