  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study evaluating the PK of S-1 components and their metabolites
      in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal function. Patients will
      be stratified by baseline 24-hour creatinine clearance(CrCL) into 4 cohorts using the normal
      clearance formula:

      Group A: Control Group B:Mild renal dysfunction Group C:Moderate renal function and Group D:
      Severe renal dysfunction. Six patients will be enrolled into each cohort.

    <description>S-1 administration will be determined by degree of renal impairment as follows:
Group A (Control): 30 mg/m2 BID Group B (Mild renal dysfunction): 30 mg/m2 BID Group C (Moderate renal dysfunction): 20 mg/m2 BID Group D (Severe renal dysfunction): 20 mg/m2 QD
Pharmacokinetic Phase (Part 1):
On Days -2 and 14 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, patients will receive a single dose of S-1 administered orally in the morning.
Treatment will be followed by 1 week of recovery (Days 15 through 21).
Extension Phase (Part 2):
S-1 will be administered orally for 2 weeks (Day 1 through Day 14) followed by a 1-week recovery period (Day 15 through Day 21). This cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             enrollment in this study:

               1. Has histologically or cytologically proven advanced solid tumors for which no
                  standard therapy exists.

               2. Has provided written informed consent.

               3. Is 18 years of age or older.

               4. Is able to take medications orally.

               5. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to ≤ 2
                  Appendix A,ECOG Performance Status).

               6. Has adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

                    1. Transaminases AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of
                       normal(ULN). If liver function abnormalities are due to underlying
                       malignancy, then AST(SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) may be ≤ 5 times ULN.

                    2. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN.

                    3. Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3 (ie, ≥ 1.5 x 109/L by International
                       Units [IU]).

                    4. Has a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (IU: ≥ 100 x 109/L).

                    5. Has a hemoglobin value of ≥ 9.0 g/dL.

               7. Is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
                  tests, and other study procedures.

        3.3.2 Exclusion Criteria

        Exclude a patient from this study if he/she does not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or if
        any of the following conditions are observed:

          1. Has had treatment with any of the following within the specified time frame prior to
             study drug administration:

               1. Any investigational agent received either concurrently or within the last 30
                  days.

               2. Previous therapy for malignancy within 21 days, including any chemotherapy,
                  immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
                  mitomycin(C).

               4. Current enrollment in another clinical trial.

          2. Has a serious illness or medical condition(s) including, but not limited to, the
             following:

               1. Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, severe/unstable angina,
                  congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV,
                  Appendix E, NYHA Classification).

               2. Known (at the time of entry) gastrointestinal disorder, including malabsorption,
                  chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea present to the extent that it might
                  interfere with oral intake and absorption of the study medication.

               3. Known brain metastasis.

               4. Known leptomeningeal metastases.

               5. Requires hemodialysis.

               6. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency
                  syndrome(AIDS)-related illness.

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.

          3. Is receiving a concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with S-1. The following
             drugs are prohibited because there may be an interaction with S-1:

               1. Sorivudine, uracil, dipyridamole, cimetidine and folinic acid (may enhance S-1
                  activity).

               2. Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 activity).

               3. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).

               4. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 and
                  flucytosine activity).

               5. Pilocarpine (may inhibit CYP2A6 activity).

          4. Has known sensitivity to 5-FU.

          5. Is a pregnant or lactating female.

          6. Is a patient with reproductive potential who refuses to use an adequate means of
             contraception
