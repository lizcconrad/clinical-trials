  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a four-month dosing period
      of intra-lesional injection of TG1042 in patients with relapsing CBCL.

      Patients will receive intra-tumoral injections of an adenoviral vector construct containing
      the human interferon gamma gene (TG1042), in an attempt to enhance immune responses with
      anti-tumor activity. This local administration induces tumour cell killing at the injected
      tumour sites.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must satisfy all the following criteria for entry into the protocol:

        Primary CBCL including (according to WHO/EORTC classification 2005) :

          -  Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma

          -  Primary cutaneous follicle center B-cell lymphoma

          -  Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell other than leg type

               -  Histologically consistent with primary CBCL.

               -  Relapse or active disease after radiotherapy or other adequate therapy if
                  radiotherapy was contra-indicated (chemotherapy, surgical excision, interferonα,
                  rituximab).

               -  Performance status of 0, 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale
                  (See Appendix E).

               -  Minimum Life Expectancy &gt; 3 months.

               -  Adequate blood count: hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0 g/dL; White Blood Count (WBC) &gt;= 3.0 x
                  109/L; and platelet count &gt;= 75 x 109/L.

               -  Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and
                  serum transaminase (SGOT and SGPT)=&lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

               -  Adequate renal function: creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

               -  Written informed consent from patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          -  Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.

          -  Primary cutaneous intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.

          -  Extracutaneous involvement (sign of B-cell lymphoma on thoraco-abdominal CT scan
             and/or PET scan and/or on bone marrow biopsy).

          -  No histologic documentation of CBCL.

          -  History of known Human Immuno-deficiency Virus, Human Hepatitis B or C positive
             serology or other active systemic infections.

          -  Serious uncontrolled, concomitant medical disorders.

          -  Concomitant therapy for CBCL: surgical resection, radiotherapy, corticosteroid,
             chemotherapy, rituximab…(not limited listing)

          -  Major surgery in previous 4 weeks preceding the 1st injection.

          -  Pregnancy at study entry or who become pregnant during the study or women who are
             breast feeding.

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who refuse to use adequate protection
             against pregnancy (intra-uterine device, hormonal contraception or diaphragm/condom
             and spermicide) during the conduct of the study and for three months after the last
             injection.

          -  Participation in another experimental protocol during the study period and within 4
             weeks prior to the first injection.

          -  Patient previously included in this study.

          -  Non compliance with the study.
