      Alefacept (AMEVIVEÂ®) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that consists of the
      extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to
      the Fcof IgG1. Alefacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese Hamster Ovary
      (CHO) mammalian cell expression system. It was shown to interfere with lymphocyte activation.
      Alefacept was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults
      with chronic plaque psoriasis. Each course consisted of once-weekly administration for 12
      weeks of placebo or alefacept. The response to alefacept was significantly better in both
      studies. In both studies, onset of response to alefacept treatment (defined as at least 50%
      reduction of baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)) began 60 days after the start
      of therapy. With one course of therapy, the median duration of response (defined as
      maintenance of a 75% or greater reduction in PASI) was 3.5 months for alefacept treated
      patients and 1 month for placebo-treated patients. Most patients who had responded to either
      alefacept or placebo maintained a 50% or greater reduction in PASI through the 3-month
      observation period.

      Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the most ominous side effect of allogenic stem cell
      transplantation (SCT). It causes severe inflammatory process, which is usually located to the
      skin, gut and liver. Treatment of GVHD consists of various immuno-suppressive and
      immuno-modulating drugs, including steroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate etc.
      These drugs unfortunately can also cause severe immunologic failure that makes the patient
      prone to infection and malignancy, and other medication-specific side effects. In spite of
      this effect on the immune system, not all of the patients achieve control of GVHD, which
      usually rapidly leads to death. Despite the use of innovative immunosuppressive modalities,
      the prognosis of steroid resistant GVHD is usually poor. In the following study we will
      evaluate the effect of alefacept on steroid unresponsive cGVHD.
