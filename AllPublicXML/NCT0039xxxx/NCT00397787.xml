  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer that progressed after first-line therapy with gemcitabine. Sunitinib may
      stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate to sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival of
      sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      II. To determine the safety of sunitinib malate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed every 3 months until 2 years from study
      entry or until disease progression.

               -  One prior adjuvant chemotherapy regimen or chemoradiation therapy containing
                  gemcitabine if the patient subsequently progressed within 3 months of completion
                  of adjuvant therapy; patients who have received chemoradiation in the adjuvant
                  setting must have measurable disease outside the radiation port

          -  No prior therapy with any other antiangiogenic agent (e.g., bevacizumab, sorafenib,

             prophylaxis of thrombosis; Note: Low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided
             the patient's PT INR is &lt; 1.5

          -  No serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

             are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse

          -  Non-pregnant and not breast feeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because sunitinib is an antiangiogenic agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with sunitinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with sunitinib malate
