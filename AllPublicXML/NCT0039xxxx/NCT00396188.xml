  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of a proprietary software screening
      tool to discriminate normal corneas (front surface of the eye) from previously diagnosed
      corneal conditions (diseases/surgeries/pathologies) and to determine the repeatabiltity and
      reproducibility of the Atlas II corneal topographer in normal human corneas.

      1. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects with normal corneas.

        2. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects who underwent myopic
           laser vision correction.

        3. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects who underwent hyperopic
           laser vision correction.

        4. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects who were diagnosed to
           have keratoconus.

        5. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects with history of
           orthokeratology.

        6. To establish reference values for SF, CIM, and TKM in subjects with previously diagnosed
           corneal conditions (diseases/pathologies/surgeries) affecting the corneal surface that
           are not listed above.

        7. To determine the repeatabiltity and reproducibility of the Atlas II corneal topographer
           in normal human corneas using true elevation data and axial curvature.

        8. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the Pathfinder II Corneal
           Analysis software in discriminating normal corneas from previously diagnosed corneal
           conditions (diseases/pathologies/surgeries) affecting the corneal surface (Phase II).
