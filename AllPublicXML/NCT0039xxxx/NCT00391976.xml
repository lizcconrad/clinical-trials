    <textblock>
      This study assessed time to recurrence of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa following
      treatment of the initial infection with tobramycin nebuliser solution. The safety profile of
      the initial tobramycin treatment was assessed during the first 3 months of the study and
      patients were followed until the end of the study, month 27.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, open-label, two-arm, randomized study. All patients diagnosed with
      CF and who fulfilled the criteria for early infection with P. aeruginosa initially received
      tobramycin 300 mg twice a day for 28 days. At the end of the 28-day treatment period,
      patients who met the inclusion criteria and none of the additional exclusion criteria were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive an additional 28 days of treatment with
      tobramycin 300 mg twice a day (56-day group) or to stop study medication (28-day group).

      All randomized patients had regular study visits until a positive P. aeruginosa sample was
      obtained. Once P. aeruginosa had recurred, the patient entered a follow-up phase where
      minimal information was collected for 27 months. During the follow-up phase, patients were
      treated according to their physicians' discretion.

      Patients who started treatment with tobramycin but were not randomized (i.e. due to a
      positive antibody test) and followed up during routine clinic visits. They were allowed to
      continue their 28-day treatment period and afterwards be treated according to their
      physicians' discretion.
