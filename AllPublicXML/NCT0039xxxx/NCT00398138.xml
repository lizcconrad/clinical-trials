      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill cancer cells. Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system
      in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with
      GM-CSF may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and GM-CSF in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, non-small cell lung
      cancer, or mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and immunogenicity of the Wilms tumor-1 analog peptide vaccine in
           patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, non-small cell lung
           cancer, or mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (acute
      myeloid leukemia [AML] or myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS] vs non-small cell lung cancer or
      mesothelioma).

      Patients receive vaccine comprising Wilms-tumor 1 (WT-1) analog peptide emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) once in weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC twice in weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (on the day of and 2 days prior to each
      vaccination). Patients who have an immunologic response and have no disease progression may
      receive up to 6 more vaccinations approximately 1 month apart.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, week 8, and week 14. Samples are examined by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure levels of WT-1 and by T-cell proliferative
      response, delayed-type hypersensitivity against WT-1 peptides, or ELISPOT to measure immune
      response.

      Bone marrow samples are collected from patients with AML or MDS at baseline and week 14.
      Samples are examined by PCR to measure levels of WT-1 and by multiparameter flow cytometry to
      measure residual disease.

    <description>Immune reactivity to the peptides will be measured in the same fashion for patients with hematologic or thoracic malignancies. Immune responses will be measured by T cell proliferative response and DTH against WT-1 peptides. In patients with adequate samples, T cell gamma interferon release as measured by ELISPOT will be performed as well.</description>

    <description>Six vaccinations of the WT-1 peptide (1.0 ml of emulsion) will be administered on weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10 &amp; 12. Vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously with sites rotated among extremities. Injection sites will be pre-stimulated with Sargramostim (GM-CSF) (70 mcg) injected subcutaneously on days 0 &amp; -2 of each vaccination. Patients may self administer the Sargramostim (GM-CSF) if they have been appropriately instructed on SQ injection administration. Patients will keep a logbook noting the time &amp; placement of the injection. Note: during each vaccination, the Sargramostim (GM-CSF) &amp; the vaccine emulsion will be administered to the same anatomical site. This site will be marked by the patient or treating healthcare professional by a permanent marker pen. For patients who have a clinical, molecular, or immunologic response &amp; have not had disease progression, they may receive up to 6 more vaccinations administered approximately every month.</description>

Vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously with sites rotated among extremities. Injection sites will be pre-stimulated with Sargramostim (GM-CSF) (70 mcg) injected subcutaneously on days 0 &amp; -2 of each vaccination. Patients may self administer the Sargramostim (GM-CSF) if they have been appropriately instructed on SQ injection administration. Patients will keep a logbook noting the time &amp; placement of the injection. Note: during each vaccination, the Sargramostim (GM-CSF) &amp; the vaccine emulsion will be administered to the same anatomical site. This site will be marked by the patient or treating healthcare professional by a permanent marker pen. For patients who have a clinical, molecular, or immunologic response &amp; have not had disease progression, they may receive up to 6 more vaccinations administered approximately every month.
