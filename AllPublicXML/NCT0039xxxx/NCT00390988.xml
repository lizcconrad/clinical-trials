    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare capillary blood count parameters with the
      corresponding venous samples to verify the hypothesis that capillary and venous blood count
      parameters are equivalent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with haematological diseases regular blood count analyses are necessary. In
      haematology, capillary blood count analyses became established in routine diagnostics. The
      method and procedure of capillary blood sampling is well accepted by both the patients and
      the medical personal for a long time. However, only venous values are generally accepted in
      clinical routine. It is important to know whether or how capillary blood gives discrepant
      results for the various parameters. Values for therapeutic decisions, e.g. transfusion, are
      only known for venous values. So far, there are only deficient data available. Therefore, the
      aim of this study is (i) to compare capillary blood count parameters with the corresponding
      venous samples to verify the hypothesis that capillary and venous blood count parameters are
      equivalent, (ii) to include an adequate large number of adult haematological patients (with
      low and high values) and healthy adults, (iii) to obtain difference values for conversation
      of measured capillary values into the corresponding venous values.
