      After a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing, a physical and
      neurological evaluation, subjects will be asked to undergo an injection of ALTROPANE®
      followed by up to 60 minutes of serial dynamic imaging. Subjects will undergo a second
      injection of ALTROPANE® followed by up to 60 minutes of serial dynamic imaging within 2-6
      weeks of the injection 1.

    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this open label imaging study is to optimize the imaging outcome for
      ALTROPANE® in mild to moderate PD subjects. All study procedures will be conducted at the
      Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New
      Haven, CT. Subjects with PD (n=15) will be recruited to undergo ALTROPANE® SPECT. All
      subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline
      clinical laboratory testing, a physical and neurological evaluation. Subjects will be asked
      to undergo an injection of ALTROPANE® followed by up to 60 minutes of serial dynamic imaging.
      Subjects will be asked to undergo a second imaging visit two-six weeks following the initial
      imaging visit to assess the reproducibility of the imaging outcome. The imaging analyses will
      be performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to clinical severity.
      The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional distribution volumes expressed
      as a target region to occipital ratio. Striatal regions of interests for caudate and putamen
      will be defined and placement standardized based on previously optimized region placement
      protocols. Imaging data will also be analyzed using an automated objective striatal analysis
      software package.
