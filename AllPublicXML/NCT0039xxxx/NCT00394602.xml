  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To assess the preferences of cancer patients scheduled to receive chemoradiation and
           caregiver controls for side-effects of chemoradiation.

             1. To compare preferences of cancer patients to those of healthy individuals.

             2. To compare how patients' preferences for side-effects of chemoradiation change over
                time.

        2. To longitudinally assess the quality of life of cancer patients scheduled to receive
           chemoradiation.

        3. To determine the impact of nausea and vomiting associated with chemoradiation on
           patients' quality of life and evaluate potential change throughout the duration of
           chemoradiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      You will be interviewed about your perceptions of side effects that are related to your
      chemoradiation treatment. The interview will take about 20 minutes. You will be interviewed
      at the beginning of your chemoradiation treatment, 3 weeks after treatment starts, and at the
      first follow-up appointment after chemoradiation treatment ends.

      Chemoradiation is a type of cancer treatment that involves both chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy.

      You will also receive a packet of 3 questionnaires to complete at different times during and
      after treatment. The questionnaires include a quality of life survey that asks about
      physical, social, and emotional well-being, a self-report symptom evaluation that will ask
      whether you are experiencing any particular side effects and if so how much it bothers you,
      and a brief survey to asks questions about anxiety and distress.

      The questionnaires should take about 20 minutes each to complete. The questionnaire packet
      will be given to patients at the beginning of chemoradiation treatment, 3 weeks after
      treatment starts, the last day of treatment, and at the first follow-up appointment after
      chemoradiation treatment ends. If the you do not have time to complete the questionnaires, a
      stamped, addressed envelop will be given so that you can mail the completed packet back to
      the research team.

      Your participation in this research study will be over about 4-6 weeks after chemoradiation
      treatment ends.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 208 individuals (104 patients and 104 caregivers)
      will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
