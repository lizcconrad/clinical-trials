  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2004 there were more than 40 million people infected Worldwide with HIV, with
      an estimated 16,000 new infections every day (UNAIDS, 2004). The HIV epidemic threatens whole
      societies particularly in Africa and Asia and rates of infections in the Western Countries
      have also increased over the last few years. However, despite more than 15 years of research,
      an effective vaccine against HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has still not
      been developed.

      There is considerable evidence that cellular immune responses can effectively control HIV-1
      replication during acute and chronic infections thereby possibly protecting individuals from
      infection and preventing the spread of HIV. To be truly effective in the general population,
      a vaccine must induce responses specific to immunologically conserved regions. The
      epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represent a very logical approach to this problem because its
      potential to elicit a polyfunctional immune response and to focus these responses to
      conserved epitopes.

      In this study the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant MVA-BN® expressing
      CTL and HTL epitopes of HIV-1 (MVA-mBN32) vs. the vector control MVA-BN® in 30 HIV-infected
      subjects will be examined. This will include a full analysis of CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+
      CTL responses to these epitopes, to establish the potential of such a homologous prime-boost
      vaccine approach to induce a broad cell-mediated response to different HIV antigens.
