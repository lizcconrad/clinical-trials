  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to assess the role of hybrid PET/CT imaging diagnosis of
      active malignancy in cancer patients with rising tumor markers after treatment and in the
      diagnosis of primary tumor in patients with metastatic cancer of unknown origin. The clinical
      impact of PET/CT in the management and treatment of these two groups of cancer patients will
      be evaluated
