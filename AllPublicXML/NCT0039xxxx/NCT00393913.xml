  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious sleep disorder in which a person repeatedly stops
      breathing, or experiences shallow breathing for short periods of time during sleep. Daytime
      sleepiness is a common symptom of OSA and may affect an individual's level of alertness
      throughout the day. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between
      the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and levels of daytime alertness at baseline
      (untreated state) in a group of subjects with and without sleep apnea. In addition the change
      in daytime sleepiness in subjects with sleep apnea being treated with a continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) machine, a common treatment for OSA will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with OSA can experience up to 300 sleep disruptions each night, which may result
      in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), one of the most common symptoms of OSA. EDS can have
      serious consequences, including motor vehicle accidents, poor school performance, and
      work-related accidents and performance issues. The most common treatment for OSA is CPAP
      therapy. This involves wearing a mask over the nose while sleeping; air then flows through
      the mask into the nose to maintain a level of pressure that keeps the breathing passages
      open. CPAP therapy typically results in fewer sleep and breathing disruptions during the
      night, which may increase an individual's alertness levels during the day. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the relationship between severity of sleep-disordered breathing and
      daytime alertness levels in adults with and withoutout symptoms of OSA.

      This study will involve three to five study visits over a 2- to 3-month period. During the
      first 3 days, participants will record their sleep habits in a diary and will wear a device
      that measures breathing, oxygen levels, and sleep position. All participants will then take
      part in a 1-night inpatient stay at the sleep center lab during which brain, eye, muscle,
      heart, and breathing activity will be monitored. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of
      OSA will stay at the sleep lab one additional night for observation while using a CPAP
      machine. The following day, tests to measure alertness, ease of falling asleep, and
      sleepiness levels will be administered. Participants will then use the CPAP machine at home
      for 4-6 weeks; each machine will be set at an appropriate level for the participant, and will
      record breathing patterns and pressure. Participants will receive weekly phone calls for
      monitoring purposes. At the end of Week 4, participants will return to the sleep lab for one
      additional night of CPAP monitoring, followed by alertness and sleep testing. Those with
      severe OSA will use the CPAP machine at a newly adjusted level for 5 additional days and
      return for repeat testing. All participants who have been compliant with CPAP will return to
      the lab for overnight sleep testing without the CPAP machine and for alertness testing.

    <time_frame>Baseline, CPAP( 4 -6 weeks), Off CPAP ( 2 nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The Epworth sleepiness scale is used in the assessment of daytime sleepiness and measures the general level of sleepiness.The ESS presents the subject with eight situations and asks how likely they are to fall asleep (0= never, 1 =slight chance of dozing, 2= moderate chance of dozing and 3 =high chance of dozing) in these situations. The sum of the 8 answers is used as the score and ranges from 0 (not sleepy) to 24 (extremely sleepy), and a score of greater than 10 is an indication that a person may be excessively sleepy.</description>

    <measure>Vigilance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, CPAP (4-6 weeks), CPAP withdrawal (2 nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Vigilance is measured using the psychomotor vigilance task which is a portable reaction time test that is contained in a small, programmable, portable electronic box that requires only a single switch to start. The task consists of responding to a small bright red light stimulus by pressing a response button as soon as the stimulus appears. This stops the stimulus counter and displays the reaction time (RT) in milliseconds for a 2-second period and the task duration is 20 minutes. The subject is instructed to press the button as soon as each stimulus appears in order to keep the reaction time as low as possible. The PVT yields highly informative metrics on the capacity for sustained attention including the frequency of lapses (reaction time &gt; 500 milliseconds). The higher the number of lapses the greater the impairment. Well rested (non-sleepy) subjects have almost no lapses(&lt;2) during the 20min test.</description>

        <title>Subjective Sleepiness</title>
        <description>Measured using the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). The Epworth sleepiness scale is used in the assessment of daytime sleepiness and measures the general level of sleepiness.The ESS presents the subject with eight situations and asks how likely they are to fall asleep (0= never, 1 =slight chance of dozing, 2= moderate chance of dozing and 3 =high chance of dozing) in these situations. The sum of the 8 answers is used as the score and ranges from 0 (not sleepy) to 24 (extremely sleepy), and a score of greater than 10 is an indication that a person may be excessively sleepy.</description>

        <title>Vigilance</title>
        <description>Vigilance is measured using the psychomotor vigilance task which is a portable reaction time test that is contained in a small, programmable, portable electronic box that requires only a single switch to start. The task consists of responding to a small bright red light stimulus by pressing a response button as soon as the stimulus appears. This stops the stimulus counter and displays the reaction time (RT) in milliseconds for a 2-second period and the task duration is 20 minutes. The subject is instructed to press the button as soon as each stimulus appears in order to keep the reaction time as low as possible. The PVT yields highly informative metrics on the capacity for sustained attention including the frequency of lapses (reaction time &gt; 500 milliseconds). The higher the number of lapses the greater the impairment. Well rested (non-sleepy) subjects have almost no lapses(&lt;2) during the 20min test.</description>
