    <textblock>
      This trial combines trastuzumab and bevacizumab monoclonal antibodies, with ABI-007 and
      carboplatin, as neoadjuvant therapy in previously untreated locally advanced breast cancers
      demonstrating HER2 gene amplification. It is hoped that this novel combination will result in
      increased pathologic response rates that will translate into long term outcome improvements
      in HER2 positive patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

      All eligible patients will receive induction chemotherapy prior to consideration of primary
      surgical intervention. If surgical intervention is deemed not to be in the best interest of
      the patient, patient will go off study at the time of evaluation for surgery. Upon completion
      of chemotherapy and surgery, all ER + and/or PR + patients will be placed on Tamoxifen 20
      mg/qd or an aromatase inhibitor.

      Induction preoperative therapy:

        -  Bevacizumab

        -  Trastuzumab

        -  ABI-007

        -  Carboplatin

      Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy:

        -  Bevacizumab

        -  Trastuzumab

    <description>Patients received treatment with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV day 1) every 28 days for 6 cycles. Trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV) were administered weekly for 23 weeks, beginning concurrently with chemotherapy. Patients then underwent either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery and pathologic treatment responses were assessed. After surgery, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were administered at 3 week intervals for a total of 52 weeks.</description>

          <description>Patients received treatment with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV day 1) every 28 days for 6 cycles. Trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV) were administered weekly for 23 weeks, beginning concurrently with chemotherapy. Patients then underwent either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery and pathologic treatment responses were assessed. After surgery, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were administered at 3 week intervals for a total of 52 weeks.</description>
