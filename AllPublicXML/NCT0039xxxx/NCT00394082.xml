    <time_frame>up to 25 months</time_frame>
    <description>Count of study participants who had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) defined as any adverse event that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the start of disease progression or patient death, whichever occurs first. Patients who do not have disease progression or have not died at the end of follow-up were censored at the last known time the patient was progression free. Patients that initiate other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated.
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) defines progressive disease (PD) as a &gt;= 20% increase taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Confirmed Complete or Partial Overall Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). RECIST defines overall response of CR as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions, confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. Overall response of PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression of non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions, confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing and no appearance of new lesions. The objective response is determined by combining the response of target and non-target lesions and the appearance of new lesion(s) or not together.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease for &gt;= 16 Weeks, or Complete or Partial Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control is stable disease (SD) for &gt;=16 weeks + complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). RECIST defines SD as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease and no new lesions. Definitions for CR and PR can be found in outcome #3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as progression-free survival in responders, i.e. as the time between the start of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the start of progressive disease (PD) or patient death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients that did not have progression or have not died were censored at the last known time the patient was progression free. Patients that initiate other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated.
Progressive disease is defined in outcome #2. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) are defined in outcome #3.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Participant Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant survival is the time from the first dose of study drug to patient death from any cause. Patients that did not die were censored at the last known time the patient was alive.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the start of disease progression or patient death, whichever occurs first. Patients who do not have disease progression or have not died at the end of follow-up were censored at the last known time the patient was progression free. Patients that initiate other anticancer therapy prior to progression were censored at the time when new anticancer therapy was initiated.
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) defines progressive disease (PD) as a &gt;= 20% increase taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion.</description>

If a patient develops intolerable toxicity to only one of the drugs, the other drug may be continued as single agent therapy in the absence of progression, as long as the treating physician feels this is in the best interests of the patient.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Confirmed Complete or Partial Overall Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</title>
        <description>Objective response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). RECIST defines overall response of CR as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions, confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. Overall response of PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression of non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions, confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing and no appearance of new lesions. The objective response is determined by combining the response of target and non-target lesions and the appearance of new lesion(s) or not together.</description>
