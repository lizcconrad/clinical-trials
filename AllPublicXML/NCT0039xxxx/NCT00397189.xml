  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of a 3 week treatment
      period with Circadin® 2 mg in shortening sleep latency in patients with primary insomnia aged
      18-80 with melatonin deficiency.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies throughout the world have shown that insomnia is a common complaint that occurs in
      10-50% of the population depending on age, sex and country. Among the wide variety of
      available treatments of sleep disturbances, the most commonly prescribed hypnotics are the
      benzodiazepines (BZD) and non-BZD hypnotics.

      However, these hypnotics were often associated with rebound, dependency, tolerance, higher
      risk of falls mainly in the elderly population, anterograde memory disturbances and increased
      risk for motor accidents the next day.

      In response to the unmet clinical need for a safe and efficacious alternative treatment for
      primary insomnia, that in addition to treating quantitative sleep problems, would improve
      sleep quality and daytime functioning, a clinical development program on melatonin for the
      treatment of primary insomnia was initiated.

      This study is conducted using a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group
      design, after a single-blind placebo period. Primary insomnia patients aged 18-80 will be
      screened for entry into the study.

      After the initial 3 weeks double-blind treatment period, patients will be given the option to
      enter a six-month double-blind continuation study.

      Primary parameter is sleep latency, secondary parameter is sleep maintenance. Exploratory
      parameters are total sleep time, sleep quality, morning alertness and quality of life.

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Subjective Sleep Latency.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep latency (SL) after 3 weeks of treatment was assessed by Patient Daily Sleep Diary (National sleep foundation sleep diary). The patients reported subjectively of their SL. The Sleep Diary question 3 (SL) was summarised at baseline (end of the two-week run-in period) and after three weeks double-blind treatment (actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. At each visit, the mean of the seven days prior to the visit were used. For each treatment group, the mean score at visit 3 was compared, adjusting for the visit 2 score. An ANCOVA model was used. Lower score indicates reduction in sleep latency and thus considered improvement</description>

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep maintenance as measured by number of awakening (NOA) after 3 weeks of treatment was assessed by Patient Daily Sleep Diary (National sleep foundation sleep diary). The patients reported subjectively of their NOA. The Sleep Diary question 4 (NOA) was summarized at baseline (end of the two-week run-in period) and after three weeks double-blind treatment (actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. At each visit, the mean of the seven days prior to the visit were used. For each treatment group, the mean score at visit 3 was compared, adjusting for the visit 2 score. An ANCOVA model was used. Lower score indicates less awakenings and thus considered improvement.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>930 patients were enrolled into the study and entered the run-in period; 139 of these patients were discontinued during the run-in period. The main reasons for discontinuation from the run-in were unwillingness to continue and ineligible to continue.

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Subjective Sleep Latency.</title>
        <description>Sleep latency (SL) after 3 weeks of treatment was assessed by Patient Daily Sleep Diary (National sleep foundation sleep diary). The patients reported subjectively of their SL. The Sleep Diary question 3 (SL) was summarised at baseline (end of the two-week run-in period) and after three weeks double-blind treatment (actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using descriptive statistics. At each visit, the mean of the seven days prior to the visit were used. For each treatment group, the mean score at visit 3 was compared, adjusting for the visit 2 score. An ANCOVA model was used. Lower score indicates reduction in sleep latency and thus considered improvement</description>
