  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood glucose levels in hospitalized patients with diabetes are associated with
      increased risk of medical complications. Improved glucose control with insulin injections may
      improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications. It is not known;
      however, what is the best insulin regimen in hospitalized patients. The use of repeated
      injections of regular insulin (known as sliding scale regimen) is one of the most commonly
      used insulin regimen for glucose control in hospitalized patients with diabetes. Recently,
      the combination of basal and rapid acting insulins has been shown to improve glucose control
      with lower rate of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

      This study will compare how well regular insulin will compare to glargine (Lantus®) once
      daily plus glulisine (Apidra®) insulin before meals in hospitalized patients with type 2
      diabetes and elevated blood glucose (sugar) levels. Lantus is a long-acting insulin which is
      given subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. Apidra is a rapid-acting insulin which is
      given subcutaneously several times a day and frequently before meals. Regular insulin is a
      short-acting insulin in clinical use for more than 20 years that is also given subcutaneously
      several times per day. Lantus, Apidra and regular insulins are approved for use in the
      treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA.

      This investigator-initiated research will be conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta
      and at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami. Dr. Umpierrez designed the study and will serve as
      principal investigator. A total of 65 patients will be recruited at Grady and 65 patients at
      the Jackson Memorial Hospital. This study is supported by Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 70 years admitted to a general medicine
             service.
