      The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety of dose-dense ABI-007
      (Abraxane) 260 mg/m^2 or Taxol 175 mg/m^2 given every 2 weeks following dose-dense Adriamycin
      plus Cytoxan (AC) chemotherapy. Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks
      throughout chemotherapy, and then at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks following chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient was eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria
        were met:

          1. Female, age greater than or equal to 18 to less than or equal to 70 years old.

          2. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status have been determined.

          3. Operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast

          4. Must have met 1 of the following criteria:

               -  T1-3, N1-3, M0, regardless of ER or PR status.

               -  T &gt; 2 cm, N0, M0 (T2-3N0M0), regardless of ER or PR status.

               -  T &gt; 1 cm, N0, M0 (T1cN0M0) and both ER and PR negative

               -  T &gt; 1 cm, N0, M0, ER or PR positive and grade 3

          5. Patients with one sentinel lymph node metastasis 0.2-2 mm in size were not required to
             undergo completion axillary dissection unless only 1 sentinel lymph node was examined.
             This completion axillary dissection was optional if 1 out of 2 or more sentinel lymph
             nodes was positive for a micrometastasis. Therefore if 1 of 1 sentinel lymph node was
             positive for micrometastasis(0.2-2 mm), then a completion axillary dissection was
             required.

          6. Patients with more than one sentinel node micrometastasis or 1 node with a
             micrometastasis &gt; 2 mm and/or T3 disease must have undergone completion, standard
             axillary dissection. -Note: the following were not eligible-

             T1b,c,N0M0 and ER or PR positive and grade 1 or 2 Tx tumors (regardless of nodal
             status) T4 disease [i.e., patients with fixed tumors, peau d'orange skin changes, skin
             ulcerations, or inflammatory changes

               -  Note: Sentinel lymph node micrometastasis &lt; 0.2 mm in considered N0 disease

          7. Negative surgical margins on lumpectomy or mastectomy specimen (no ink on invasive
             cancer and no ink on ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]).

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          9. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG, as assessed by the investigator).

         10. No pre-existing peripheral neuropathy.

         11. It had not been longer than 84 days since the date of definitive surgery (eg,
             mastectomy or in the case of a breast-sparing procedure, axillary dissection).

         12. Laboratory values were to be as follows:

               -  White blood cell count: &gt; or equal to 3,000/mm^3

               -  Absolute neutrophil count:&gt; or equal to 1,500/mm^3

               -  Platelets:&gt; or equal to 100,000/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin: &gt; or equal to 8g/dL

               -  Bilirubin:&lt; or equal to the institution's ULN

               -  Creatinine: &lt; or equal to 1.7 mg/dL

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline
                  phosphatase could be up to 2.5 times the institutional ULN.

         13. All staging studies including physical exam, chest x-ray, and bone scan had to show no
             evidence of metastatic disease, including suspicious lymphadenopathy or skin nodules
             on physical exam. A chest x-ray and bone scan were mandatory; however, all other
             staging studies were at the treating physician's discretion. Any other staging test
             (eg, Computed Tomography [CT] scans, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] studies,
             ultrasound of abdomen, Positron Emission Tomography [PET] scans must have been
             negative for metastatic disease. An abdominal CT scan or PET scan was mandatory for
             patients with liver function tests elevated above the upper limit of normal (ULN) to
             rule out metastatic disease. If the patient had a staging PET scan then a bone scan
             was not necessary, but a chest x-ray was required.

         14. Patient had a negative serum pregnancy test &lt; or equal to 14 days of the first dose of
             study drug (patients of childbearing potential).

         15. If fertile, patient had agreed to us an acceptable method of birth control to avoid
             pregnancy [Note: oral contraceptives were not allowed] for the duration of
             chemotherapy and hormonal therapy and for 6 months thereafter.

         16. If obese, a patient must have been treated with doses calculated using his/her actual
             body surface area (BSA) (the physician must have been comfortable treating at the full
             BSA dose regardless of BSA).

         17. Patient had signed a Patient Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient was not eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        applied:

          1. Patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer (IHC 3+ or FISH +) who were eligible for

          <title>Stage at Primary Diagnosis</title>
          <description>American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition staging for breast cancer was used to define stage at primary diagnosis. The scale ranges from stage I (primary tumor &lt;=2.0 cm, no regional or distant lymph node involvement) to stage IV (primary tumor of any size, with both regional and distant lymph node involvement). Each stage includes combinations of ratings for the primary tumor, regional lymph node involvement, and metastasis. Illustrative examples of stages appear in the data table. Each higher stage represents increasingly poor prognosis.</description>

Participants with treatment-emergent toxicities with a frequency of &gt;=20% in any treatment arm, and participants with at least one toxicity are reported.
Taxane subsets (ABI-007 subset and Taxol subset treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of taxane treatment (cycle 5, week 9) through 30 days after the last dose of taxane (week 20) and were ongoing 3 months after chemotherapy (month 7).

Participants with treatment-emergent toxicities with a frequency of &gt;=20% in any treatment arm, and participants with at least one toxicity are reported.
Taxane subsets (ABI-007 subset and Taxol subset treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of taxane treatment (cycle 5, week 9) through 30 days after the last dose of taxane (week 20) and were ongoing 6 months after chemotherapy (month 10).
Entire regiments (AC --&gt; ABI-007 and AC --&gt; Taxol treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of chemotherapy (cycle 1, week 1) through 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy (week 20) and were ongoing 6 months after chemotherapy (month 10).</description>

          <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Toxicities With a Frequency &gt;=20% at 6 Months Post Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Toxicities are summarized using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) terms. Participants with treatment-emergent toxicities with a frequency of &gt;=20% in any treatment arm, and participants with at least one toxicity are reported.
Taxane subsets (ABI-007 subset and Taxol subset treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of taxane treatment (cycle 5, week 9) through 30 days after the last dose of taxane (week 20) and were ongoing 6 months after chemotherapy (month 10).
Entire regiments (AC --&gt; ABI-007 and AC --&gt; Taxol treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of chemotherapy (cycle 1, week 1) through 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy (week 20) and were ongoing 6 months after chemotherapy (month 10).</description>
