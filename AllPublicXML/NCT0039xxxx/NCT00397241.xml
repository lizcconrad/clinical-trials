      The primary objective of this crossover trial is to compare the 3-month mean 24-hour
      intraocular pressure (IOP) control and safety of dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (DTFC)
      given twice daily, versus latanoprost/timolol fixed combination (LTFC) given in the evening
      and placebo given in the morning, versus adjunctive therapy with DTFC given twice daily and
      latanoprost 0.005% given once in the evening in open-angle glaucoma patients who are
      insufficiently controlled with latanoprost monotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive primary open-angle (POAG) and exfoliative glaucoma (XFG) patients will be
             recruited.

          -  Patients included will be older than 29 years

          -  Have early to moderate POAG, or XFG (less than 12 mean deviation visual field loss
             attributed to glaucoma and 0.8 or better vertical cup-to-disc ratio)

          -  Will be on therapy with latanoprost for more than 3 months;

          -  Have at treated baseline IOP at 10:00 (two consecutive readings) greater than 21 mm Hg

          -  Have a reliable visual field (at least two visual fields with less than 30% fixation
             losses, false positives or negatives)

          -  Have a best corrected distance Snellen visual acuity &gt; 1/10

          -  Have corneal pachymetry within the 550 ± 55 μm range, understand the study
             instructions and are willing to attend all follow-up appointments

          -  Are willing to comply with study medication usage

          -  And have open, normal appearing angles

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have: a risk for significant deterioration during
             the study

          -  Known previous history of lack of adequate response (&lt; 10% reduction) to any topical
             glaucoma medication

          -  Less than 20% daytime IOP reduction on latanoprost;

          -  Systemic contraindications to topical beta-blockers (asthma, bradycardia, severe
             congestive heart disease)

          -  Known contraindications to prostaglandins, history of ocular herpetic disease, or
             cystoid macular edema

          -  History of trauma, inflammation, surgery or past use of steroids (within two months)

          -  Severe dry eyes

          -  Use of contact lenses

          -  Signs of ocular infection, except blepharitis

          -  Corneal abnormality that may affect IOP measurements

          -  Unwillingness to accept the risk for hyperchromia of the iris or development of
             hypertrichosis

          -  And females of childbearing potential or lactating mothers
