  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase III, open-label, single-arm study that was conducted at 43 centers in the
      United States and Canada. 251 adult and pediatric patients with dysfunctional central venous
      catheters (CVCs) were enrolled in the study and treated with one or two doses of
      tenecteplase.

    <description>2 mL of reconstituted lyophilized tenecteplase instilled into lumen of dysfunctional CVC.
Patients weighing ≥ 30 kg received 2-mL instillations of tenecteplase (i.e., 2 mg of tenecteplase). Patients weighing &lt; 30 kg received instillations of tenecteplase equal to 110% of the internal lumen volume of the dysfunctional CVC. This dose was rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL and should not have exceeded 2 mL (2 mg).</description>

In CVCs for which function was not restored, study drug was left to dwell for an additional 90 (±10) minutes (120 minutes post-treatment), after which CVC function was assessed as before. If CVC function was not restored by 120 minutes after Dose 1, Dose 2 was given. Assessment of CVC function was repeated as before, after 15 (±5) minutes and, if needed, after 30 (±5) minutes and 120 (±10) minutes.</description>
