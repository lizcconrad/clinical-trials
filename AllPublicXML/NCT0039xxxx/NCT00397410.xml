      Hip fractures are a major cause of disability and functional limitation. Hip protectors have
      shown to have the potential to lower the risk of a fracture by reducing the impact on the hip
      region during falls, but low uptake and adherence have been a problem.

      Changing the hip protector`s design might give a higher uptake and adherence. The aim of this
      study is to compare uptake, adherence and effect of soft and hard hip protectors in Norwegian
      nursing homes. Because a soft hip protector seems to be more comfortable, we expect a higher
      uptake and adherence with the soft hip protector, specially when it comes to 24 hour use. If
      the soft hip protector has the same protective quality as the hard hip protector, the soft
      hip protector will be a better alternative than the hard one.

      This cluster randomized study is performed in 18 Norwegian nursing homes in 2 municipalities.
      The study started May 15. 2006 and will end November 30. 2006.

      All permanent residents are invited to participate in the study either as a user of hip
      protector or as a non user.
