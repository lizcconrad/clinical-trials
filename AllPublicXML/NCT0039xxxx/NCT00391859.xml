  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health concern. Currently, there are at least 3 million
      Canadians afflicted with this condition with a 50% increase predicted by 2020. It is
      estimated that 85% of Canadians are afflicted with OA by age 70. As such, using the current
      health care structure, it is doubtful that the health system can keep pace with this
      increasing demand. Alternative health care delivery strategies must be investigated.

      The purpose of this study is to assess if a pharmacist-initiated intervention for individuals
      with knee pain with a high likelihood of knee OA will lead to an improvement in the quality
      of care for these individuals.

      We are hopeful that results of this study will show better management of knee osteoarthritis
      by a pharmacist-initiated intervention (which means that it is the pharmacist who will start
      the process for an intervention that includes exercise and an educational program when
      compared to no intervention. If this is the case, by implementing the proposed intervention
      program, subjects could be diagnosed earlier, the burden of illness on individuals could be
      diminished through an appropriate intervention program, and economic savings could be
      embraced.

      Hypothesis: Community pharmacists can identify patients with likely knee OA and initiate a
      multidisciplinary intervention that will improve quality of care and outcomes.

      This will be a pilot study of a multidisciplinary intervention for individuals with knee pain
      with a high likelihood of knee OA that could be a model for other chronic diseases. The
      intervention will be multidisciplinary such that it will be initiated by community
      pharmacists with referral to a comprehensive OA treatment program at the provincial arthritis
      center involving physiotherapists. In addition, formal communication will be initiated with
      their family doctor. Those in the usual care group will receive an educational OA pamphlet.
      The primary objective of this pilot project is to determine the proportion of patients who
      meet the Arthritis Foundation's Quality Indicator Set for osteoarthritis in the treatment arm
      compared to those in the usual care arm. Specifically, this indicator set focuses on health
      service provision within the first few months of diagnosis which includes physical
      examination, radiographs, education, exercise, weight loss, assistive devices and
      pharmacologic therapy.
