      Background: Heel lancing is a routine procedure for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria in
      infants. Despite the short- and long-term adverse effects of pain, there are no guidelines
      for the reduction of such pain. Previous studies evaluated different treatment modalities;
      however, in most of them, pain response was assessed by subjective measures.

      Aims of study: 1. To characterize the pain response of infants by using a computerized
      analysis of the ECG. 2. To compare six different methods of pain reduction during heel
      lancing in newborns.

      Methods: The time, geometric and frequency domains of the infants' ECG will be computed
      during heel lancing. 150 healthy full-term infants will be evaluated in six treatment groups:
      breastfeeding, bottle feeding, skin-to-skin contact, lying on a table without anything, lying
      with a pacifier and lying while getting a glucose solution. The differences in pain response
      to these six treatment modalities will be assessed and compared to the infants' length of
      cry, and scoring of the infants' behavioral response.
