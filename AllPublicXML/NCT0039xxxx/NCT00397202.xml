      1. Purpose: To compare the use of the menstrual cup &quot;The DivaCupTM &quot; to a menstrual
           strategy using tampons as the primary method of menstrual flow management using
           indicators of user-satisfaction, urinary tract infection, vaginal irritation, cost and
           waste.

        2. Hypothesis: The &quot;The DivaCupTM&quot; will have similar rates of user-satisfaction, urinary
           tract infection, and vaginal irritation as a menstrual strategy using tampons as the
           primary method of menstrual flow management but will likely be more reasonable in terms
           of cost and will generate less waste.

      Method:

      Prospective study of 100 women from family practice offices in Vancouver, Victoria and Prince
      George who currently use tampons to manage menstrual flow. After an information session and
      consent, subjects will be randomized to tampon use or Diva Cup use and record their
      experience on a diary for 3 months. Women who attend the information session and who do not
      enrol, or those who drop out will be asked their reasons for discontinuing, and their
      pre-study questionnaire will be used for analysis.
