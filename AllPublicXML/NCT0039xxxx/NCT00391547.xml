      The primary purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of a prescription mouthrinse in human
      subjects for treatment of Gingivitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingivitis is an endemic disease that is a precursor to periodontal disease. Two mouthrinse
      agents, Peridex and Listerine, have received the Seal of Acceptance from the Council on
      Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association for the control of supragingival
      plaque and gingivitis. Peridex (0.12% chlorhexidine, bisbiguanide cationic detergent) is a
      prescription mouthrinse that demonstrates potent anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis action.
      Chlorhexidine rinses are also prescribed to prevent post surgical infections. Chlorhexidine
      has broad spectrum antibacterial activity and substantivity. With prolonged use,
      chlorhexidine maintains its effectiveness but causes staining of natural teeth and composite
      materials used in restorative dentistry. Other side effects associated with chlorhexidine are
      calculus formation and possible alterations in taste. Although chlorhexidine rinses and
      supragingival irrigations have demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing plaque and
      gingivitis, chlorhexidine has had a minimal impact in treating periodontal disease.
      Listerine, comprised of essential oils, is an over-the-counter mouthrinse that is less
      effective than chlorhexidine in controlling plaque and gingivitis, but has minimal side
      effects. Other agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds and metal salts are rarely used
      alone but can be used in combination with other antimicrobial rinses to enhance their
      effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects shall meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
        participation in this study:

          -  Males or non-pregnant females of 18 years of age, and in good general health, as
             determined by Investigator.

          -  Have 16 natural, gradable teeth and good dental health, as determined by Investigator.

          -  Have &gt; 25% sites with GI scores &gt; 2.

          -  Have average PI score &gt; 2.

          -  Use of effective method of contraception for the duration of the study or permanently
             sterilized.

          -  Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on
             study treatment (drug) and returning for follow-up visits as required by the protocol.

        Have full understanding of all elements of, and signature and dating of the written
        informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol specified procedures. Females with
        childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before and during the study
        period. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These
        methods include oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD),
        levonogestrol implants (Norplant®), medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera®)
        or contraceptive foam with a condom.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for participation
        in this study:

          -  History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic medical or
             psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would render
             examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study
             participation.

          -  Treatment with antibiotic within the one (1) month period prior to the screening
             examination.

          -  Presence of heart murmur, history of rheumatic fever, valvular disease or prosthetic
             implant requiring antibiotic premedication.

          -  History of thyroid disease.

          -  History of diabetes.

          -  History of autoimmune disease.

          -  Gross oral pathology (periodontal disease, rampant caries, tissue damage created by
             poor oral care or treatment, soft or hard tissue tumors) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could influence the outcome of the study.

          -  Current signs or symptoms of mucosal tissue ulcerations or inflammation, or canker
             sores.

          -  Presence of orthodontic appliances or any removable appliance that impinges on the
             oral tissues being assessed.

             steroids, or therapeutic doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phenytoin,
             calcium antagonists, cyclosporine or coumadin).

          -  Concomitant therapy with another investigational drug or device without prior approval
             from the Sponsor within four (4) weeks prior to Visit 2 (Study Day 1).

             study.

          -  Unable and unwilling to comply with the informed consent process, to meet study
             requirements including following instructions on study treatment (drug), and to return
