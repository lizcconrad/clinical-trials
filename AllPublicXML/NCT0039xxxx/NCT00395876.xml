  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted
      at 24 centers in the United States and Canada. 100 adult and pediatric patients with
      dysfunctional central venous catheters (CVCs) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive an initial dose of either placebo (Arm A) or tenecteplase (Arm B).
