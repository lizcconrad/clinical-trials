    <description>Excess body weight: the difference between a participant's actual body weight and the weight a participant of his/her height would have if his/her BMI were 24.9 kg/m2. Excess body weight at a given visit was calculated as body weight in kilograms (kg) at that visit minus 24.9 Ã— height in meters (m)^2 or 0, whichever was greater. If a participant achieved a normal BMI (24.9 kg/m^2), that subject was considered to have no excess weight. Additional weight loss that occurred after a normal BMI was achieved was not included in the calculation of excess weight loss. Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4), the start of the Lead-In Period. Baseline was Day 1 of the randomization to a study arm.</description>

        <description>Initial (Day 1 through Week 12), late (Week 12 through Week 20), and overall (Day 1 through Week 20) rates of Least squares (LS) mean absolute change in body weight were defined by the slopes of the regression lines fitted to the observed body weights during the periods from Baseline (Day 1) through each visit to Week 20. Initial, late and overall absolute change was measured in kilograms of body weight per week (kg/week). Baseline refers to Visit 4 (Day 1 of randomization period).</description>

        <title>LS Mean Percent Change in Weight From Enrollment to Baseline and LS Mean Percent Change in Excess Weight From Enrollment to Baseline - Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Excess body weight: the difference between a participantâ€™s actual body weight and the weight a participant of his/her height would have if his/her BMI were 24.9 kg/m2. Excess body weight at a given visit was calculated as body weight in kilograms (kg) at that visit minus 24.9 Ã— height in meters (m)^2 or 0, whichever was greater. If a participant achieved a normal BMI (24.9 kg/m^2), that subject was considered to have no excess weight. Additional weight loss that occurred after a normal BMI was achieved was not included in the calculation of excess weight loss. Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4), the start of the Lead-In Period. Baseline was Day 1 of the randomization to a study arm.</description>

Participants who were overweight (BMI of 25 kg/m^2 to &lt;30 kg/m^2) at enrollment were evaluated at Week 16 to see if the same number who were overweight at enrollment were still overweight at Week 16 or if they had changed to normal (or obese).</description>

        <description>Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4). Baseline refers to Visit 4 (Day 1 of randomization period). Leptin was measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).

        <description>Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4). PRO: Total Score in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire-lite Version (IWQOL-Lite), 31-item instrument used to assess the effect of weight on physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work. Individual items range from 1 to 5 with 5=always true and 1= never true. Total score measured on scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores indicate improvement; Profile of Mood States (POMS), 65 mood adjectives that assess participants' mood over the past seven days. The POMS-B is an authorized, 30-item brief version of the POMS consisting of five items for each: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment. Scores range from 0= Not at All to 4=Extremely. Factor scores added for total score. Lower score indicates improvement. 0=best outcome; 120=worst outcome.</description>

          <title>LS Mean Absolute Change From Enrollment to Week 16 in Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Instruments Measuring Quality of Life and Mood - Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4). PRO: Total Score in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire-lite Version (IWQOL-Lite), 31-item instrument used to assess the effect of weight on physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work. Individual items range from 1 to 5 with 5=always true and 1= never true. Total score measured on scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores indicate improvement; Profile of Mood States (POMS), 65 mood adjectives that assess participants' mood over the past seven days. The POMS-B is an authorized, 30-item brief version of the POMS consisting of five items for each: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment. Scores range from 0= Not at All to 4=Extremely. Factor scores added for total score. Lower score indicates improvement. 0=best outcome; 120=worst outcome.</description>

        <description>The HADS is a questionnaire that uses 14 items to assess both anxiety and depression over the past week. The odd numbered items constitute the anxiety subscale, and the even numbered items constitute the depression subscale. The individual response scores for each subscale component are added together to obtain the individual subscale scores. The minimum and maximum score for each subscale is 0 and 21, respectively. The lower the score the more improvement a participant shows.</description>

        <description>Enrollment was Visit 2 (Week -4). Blood pressure (BP) was measured after 5 minutes of quiet rest with the participant in a sitting position and was measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Blood pressure was taken at each visit (screening, Week -4, Week -2, Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (or early termination). After the Lead-In Period, participants were either randomized to one of the 3 arms of the study or they were dropped from the study so the time frame for evaluation of all participants in the study was either: enrollment up to Week 20 for Randomized participants or enrollment up to, but not including Day 1 for Non-Randomized participants who participated only in the Lead-In Period.</description>

        <description>A 12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at Week -4, Day 1, Week 16, Week 20 or early termination and the overall interpretation of the ECG was made by the investigator as normal, abnormal (not clinically significant) and abnormal (clinically significant). The ECG consisted of the PR interval = time from beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex; (Note: QRS complex is a name for the combination of 3 of the graphical deflections seen in an ECG); QRS (time from the beginning to the end of the QRS complex) interval; QT interval (measure between Q wave and T wave in the heart's electrical cycle); and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) were measured in milliseconds (msec). .</description>

        <description>Serum titer determinations for antibodies to leptin were made using a validated electrochemical luminescence (ECLA) bridging assay.

Participants were considered to have a positive titer to treatment-emergent antibodies to leptin at a given visit if they had a titer &gt;=5 following a negative or missing titer at baseline or if they had a titer that had increased by at least 2 dilutions from a detectable level at baseline. All participants were evaluated (including those who did not receive metreleptin as their randomized study drug). Baseline was Day 1 (randomization).</description>
