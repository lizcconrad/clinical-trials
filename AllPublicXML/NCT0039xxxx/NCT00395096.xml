  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common childhood diseases. It is chronic and often severely
      disabling. The amount of nitric oxide that is exhaled while breathing increases with airway
      inflammation, a symptom of asthma. This study will examine the results from a previous study,
      the Cincinnati Asthma Prevention (CAP) study, to evaluate the effects of environmental and
      genetic factors on exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels and to determine the relationship
      between eNO and asthma severity.

      Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring gas that plays a role in many body functions. Levels of
      eNO increase with airway inflammation, a symptom of asthma. Researchers have proposed using
      eNO as a noninvasive measure to guide physicians in the treatment and medical management of
      asthma in children. However, more information about eNO is needed before this can happen.
      This study will perform a secondary analysis of the results from its parent study, the CAP
      study, which evaluated the effectiveness of preventing asthma in children who had been
      exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.

      This study will not enroll any new participants. Previously collected data from the CAP study
      will be reevaluated in this study to determine the longitudinal effects of environmental and
      genetic factors on eNO levels. In addition, the data will be evaluated to determine the
      relationship between eNO levels and asthma severity. No new data will be collected in this
      study.
