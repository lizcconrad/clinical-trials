      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of increasing doses of
      MultiGeneAngio, a cell therapy product produced from the patient's own cells, as potential
      treatment for patients with peripheral arterial disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16 million patients worldwide (1 in 20 people over the age of 50) suffer from
      peripheral arterial disease(PAD). PAD is characterized by narrowing or occlusion of vessels
      supplying blood to the lower limbs, most often due to atherosclerosis. Symptoms of PAD
      include claudication that may progress to critical limb ischemia manifested by rest pain,
      tissue loss and gangrene, which eventually may necessitate amputation.

      MultiGeneAngio is a cell therapy-based product developed for treatment of patients with PAD
      secondary to narrow or blocked arteries in the legs. MultiGeneAngio is composed of
      endothelial and smooth muscle cells that are isolated from a short vein segment stripped from
      the patient's arm. After isolation the cells are expanded, characterized, and gene modified
      by transfer of angiogenic genes.

      MultiGeneAngio is a clear cell suspension injected intra-arterially at the site of blockage
      using a standard diagnostic catheter, in order to create and expand new collateral arteries,
      and thereby improve blood flow to an ischemic limb.

      Comprehensive pre-clinical studies, as well as clinical experience with PAD patients
      suffering from claudication showed that production and administration of MultiGeneAngio was
      feasible and safe, as no apparent drug-related adverse events have been observed. Moreover,
      follow-up data of peak walking times imply a beneficial trend of this efficacy end-point.
      Additional follow-up data will continue to be collected to help evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of MultiGeneAngio.
