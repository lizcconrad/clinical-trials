      The main purpose of this study is to see what levels of Bone Mineral Density post-menopausal
      women with breast cancer have, and to see if the level of Bone Mineral Density changes during
      a women's treatment after her surgery.

      This trial studies changes in Bone Mineral Density and markers of of bone activity in
      post-menopausal women receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of breast cancer

          -  Last menstrual period occurring more than 5 years ago

          -  Non-metastatic breast cancer tumor with the diagnosis of Tis, Tl-T4, N0-3, M0

          -  DCIS is allowed, but LCIS (only) is not

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any metabolic bone disease other than postmenopausal osteoporosis or osteopenia

          -  Use of systemic gonadal hormonal medications or supplements within the past 24 months

          -  Prior use of tamoxifen or raloxifene is permitted if the medication was discontinued
             more than 24 months prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer.

          -  No adjuvant antiestrogen, antineoplastic, therapies are permitted on study.

          -  Chronic use of systemic steroids for disease process other than breast cancer
             chemotherapy premedication or antiemetics

          -  History of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hyperparathyroidism, renal
             osteodystrophy, moderate to severe inflammatory or autoimmune disease or newly
             diagnosed thyroid condition requiring titration of medications.

          -  Lobular carcinoma in situ or Stage IV breast cancer and patients with a concurrently
             active second malignancy other then adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers or in
             situ cervical cancer.

          -  participation in other clinical trials that are measuring BMD as a study parameter

          -  Patients with conditions that are expected to distort BMD reading and make DEXA
             results unreliable

          -  Patients with concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would keep them from
             understanding and complying with this clinical trial.
