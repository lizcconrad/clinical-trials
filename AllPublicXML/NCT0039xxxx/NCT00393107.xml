  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of follicular lymphomas is characterized by a high initial response rate
      to chemotherapy followed invariably by relapse, with subsequent remissions of progressively
      shorter duration. The majority of patients eventually die of their disease. As yet, there is
      no gold standard for the treatment of newly diagnosed or relapsed advanced FL.Rituximab(R)
      has been shown to be a highly effective agent in the treatment of FL, either alone or in
      combination with chemotherapy. The ability of R to sensitize indolent lymphoma derived cell
      lines to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents has been demonstrated. Furthermore, fludarabine (F)
      may also sensitize cells to the effects of R. Cyclophosphamide (C) and F have shown in vivo
      synergistic activity. In view of the single agent activity and demonstrated synergy between C
      and F, and between F and R, we evaluated FC+R in previously treated patients with advanced
      FL. The primary aim of this study was to assess the safety profile and clinical activity of
      the FC+R combination. The secondary goal was to evaluate the ability of the treatment to
      convert bone marrow Bcl2 positivity such that patients achieved molecular remissions.
