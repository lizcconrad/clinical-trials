  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After removing the rectum at surgery, bowel continuity can sometimes be restored by an
      anastomosis between the anus and the bowel. This anastomosis is most commonly created by the
      use of surgical circular stapling instruments. In a retrospective pilot study the risk of
      developing an acute leak in the anastomosis was increased with one of the most commonly used
      instruments in Sweden as compared to the other brand in use. In the current study the patient
      is randomized to either one of the instruments after a resection of the rectum for rectal
      cancer.

    One of the instruments in the study was withdrawn from the market before the calculated number
