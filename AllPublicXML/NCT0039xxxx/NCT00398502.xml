      Primary: To determine the relative bioavailability of MOA-728, an investigational drug,
      administered orally in both the capsule and tablet formulations to methadone maintenance
      subjects.Secondary: To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of MOA-728 administered both orally
      and subcutaneously to methadone maintenance subjects using the oral-cecal transit time.

        -  Men or nonlactating and nonpregnant women, aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive. Women of
             nonchildbearing potential must be surgically sterile (hysterectomy, oophorectomy,
             and/or tubal ligation) or postmenopausal for ³1 year. Women of childbearing potential
             must be using an acceptable nonhormonal method of contraception (intrauterine device
             [IUD], diaphragm, or condom with spermicidal jelly or foam, or abstinence) for a
             period of at least 1 month before and after dose administration. All women must have
             negative pregnancy test results within 48 hours before the start of the first test
             article administration.

          -  Body mass index in the range of 18 to 35 kg/m² and body weight ≥50 kg.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Subjects with positive results for HBsAg, and/or HCV antibodies may be enrolled if
             their bilirubin and serum albumin values are within normal limits and their liver
             function tests are within 1.2 times the upper limit of the normal range.

          -  A history of methadone treatment for at least 1 month before day -1 and have a
             positive drug test for methadone.

          -  No concomitant medication with the exception of stable doses of anxiolytic agents,
             antidepressants, Seroquel, occasional sleep medications, and drugs or supplements
             required to enhance or maintain regulation of bowel movements (must be stopped for the
             72 hours before the first dose of test article administration in each period).

          -  Must have a high probability for compliance with and completion of the study.
