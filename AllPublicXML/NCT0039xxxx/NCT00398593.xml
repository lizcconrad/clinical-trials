  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis is associated with a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer.
      This risk can be reduced through regular medication with 5ASA compounds. Their effectiveness
      however is limited by poor adherence to the treatment protocols by many patients.

      The hypothesis which underlies this proposal is that if the factors responsible for poor
      compliance can be identified, interventions could be developed which would help to overcome
      the barriers which exist in individual patients. These interventions would be based on the
      reasons for non-adherence, specifically tailored to the needs of the individual. As a result
      such interventions will improve patients' adherence with prescribed 5ASA and therefore reduce
      the relapses of the disease and a cancer risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to treatment is well recognised and significantly contributes to treatment
      failures. In ulcerative colitis it may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal
      cancer. Estimates for non-adherence range from 15% to 93% with an average of around a third
      of patients failing to adhere to their recommended therapeutic regimen.

      The study aims to evaluate a wide-ranging approach to reducing poor adherence, which is based
      on factors associated with non-adherence and involves the patient in choosing interventions.

      The effectiveness of the overall intervention will be assessed through a randomised
      controlled trial comparing intervention against standard care.
