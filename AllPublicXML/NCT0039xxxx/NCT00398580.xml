  <brief_title>28-Day Study of Testosterone Co-administered With Dutasteride in Hypogonadal Men</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of testosterone and dutasteride is intended for use in hypogonadal men. This
      study will evaluate the effect of 28-day repeat dosing of this combination with varying BID
      doses of testosterone (T), in combination with a fixed BID dose of dutasteride (D), as well
      as a testosterone alone arm, on T and D levels in the blood. The rationale is to look for the
      effects of each compound on the other, and to look for any safety problems that may result
      when the 2 drugs are given together.
