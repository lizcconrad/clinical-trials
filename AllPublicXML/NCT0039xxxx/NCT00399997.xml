  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a primary healthcare intervention
      called 'Exercise on Prescription' aimed at increasing level of physical activity in a
      population of sedentary patients with increased risk of developing lifestyle diseases. The
      effect is evaluated using both objective and patient-reported variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise prescriptions are used for initiating a physical active lifestyle in sedentary
      populations.

      A Danish project called ‘Exercise on Prescription’ (EoP) is implemented in primary
      healthcare. Patients eligible for EoP are non-institutionalised adults with medically
      controlled lifestyle diseases or risk factors of lifestyle diseases, who are motivated to
      change lifestyle, able to improve health status through a physical active lifestyle, and
      willing to pay a fee of €100 for the intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on: 1) maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), 2)
      bodyweight and Body Mass Index, 3) glycemic control (in patients with impaired glucose
      tolerance), 4) physical activity level, and 5) health related quality of life.

      The EoP-group is compared to a control group.
