      Hypothesis: that lipoic acid supplements taken orally will improve control of blood sugar
      levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

      This study will recruit 18 people with type 2 diabetes, whose diabetes is currently managed
      on oral agents. Each subject will then either take placebo for 12 weeks followed by lipoic
      acid for 12 weeks, or lipoic acid followed by placebo.

      A blood test for overall diabetes control will be taken at the start and end of each 12 week
      period, and the change in control will be compared for lipoic acid vs placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial of lipoic acid for
      glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes.

      The trial has 3 phases, each lasting 12 weeks. During phases 1 and 3, subjects take lipoic
      acid or placebo tablets, the order to be determined by randomization. Phase 2 is a 12-week
      washout period. The intervention is lipoic acid 200mg daily for 1 week, 400mg daily for the
      second week, and 600mg daily for weeks 3-12. Equivalent numbers of placebo tablets will be
      taken during the placebo phase.

      The principal outcome measure is change in HbA1c between the start and end of lipoic acid
      supplementation, by comparison with the same change with placebo.

      The secondary outcome measure is change in urine albumin:creatinine ratio over the same
      periods.

      Assessments for safety will include standard adverse events reporting, repeated laboratory
      measurements throughout the study (blood count, renal and liver function) and hypoglycaemia
      frequency.
