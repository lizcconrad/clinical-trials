    <textblock>
      Traumatic events may lead to strong emotional episodic memories common in Post- Traumatic
      Stress Disorder(PTSD). Intense affect may inhibit efficacy of glutamatergic neurotransmission
      in two particular areas of the limbic system that have been implicated in the processing of
      emotionally charged memories: the amygdala and the hippocampus(1,2).

      Dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is associated with disbalance of long-term
      potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD)- two underlying mechanisms that cooperate
      to achieve synaptic plasticity and its expressations- learning and memory(3). LTP- the long
      lasting enhancement of synaptic function includes changes in the amount of neurotransmitter
      glutamate released into a synapse, changes in the levels of key proteins in synapses, protein
      phosphorylation and changes the density of receptors on their synaptic membranes. LTD is the
      inverse of LTP, a long lasting reduction in synaptic transmission (4). Interactions among the
      different forms of plasticity underlie different forms of memories. Normally these mechanisms
      are balanced.

      In the current literature there is data that a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC
      class I) molecules, known to be important for immune responses to antigen, are expressed also
      by neurons that undergo activity-dependence, long-term structural and synaptic modifications
      (5). The brain produces its own immune molecules, the proteins MHC class I and CD3-zeta (a
      component of receptors for MHC class I). In the immune system, the two proteins act as part
      of a lock and key system to recognize and get rid of the body’s foreign invaders. The
      CD3-zeta polypeptide is component of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) which contribute to
      its efficient cell surface expression and account for part of its transducing capability (6).

      In the brain, they may be part of a signaling system that recognizes and eliminates
      inappropriate neural connections. Expression of MHC class I is regulated by the naturally
      occurring electrical activity, and sensitive to both natural and pathological changes in the
      activity. Electrical activity of neurons drives to an establishment of the final pattern of
      connection. Changes in the strength of individual synapses such as potention and depression
      leads to stabilization and withdrawal, respectively, of the affected connections. There are
      data, that in mice with deficiency of MHC class I and CD3-zeta the LTP in the hippocampus is
      enhanced significantly and LTD is absent. Thus, MHC class I is crucial for translating
      activity into changes in synaptic strength and neuronal connectivity in vivo. He required for
      normal activity dependent potentiation, depression, removal of inappropriate connection and
      responding to injury in the CNS (6).

      Glutamate receptors play critical roles in LTP/LTD mechanisms. Some researchers consider that
      a key role in pathogenesis of PTSD is being played by excessive excitation of NMDA-receptors
      in limbic system structures (1). The existing data allows to assume, that equation of
      plasticity mechanisms depends on mutual relations between the MHC class I and glutamate
      receptors.

      T-cells, like neurons, express high levels of glutamate receptors that are identical to the
      brain glutamate receptors. Presence of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in
      membranes of lymphocytes makes them sensitive to the same alarm molecules which operate
      neuronal activity. Glutamate by itself triggers several T-cell activation which differs
      quantitatively or qualitatively from that ones triggered by “classical’ T-cell activators
      like antigens(7). There are data about influence of T cell receptor-CD3 complex- on the
      expression of T-cells glutamate receptors (8). It is possible, that the key roles in this
      function play CD3-zeta.

      Working hypothesis and aims

      Trauma-related LTP/LTD disbalance in favor of potentaion and excessive excitation of
      glutamate receptors generated when arousing experiences occur in conjunction with
      memory-related activation of the hippocampus and amigdala. Traumatic memories connected to
      the amplification of mechanism LTP, when new information is unable to induce reliable LTD,
      which reverses synaptic plasticity formed during previous emotional learning experiences.

      MHC class I and CD3-zeta play a key role in these changes. We assume that the composition of
      glutamate receptors and CD3-zeta expression in T-cells can be used as the model reflecting
      for LTP/LTD balance in CNS.

      The work includes the learning of following parameters:

        1. The Expression in T-cells: glutamate receptors, CD3-zeta.

        2. Glutamate level in plasma

        3. Cytokines levels in plasma:

             1. interferon-γ that can induce some components of class I MHC (9).

             2. tumor necrosis factor-α that influences the AMPAR expression and plays a role in
                LTP reduction (10).

      Groups (of 20 people each) will make patients with a priori various degree of LTP/LTD
      balance: healthy people and PTSD patients.

      People suffering PTSD, frequently have conditions when they again, brightly and deeply
      experience event injuring them. The memoirs painted by painful emotions, seize attention of
      the person and then it seems to him as if he again experiences injuring event and sees it as
      real.

      We assume, that it is connected to the unable to induce reliable LTD, and that the
      composition of glutamate receptors and CD3-zeta expression in T-cells such people should
      differ from healthy.
