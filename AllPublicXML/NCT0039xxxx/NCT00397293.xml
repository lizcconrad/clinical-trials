  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Mixed
             histology will not be eligible.

          -  Progression of disease after only one prior platinum containing chemotherapy regimen.
             Prior Regimen must not have contained irinotecan

          -  All patients must have measurable disease.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy but they must have recovered from
             all treatment-related toxicities.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Adequate hematologic function

          -  Adequate liver and renal function

          -  Ability to swallow oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with more than one prior regimen of chemotherapy or prior regimen that did
             not contain a platinum agent. Note: Patient who stopped prior therapy due to toxicity
             or had less than 2 cycles of platinum based therapy would not be eligible for the
             phase II portion of this study.

          -  Prior chemotherapy regimen containing irinotecan.

          -  Active secondary malignancy.

          -  Unstable or progressive brain metastases.

          -  Prior history of radiation therapy to &gt; 25% of the bone marrow.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: serious uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with the study requirements.

          -  Failure to recover from toxicities related to prior therapy (e.g., surgery, radiation,
             chemotherapy).
