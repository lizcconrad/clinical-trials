      Phase 1b of the study, will evaluate the safety and tolerability of AQ4N treatment at three
      different dose levels.

      Phase 2a of the study, will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and in addition
      efficacy of AQ4N treatment at a tolerated dose selected from Phase 1b.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven intracranial Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) with diagnosis
             established by biopsy or resection within 5 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Cranial MRI or contrast CT performed 14 days prior to study entry. Subjects without
             measurable or assessable disease are eligible.

          -  Plan to begin partial brain radiotherapy within 24-72 hours after beginning AQ4N, and
             within 35 days (5 weeks) of the surgery, or if surgery cannot be performed, the biopsy
             that confirms GBM diagnosis. Radiation therapy must be given by external beam to a
             partial brian field in daily fractions of 2.0 Gy, to a planned total dose to the tumor
             of 60.0 Gy over 6 weeks.

          -  Age equal to or greater than 18 years and life expectancy &gt; 10 weeks.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal functions (tests must be performed within 14
             days prior to enrollment).

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only).

          -  Willingness to use effective contraception (both males and females of child-bearing
             potential) throughout the study and for at least 2 months after study treatment.

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiotherapy to the brain.

          -  Previous cytotoxic drug therapy, non-cytotoxic drug therapy, or experimental drug
             therapy directed against the brain tumor. Subjects who received Gliadel wafers will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects previously treated with enzyme-induced antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) must have
             discontinued treatment with these agent(s) greater than or equal to 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  A history of any other primary malignancy that has not been treated with curative
             intent and that has not been in complete remission for at least 2 years (exempt from
             the two year limit are non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in-situ on
             biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on PAP smear).

          -  Active infection.

          -  Any significant medical illnesses or toxicities that in the investigator’s opinion
             cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the
             subjects’ ability to tolerate this therapy. Subjects must not have any disease that
             will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism, e.g. congestive heart
             failure, moderate to severe liver and renal disease, other cancers.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction (LVEF) by multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) less than
             the institutional lower limit of normal.

          -  Prior investigational therapy within the past 28 days.

          -  Prior AQ4N therapy.

          -  Hypersensitivity to AQ4N or to any ingredients contained in the drug formulation.

          -  Hypersensitivity to temozolomide or to any ingredients contained in the drug
             formulation and dacarbazine (DTIC).

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.
