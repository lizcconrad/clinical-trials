  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child psychological/behavioural disorders such as withdrawal may persist when the
      psychosocial context is unfavourable. Health promotion strategies (Olds' paradigm) have
      proved their efficacy in vulnerable populations. CAPEDP project sets out to evaluate a
      program of home visits in France

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program aims at reducing psychosocial disorders and promoting mental health, social
      support and attachment amongst at-risk young women and their family. 440 primigravida
      (pregnant women) will be randomised into two groups. The first group will receive routine
      follow-up as currently provided by national community health and social services. The second
      group will receive home visits by community workers. These visits will start during pregnancy
      and will continue up to the child's second birthday.
