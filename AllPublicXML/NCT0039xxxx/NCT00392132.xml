  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Infectious Disease Society of America has recently recommended that patients with Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) be screened for kidney disease on a regular basis. Screening
      involves non-invasive urine and blood test and a screening program has already been initiated
      here in the University of Mississippi HIV clinic. This study looks at the effect of this new
      screening program. Our Hypothesis is that screening for kidney disease is a cost effective
      and important addition to the care of patients with HIV.

      The Infectious Disease Society of America has recently recommended that patients with Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) be screened for kidney disease on a regular basis. Screening
      involves non-invasive urine and blood test and a screening program has already been initiated
      here in the University of Mississippi HIV clinic. However nobody knows for sure whether this
      will help doctors take better care of patient with HIV.

      This study looks at the effect of this new screening program. We want to see how frequently
      abnormalities are seen on screening, how frequently certain kidney diseases are diagnosed,
      how often patients are referred to a nephrologist and how often a patient's management is
      changed by the screening. We will also estimate the cost-benefit ratio of the screening. We
      will review patient charts to determine what has happened in each case where screening was
      conducted.

      This study will not involve any additional testing.

      The benefit of this study will be improving our understanding of kidney disease in HIV. It
      will help us determine the value of screening for kidney disease and the frequency of certain
      kidney diseases in HIV in our clinic population.
