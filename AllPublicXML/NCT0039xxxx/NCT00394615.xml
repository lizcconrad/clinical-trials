  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study of metabolic imaging in locally advanced rectal cancer, we hope to
      learn whether new medical imaging technology can help predict the response of rectal cancer
      to preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Ultimately we hope this information will
      in the future help us predict which patients will benefit from more or less aggressive
      initial therapy for their rectal cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:- You must be diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and have
        chosen treatment with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, which is a
        standard treatment approach for this disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:- You are ineligible for this study if you are pregnant or under the age
        of 18 years old.
