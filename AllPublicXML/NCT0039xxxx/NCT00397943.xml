  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to have a vaccination phase (includes screening, 2 doses of vaccine 1
      month apart and follow-up until 1 month post dose 2), which will be performed in an observer
      blinded manner. This will be followed by 3 years of follow-up which will continue in an open
      manner.

      No new subjects will be recruited at the follow-up phase. The Protocol Posting has been
      updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
