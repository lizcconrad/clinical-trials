      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving rituximab
      together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome
      and rituximab together with combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt-like lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete remission, complete remission
           undetermined, and partial remission) in HIV-negative or HIV-positive patients with newly
           diagnosed Burkitt's or Burkitt-like lymphoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride
           liposome and rituximab as part of the Magrath regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete remission rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival at 2 years in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of adding rituximab to the standard Magrath regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety of using doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in place of doxorubicin
           hydrochloride in these patients.

        -  Determine correlative levels of rituximab and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in
           cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk category (low
      risk vs high risk). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment regimens according to stratum.

        -  Regimen A (low-risk disease with no CNS involvement): Patients receive R-CODOX-M
           chemotherapy comprising rituximab IV over 2-4 hours on days 0 and 8; doxorubicin
           hydrochloride liposome IV over 30 minutes on day 1; vincristine IV on days 1 and 8;
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5; and high-dose methotrexate (MTX) IV over 24
           hours on day 10. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV beginning 36 hours after
           the start of MTX infusion and continuing every 6 hours until blood levels of MTX are
           safe. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days
           4-8 in courses 1 and 3 and on days 6 and 7 in course 2. Beginning on day 12, daily G-CSF
           dosing resumes until blood counts recover. Patients receive CNS prophylaxis comprising
           cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and MTX IT on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Regimen B (high-risk disease with or without CNS involvement): Patients receive
           R-CODOX-M chemotherapy with leucovorin calcium and G-CSF support as in regimen A for
           courses 1 and 3 and R-IVAC chemotherapy with leucovorin calcium and G-CSF support (as
           below) for courses 2 and 4. R-IVAC chemotherapy comprises high-dose ifosfamide IV over 3
           hours and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5; cytarabine IV over 3 hours twice daily
           on days 2 and 3; and rituximab IV over 2-4 hours on day 0 and on day 6 or 7. Patients
           also receive leucovorin calcium orally every 6 hours on day 6 and G-CSF SC once daily
           beginning on day 6 or 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients without CNS
           involvement receive CNS prophylaxis comprising cytarabine IT on days 1 and 3 and MTX IT
           on day 15 in courses 1 and 3 and MTX IT alone on day 5 in courses 2 and 4. Patients with
           proven CNS involvement at diagnosis receive cytarabine IT on days 1, 3, and 5 in course
           1, on days 7 and 9 in course 2, and on days 1 and 3 in course 3. These patients also
           receive MTX IT on days 15 and 17 in course 1, on day 5 in courses 2 and 4, and on day 15
           in course 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The first 10 patients enrolled on the study undergo cerebrospinal fluid and blood collection
      during courses 1 and 3 for correlative biological marker and pharmacological studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then periodically
      for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
