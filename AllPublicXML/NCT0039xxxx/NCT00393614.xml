  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice at the National centre for epilepsy (SSE) in Norway we see many children
      who have subclinical epileptiform activity in EEG that increases substantially during slow
      wave sleep (SSEA; subclinical sleep-activated epileptiform activity). They may or may not
      have seizures. Hence, according to the definition some children with SSEA do not suffer from
      epilepsy because they do not experience seizures. Many of these children have symptoms such
      as: attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (AD/HD), dyslectic problems, sleep problems,
      tantrums or autistic symptoms . We hypothesize that this subclinical epileptiform activity
      during slow sleep may act negatively on cognitive functions, language and behaviour in some
      children; even when the spike-wave discharges are less frequent than in CSWS (continuous
      spike-waves during slow sleep).
