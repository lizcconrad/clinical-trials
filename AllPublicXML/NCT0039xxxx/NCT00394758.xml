      1. To compare the recurrence rate between the use of laser vaporization and ultrasonic
           surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal dysplasias

        2. To compare healing related complications, post-operative pain, and scarring between the
           two procedures.

      First line of treatment for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal
      intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is not well defined. Laser vaporization and ultrasonic
      surgical aspiration are both accepted surgical modalities used in the treatment of vulvar and
      vaginal dysplasias, however no prospective study has been done to compare the two procedures.
      The specific aims of this research study include:

        1. To compare the recurrence rate between the use of laser vaporization and ultrasonic
           surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal dysplasias in a prospective,
           multi-institutional, randomized clinical trial.

        2. To compare healing related complications, post-operative pain, and scarring between the
           two procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who present with vulvar or vaginal dysplasias or condylomas that require
             surgical intervention will be informed of the study by the treating physician

          -  Pre-operative biopsies to confirm presence of dysplasia / condyloma. Patients with
             dysplasias of grade 3 / CIS will be included at the discretion of the treating surgeon
             and will have had invasion confidently excluded by clinical exam and biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of eighteen or who are pregnant will be excluded
