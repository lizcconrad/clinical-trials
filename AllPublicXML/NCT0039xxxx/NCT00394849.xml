  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if closing the tonsil fossa after tonsillectomy
      leads to less pain and bleeding risk than leaving it open to heal by secondary intention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After induction of appropriate general anesthesia, a tonsillectomy was performed and control
      of bleeding was achieved as is routine for the individual Otolaryngologist performing the
      procedure. Next the surgeon used 3-0 chromic (absorbable) sutures on tapered needles to close
      one tonsillar fossa but leave the tonsillar fossa on the other side open. The side chosen was
      determined by a computer generated schedule. Routine postoperative care was given.

    <description>Additional information was obtained about details if postoperative bleeding occurred. Specifically, if postoperative bleeding occurred, we sought to obtain as many details as possible about the events. Items such as when the postoperative bleeding occurred, what was done about it, where the subject was treated, and what the outcome was ( was the bleeding controlled, did the subject have other complications or concerns, etc. were elicited</description>
