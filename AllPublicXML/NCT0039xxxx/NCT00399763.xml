      The purpose of this study is to find out whether atomoxetine (also called Strattera) helps
      teenagers (12-19) with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and drug/alcohol
      problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based psychosocial treatments have recently been developed. However, very little
      data exist on the use of pharmacotherapy for adolescents SUD (Substance Use Disorder). One
      promising pharmacotherapy approach is to treat co-occuring psychiatric disorders. A common
      co-occurring disorder in adolescent SUD is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      Fortunately, new ADHD medications, such as atomoxetine, that do not have addictive potential
      are now available. However, all controlled studies of atomoxetine have specifically excluded
      teens with SUD. Therefore, little data exist on the safety and efficacy of the medication in
      this population. This research project will address the important research gap with the
      specific aim: to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine for ADHD in
      teens with SUD.

    <time_frame>baseline and weekly through week 12 post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>All 18 ADHD symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) since the previous study visit. The scores are summed to create a total ADHD severity scale score ranging from 0 (none) to 54 (most severe). A single value of mean change in ADHD severity for each group (placebo and atomoxetine) was calculated using linear mixed models in an intent-to-treat an analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Line Followback Interview (TLFB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TLFB assesses the number of days in which a substance was used in the past 28 days. The TLFB is administered by the clinician and uses a 28-day calendar with anchor points to record this information. This instrument relies on confidential self-report of the adolescent participant. The result is reported as mean change in the number of days used substances in the past 28 days from baseline to the end of treatment using linear mixed models in an intent-to-treat analysis.</description>

    <measure>Side Effect Form for Children and Adolescents (SEFCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly from randomization to 12 weeks post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The SEFCA is a clinician-administered instrument that systematically assesses 52 possible side effects and rates them on a scale of 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). The instrument relies on confidential, self-report of the adolescent.The number of serious adverse events was recorded by intervention assignment.</description>

          <description>All 18 ADHD symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) since the previous study visit. The scores are summed to create a total ADHD severity scale score ranging from 0 (none) to 54 (most severe). A single value of mean change in ADHD severity for each group (placebo and atomoxetine) was calculated using linear mixed models in an intent-to-treat an analysis.</description>

        <description>The TLFB assesses the number of days in which a substance was used in the past 28 days. The TLFB is administered by the clinician and uses a 28-day calendar with anchor points to record this information. This instrument relies on confidential self-report of the adolescent participant. The result is reported as mean change in the number of days used substances in the past 28 days from baseline to the end of treatment using linear mixed models in an intent-to-treat analysis.</description>
