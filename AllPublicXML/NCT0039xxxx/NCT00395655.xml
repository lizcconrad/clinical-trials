  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation participate in cancer development and
      progression, as epigenetic alterations are common to breast cancer, in this phase II study,
      the demethylating hydralazine plus the HDAC inhibitor magnesium valproate will be added to
      neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in locally advanced breast cancer to assess
      their safety and biological efficacy.

      Eligible patients after signing the informed consent and will undergo study evaluation and
      then typed for acetylator phenotype before being treated with hydralazine at 182 mg for
      rapid-, or 83 mg for slow-acetylators, and magnesium valproate at 30 mg/kg, starting from day
      –7 until chemotherapy ends. Chemotherapy will consists in a regimen of four cycles of
      doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 21 days, followed by surgery to
      assess the pathological response. Adjuvant radiation and additional treatment will be done in
      off-protocol basis according to standard institutional policies. Blood samples and
      core-needle biopsies will be taken from primary breast tumors at diagnosis and at day 8 of
      treatment with hydralazine and valproate. Global cytosine content (global DNA methylation)
      and histone deacetylase activity will be assessed in peripheral blood DNA. The
      transcriptional profile in the primary breast tumor before and after treatment will also be
      analyzed as well as the plasma levels of hydralazine and valproic acid.
