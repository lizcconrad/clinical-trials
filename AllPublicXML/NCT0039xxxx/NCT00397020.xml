  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine
      versus divalproex extended-release administered in a rapid oral loading fashion in the
      treatment of acute episodes of mania or mixed mania in bipolar disorder. Three hypotheses
      will be tested:

      Hypothesis 1: treatment ( 3 weeks) of divalproex extended-release is similar to quetiapine in
      the symptomatic control of mania or mixed mania

      Hypothesis 2: divalproex extended-release orally loaded may produce significant improvements
      in symptoms of mania sooner than quetiapine

      Hypothesis 3: divalproex extended-release may produce significantly less sedation

      This will be a rater-blinded, head-to-head comparison (no placebo) of divalproex ER and
      quetiapine in patients with symptoms of an active manic or mixed mania (symptoms of mania and
      depression). Forty subjects are expected to be enrolled. After screening for eligibility,
      eligible subjects will be randomized while hospitalized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment
      groups: divalproex ER or quetiapine. DepakoteÂ® ER will be given orally at 30 mg/kg day
      initially taken at night and rounded up to nearest 500 mg dose with adjustments made through
      the trial as needed to obtain serum valproic acid levels of 85-125 mcg/ml. Quetiapine will be
      given orally at an initial dose of 200mg/day on Day 1, and titrate up to 800 mg/day. The
      duration of the study will be 21 days from baseline and the total number of visits including
      screening is five. Patients will be released from the hospital once stable and visits for the
      study will then take place on an outpatient basis.
