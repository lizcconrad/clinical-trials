  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether methylphenidate facilitates so called
      short-term plasticity as measures with transcranial magnetic stimulation, in patients with
      stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients are to be examined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and
      after a short training session. TMS will be used to demonstrate changes in cortical
      excitability (motor threshold) and intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The effect of
      methylphenidate on baseline TMS measures will be evaluated as well as the effect on training
      induced changes in TMS measures (by comparing baseline and posttraining measures). The
      patients will be trained on two separate occasions, to compare the effect of Methylphenidate
      to placebo.
