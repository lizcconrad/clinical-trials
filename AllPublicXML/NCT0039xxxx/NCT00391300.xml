      RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as bioelectric field imaging, may help find and
      diagnose melanoma and other skin cancers. It may also be a less invasive way to check for
      skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying bioelectric field imaging in diagnosing melanoma and
      other skin cancers in patients with skin lesions.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if the hand-held Bioelectric Field Imager can be used to measure the
           electric field in skin of various body surfaces, including face, neck, shoulders, arms,
           hands, chest, back, legs, and feet, during the course of examination and treatment of
           patients with suspected malignant skin lesions.

        -  To determine if there is a significant difference between the lateral electric field
           strength near benign and malignant skin lesions in the same individual.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo scanning of their skin lesions and nearby healthy skin using the
      Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI). The lesions are then biopsied for histological diagnosis.
      Histological data from the biopsy is correlated with the electric field data from the BFI.
