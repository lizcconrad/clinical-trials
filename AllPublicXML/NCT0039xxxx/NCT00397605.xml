  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people with bipolar disorder who use cannabis (marijuana) claim that it eases the
      symptoms of depression and mania. There are many chemicals (called cannabinoids) found in
      cannabis but two particular ones appear to have medicinal (therapeutic) effects. These two
      compounds are: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These cannabinoids
      appear to have mood, anxiety, and sedative effects as well as have antipsychotic and
      anticonvulsant properties. This study will try to find out if these cannabinoids can be of
      benefit as an add-on treatment in bipolar disorder and what effects it has on thinking power
      and memory.

      This study will be a within-subject, random order, double-blind cross-over study with
      standard clinical and neuropsychological ratings. Duration is 13 weeks per subject. Clinical
      assessments including mood ratings will be performed weekly. Instructions and practice on the
      use of the spray will be given under supervision during a 2-week run-in period before
      baseline. Patients can control the dosage of cannabinoids according to their symptoms by
      administering up to a maximum of 48 pump-controlled sprays per day. Patients will be asked to
      abstain from using cannabis (other than the study drug) during the study. Patients will be
      treated for 4 weeks with either the sublingual THC:CBD spray or placebo spray. This will be
      followed by a 2-week washout period before another 4 weeks of treatment with whichever study
      medication was not initially used. Neurocognitive testing will be performed 3 times during
      the study. A mood diary will be completed daily by each patient at home.
