      We wish to determine the best treatment for expulsion of lower ureteral stones. Which of the
      three major treatment protocols is the best treatment of conservative management of ureteral
      stones?

      The study will include 60 patients with lower ureteral stones. The patients will be divided
      into three groups. The first group will be administered Alfuzosin (10 mg). The second group
      will be administered a combination of Alfuzosin (10 mg)and Rowatinex (Pinene 31%, Camphene
      15%, Anetol 4%, Borneol 10%, Cineol 3%, Fenchenol 4%, Olive Oil 33%). The third group will be
      administered Rowatinex.
