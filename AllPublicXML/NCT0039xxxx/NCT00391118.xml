  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ovarian cancer usually get the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel as initial
      treatment. In many patients the tumor will shrink, or even disappear, after treatment with
      these drugs. But, unfortunately, the tumor will grow again in many patients. This trial will
      try to address the question: Can we delay the time, till the tumor grows again, by adding a
      3rd drug to the standard therapy? To answer this question, patients will, by chance, either
      get the experimental drug enzastaurin or a &quot;dummy pill&quot; (placebo) during the chemotherapy and
      for up to 3 years after chemotherapy. Patients and physicians will not know, if a patient
      gets enzastaurin or placebo (double-blinded trial). After a predefined time, the treatment
      will be uncovered, and the number of patients with tumor growth at a specific time point will
      be compared between the two treatments.
