  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to obtain safety and efficacy data on three dose levels of indacaterol
      when delivered via an SDDPI in patients with COPD. All patients will receive 1 day of
      treatment with each of the following: indacaterol 150 µg, once- indacaterol 300 µg,
      indacaterol 600 µg, placebo, and formoterol. Each treatment day will be followed by a
      washout-period of 1 week.
