        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histopathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour that is
             either refractory after standard of care therapy for the disease or for which standard
             of care therapy is not reliably effective or has a cancer for which no standard
             therapy exists

          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          3. Has read and understands the informed consent form and is willing and able to give

             willing to use adequate contraception such as, intra uterine device, diaphragm, or
             condom, for the duration of the study. For the purposes of this study, childbearing
             potential is defined as: &quot;All female subjects unless they are post- menopausal for at
             least two years, are surgically sterile or sexually inactive&quot;

          5. Negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit for women of childbearing
             potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Bone marrow impairment as evidenced by Hb &lt; 9.0 g/dl, ANC &lt; 1.5x 109/L, platelets &lt; 75
             x 109/L. Subjects may be transfused.

          2. Renal impairment as evidenced by serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal),
             and/or calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min

          3. Liver function abnormality as defined by total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN, or AST or ALT &gt;
             2.5x ULN at screening; for subjects with liver involvement AST or ALT &gt; 5x ULN at
             screening

          4. INR (blood coagulation) &gt; 1.5 x ULN for subjects not on therapeutic doses of coumadin

          5. History of CNS metastases, unless subject has been previously treated for CNS
             metastases, is stable by CT scan without evidence of cerebral edema, and has no
             requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants

          6. History of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastro- intestinal
             disease or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption of the tested
             product

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) &gt; 2

          8. Known HIV, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B positivity

          9. Has received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or any
             other anticancer therapy or surgical intervention within 28 Days of Day 1 of study
             drug treatment (6 weeks for nitrosureas or mitomycin C), and must have fully recovered

         10. Has received extensive prior radiotherapy on more than 30% of bone marrow reserves, or
             prior bone marrow/stem cell transplantation

         11. Has received any investigational agent within 28 days of Day 1

         12. Has history of any other significant medical disease or intervention including major
             gastric or small bowel surgery or has a psychiatric condition that might impair the
             subjects well-being or preclude full participation in the study

         13. Is a pregnant or nursing female
