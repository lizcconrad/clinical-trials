  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when
      given together with cetuximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      advanced gastrointestinal cancer, head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or
      colorectal cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can
      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Erlotinib hydrochloride and cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with cetuximab may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). II. To identify the recommended dose (RD)
      for phase II of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in combination with cetuximab in patients
      (pts) with incurable gastrointestinal, head and neck, or non-small cell lung cancers that are
      Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild type.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). II. To perform skin and tumor biopsies to
      analyze molecular inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
      pathway, defined as a &gt;= 75% inhibition of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor
      (EGF) receptor or of its downstream effectors tumor protein (p)44/42 mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) or protein kinase B (Akt) or as a &gt;= 25% decrease of marker of
      proliferation Ki-67 (Ki67) from baseline in either skin or tumor tissue in the majority of
      patients.

      III. To identify the optimal biological dose (OBD). IV. To describe any antitumor effect
      observed.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases are eligible provided that the metastases
             have been surgically resected and/or are radiographically and clinically stable for 2
             months following the completion of radiation therapy

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to erlotinib

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic

          -  Prior treatment with EGFR-targeting therapies

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 21 days prior to

          -  Abnormalities of the cornea based on history (e.g., dry eye syndrome, Sjogren's
             syndrome), congenital abnormality (e.g., Fuch's dystrophy), abnormal slit-lamp
             examination using a vital dye (e.g., fluorescein, Bengal-Rose), and/or an abnormal
             corneal sensitivity test (Schirmer test or similar tear production test)

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or
             active peptic ulcer disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with erlotinib or cetuximab
