    <textblock>
      Background Prevention of contrast media (CM) induced nephropathy (CIN) by pharmacological
      prophylaxis (e.g. N–acetylcysteine; NAC) is controversially discussed. So far, in all
      interventional studies assessment of kidney function was based on measurements of serum
      creatinine although this surrogate biomarker has several limitations. We investigated the
      antioxidants NAC and zinc (Zn) for the prevention of CIN by monitoring concomitantly serum
      levels of creatinine and cystatin C.

      In a prospective, placebo-controlled, double blind trial patients with moderate impaired
      kidney function receiving hypoosmolar, nonionic contrast medium were randomly assigned to an
      oral treatment for 2 days with 1.2g/day of NAC (n=19), for 1 day with 60mg/day of Zn (n=18)
      or placebo (n=17). All patients were periprocedural hydrated with 1ml/kg/h of 0.45% saline
      for 24h. At baseline (before hydration), prior to exposure of CM as well as 2 and 6 days
      after CM serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C have been measured.
