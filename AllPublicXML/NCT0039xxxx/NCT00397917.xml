      The purpose of this study is to asses if taking 4 mg of folic acid per day at preconception
      and during the first three months of pregnancy decreases the risk of having a child with
      cleft lip and palate compared to 0.4 mg folic acid for women who have an oral cleft or have
      had previously child with an oral cleft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cleft lip and palate is a common and burdensome birth defect that has large health
      ramifications and requires surgical, speech, behavioral, dental, and medical interventions.
      There is some evidence suggesting that taking folic acid particularly at large doses during
      preconception and first trimester of pregnancy may decrease the risk of oral cleft
      recurrence, which is the risk of having a child with an oral cleft for women who have an oral
      cleft or who have had a child with a cleft. However this evidence is based on study designs
      that are incapable of contributing the preventive effects to folic acid with adequate
      confidence, and the real effect of folic acid on cleft recurrence prevention remains to be
      identified. Taking 4 mg of folic acid per day at preconception and first trimester of
      pregnancy has also been shown to prevent the recurrence of neural tube defects by up to 70%,
      providing further support to evaluate this intervention for oral cleft recurrence.

      This study evaluates the effects of supplementation with 4 versus 0.4 mg of folic acid per
      day at preconception and during the first three months of pregnancy on recurrence of cleft
      lip and palate. Up to 6000 women will be randomly assigned to 4 versus 0.4 mg groups. The
      primary aim is to compare the recurrence rates in the offspring of trial mothers in the two
      groups. Secondary aims are to compare the two groups on several outcomes including
      miscarriage, twinning, pre-eclampsia, serum and red cell folate levels, severity of oral
      clefts and occurrence of other birth defects in the offspring of trial mothers, and birth
      weight and gestational age of trial babies, and to compare the recurrence in the two groups
      to that in historic controls.
