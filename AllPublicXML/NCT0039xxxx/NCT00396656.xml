    <measure>Difference in Mean Post-treatment Microcirculation at Acetylcholine (ACH) Injected Sites Compared to NaCl Injected Sites</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of each treatment period (Week 21 and Week 43)</time_frame>
    <description>10 µl of acetylcholine (ACH) at 3 concentrations (10-7, 10-8, 10-9 M) was injected intra-dermally at 3 sites on the forearms. NaCl was injected at 2 sites on the forearms. Microcirculation was measured using laser doppler velocimetry before and 12 times in the 30 minutes following injection. The mean difference of the 12 post-injection measurements to the pre-injection measurement was calculated. Means for the 3 ACH and the 2 NaCl sites were calculated and compared. Microcirculation was measured in perfusion units which is an arbitrary measure specific to each laser doppler scanner.</description>

    <description>10 µl of acetylcholine (ACH) at 3 concentrations (10-7, 10-8, 10-9 M) plus 10 µl L-NMMA (10-6 M) was injected intra-dermally at 3 sites on the forearms. NaCl was injected at 2 sites.

    <time_frame>At end of each treatment period (Week 21 and Week 43)</time_frame>
    <description>10 µl of sodium nitroprusside at a concentration of 10-7 M was injected intra-dermally at 1 site on the forearms. NaCl was injected at 2 sites on the forearms. Microcirculation was measured using laser doppler velocimetry before and 12 times in the 30 minutes following injection. The mean difference of the 12 post-injection measurements to the pre-injection measurement was calculated. A mean for the 2 NaCl sites was calculated and compared to the sodium nitroprusside mean.

    <measure>Arterial Pressure Waveform Augmentation Index at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of each treatment period (Week 21 and Week 43)</time_frame>
    <description>Using applanation tonometry, the arterial pulse form measured at the wrist was analyzed using computerized pulse wave analysis. The arterial pressure waveform has two components; the first is the forward traveling wave when the left ventricle contracts and the second is the reflected wave returning from the periphery. The augmentation index is the ratio of the first and second systolic peaks and is used as a surrogate measure of arterial stiffness.</description>

    <measure>Arterial Pressure Waveform Pulse Wave Velocity at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of each treatment period (Week 21 and Week 43)</time_frame>
    <description>Using applanation tonometry, the arterial pulse form measured at the wrist was analyzed using computerized pulse wave analysis. The arterial pressure waveform has two components; the first is the forward traveling wave when the left ventricle contracts and the second is the reflected wave returning from the periphery. Pulse wave velocity is the speed of the forward traveling wave and can be used as a measure of arterial stiffness since the more rigid the wall of the artery, the faster the wave moves.</description>

Patients received valsartan 160 mg for 4 weeks, followed by valsartan 320 mg for 16 weeks. The valsartan dose was then tapered off to 80 mg for one week. Patients took valsartan film coated tablets orally once a day (od) in the morning.
After a second 2-week washout period, patients were treated with atenolol plus HCTZ for 20 weeks. Patients received atenolol 100 mg for 20 weeks.

        <title>Difference in Mean Post-treatment Microcirculation at Acetylcholine (ACH) Injected Sites Compared to NaCl Injected Sites</title>
        <description>10 µl of acetylcholine (ACH) at 3 concentrations (10-7, 10-8, 10-9 M) was injected intra-dermally at 3 sites on the forearms. NaCl was injected at 2 sites on the forearms. Microcirculation was measured using laser doppler velocimetry before and 12 times in the 30 minutes following injection. The mean difference of the 12 post-injection measurements to the pre-injection measurement was calculated. Means for the 3 ACH and the 2 NaCl sites were calculated and compared. Microcirculation was measured in perfusion units which is an arbitrary measure specific to each laser doppler scanner.</description>
