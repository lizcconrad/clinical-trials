  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to further evaluate the operation, safety, and feasibility of a subcutaneous
      implantable defibrillator (S-ICD) system in patients who require an implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD)for treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The S-ICD electrode and pulse
      generator emulator will be briefly implanted and tested during the standard implantation
      procedure of an ICD, but then the S-ICD system will be removed entirely.

      The objectives of this study are to further evaluate the S-ICD system's ability to identify
      and terminate induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients acutely with an S-ICD emulator
      and parasternal electrode during the implant procedure of a standard transvenous ICD.

      The active emulator is not a powered medical device and all elements of the test system are
      removed following the testing.

      This acute intra-operative protocol will test the ability of the electrode and emulator to
      appropriately convert the arrhythmia and allos an assessment of post shock pacing.
