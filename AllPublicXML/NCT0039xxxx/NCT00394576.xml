      Study Description

      The relationship between elevated phosphorus levels and morbidity and mortality in patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is well recognized, and dietary phosphorus restriction is a
      mainstay of phosphate management. Despite this, appropriate control of phosphate intake
      remains sub-par, due in part to the difficulties that patients have understanding phosphate
      content in foods. Randomized trials have shown that intensive, individualized dietary
      counseling can improve patient knowledge about phosphorus and help control hyperphosphatemia;
      however, maintaining this level of counseling is time-consuming, costly, and impractical.
      Given the recognized nephrology workforce shortage, there is a crucial need for systems to
      fill this gap with novel technologies to educate patients, and it is vital that a better
      understanding of the effects of novel nutritional intervention counseling methods on patient
      knowledge, nutritional intake and nutritional status be evaluated in CKD patients.

      Furthermore, to effectively engage in the patient side of the education process, those who
      receive it, the patients, must be able to comprehend information and draw on it for
      decision-making. Novel educational interventions may be better suited than traditional
      methods to circumvent literacy limitations. Therefore, it is vital to assess the relation of
      functional health literacy of this population in both traditional and emerging educational
      venues.

      Finally, the importance of phosphorus control for patients with CKD has traditionally been to
      prevent bone disease. More recently it is recognized that poor phosphorus control correlates
      with cardiovascular disease, of which patients with CKD carry an enormous burden. Similarly,
      there has recently been much attention to circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as a novel
      marker for cardiovascular risk in this population. While the ultimate test would be to
      determine if controlling phosphorus impacts on cardiovascular events, that is beyond the
      scope of this project. Therefore, we propose to measure levels of CECs as an intermediary
      step toward cardiovascular events, in correlation to phosphorus intake.

      Hypothesis 1: Novel nutritional educational interventions of dietary phosphorus can be useful
      for providing improvements on phosphorus knowledge and control of intake. Significance: Such
      methods can be self-sustaining, and therefore a practical solution to the problem of
      providing continuous and repeated educational interventions given limited provider time and
      resources.

      Hypothesis 2: A higher level of health literacy in individuals with CKD is associated with
      greater knowledge of and compliance with recommended dietary phosphorus intake. Significance:
      A better understanding of obstacles to optimal nutritional intake will lead to improved
      methods for nutrition intervention counseling. Alternative measures to educate those with
      lower health literacy may require a shifting of resources for this subgroup of individuals.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher dietary phosphorus intake in individuals with CKD correlates with higher
      levels of CECs.

      Study Design

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effect of a novel, web-based method of educating CKD patients
      on patient knowledge and dietary intake of phosphorus. We will compare 2 methods for
      educating CKD patients about dietary phosphorus intake:

        1. Usual care, consisting of individualized care/counseling by a nephrologist.

        2. Usual care, plus review of the Kidney School (KS) Nutrition Module (see below). To
           compare gains in phosphorus knowledge after 1 month. To compare compliance with dietary
           phosphorus intake, as measured by mineral metabolism laboratory values (serum
           phosphorus, calcium, PTH, calcium-phosphorus product) and 3-day dietary diaries.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if the S-TOFHLA predicts CKD patients' knowledge and compliance
      with recommended dietary phosphorus intake:

        1. To measure health literacy in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, using the
           S-TOFHLA.

        2. To assess correlations between health literacy and knowledge of phosphorus.

        3. To assess correlations between health literacy and compliance with CKD dietary
           phosphorus guidelines, as measured by mineral metabolism laboratory values (serum
           phosphorus, calcium, PTH, calcium-phosphorus product), and dietary phosphate intake, as
           measured by 3-day dietary diaries.

        4. To assess correlations between health literacy and compliance with CKD dietary
           phosphorus guidelines, following usual care versus an eHealth nutrition intervention.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if higher dietary phosphorus intake correlates with higher
      levels of CECs.

        1. To measure CEC levels in patients with CKD.

        2. To assess correlations between dietary phosphorus intake, serum phosphorus levels, and
           CECs in patients with CKD.

      Following enrollment and informed consent, subjects will be randomized to one of two arms
      (group1: usual care; group 2: usual care plus KS module). All subjects will undergo baseline
      data collection, as shown in table 1. KS and Survey information is as follows:

      Kidney School (KS). KS (http://www.kidneyschool.org) is an online, personalized, interactive
      self-management learning center created by the Madison, WI based Medical Education Institute
      (MEI) and organized into fifteen 20-30 minute modules, each focused on a different topic
      related to kidney disease and its treatment, including nutrition. Content is based on 10
      years of research conducted by the Life Options Rehabilitation Program, with internal and
      external expert review. The nutrition module is tailored for patients with or without
      diabetes.

      KS modules contain a pre/post-test, instructional content, patient quotes,
      graphics/animations, photos, pop-ups, a resource list containing books and relevant website
      links, and a certificate of completion. The content branches to provide tailored information
      to each user according to user responses. These responses also create a Personal Action Plan
      in each module that can be printed and used for content review and setting goals. A custom
      graphic interface with navigation buttons was designed for KS, and each module has customized
      Javascript programming, as the content branching patterns are unique.

      Proprietary Information. The mission of the non-profit MEI is to help people with chronic
      diseases learn to manage and improve their health, through research and education. The MEI
      believes charging a fee for educational materials can be a barrier between patients and the
      information they need to live successfully with a chronic disease. All MEI-developed patient
      education materials are therefore free. KS is entirely proprietary to the MEI, but will
      continue to be available free of charge via the Internet.

      HIPAA. KS is fully compliant with HIPAA standards. S-TOFHLA. An abbreviated version of the
      test of functional health literacy in adults, the S-TOFHLA is widely used by health care
      providers to determine the adequacy of their patients' understanding of health care materials
      needed for their health care or education, as well as by researchers to assess health
      literacy as a variable in research. It categorizes individuals as having adequate, marginal
      or inadequate health literacy, can be administered in 12 minutes, and has been used in
      patients with a variety of chronic diseases.

      CKD Knowledge Assessment Tool (CKDKAT) of Nutrition. The CKDKAT of nutrition is a revised
      version of our original CKDKAT, which addresses only nutritional knowledge specific to CKD.
      Fifteen of 25 questions are phosphorus-specific, with the remaining 10 concerning sodium,
      potassium and protein intake.

      SF-12v2. The SF-12 Health Survey version 2 is a 12-item measure of health related quality of
      life. Widely used in research in a variety of disease states, including CKD, it provides
      physical and mental component summary scores with a strong concordance with the lengthier
      SF-36. Given that we will be administering multiple cognitive and behavioral surveys to
      subjects, the shorter version will be used.

      Kidney Disease Self-Management Survey (KDSMS). Developed by MEI, the KDSMS is a 58-item
      Likert scale with 6 subscales, based on theories deemed important for self-management
      education in other chronic diseases, including the health belief model, self-efficacy,
      behavioral intent, and the transtheoretical model. These theories converge into a
      self-management education schema that emphasizes the importance of information, support,
      modeling, planning, practice and monitoring, and reflection in patient self-management
      education. The 6 subscales are: 1) Self-monitoring, 2) Adjusting to symptoms, 3) Lifestyle
      behaviors, 4) Medication-taking, 5) Information seeking, 6) Doctor/patient communication.

      24 hour recall diaries. After collecting the information from subjects, nutrient analysis
      will be performed using The Food Processor SQL Nutrition Software (ESHA Research, Salem,
      Oregon).

      The study instruments will all performed for research purposes. While some of them (the
      S-TOFHLA, 3-Day Dietary Diaries) have been used as part of patient care, this is not routine,
      and it is not done at our facilities.

      Lab work collected will consist of serum phosphorus, calcium and intact-parathyroid hormone
      levels. As these are routinely collected prior to or during a regular CKD clinic visit, the
      study coordinator will check to see if this data is already available, and will not duplicate
      this blood work if it is. In addition, all subjects will have blood drawn (30 ml) for
      assessment of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a novel marker for vascular damage.

      Following baseline data collection, group 1 will continue with their scheduled clinic visit,
      while group 2 will spend approximately 30 minutes completing the KS nutrition module at a
      dedicated computer education station at the UW Kidney Clinic. The study coordinator will
      bring up the KS nutrition module (tailored for diabetes as a co-morbidity if appropriate).
      After completion of the KS nutrition module, patients will receive a personalize action plan,
      and then proceed with their scheduled clinic visit.

      All subjects will then be asked to return in 30-60 days to repeat some of the survey
      information and blood work.

      Subject Population

      All subjects (N = 100) will be recruited from the UW Health Kidney Clinic. We will recruit
      individuals in the later stages of kidney disease: Stages 3 and 4. Staging of CKD is
      determined by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR). The e-GFR is automatically
      calculated with each outpatient serum creatinine ordered through the UW labs, and so this
      information is readily available. Stage 3 is defined as GFR of 30-59 milliliters/minute (~ ½
      to ¼ of normal kidney function), and Stage 4 is defined as a GFR of 15-29 milliliters/minute
      (~ ¼ to ⅛ of normal kidney function). Stage 5 is kidney failure (GFR &lt; 15
      milliliters/minute).

      All patients between the ages of 18 and 89 with CKD stage 3 or 4 who are seen in the UW
      Health Kidney Clinic will be invited to participate in the study by a member of the study
      personnel prior to beginning the class or while waiting for their clinic visit. Fliers
      briefly describing the study with contact information for those interested will be available
      at the receptionist area in the UW Kidney Clinic and in the computer-station education area.
      Demographic information collected will include age, gender, race, length of time with known
      CKD, education level, and home computer ownership.

      Subjects will receive modest compensation for their time and effort ($10 after completion of
      first set of data collection, $25 after completion of follow up data collection). No project
      personnel will receive incentives for recruiting human subjects or for any other purpose
      directly related to the study. The greater amount offered for the second visit is due to the
      added inconvenience of returning for an additional visit.

      Note, as prisoners are not seen in the UW Kidney Clinic, the study will not involve this
      population.

      Statistical Justification of Sample Size

      We propose a sample size of 50 subjects for each of the cohorts. Pairwise comparisons of mean
      knowledge scores of Cohort 2 with Cohort 1 (i.e., the original cohort taking the test prior
      to any educational intervention) will be conducted using two-sided t-tests to detect a
      p-value of &lt; 0.05. Adjustments will be made for demographic factors known to be related to
      chronic disease knowledge, including age, race, gender and education. The effective sample
      size will provide 80% power to detect a difference in mean knowledge scores of 3 or more
      questions.

      Correlation between higher levels of functional health literacy and increased knowledge of
      kidney disease will be determined using Spearman rank-order correlation.

      Risks and Benefits to Participants

      It is not anticipated that there are any significant or sustained risks to subjects of
      participation in the study. There is the potential for some mild discomfort from the
      necessary blood draws, which occur twice per subjects.

      Personal benefits to subjects: Subjects randomized to the KS nutrition module may receive
      benefit from the personalized action plan, and may gain knowledge of nutritional needs for
      their chronic condition.

      Scientific benefits from the study: A better understanding of obstacles to optimal
      nutritional intake will lead to improved methods for nutrition intervention counseling.
      Alternative measures to educate those with lower health literacy may require a shifting of
      resources for this subgroup of individuals.

      Consent Procedures

      As the study requires the ability to fill out multiple surveys and use the Internet, only
      individuals who can provide their own consent can participate. The consent process will be
      conducted by either the Study Coordinator (Lynn Jacobson) or the PI (Jonathan Jaffery). Upon
      agreeing to enroll in the study, the subject with a copy of the consent form (see attached).
      The individual obtaining consent will remain available to answer any and all questions.

      Changes to the protocol were submitted and approved:

      The changes are being made because additional funding has been awarded to look further at the
      same question in a slightly different patient population. The previously approved study
      enrolls individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 (moderate to severe
      CKD). The proposed changes will include individuals with CKD 5 (end-stage kidney disease)
      undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MD). Given the major differences in how these groups of
      patients receive care (clinic visits averaging every 3-6 months with occasional blood work
      and primarily oral medications arranged per provider discretion for those with CKD 3 and 4,
      versus dialysis unit treatments of 3-4 hours/3 times weekly, with monthly blood work and
      various oral and IV medications prescribed per protocols for those with CKD 5 on MD), it is
      important to assess the proposed questions in both distinct groups.

        1. Will enroll an additional 80 subjects, all with CKD 5, undergoing MD

        2. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive standard of care versus the intervention
           with the tailored, web-based CKD nutrition module

        3. Other interventions will be (for all 80 subjects) the same questionnaire instruments as
           previously described

        4. The timetable/duration of the study will be different for the MD group versus the CKD
           3/4 group (see below)

        5. No separate blood draws will be required of the MD group, as all the relevant lab tests
           are measured as standard of care and recorded in the dialysis clinical database

      Subjects with CKD 5 will have a decreased risk of adverse effects, due to the lack of any
      need for blood draws. Additionally, the time spent performing study questionnaires or
      engaging with the web-based module (via wireless-enabled laptop) will be during the 3-4 hour
      dialysis treatment, and so will not prolong their visit length. Subjects with CKD 3 and 4
      will not be affected by the changes.
