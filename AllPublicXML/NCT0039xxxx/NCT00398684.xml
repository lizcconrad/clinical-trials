  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of a single dose of the drug nevirapine
      (NVP) given to pregnant women at onset of labor and to their infant 48-72 hours after birth
      in addition to standard oral zidovudine (ZDV or AZT) prophylaxis for the prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.

      Multicenter, randomized, three arms, double-blind, controlled study. Study population was
      HIV-infected pregnant women who were on ZDV prophylaxis for more than two weeks and gave
      informed consent. If eligible, women completed a baseline check-up. Women meeting selection
      criteria were randomly assigned to receive one of three study regimens, in addition to ZDV
      prophylaxis:

        1. One dose maternal NVP treatment at onset of labor, and one dose of infant NVP treatment
           48-72 hours after birth

        2. One dose maternal NVP treatment at onset of labor, and one dose of infant placebo 48-72
           hours after birth

        3. One dose maternal placebo at onset of labor, and one dose of infant placebo 48-72 hours
           after birth. This was the reference study arm.

      Follow-up of women and infants was carried out on an outpatient basis except for delivery and
      the first three days after delivery.

      AMENDMENT

      After the first interim analysis, enrollment in Placebo-Placebo arm was terminated on May 2,
      2002, according to the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The target
      sample size was increased to 660, instead of 510, in each of the two remaining arms (N-N and
      N-P) to ensure enough power to test for non-inferiority between these arms with a limit of
      2.5%.

        Pre-Entry Criteria

        Women were eligible for the study if they:

          -  have evidence of HIV infection (documented by two HIV antibody tests on two different
             dates);

          -  were to be provided ZDV Prophylaxis (starting at 28 weeks or as soon as possible
             thereafter);

          -  intended to carry the pregnancy to term;

          -  intended to deliver at and bring their infant to a study site for at least 12 months
             after delivery; and

          -  could provide informed consent.

        Inclusion criteria

        Women are eligible for the study if they:

          -  met all pre-entry criteria;

          -  agreed not to breastfeed;

          -  consented to participate and to be followed for the duration of the study;

          -  presented the following laboratory values within 14 days prior to randomization:

          -  hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dl

          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000 cells/mm3

          -  platelets &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3

          -  serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl (women with a serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl must have a

             study; they were monitored monthly until delivery. If at any point their SGPT value
             rose to a Grade 4 (more than 10 times the upper limit of normal), they should not be
