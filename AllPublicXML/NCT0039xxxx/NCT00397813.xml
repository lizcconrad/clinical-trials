    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of total-body irradiation when
      given together with fludarabine phosphate followed by a donor peripheral stem cell transplant
      in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders
      (MPD). Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body
      irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer cells. Giving chemotherapy or radiation therapy before or after transplant also stops
      the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Decrease the incidence of day-200 hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) failure to &lt;
      20% in patients with MDS-Refractory anemia (RA)-(ringed sideroblasts [RS])/MPD and in
      patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)/refractory anemia with excess blasts
      (RAEB).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The rate of relapse/progression in patients with MPD or MDS-RA and those with CMML or
      MDS-RAEB.

      II. The probability of progression free survival (PFS) in patients with MPD or MDS-RA and
      those with CMML or MDS-RAEB.

      III. The kinetics of donor engraftment.

      IV. The incidence of infections.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of total body irradiation (TBI).

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously
      (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo filgrastim
      (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC infusion after TBI on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:

      Matched Related Donor: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3
      to 56, followed by a taper until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      PO BID beginning 4-6 hours after transplantation on day 0 and continue until day 27.

      Unrelated Donor: Patients receive cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 100, followed by a taper
      until day 180. Patients also receive MMF PO three times daily beginning 4-6 hours after
      transplantation on day 0 and continue until day 40, followed by a taper until day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

             would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on
             the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the
             cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA class I
             allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be
             obtained regardless of the PRA results
