  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease. It has a worldwide
      distribution and can affect all age group. The peak incidence is between fourth and sixth
      decade. It is more prevalent in women, and itâ€™s prevalence in the general population in North
      America is between 0.2-1.5%. The etiology of RA is unknown, although clusters of the disease
      in families and high concordance in mono-zydotic twins support genetic predisposition. The
      prevalence of fatty liver disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is currently unknown.
      We wish to study the link between the two conditions by performing a son graphic imaging of
      the liver in a cohort of RA patients. If indeed a high prevalence of NAFLD will be found in
      the RA patients, further support will be landed for the link between inflammation and fatty
      liver disease. These findings may also have implications regarding the management and follow
      up of RA patients.

      The validity of sonographic imaging for detection of fatty liver diseases is currently
      accepted: On ultrasonographic, fatty infiltration of the liver produces a diffuse increase in
      echogenicity as compared with that of the kidneys. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 89%
      and a specificity of 93% in detecting steatosis and sensitivity and specificity of 77% and
      89% respectively in detecting increase fibrosis.

      In view of all the above data, we expected to find higher prevalence of fatty liver in the
      patients with higher inflammation markers compare with patients with lower markers.
