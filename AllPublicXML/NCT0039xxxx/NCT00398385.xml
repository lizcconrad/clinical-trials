      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount
      of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any
      tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving chemotherapy before
      surgery is more effective than giving it after surgery in treating non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying gemcitabine and cisplatin to compare how
      well they work when given before or after surgery in treating patients with stage I or stage
      II non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the time to recurrence in patients with stage IB or II non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant versus adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare the complete resection rate with and without neoadjuvant gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by disease stage (IB vs II) and
      histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs nonsquamous cell carcinoma). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
           minutes and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4
           weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.
           Within 8 weeks after initiating course 4 of chemotherapy, patients undergo complete
           surgical resection.

        -  Arm II (adjuvant chemotherapy): Patients undergo complete surgical resection. Beginning
           within 8 weeks after complete surgical resection, patients receive gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and periodically for up to 5 years.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years or
      until disease recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 170 patients will be accrued for this study.
