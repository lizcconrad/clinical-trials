    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of carcinoembryonic
      antigen-expressing measles virus (MV-CEA) in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme
      that has come back. A virus, called MV-CEA, which has been changed in a certain way, may be
      able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of intratumoral and resection cavity administration of
      an Edmonston's strain measles virus genetically engineered to produce CEA (MV-CEA) in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MV-CEA. III. To characterize viral gene
      expression at each dose level as manifested by CEA titers.

      IV. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following
      intratumoral administration.

      V. To assess humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. VI. To assess in a
      preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 sequential
      treatment arms.

      ARM A (RESECTION CAVITY ADMINISTRATION): Patients undergo en block resection of their tumor
      (after confirming diagnosis) on day 1, followed by MV-CEA administered into the resection
      cavity.

      ARM B (INTRATUMORAL AND RESECTION CAVITY ADMINISTRATION): Patients undergo stereotactic
      biopsy (to confirm the diagnosis) and placement of a catheter within the tumor, followed by
      carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing measles virus intratumorally (IT) through the catheter
      over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo en block resection of their tumor with
      computer-assisted stereotactic techniques on day 5, followed by MV-CEA administered around
      the tumor bed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days (non-cohort I
      patients), 7 weeks (patients in cohort I only), every 2 months until progression, every 3 and
      12 months after progression, and then yearly thereafter for up to 15 years.
