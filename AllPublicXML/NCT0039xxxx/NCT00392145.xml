      This study will look at children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis requiring IV
      rehydration and determine whether the proportion rehydrated after two hours is greater in the
      children who receive rapid intravenous rehydration (RIVR) or in the children who receive
      standard IV rehydration.

    <textblock>
      Despite a movement toward increased use of enteral rehydration, many children still receive
      prolonged IV rehydration in the emergency department (ED). These children commonly receive a
      single IV bolus of normal saline followed by the administration of a hypotonic solution at a
      maintenance rate.

      The mean time spent in the ED by children receiving IV rehydration is significantly longer
      than the mean time required to treat all other conditions. ED overcrowding has been
      associated with poor outcomes, prolonged pain and suffering, and dissatisfaction. One of the
      solutions proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on ED overcrowding
      is that hospitals should strive to improve the efficiency of the care provided. One small
      step in this direction may be to improve our management of gastroenteritis and dehydration.
