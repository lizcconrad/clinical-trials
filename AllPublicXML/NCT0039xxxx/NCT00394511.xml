  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III trial to compare treatment with or without adjuvant radiation therapy in
      men with stage III prostate cancer who have had radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy
      recently. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells and may be an
      effective treatment for prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare disease-free survival rates of patients randomly assigned to adjuvant
      external-beam radiotherapy vs. no adjuvant therapy following radical prostatectomy and pelvic
      lymphadenectomy for surgical Stage C (T3 N0 M0) adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this adjuvant
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Randomization takes place when the patient is physically able to
      begin treatment, any time within 16 weeks after surgery.

      Arm I: Radiotherapy. Irradiation of the prostatic bed using megavoltage equipment with
      effective photon energies of greater than 4 MV.

      Arm II: No further treatment.
