  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the exact role of Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) in
      altering creatinine clearance. Prior studies have shown the protective effects of
      Acetylcysteine on contrast-induced renal dysfunction. In these studies, Acetylcysteine
      lowered the incidence of serum creatinine elevation after administration of radiographic
      contrast agents. Not only was the increase in serum creatinine prevented, the studies also
      demonstrated a significant increase in creatinine clearance after administration of the
      agent. These prior studies did not evaluate if the increase in creatinine clearance was
      indeed from a protective benefit of Acetylcysteine in preserving the GFR versus simply
      increasing the proximal tubular creatinine secretion without actually affecting the GFR. We
      propose an experiment to help support our hypothesis that Acetylcysteine increases creatinine
      clearance via an increase in proximal tubular secretion of creatinine.
