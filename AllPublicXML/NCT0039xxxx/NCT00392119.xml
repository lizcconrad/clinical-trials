      The purpose of this study is to determine if the stereotactic, MR guided, laser interstitial
      thermal therapy treatment technique can be safety and efficiently used for human brain
      metastasis and primary brain tumors.

    <textblock>
      This new &quot;minimally invasive&quot; technique has been tested so far, with success, on animal brain
      tumor models and on human liver metastasis.

      The main purpose of this study is to determine if the stereotactic, MR guided, laser
      interstitial thermal therapy treatment technique can be safety and efficiently used for the
      human brain metastasis and primary brain tumors.

      As secondary objectives for this clinical study, the following are to be explored:

        -  Eventual evaluation of the eventual mid and long term post-intervention complications,

        -  Evaluate the contra indication for the technique,

        -  Evaluate and optimize clinical and logistic intervention protocols,

        -  Evaluate the mean duration for the procedure,

        -  Evaluate the mean cost for the procedure

      The clinical trial will include a statistical sample of 12-18 treatments and will run over a
      period of 18 months. The inclusion period will be for 6 months and the patients will be
      followed up during 12 months post intervention.

      The clinical trial will be performed at the Lariboisiere University Hospital of Paris and the
      patients will be coming from all the Assistance Publique de Paris ( APHP ) hospitals
