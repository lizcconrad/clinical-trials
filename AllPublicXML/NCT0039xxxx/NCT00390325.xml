    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate works in treating patients with
      medullary thyroid cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), spread to
      the tissue surrounding the thyroid (locally advanced), or has returned after a period of
      improvement (recurrent). Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) (sorafenib tosylate) in
      metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in setting of inherited tumor syndromes, such as
      multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma
      (FMTC).

      II. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in sporadic metastatic
      medullary thyroid carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess toxicity of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in patients with metastatic medullary
      thyroid carcinoma.

      II. Measure serum tumor markers calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) pre-, during,
      and post-treatment to correlate with disease response.

      II. Correlate nuclear medicine functional imaging (fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
      tomography [PET] scan) data obtained at pre-, during, and post-treatment with tumor response
      in these patients.

      III. Correlate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data obtained
      at pre-, during, and post-treatment with changes in tumor permeability and vascularity with
      tumor response.

      IV. Perform pharmacogenomic studies on procured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) if
      clinical responses are observed in these patients.

      V. To correlate between the degree of retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      sequences (Ras)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition with vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the tumor and clinical response.

      VI. To correlate between the presence and type of ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene defects in
      tumor and clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-56. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
