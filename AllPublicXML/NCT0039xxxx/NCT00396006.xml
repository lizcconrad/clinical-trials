  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of weekly augmentation therapy with
      ARALAST Fraction IV-1 (Fr IV-1) on epithelial lining fluid (ELF) alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor
      levels and other ELF analytes and to assess the safety of the treatment. Eligible subjects
      with a diagnosis of severe congenital alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency will receive 8
      consecutive weekly treatments with 60 mg/kg/week of functional ARALAST Fr IV-1 administered
      intravenously. The efficacy and safety assessments will include two bronchoscopies with
      bronchoalveolar lavage on study initiation and on study termination and multiple imaging and
      laboratory safety assessments. Each subject will participate for a minimum of 12 weeks.
