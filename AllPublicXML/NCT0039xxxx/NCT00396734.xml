  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to use an advanced brain imaging technique, PET, in order
      to monitor the progress of pharmacotherapy with modafinil or topiramate for cocaine
      dependence in methadone-maintained patients who use cocaine in addition. Comparisons will be
      made within the cocaine dependent methadone maintained subjects, between the start and end of
      treatment, and between the two medications. This is the first systematic research study of
      pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence in Israel. This study is of major clinical
      use, with implications for the treatment of cocaine dependence in poly-drug abusers in
      Israel. Successful pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence is expected in reduction in
      cue-induced subjective craving and in glucose metabolism in brain areas elicited by cocaine
      craving. Metabolic activity in regions that are activated by craving should be correlated
      with dopamine DRD2 receptor occupancy in all patients.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To try to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying cocaine dependence and craving in
           co-morbid cocaine-dependent patients. For this purpose we shall trigger craving for
           cocaine by exposure to a videotape showing cocaine use and then measure brain metabolic
           activity using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)

        2. To evaluate dopamine binding in the brain in the early stage, and at the end of
           treatment. For this purpose the patients will undergo brain imaging of the dopamine
           receptor DRD2 by using PET with [11C] raclopride. This is a well established procedure
           for quantifying the effects of drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine on the brain.

        3. To investigate the association between subjective measures of craving for cocaine and
           the level of dopamine DRD2 receptor occupancy in the brain.
