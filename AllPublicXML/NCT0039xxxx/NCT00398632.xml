    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs). The hypotheses of this study are that:1. subjects with major depression or dysthymia
      who are being treated with an SSRI and experiencing treatment-related sexual dysfunction will
      experience less sexual dysfunction if they are switched to duloxetine, and 2. they will
      experience either improved antidepressant response or no loss of antidepressant response.

      In this study, subjects suffering from depression or dysthymia and experiencing
      treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction from an SSRI are switched from their SSRI to duloxetine
      to determine whether or not they experience improved sexual function and equal or improved
      antidepressant response. Study subjects are assigned to receive open label duloxetine for 12
      weeks at either 60mg per day or 120mg per day after discontinuing their current
      antidepressant

    <measure>Global Clinical Impressions Improvement Score re Sexual Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and last observation (4 subjects at end of week 12, 2 subjects at end of week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The GCI-I score is a global clinical impression score regarding a patient's symptom severity change rated by the treating clinician. The score can be 0 (not assessed), 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse). In this study clinicians made ratings based on interviewing the patient and reviewing the patient's self ratings on the the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX). No formal cut point scores on the ASEX were established. The ASEX is a 5-item slef rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach organism, and satisfaction from orgasm. Each item is rated from 1 to 6 (total scores from 5 to 30), with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction.</description>

    <description>The IDS-C is a 30-item inventory designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. Scale range minimum = 0 / maximum = 84. Higher values are considered to be worse outcomes. Scores less than or equal to 6 indicated remission in this study.</description>

        <title>Global Clinical Impressions Improvement Score re Sexual Functioning</title>
        <description>The GCI-I score is a global clinical impression score regarding a patient's symptom severity change rated by the treating clinician. The score can be 0 (not assessed), 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse). In this study clinicians made ratings based on interviewing the patient and reviewing the patient's self ratings on the the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX). No formal cut point scores on the ASEX were established. The ASEX is a 5-item slef rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach organism, and satisfaction from orgasm. Each item is rated from 1 to 6 (total scores from 5 to 30), with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction.</description>

        <population>Four subjects completed the study; two withdrew at end of week six. CGI-I ratings for two subjects were done at end of week 6 and this last observation was carried forward in the analysis. CGI-I ratings for the 4 completing subjects were done at end of week 12.</population>

          <title>Global Clinical Impressions Improvement Score re Sexual Functioning</title>
          <description>The GCI-I score is a global clinical impression score regarding a patient's symptom severity change rated by the treating clinician. The score can be 0 (not assessed), 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse). In this study clinicians made ratings based on interviewing the patient and reviewing the patient's self ratings on the the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX).
