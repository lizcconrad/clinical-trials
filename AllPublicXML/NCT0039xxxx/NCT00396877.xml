  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contemporary management of cyanotic congenital heart disease includes three stages of
      surgery. Incidence of shunt thrombosis and death between the two first stages of palliation
      remains important.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg/day
      for the reduction of all cause mortality and shunt related morbidity in neonates or infants
      with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt
      (e.g. modified Blalock Taussig Shunt [BTS]).

      The secondary objective was to assess the safety of Clopidogrel in the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this event-driven study, participants were to be randomized and treated as soon as
      possible after shunt placement. They were then to be treated and followed until the primary
      endpoint criteria was reached i.e. (shunt thrombosis, the next surgical procedure for
      correction of the congenital heart disease or death) or one year of age or the common
      study-end-date, which ever came first.

      The common study-en-date was defined as the date when it was projected that 172 participants
      would have reached the primary endpoint criteria.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the first occurence of any of the following events: Death (including heart transplant); Shunt thrombosis requiring intervention; Hospitalization for bi-directional Glenn procedure or any cardiac related intervention prior to 120 days of age following an event or a shunt narrowing considered to be of thrombotic nature by the blinded adjudication committee.
Only the first event was counted.</description>

    <description>Bleeding events spanning from signature of the Informed Consent Form up to the last visit were collected as for any Adverse Event.
The 'on-treatment' period was defined as the period from randomization up until 28 days after treatment discontinuation or final follow-up visit, whichever came first, and participants who experienced bleeding events during that period were counted.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization up to 28 days after treatment discontinuation or final follow-up visit, whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>For all reported bleeding events, the type and the etiology of the bleeding event were collected. Participants who experienced bleeding events during the 'on-treatment period' were counted by bleeding type and etiology. Participants who had multiple bleedings could be counted several times.</description>
