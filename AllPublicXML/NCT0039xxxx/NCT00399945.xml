      This study assesses the aerosol delivery characteristics (measured by in vivo lung
      deposition, nebulization time, serum tobramycin concentrations, and pharmacokinetic
      parameters) and safety of tobramycin inhalation solution administered for inhalation by PARI
      eFlow rapid electronic nebulizer (no compressor) vs. PARI LC PLUS Jet Nebulizer (with
      compressor) in healthy subjects and in subjects with cystic fibrosis.
