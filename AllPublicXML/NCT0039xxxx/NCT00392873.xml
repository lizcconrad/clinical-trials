  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of increased food intake on the menstrual
      cycle and bone health in physically active women who have irregular or absent menstrual
      cycles. This study will examine whether a 12 month period of increased food intake will cause
      menstrual cycles to resume and help bones get stronger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of estrogen found in physically active, premenopausal women with irregular or
      absent menstrual periods is likely caused by insufficient energy (calorie) intake compared to
      energy expenditure. Premenopausal women with menstrual disturbances and amenorrhea suffer
      from reductions in bone mineral density, particularly in the lumbar spine. Bone loss observed
      in amenorrheic women may be serious enough to result in osteoporotic fractures, but is also
      associated with a high prevalence of stress fractures. Increased calorie intake should help
      improve energy status, menstrual status, and bone health.

      Comparison: Premenopausal women with irregular or absent menstrual periods will be assigned
      to either receive additional calories or serve as controls. A group of premenopausal women
      with normal menstrual periods will also be used for comparison.

    <description>During the 12 month intervention, volunteers in the Increased calorie intake group will follow a modified dietary plan designed to achieve and maintain a target level of 20-30% above their previously determined baseline, in an effort to achieve a chronic energy surplus of +20-30% over their baseline energy requirements.</description>
