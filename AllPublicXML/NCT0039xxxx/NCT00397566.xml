        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1-infected subjects with CD4+ lymphocyte count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and with plasma
             HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5000 copies/mL who have not been on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for ≥ 8
             weeks or who are naive to ARV, and who are otherwise medically stable as determined by
             medical history, physical examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram, and clinical
             laboratory evaluations will be eligible to participate in the study. In addition,
             subjects must have had no prior exposure to the Integrase Inhibitor class of
             compounds.

          -  Female subjects must not be nursing, pregnant, or of childbearing potential
