      Primary objective:

        -  To determine the optimal treatment algorithm for the clinical use of insulin glargine
           based on the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine for each treatment algorithm the incidence of asymptomatic, symptomatic and
           nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

        -  To determine the difference in glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c and fasting blood
           glucose between the treatment algorithms.

        -  To determine the difference in glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c and fasting blood
           glucose between baseline and end of treatment.

        -  To obtain safety data on the use of insulin glargine in each treatment algorithm.

        -  To measure change in subject weight and insulin dose between baseline and end of
           treatment.

        -  To determine subject quality of life and treatment satisfaction (sub-study)
