    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of SL77.0499-10 10mg
      once daily over placebo and the non-inferiority versus tamsulosin hydrochloride after 12
      weeks treatment in terms of the efficacy in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms
      related to BPH.

      The secondary objective is to assess the safety of SL77.0499-10 in patients with lower
      urinary tract symptoms related to BPH in comparison with placebo and tamsulosin
      hydrochloride.
