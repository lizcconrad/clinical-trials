        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the study:

          1. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum or appendix.

          2. Metastatic/recurrent disease not amenable to potentially curative treatment (e.g.,
             inoperable metastatic disease).

          3. No prior chemotherapy for metastatic/recurrent disease. Prior adjuvant treatment with
             5-FU/LV and/or IFL is allowed if it is completed at least 6 months before study
             registration.

          4. ECOG Performance Status 0- 1.

          5. At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion with a diameter &gt;/= 20 mm using
             conventional CT or MRI scans or &gt;/= 10 mm using spiral CT scans. If a single lesion is
             identified as the target lesion, a histological or cytological confirmation of
             adenocarcinoma is required.

          6. Recovery in full from any previous surgical procedure.

          7. No other serious concomitant disease.

          8. Required baseline laboratory parameters:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/=1,500/mm3 (standard international [SI] units
                  109/L);

               2. Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm3 (SI units 109/L);

               3. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 8.0 g/dL (SI units mmol/L);

               4. Creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN; Total bilirubin &lt;/= 2.0 x ULN;

               5. Serum glutamate-oxalate transferase (SGOT, AST) Serum glutamic pyruvic
                  transaminase (SGPT, ALT) &lt;/= 3 x ULN &lt;/= 3 x ULN;

               6. Urinalysis - dipstick Protein &lt; +1;

               7. Coagulation PT/PTT (INR) Within Normal Limits for Institution;

               8. Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential: Negative within 7
                  calendar days of randomization to study

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          1. Prior treatment with oxaliplatin or bevacizumab.

          2. Any uncontrolled infection.

             significant hypertension (blood pressure of &gt;160/110 mmHg on medication), or
             symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.

          4. History of any other cancer (except non melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of
             the cervix) unless in complete remission and off all therapy for that cancer for at
             least 5 years.

          5. Central nervous system metastases.

          6. Peripheral neuropathy of any cause.

          7. Pregnant or lactating women.

             syndrome.

         11. Medical or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with informed consent,
             compliance or make them a poor risk for participation in this trial.

         12. Patients with known DPD deficiency.

         13. Patients with interstitial pneumonia or extensive symptomatic fibrosis of the lungs.

         14. Patients with calculated creatinine clearance of &lt;30 ml/min using Cockroft and Gault
             formula.

         15. Patients who have received an organ allograft.

         16. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to study entry.

         17. Chronic, daily treatment with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
             medications (intermittent or &quot;p.r.n.&quot; use for pain is permitted).

         18. Evidence of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

         19. Subjects found to have proteinuria at baseline - If patients are found to have &gt;/= 1+
             proteinuria at baseline screening they should undergo a 24-hour urine collection,
             which must be an adequate collection and must demonstrate &lt;2g of protein/24 hr to
             allow participation in the study.
