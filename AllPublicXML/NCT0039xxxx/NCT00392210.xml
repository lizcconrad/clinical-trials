    <textblock>
      After gynecologic surgery, it may be difficult to void (urinate). This problem is usually
      short-term with normal function returning within a few days to a few weeks. For this reason,
      patients may require drainage of their bladder with a catheter immediately after surgery.
      Currently in our office, we use two different tests to see how well you are able to urinate
      and how quickly the catheter can be removed. The purpose of this study is to see which
      voiding test is better after gynecologic surgery.

      Postoperative voiding dysfunction is commonly encountered following gynecologic surgery. This
      dysfunction is usually short term, with normal function returning within a few days.
      Following uro/gynecologic surgery, most patients require drainage with either a transurethral
      or suprapubic catheter in the immediate postoperative period. Within our practice, we prefer
      drainage with a transurethral catheter.

      At some point after surgery, the urethral catheter is removed and normal bladder function
      allowed to resume. At present, there is no generally accepted regimen to assess voiding
      efficiency. In our practice, we currently employ two regimens to both assess voiding
      efficiency and expedite catheter removal. In one technique, the catheter is removed and the
      patient's bladder is allowed to fill spontaneously. Patients are asked to void when they
      experience a strong urge. The voided volume is recorded and a post-void residual (PVR) is
      then measured by transurethral straight catheterization.

      In the second technique, the patient's bladder is retrogradely filled with 300 cc of sterile
      fluid and the catheter removed. They are asked to void within 15 minutes of instillation and
      the voided volume is measured. The PVR is then obtained by transurethral straight
      catheterization.

      In both cases, if the patient voids &gt;2/3 the total volume (voided volume + residual) the
      trial is considered &quot;passed&quot; and the catheter is removed. If a patient voids &lt; 2/3 of the
      total volume, the trial is considered &quot;failed&quot; and indicative of urinary retention. In this
      case the catheter replaced.

      We aim to assess the ability of these techniques to accurately predict voiding efficiency and
      to determine if one technique is superior to the other.

          <description>Voiding trial 1 was performed according to the patient assignment to group 1 or 2. Voiding trial 2 was done immediately after completion of trial 1. A successful trial was defined as a void of greater than two-thirds of total bladder volume (voided volume + post-void residual urine).</description>
