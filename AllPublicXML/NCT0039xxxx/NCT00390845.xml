    <measure>Mean average Daily Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (PI-NRS) score over period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their overall pain intensity for the last 24 hours, daily before retiring to bed. This constituted the Daily Pain Score. The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Maximum pain imaginable&quot;. It was used for the subjective assessment of the pain. The score ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 represented absence of symptoms and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. The average daily pain over Week 1 (Day 7) was calculated as the mean of days 2 to 6 inclusive and for week 2 (Day 14), days 8 to 13 inclusive. Participants were instructed to record their daily pain score on a dairy card and calculations of average weekly pain scores were performed on the basis of diary cards review.</description>

    <measure>Mean Current pain intensity (CPI) score using PI-NRS over period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The 11 point pain intensity numerical rating scale ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Maximum pain imaginable&quot;. It was used for the subjective assessment of the pain. The score ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 represented absence of symptoms and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Current pain was the pain intensity assessments that were carried out in the unit (at Day 7 and 14 of each treatment period), were recording of the pain intensity that the participant felt at the time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) in cold pain, heat pain and warmth detection threshold on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>A thermode was placed on skin of participant. Temperature of block was initially set to Baseline temperature of participant's skin (32 degree Celsius [°C]). For threshold measurement, temperature of thermode was gradually increased (for warm sensation and heat pain detection thresholds) or decreased (for cold sensation and cold pain thresholds) from Baseline (32°C) at rate of 1°C per second. Ramp was stopped and temperature of thermode was returned to Baseline by participant pushing a button on a response unit when threshold was reached. It was repeated 4 (sensation thresholds) or 3 times (pain thresholds) for each modality. Threshold temperatures and average values were recorded. If thermode temperature reached 50°C (heat pain) or 0°C (cold pain) without participant responding, ramp was stopped, temperature was returned to Baseline automatically to prevent skin injury. Respective cut-off temperature was then recorded for that trial. Recorded for affected and controlled area of skin.</description>

    <measure>Mean area of static touch allodynia</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Allodynia is defined as increased response of neurons on painful and repetitive, stimulation or pain in response when touched. Area of static allodynia was determined using a 26 g von Frey filament. In a non-painful area, investigator repeatedly applied filament perpendicularly to skin, exerting enough pressure to make filament bend slightly, each time closer to presumed border of allodynia. When participant reported sensation becoming more unpleasant or painful, point at which filament was contacting the painful area of skin was marked with a felt tip pen by investigator. At that point, if participant's painful area was on a limb, a total of four points (each 90° apart) were drawn in order to complete mapping. If participant's painful area was irregular, or on trunk or face, a total of 8 points (45° apart) was drawn in order to complete mapping. Area of static allodynia was calculated by transferring the points to an homunculus. Points were connected to form area of allodynia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean area of dynamic touch allodynia</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Allodynia is defined as increased response of neurons on painful and repetitive, stimulation or pain in response to stroking lightly. Area of dynamic allodynia was determined using a one inch foam brush. In a non-painful area, investigator, exerted enough pressure to make foam brush bend slightly, would slowly move brush forward toward painful area of participant, at rate of 1 centimeter per second. When participant reported sensation becoming unpleasant or painful, point at which foam brush was contacting painful area of skin was marked with a felt tip pen by investigator. At that point, if participant's painful area was on a limb, a total of 4 points (each 90° apart) was drawn in order to complete mapping. If participant's painful area was irregular, or was in truncal or facial area, a total of 8 points (45° apart) were drawn in order to complete mapping. Area of dynamic allodynia was calculated by transferring points to an homunculus, were connected to form area of allodynia.</description>

    <measure>Mean intensity of static and dynamic touch allodynia</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Allodynia is defined as increased response of neurons on painful and repetitive, stimulation. Where static allodynia was pain in response when touched and dynamic allodynia was pain in response to stroking lightly. The intensity of static and dynamic allodynia was assessed using the 11 point numeric rating scale, where 0=no pain, 10=maximum pain imaginable. The score ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 represents absence of symptoms and higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with Global Impression of Change Scale scores over period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Impression of Change scale was rated by the clinician and the participant for change in overall status as perceived by the clinician and as perceived by the participant, respectively. It was rated using a 7-point numerical rating scale where 1=Very much improved, 2=Much improved, 3=Minimally improved, 4=No change, 5=Minimally worse, 6=Much worse and 7=Very much worse. The scale ranged from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates best response and 7 indicates worst response. The assessments were done during the Visit to the unit on Day 7 and Day 14, 2 hours post-dose of each treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who used rescue medication over period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Any participant for whom the pain intensity became unacceptable during any stage of the study was permitted to initiate rescue analgesic therapy with the protocol defined rescue medication of paracetamol up to two 500 mg tablets BID (i.e., maximum paracetamol 2 g per 24 hour period). Total paracetamol use included rescue medication and also paracetamol consumed in over-the-counter remedies including cold, allergy, sleep and pain preparations. Participants were requested not to take any paracetamol up to 24 hours before a treatment Visit. The use of rescue medication was recorded on the diary cards by the participants and use of recue medication during the treatment visit was recorded in case report form (CRF). Data is reported for number of participants who used rescue medication.</description>
