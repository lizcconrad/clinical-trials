      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      chemotherapy with or without monoclonal antibody therapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel, epirubicin, and
      cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab works in treating women with locally advanced
      breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy comprising docetaxel and trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®) and adjuvant therapy comprising epirubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,
           and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) followed by radiotherapy in women with locally advanced,
           HER2-positive, operable breast cancer.

        -  Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with docetaxel and adjuvant therapy
           comprising epirubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide followed by radiotherapy in
           women with locally advanced, HER2-negative, operable breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to HER2 status (positive vs negative).

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy:

             -  Stratum 1 (HER2-positive disease): Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90
                minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
                repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity

             -  Stratum 2 (HER2-negative disease): Patients receive docetaxel IV alone as in
                stratum 1.

        -  Surgery: All patients undergo surgery in week 19.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning within 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive adjuvant
           therapy.

             -  Stratum 1 (HER2-positive disease): Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90
                minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 2,
                and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
                for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
                Patients then receive trastuzumab IV alone every 3 weeks until week 52.

             -  Stratum 2 (HER2-negative disease): Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride and
                cyclophosphamide as in stratum 1.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients who undergo breast conserving surgery or patients who undergo
           mastectomy with ypN positive lymph nodes (i.e., &gt; 4 positive lymph nodes) or ypT3 tumor
           (i.e., tumor size &gt; 4 cm) undergo radiotherapy, beginning in approximately week 31 and
           continuing until up to week 38.

        -  Adjuvant endocrine therapy: Patients with estrogen receptor- or progesterone
           receptor-positive disease receive adjuvant endocrine therapy beginning in approximately
           week 31. Premenopausal patients ≤ 40 years of age receive goserelin for 2-3 years and
           tamoxifen citrate for 5 years.Premenopausal patients &gt; 40 years of age receive tamoxifen
           citrate for 5 years. Postmenopausal patients receive anastrozole for 5 years years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 94 patients will be accrued for this study.
