  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary kallikrein excretion is known to increase in patients with nephrotic syndrome and
      sick cell disease, but decrease in patients with chronic kidney disease or uremia. Some of
      authors consider urinary kallikrein is a marker of nephropathy. To evaluate the possible role
      of kallikrein kinin system in chronic kidney disease, we conduct a retrospective longitudinal
      observation study. Patients who participating in the “Efficacy of Pentoxifylline on Chronic
      Kidney Disease” study are included in the study. The morning spot urinary kallikrein and
      cytokines are measured at the time point of 0 and 12 month in addition to clinical
      parameters. The correlation of urinary kallikrein and cytokine concentration will be
      evaluated. Using multiple regression model, the relationship of urinary kallikrein excretion
      with degree of proteinuria, creatinine clearance and other clinical parameter will also be
      evaluated.
