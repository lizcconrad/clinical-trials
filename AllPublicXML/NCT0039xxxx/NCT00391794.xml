      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an Early Stage Memory Loss Support
      Group (ESSG) and Education Seminar (ES) on quality of life, mood, social support, distress
      about memory loss, and interpersonal relationships of memory loss participants and their
      caregivers.

    <textblock>
      With recent advances in diagnostic procedures and treatment options, many individuals with AD
      are now diagnosed early in the disease. Early diagnosis has many benefits: treatment can be
      started sooner, legal and financial planning can be addressed while the individual is able to
      participate in decision-making, and support services can be mobilized earlier. However, early
      diagnosis may also have negative consequences for the diagnosed individual's quality of life.
      Thus, diagnosis creates an obligation to help individuals and their families learn more about
      AD and cope with the impact of the diagnosis. Many Alzheimer's Association chapters have
      begun providing early stage support groups that focus on enhancing quality of life for
      participants and their caregivers. Anecdotal reports suggest that these groups improve
      quality of life of participants, but some individuals may also experience decreases in
      quality of life associated with stress, depression, or family conflict as a result of
      discussing current and future losses in the group. Thus, there is a need to systematically
      evaluate the benefits of these groups.

      This study will evaluate and compare the efficacy of a structured, 8-session Early Stage
      Support Group intervention (ESSG) and a half-day Education Seminar (ES). Participants with
      early stage memory loss and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to either ESSG or ES.
      Both are presented by the Alzheimer's Association Western &amp; Central Washington State Chapter.
