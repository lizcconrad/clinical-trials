  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint swelling,
      pain, stiffness, damage, and ultimately loss of joint function. Scientists estimate that
      about 1.3 million people (0.6 percent) of the U.S. adult population have RA. Current
      therapies target the immune system early in the disease process before joint damage occurs,
      and include drugs such as methotrexate (MTX) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking agents.
      Rituximab is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) recently approved by the FDA for
      use in combination with MTX for treatment of moderately to severely active RA in patients who
      have had an inadequate response to TNF-blocking agents, in an effort to try to slow the
      course of the disease. This study will examine the effects of rituximab on the immune
      response and disease activity in participants with early RA who have not been treated with
      any disease-modifying agent. In addition, the safety and tolerability of rituximab in this
      population will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RA is an inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in
      the joints. It occurs when the immune system, which normally defends the body from invading
      organisms, turns its attack against the membrane lining the joints. RA is commonly managed by
      DMARDs initiated early in the disease process, before irreversible joint damage occurs. The
      most common DMARD prescribed in the United States is MTX; this drug is well tolerated and has
      better efficacy compared to other DMARDs, but is inadequate in providing lasting improvement
      in individuals with RA. In patients with an inadequate response to MTX alone, the use of
      biologic agents, including TNF-blocking agents in combination with MTX, has become a standard
      therapeutic approach.

      Rituximab (anti-CD20) is a man-made antibody used to treat certain types of cancer. The drug
      blocks the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B cells and is known to deplete B cells when
      administered intravenously. Previous research suggests B-cell activity is important in
      pathogenesis of RA, so B-cell depletion may decrease inflammation and other symptoms of RA.
      Rituximab has recently been approved by the FDA for use in combination with MTX for treatment
      of patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to
      TNF-blocking agents. This study will examine the effects of rituximab on the immune response
      and disease activity in patients with early active RA who have not been treated with any
      disease-modifying agent. Levels of B and T cells and other markers of disease activity will
      be monitored during the study. The safety and tolerability of rituximab in this DMARD-naive
      population will be examined.

      The expected duration of this study is 2.5 years. All participants will receive two
      intravenous infusions of rituximab in an outpatient setting at study entry and Week 2.
      Throughout the study, participants will receive MTX, systemic corticosteroids, and folic or
      folinic acid. MTX dosing will be re-evaluated by disease activity scores every month until
      Month 6 and again at Months 8, 10, and 12. Systemic corticosteroid doses will be modified
      based on the participant's health while in the study. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) is permitted, but NSAID doses should not be changed during the study, if at
      all possible. NSAIDs will not be provided by this study.

      There will be a maximum of 2 screening visits before study treatment, a baseline visit (Day
      0), and 11 study visits. A physical exam, assessment for adverse events, and blood collection
      will occur at all study visits. Kidney and liver function tests and rheumatologic evaluations
      will occur at most study visits; participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire
      on their health at most study visits. Arthroscopy (knee biopsy) on the more inflamed knee
      will occur at baseline and Month 3. Participants will be contacted by telephone the day after
      each arthroscopy and rituximab infusion.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score- Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-ESR is a score on a scale (0 to 10) that is a measure of the subject's disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity (mm), and ESR (mm/hour). Lower score indicates less disease activity. Flares in disease activity are defined as an increase in this score of greater than 1.2 and remission is defined as achieving a DAS28-ESR score of less than 2.6.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Tender Joint Count (TJC) is calculated based on tenderness response of 28 joints. TJC possible values range from 0 to 28. A lower TJC indicates less joint tenderness. Change from baseline is computed as Week 48 value minus baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Health Component Summary Scores (PCS and MCS) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 48 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living activities (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). In addition, category scores are modified if an aid or device is used, for example, a walker or wheelchair, or help is received from another person in the daily living activities. If an aid or device is used or help is received then a category score of 0 or 1 increases to a category score of 2. A category score of 3 remains a 3 regardless of aids, devices, or help. Scores from each of the 8 categories are totaled. The total score can range from 0 to 24. Change from baseline is computed as the total score at Week 48 minus the baseline total score. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>ESR is a blood test used to monitor therapy in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and reflects acute phase reactant levels. Active disease in RA is defined by an ESR greater than 30 mm/hr. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 48 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

          <description>The DAS28-ESR is a score on a scale (0 to 10) measure of the subject's disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity (mm), and ESR (mm/hour). Flares in disease activity are defined as an increase greater than 1.2 in this score and remission is defined as achieving a DAS28-ESR score of less than 2.6</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental Health Component Summary Scores (PCS and MCS) at Week 48</title>
        <description>SF-36 measures health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 48 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 48</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living activities (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). In addition, category scores are modified if an aid or device is used, for example, a walker or wheelchair, or help is received from another person in the daily living activities. If an aid or device is used or help is received then a category score of 0 or 1 increases to a category score of 2. A category score of 3 remains a 3 regardless of aids, devices, or help. Scores from each of the 8 categories are totaled. The total score can range from 0 to 24. Change from baseline is computed as the total score at Week 48 minus the baseline total score. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
