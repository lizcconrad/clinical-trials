  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of hypertensive patients require antihypertensive associations to control their
      blood pressure. Most of clinical trials don’t compare different associations using
      Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg as the standard initial therapy and compare the associations using
      doses that are not equivalent.

      This randomized trial where patients and investigators are blinded and compares the
      effectiveness two associations: Hydrochlorothiazide and Amiloride and Hydrochlorothiazide and
      Enalapril.
