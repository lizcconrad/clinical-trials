  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of double blind phase in this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety at
      the fixed dose of 0.25 mg,0.5 mg and 0.75 mg pramipexole in RLS. The objective of open label
      phase in this trial is to investigate the long term safety and efficacy of pramipexole in
      RLS.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Total Score at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 - change from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) proposes classification of severity based on the total score on the IRLS (0-10, mild; 11-20, moderate; 21-30, severe; 31-40, very severe). A decrease in the score of the IRLS by 10 or more points corresponds to the improvement of severity by one rank and has clinical importance. Therefore, the primary endpoint in the double-blind period was set as a decrease by 10 or more points in the mean change on the total score of the IRLS from the baseline to Visit 5 (last observation day in the double-blind period) at all doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.75 mg/day of pramipexole.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Total Score at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 - change from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI developed to evaluate the quality of sleep is a self-recording questionnaire consisting of 18 questions focused on 7 factors such as sleep quality, sleep period time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, sleep difficulty, use of hypnotics, and hindrance to activities of daily living due to daytime sleepiness. Each score (0-3 points) in the respective factors was added to calculate the total score (0-21 points). Rating scale scored from 0 (best sleep) to 21 (worst sleep).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Japanese Version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (JESS) Total Score at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 - change from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>ESS is a self-recording scale used to evaluate sleepiness experienced in daily activities and it consists of 8 items focused on specific situations such as reading books and watching television. Each score (0-3 points) to 8 questions was added simply to calculate the total ESS score. A Japanese translation of the ESS (a provisional version provided by the Japanese Respiratory Society) used so far had not been prepared through the international scale development and validation process, but the version prepared through this process was published at the 31st meeting of the Japanese Society of Sleep Research. The questions in JESS had been discussed with the original author of the ESS and their measurement concepts had been confirmed. The JESS is the Japanese version of ESS prepared through the international scale development and validation process. Rating scale scored from 0 (no daytime sleep) to 24 (worst daytime sleep)</description>

    <description>CGI is extensively used for risk-benefit evaluation (efficacy) of drug therapies. The CGI evaluates the severity and improvement in 7 ranks. It also evaluates the therapeutic effect and side effects in 4 ranks, separately. Rating scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The percentage of patients who were evaluated as 1(very much improved) or 2(much improved) by the investigator were considered responders.</description>

Open-label period:
Administration of pramipexole was started at 0.25 mg/day at Week 6 (Visit 5, the last observation day in the double-blind period). Subsequently, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) and tolerability was assessed from Visit 6 and if required, the investigator or subinvestigator determined whether to increase the daily dose to 0.5 mg and then to 0.75 mg/day every two weeks. After checking the PGI and tolerability at each visit, the investigator or sub-investigator determined dose increase, maintenance or reduction.

        <title>Change From Baseline in International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Total Score at 6 Weeks</title>
        <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) proposes classification of severity based on the total score on the IRLS (0-10, mild; 11-20, moderate; 21-30, severe; 31-40, very severe). A decrease in the score of the IRLS by 10 or more points corresponds to the improvement of severity by one rank and has clinical importance. Therefore, the primary endpoint in the double-blind period was set as a decrease by 10 or more points in the mean change on the total score of the IRLS from the baseline to Visit 5 (last observation day in the double-blind period) at all doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.75 mg/day of pramipexole.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Total Score at 6 Weeks</title>
          <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) proposes classification of severity based on the total score on the IRLS (0-10, mild; 11-20, moderate; 21-30, severe; 31-40, very severe). A decrease in the score of the IRLS by 10 or more points corresponds to the improvement of severity by one rank and has clinical importance. Therefore, the primary endpoint in the double-blind period was set as a decrease by 10 or more points in the mean change on the total score of the IRLS from the baseline to Visit 5 (last observation day in the double-blind period) at all doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.75 mg/day of pramipexole.</description>

          <description>CGI is extensively used for risk-benefit evaluation (efficacy) of drug therapies. The CGI evaluates the severity and improvement in 7 ranks. It also evaluates the therapeutic effect and side effects in 4 ranks, separately. Rating scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The percentage of patients who were evaluated as 1(very much improved) or 2(much improved) by the investigator were considered responders.</description>

Administration of pramipexole was started at 0.25 mg/day at Week 6 (Visit 5, the last observation day in the double-blind period). Subsequently, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) and tolerability was assessed from Visit 6 and if required, the investigator or subinvestigator determined whether to increase the daily dose to 0.5 mg and then to 0.75 mg/day every two weeks. After checking the PGI and tolerability at each visit, the investigator or sub-investigator determined dose increase, maintenance or reduction.
The end-of-trial dosage was 0.125 mg. mode of administration.: Oral, once daily, 2-3 hours before bedtime</description>
