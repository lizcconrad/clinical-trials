    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of
      combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) given intravenously (IV) in combination with bevacizumab
      every 14 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose will be
      defined if it is at one of the three dose levels under study.
