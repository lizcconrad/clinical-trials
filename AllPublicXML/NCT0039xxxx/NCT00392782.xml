      RATIONALE: Giving total-body irradiation and chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and thiotepa,
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It
      also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving antithymocyte globulin and removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant
      may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a donor stem cell transplant works in
      treating patients with myeloid cancer or other disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of disease-free survival at 1 year in patients with acute or
           chronic myeloid leukemias undergoing T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation from HLA-C mismatched, unrelated donors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of disease relapse at 1 year in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) at 100 days
           and chronic GVHD at 1 year in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure at day 100.

        -  Determine the transplant-related mortality of these patients at 1 year.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients at 1 year.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) epitope mismatch (yes [experimental] vs no
      [control]).

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily
           on days -10 and -9 and receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -8 and
           -7, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30-60 minutes on days -7 to -3, and antithymocyte
           globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -5 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo
           filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, T-cell-depleted, CD34+-selected allogeneic PBSC
           transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.

        <description>Number of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease at 1 year post transplant. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in which functional immune cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as &quot;foreign&quot; and mount an immunologic attack. Grade I=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life threatening. Chronic GVHD is an extension of acute GVHD.</description>
