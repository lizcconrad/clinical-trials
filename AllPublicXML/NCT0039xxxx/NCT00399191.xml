  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to develop a simple, noninvasive test for evaluation of iron
      absorption as a tool to determine the cause of iron deficiency anemia. Healthy, premenopausal
      women with iron deficiency with or without anemia will be recruited for the study.
      Participants will, over the course of two months, ingest an iron solution three times; after
      each iron ingestion, participants will collect their stool and bring it to the study
      investigators for assessment of iron content.
