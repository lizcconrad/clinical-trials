  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess [123I] 5-IA and SPECT imaging as a tool to
      detect nicotinic receptor activity in the brain of PD patients. All study procedures will be
      conducted at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) and Molecular NeuroImaging
      (MNI) in New Haven, CT. Approximately 10 patients with a diagnosis of PD without cognitive
      changes will be recruited to participate in this study. Patients will be eligible to
      participate if they have a diagnosis of PD of more than 2 years duration and have no
      significant cognitive changes.

      All subjects will undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including
      baseline clinical laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and
      baseline cognitive evaluations using the MMSE, the ANAM computerized cognitive battery, and
      other tests of executive function. All subjects will be evaluated with United Parkinson
      Disease Rating Scales (UPDRS) following an overnight withdrawal of anti-parkinson medication.
      Subjects will be asked to undergo an injection of [123I] 5-IA followed by SPECT imaging as
      described below. A second [123I] 5-IA and SPECT imaging study will be obtained for
      reliability testing between 2 weeks and 2 months following the initial [123I] 5IA imaging
      session.

      The primary imaging outcome measure will be VT', the equilibrium distribution volume in brain
      regions is determined from an MRI-directed region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. The baseline
      imaging VT' will be compared to the follow-up imaging study to the reliability of the
      nicotinic [123I] 5-IA imaging.
