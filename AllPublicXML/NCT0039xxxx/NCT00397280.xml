    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the response of immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes) to various
      signals in the test tube to determine how they sense the signals in the body and what
      substances they produce in response to them. It will determine how the cells may, under
      certain circumstances, contribute to inflammation, and will measure substances in the blood
      plasma (the liquid, non-cellular part of the blood) that might stimulate white blood cells,
      in order to understand how the blood responds to possible disease-related conditions.

      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older who weigh at least 110 pounds may be
      eligible for this study. Participants give about 320 milliliters (mL) of blood (about 1 1/3
      cups) or less at each donation. They donate no more than once every 8 weeks and no more than
      six times a year. On some occasions, less than 320 mL of blood may be drawn. The collected
      blood is separated into its components and specific cells are exposed to substances to
      examine their response....

      The objective is to define the signaling pathways activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
      other selected innate immunity stimuli, and the downstream inflammatory functional
      consequences, in human leukocytes in vitro. Adult (greater than or equal to 18 - 65 years
      old), nonpregnant, healthy volunteers will have 320 ml of whole blood collected by
      venipuncture in a monitored setting no more frequently than once every 8 weeks. No further
      interventions will be exercised upon the subjects. The whole blood will be fractionated into
      neutrophil, red blood cell, mononuclear cell, and plasma fractions using plasma-Percoll
      discontinuous centrifugation. Leukocytes will be subjected in vitro to inflammatory stimuli
      (eg, LPS), and selected signaling outcomes (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation,
      Rho GTPase activation, protein-protein interactions) and functional measures (eg, chemotaxis,
      superoxide anion and cytokine production) quantified in the absence and presence of relevant
      chemical inhibitors (eg, SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor). In each such experiment, cells from
      the daily donor will be used as paired controls to the in vitro experimental intervention
      (eg, SB203580 inhibitor vs. DMSO vehicle). Three or more repetitions (on different donors) of
      each specific experimental outcome, as necessary, will be performed to establish statistical
      significance of findings.

      A specific focus of the studies planned will be to define the role of lipid raft membrane
      microdomains in transduction of the LPS signal in human leukocytes. Lipid rafts are
      cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane, within which the LPS receptor,
      Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has been described to reside. LPS signaling has been reported to
      be sensitive to raft cholesterol content, presumably because the specific repertoire of
      proteins in rafts is sensitive to raft cholesterol content. Rafts are thought to act as
      dynamic signaling platforms for co-segregation of proximal adaptor proteins, kinases, and
      other signaling proteins. Of interest, while LPS has been described to modulate the activity
      of proteins that determine raft cholesterol content (eg, Liver X Receptor, ABCA1), virtually
      no work has been done to clarify: 1) the mechanisms underlying LPS-induced intracellular
      cholesterol redistribution, and, more importantly, 2) whether such intracellular
      redistribution of cholesterol is causal to the signaling events triggered by LPS, or 3)
      whether innate immunity signaling is dependent upon inter-subject variations in raft
      cholesterol content.

      Furthermore, we will investigate the role of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the regulation
      of inflammation. It is now widely accepted that inflammation and cancer development are
      interconnected. Dr. Resnick is one of the international leaders in the study of the tumor
      suppressor gene p53. His group has discovered that activation of p53 through exposure to
      carcinogenic stimuli leads to differential expression of genes that have a direct effect on
      the inflammatory response, such as several toll-like-receptor genes. Dr. Resnick will use
      human leukocytes that will be isolated from whole blood. He will expose these cells to
      stimuli that activate p53, such as doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent) or radiation, and
      examine the expression of toll-like-receptor genes as well as the response to LPS and other
      inflammatory agents in vitro.

      Finally, we will investigate the role of zinc-finger proteins in gene expression in
      inflammatory cells. ZFP36 is an RNA binding zinc finger protein that is involved in the
      turnover of mRNAs encoding several clinical important cytokines, including TNF(alpha).
      Several missense, promoter and 3'-untranslated variants have been indentified in humans; in
      some cases, these variants and their haplotypes have been associated with human inflammatory
      disease. We will isolate peripheral blood macrophages and stimulate them with LPS and other
      cytokines, then evaluate the behavior of cytokine mRNA and gene expression.

      In addition to cell signaling experiments, we plan to test a novel detection system for the
      presence of oxidized lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. Inflammation in the body (like sepsis,
      radiation injury, cancer) can induce the generation of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) which
      can react with proteins, DNA and other cell structures and alter their structure, therefore
      causing cell damage. No reliable minimally invasive tests exist to detect biomarkers for
      oxidative stress in humans. One such biomarker is N-formyl kynurenine (NFK) which can be
      found on lipoproteins like LDL. We are developing polyclonal antiserum to NKF with the goal
      of producing a simplified and high throughput method of detecting NFK via ELISA and Western
      analyses. We propose to purify LDL from human serum by standard methods and use ELISA
      analysis to determine if the samples contain KFK as detected using our anti-NFK polyclonal
      serum. These experiments could lead to the development of a simple and reliable non-invasive
      assay that detects a biomarker for oxidative stress in humans.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Normal, healthy adult donors as judged by screening questionnaire

          -  Nonpregnant

          -  Weighing at least 110 lbs

          -  18-65 years of age

          -  HIV negative (proof required every 6 months we will conduct test)*

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C serology negative (checked every 6 months
             we will conduct test)*

               -  The rationale for HIV and hepatitis viral testing is that chronic viral infection
                  may alter and possibly invalidate our experimental results. HIV and hepatitis
                  results will be confidentially obtained. Testing will be contracted to an
                  external certified laboratory and will be paid for by the study group. Results
                  will be available only to the study doctor/PI (Fessler), the study coordinator,
                  the CRU Director (Garantziotis, LAI), and the donor, with the few caveats that
                  follow

        All positive HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results will be promptly communicated to the
        donor by the study doctor/PI or the CRU Director. The participant will be referred to their
        physician and/or to the N.C. Department of Health for confirmatory testing and counseling.
        As explained in detail in the attached Supplement describing N.C. State Department of
        Health code will be followed. The state code mandates reporting of positive results along
        with the participant s name and identifying information to the N.C. Department of Public
        Health. Upon contracting with the testing laboratory, clarification will be obtained and
        documented as to whether the contracted laboratory or the study MD will be responsible for
        reporting positive results to the state to avoid duplication of reporting. Upon receipt of
        the test results, the N.C. Department of Health will contact the participant to inform them
        of the positive result, how to find care, how to avoid infecting others, how the newly
        diagnosed HIV and/or hepatitis infection is reported, and the importance of informing their
        partners at possible risk because of their HIV and/or hepatitis infection. If the HIV,
        hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results are negative, the participant will be not be notified.
        However, the participant may contact the research study nurse for their results.

        HIV and hepatitis B/C test results, non-reactive and reactive, will be documented
        confidentially by the PI or study coordinator in the subject s file, and kept in a locked
        file cabinet in the CRU Medical Records Room.In order to document the reporting procedure
        and the time associated with the reporting process, a document has been created and placed
        in the study specific manual (Hepatitis B/C and HIV Notification Process for Reactive
        Results Form)
