  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty-six patients with heart attacks will be identified at our hospital. Post heart attack
      we will assess heart function, blood flow to the heart, and heart cell function. We will
      assess these parameters using nuclear cardiology scans that are used in everyday cardiology
      practice. The patients will then be divided into 2 groups. One group will receive a
      medication called G-CSF and the other group will receive a placebo. We will give this drug
      (1-2ml) for 4 days beneath the skin. We will take the patients blood during this time and
      measure how the drug affected their blood. The patients will all have the nuclear cardiology
      tests again in 6 weeks and 6 months to see how their heart is functioning. As well, they will
      have a six month angiogram. All the patients will otherwise receive optimal care from their
      Cardiologist. They will be seen at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks to assess them clinically.

      This study will test the effects of G-CSF on the heart function of patients who have had a
      heart attack. It is a medication that that has been shown in an animal model to improve heart
      function after a heart attack. It is a medication that has been used for many years to treat
      patients with cancers and to increase the number of cells donated by healthy bone marrow
      donors. It has no serious side effects. It works by increasing the number of a personâ€™s own
      stem cells in the blood. Stem cells are special cells that are present in our bodies that
      have the ability to form new cells. It had been thought that the heart could not make new
      cells after it has been damaged. Other investigators have shown that this might not be the
      case. It is now thought that after an injury, stem cells from the bone marrow can transform
      into cells of the injured tissue. Therefore, we are trying to increase the number of stem
      cells in the circulation with G-CSF so as to increase repair in the heart after it has been
      damaged. This strategy has never been tried in human beings and if successful could greatly
      reduce death and suffering from heart disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Large anterior wall ST elevation AMI defined by: Post AMI LVEF less than 45% as
             assessed by echocardiography. It is standard practice at our institution to obtain
             echocardiograms on such patients before day 4 post AMI.

          2. Age between 40 -75 years

          3. Angiographically patent infarct related artery (IRA) with TIMI 3 flow with no
             significant stenosis (&gt;70% diameter stenosis in non-intervened upon arteries or &gt;30%
             in arteries that had PTCA), no dissection or visible thrombus, and considered at low
             risk for re-occlusion by the Cardiologist performing the coronary angiography. In
             patients who have undergone PTCA, this assessment will be none on a post PTCA
             angiogram. This will be the majority of patients.

          4. Eligible for treatment with G-CSF within the 5 days Post AMI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior STEMI

          2. Patients with regional wall motion abnormalities in the non-infarct region

          3. Prior CABG or need for CABG

          4. Patients with significant valve disease; defined as stenosis or regurgitation graded
             as greater than moderate (2+).

          5. Patients with clinically apparent, concurrent infection, requiring intravenous
             antibiotics

          6. Patients who are or could be pregnant

          7. Patients with another etiology of LV dysfunction (known/suspected non ischemic
             cardiomyopathy, previous anthracycline therapy, known ethanol abuse (greater than 6
             oz. ethanol/day on a regular basis).
