      To compare Bispectral index and entropy during maintenance of anesthesia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several monitors are currently proposed to evaluate the depth of hypnosis. Among them,
      Bispectral Index (BIS) is a well known and widely used parameter derived from the patient's
      electroencephalograph (EEG). Spectral entropy relies on the extent of disorder in both EEG
      and electromyography (EMG) signals and returns 2 values: State Entropy (SE) and Response
      Entropy. SE is computed over the frequency range of 0.8-32 Hz and reflects the level of
      hypnosis while Response Entropy is computed over the frequency range of 0.8-47 Hz and
      reflects also EMG activity. BIS and SE are dimensionless numbers scaled from 100 to 0 for BIS
      and from 91 to 0 for SE.

      The BIS and Entropy manufacturers claim that adequate level of anesthesia is defined by a BIS
      or SE value between 40 and 60. But some observations have shown that the monitors provided
      different information. These observations led us to carry out this prospective observational
      study designed to study the comparability between BIS and SE during the maintenance period of
      propofol-sufentanil anesthesia.
