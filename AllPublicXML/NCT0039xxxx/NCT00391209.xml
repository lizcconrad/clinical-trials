  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-comparator, 2-arm, parallel-group, 6 month
      study with approximately 360 patients will compare the efficacy of two treatment regimens
      (Algorithm A versus Algorithm B) in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes not optimally
      controlled by one or more oral antihyperglycemic medications. Patients will be assigned
      randomly to receive one of the following treatment groups:

      Algorithm A is defined as a simplified diabetes management regimen starting with a fixed dose
      of HIIP (also known as AIR® Inhaled Insulin)(AIR® is a registered trademark of
      Alkermes,Inc.), titrating 2 times per week based on 2 times per week 4 point blood glucose
      values for the first month and titrating 1 time per week based on once weekly 4-point blood
      glucose values for the remainder of the study, increasing total daily dose by a maximum of 6
      U per day.

      Algorithm B is defined as an intensive diabetes management regimen, starting with an adjusted
      dose of AIR® Inhaled Insulin, titrating 2 times per week based on daily 4 point blood glucose
      values, with sustained monitoring of dose and blood glucose throughout the study, increasing
      total daily dose by a maximum of 8 U per day.
