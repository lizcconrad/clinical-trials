      RATIONALE: Vatalanib and pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vatalanib may also stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving vatalanib together with pemetrexed disodium may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vatalanib when
      given together with pemetrexed disodium in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of PTK/ZK
      and pemetrexed disodium when given in combination.

      II. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of PTK/ZK with pemetrexed
      disodium.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of combination of PTK/ZK with pemetrexed
      disodium at the MTD (Group II).

      IV. To evaluate the intracellular content of pemetrexed disodium polyglutamates as a measure
      of activity of pemetrexed disodium transport and activation enzymes in the MTD expansion
      cohort (Group II).

      V. To evaluate polymorphisms and gene expression of pemetrexed disodium target genes, and
      genes encoding enzymes involved in the transport, activation, and inactivation of pemetrexed
      disodium, and correlate haplotype-tagged SNPs or gene expression levels with intracellular
      levels of pemetrexed disodium polyglutamates, toxicity and/or efficacy or pemetrexed disodium
      in Group II.

      VI. To evaluate pharmacogenetic, metabolic and clinical markers that may predict for
      hypertension induced by anti-VEGF therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose-escalation study of vatalanib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups.

      GROUP I (dose escalation, closed to accrual 12/18/2007): Patients receive pemetrexed disodium
      IV over 10 minutes on day 1 and oral vatalanib twice daily on days 1-21.

      GROUP II (MTD expansion group): Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1, as in group
      I. Patients also receive oral vatalanib at the MTD twice daily on days 8-21 during course 1
      and on days 1-21 during all subsequent courses.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
