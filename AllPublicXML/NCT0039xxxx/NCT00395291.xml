    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine MK-0677 increases IGF-1 in patients with end
      stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end stage renal disease
      (ESRD), malnutrition becomes an increasingly severe problem. This is thought to occur from
      two mechanisms: decreased appetite secondary to uremia and development of a catabolic
      inflammatory milieu. Patients experience decreased muscle mass and functional activity
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Many therapies to improve poor nutritional
      state have been used with little success. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin like growth hormone
      (IGF-1) improve muscle mass, quality of life, nutritional parameters, immune and physical
      functions but must be given parenterally and are limited by expense and patient compliance.
      Recently, the endogenous GH receptor secretagogue (GHRS) ghrelin has been shown to raise
      endogenous GH and improve food intake but must be given parenterally and is not available.
      The experimental drug MK-0677, a synthetic GHRS, ghrelin mimetic, which is given orally, has
      recently been shown to increase IGF-1 and muscle mass in the elderly. Its effects in CKD and
      ESRD are unknown. We will study the effects of MK-0677 on renal patients. Specifically, we
      hope to show that the drug increases IGF-1 in renal patients, and has similar effects to
      exogenous GH and IGF-1. Subjects will be ESRD hemodialysis patients. This protocol is an
      investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind crossover, placebo-controlled pilot study.
      The study's primary outcome is IGF-1 levels for subjects. Secondary outcomes will be levels
      of cytokines, esterase, leptin, insulin, ghrelin, TNF-alpha, CRPs, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and
      adiponectin.

          -  Patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, mentally or legally incapacitated such

             investigational drug within 30 days prior to signing the informed consent form.

Power calculation: We assumed that the IGF-I data will be lognormally distributed and thus the parameter of interest will be the IGF-1 geometric mean. If n=22 individuals complete the study and the intervention effect is 48% greater for one intervention than the other we will have at least 0.80 power to reject the null hypothesis.</groups_desc>
