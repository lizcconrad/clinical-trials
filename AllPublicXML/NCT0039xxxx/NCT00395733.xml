    <description>Each arterial segment visualized in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enhanced by Gadavist and Magnevist was characterized by the on-site investigators and by three independent blinded readers (reader 1, 2 and 3) according to a five-point scale (none/not assessable, poor, moderate, good, excellent), which takes into consideration intravascular contrast quality as well as vessel border delineation. The number of vessel segments with adequate diagnostic quality, i.e. good or excellent scores, was determined for each MRA image.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited at specialized study centers if they satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All had known or suspected stenosis of arterial vessels in different vascular body regions with an indication for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography for diagnosis and further treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 87 screened participants, 4 were not randomized (2 due to withdrawal of consent, 1 due to entering another clinical study and 1 was lost to follow-up). Thus, 83 participants were randomized to either the sequence Gadobutrol/Gadopentate dimeglumine (41 participants) or Gadopentate dimeglumine/Gadobutrol (42 participants).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Each arterial segment visualized in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enhanced by Gadavist and Magnevist was characterized by the on-site investigators and by three independent blinded readers (reader 1, 2 and 3) according to a five-point scale (none/not assessable, poor, moderate, good, excellent), which takes into consideration intravascular contrast quality as well as vessel border delineation. The number of vessel segments with adequate diagnostic quality, i.e. good or excellent scores, was determined for each MRA image.</description>
