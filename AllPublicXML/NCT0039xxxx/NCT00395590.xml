  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder. It is known to be related with increased
      body mass, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension. It is currently believed
      to be a feature of the metabolic syndrome. Other features of the metabolic syndrome-such as
      insulin resistace were found related to inflammation and inflammatory cytokines. Several
      polymorphisms in the genes that encode interleukin 6,inteleukin 10 and TNF-alpha have
      significant influence on the amounts of cytokine production. we thus hypothesize that
      polymorphisms related to increased pruduction are more common in subjects with OSA than in
      matched controls

      Patients attending a sleep apnea clinic for evluation will be recruited. Patients found
      positive for OSA will be compared to the patients with a negative study for OSA for the
      prevalence of polymorphisms in genes of inflammatory cytokines and cytokine levels
