      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given
      together with lenalidomide in treating patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.
      Lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temsirolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Temsirolimus
      may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their
      growth. Giving lenalidomide together with temsirolimus may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 (temsirolimus) when given together with
      lenalidomide in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the clinical
      response of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this
      regimen. IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen in these patients. V.
      Determine the effect of this regimen on immunological cellular and serological parameters and
      hematopoietic precursor cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CCI-779.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and
      oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving at least a partial response after 12 courses may continue to receive
      CCI-779 and lenalidomide as above in the absence of disease progression. Cohorts of 3
      patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Ten patients are treated at the MTD. Patients undergo blood sample
      and bone marrow collection periodically during study treatment for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies, and to determine the immunomodulatory effects of CCI-779 and
      lenalidomide.

    <description>PBMC will be used to assess the phosphorylation status of p70S6K to evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of each dose level. This will assist in determining the biologically active dose in the event that dose limiting toxicity is not observed. The analysis of p70^S6K and phospho (P)-p70^S6K will be assessed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. The expression level will be quantified by densitometry. The inhibition of P- p70S6K will be correlated with clinical endpoints and PK parameters.</description>
