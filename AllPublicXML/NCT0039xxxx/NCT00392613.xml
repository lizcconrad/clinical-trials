  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that in patients with permanent AF lenient rate control is
      not inferior to strict rate control in terms of cardiovascular mortality, morbidity,
      neurohormonal activation, NYHA class for heart failure, left ventricular function, left
      atrial size, quality of life and costs. Lenient rate control is defined as a resting heart
      rate &lt;110 bpm.Strict rate control is defined as a mean resting heart rate &lt; 80 beats per
      minute (bpm) and heart rate during minor exercise &lt; 110 bpm. Patients will be seen after 1,
      2, 3 months (for titration of rate control drugs) and thereafter yearly.

      Study objectives:

        1. To show that lenient rate control is not inferior to strict rate control in terms of
           cardiovascular mortality and morbidity

        2. To show that lenient rate control is not inferior to strict rate control in terms of all
           cause mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, NYHA class for exercise tolerance,
           left ventricular function and left atrial size, quality of life, neurohormonal
           activation as measured by NT-proBNP, hospitalization for heart failure, syncope,
           sustained ventricular tachycardia, appropriate shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing of ICD
           for ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and pacemaker implantations, stroke,
           systemic emboli, and bleeding, unstable angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, costs
           and renal function
