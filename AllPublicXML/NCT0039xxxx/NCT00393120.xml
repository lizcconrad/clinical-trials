  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the CCR5 antagonist
      INCB009471 in HIV-1 infected patients who are antiretroviral therapy na誰ve, or who are not
      currently on a HAART regimen and have not received any antiretroviral agents for 3 months
      prior to the Screening visit. Subjects will receive study medication (INCB009471) admnistered
      orally or placebo once daily with food for 14 days. Clinical safety laboratories, 12-lead
      electrocardiograms, physical examinations and virologic assessments, including viral load,
      viral tropism and CD4+ cell count determinations will be performed at the Screening visit and
      at regularly scheduled visits throughout the study. A blood sample will also be obtained and
      stored to potentially determine the genotype of the CCR5 receptor.

      The primary objectives are:

        1. Assess the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of INCB009471 or placebo when administered
           orally, once daily, as monotherapy for 14 days;

        2. Determine the pharmacokinetics of 3 doses of INCB009471 or placebo when administered
           orally, once daily, as monotherapy for 14 days;

        3. Evaluate the anti-retroviral activity of 3 doses of INCB009471 or placebo when
           administered orally, once daily, as monotherapy for 14 days
