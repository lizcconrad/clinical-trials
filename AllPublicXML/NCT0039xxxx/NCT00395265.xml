  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thrombosis is the development of a blood clot in a vein. Post-thrombotic syndrome
      (PTS) is a painful condition that can develop following a venous thrombosis in one of the
      deep veins of the leg. While PTS is mainly thought to occur because of damage to the vein,
      other factors may be responsible for the development of this condition. This study will
      analyze genetic and biologic samples from participants of a previous study to examine other
      possible causes of venous diseases and PTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term effects of venous thrombosis, known collectively as PTS, include persistent
      swelling, pain, cramps, and numbness in the leg. These symptoms result from impaired return
      of blood through the veins of the lower leg to the heart. PTS is believed to occur as a
      result of direct damage to the valves and walls of the vein. There may be specific factors
      that make certain individuals more prone to PTS. Individuals who are obese, have a genetic
      predisposition to blood clotting disorders, or have high levels of inflammation biomarkers
      may have an increased risk of developing venous diseases. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the possible link between these factors and the occurrence of chronic venous
      disease and PTS. The study's findings will be useful in developing new prevention and
      treatment strategies.

      This study will examine previously collected data from participants in the San Diego
      Population Study, a study that gathered information on the prevalence of chronic venous
      disease in a multi-ethnic group of individuals. There will be no study visits specifically
      for this study. Researchers will examine stored genetic and biologic samples of 370 control
      participants and 370 participants with chronic venous disease. Specifically, levels of
      inflammation biomarkers, levels of obesity-related biomarkers, and genetic predispositions
      for blood clotting disorders will be studied.
