  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine wether an electronic decision support system based on national
      guidelines is effective to improve the follow-up and the treatment of two conditions:
      hypertension and diabetes, in primary care practices.

      Existing computer-based ordering systems for physicians provide drug-centred checks but offer
      little assistance for optimizing the overall patient-centred treatment strategy.

      The ASTI project aims :

        1. to design a guideline-based decision support system for diabetic and/or hypertensive
           patients, to help general practitioners :

             1. to carry out procedures (clinical and biological tests) according to guidelines
                (the recommended procedure at the recommended moment), and to get a synthetic view
                of all the elements they need to follow-up the patient

             2. to avoid prescription errors and to improve compliance with therapeutic guidelines.
                The &quot; critic mode &quot; operates as a background process and corrects the physician's
                prescription on the basis of automatically triggered elementary rules that account
                for isolated guideline recommendations. The &quot; guided mode &quot; directs the physician
                to the best treatment by browsing a comprehensive guideline knowledge base
                represented as a decision tree.

        2. To measure the impact of ASTI when it is implemented with an electronic medical record
           system. We adopt a randomized design, with the practice as the unit of randomization.
