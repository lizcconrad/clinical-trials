  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, Open-Label study evaluating the PK of S-1 components and their metabolites
      in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of hepatic function defined by the
      NCI classification for hepatic impairment. Patients will be stratified into 4 Cohorts-
      Normal, Mild, Moderate or Severe.

      Six patients will be enrolled inot each cohort and receive S-1.

    <description>PK Phase (Part 1), Beginning on Day 1 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, 30 mg/m2 S-1 will be administered orally BID for 14 days (Days 1 through 14), followed by a 1-week recovery period.
On Day -2 and Day 14 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, all patients will receive a single dose of 30 mg/m2 S-1 administered orally.
Extension Phase, Patients will receive S-1 at the dose that they tolerated in the PK Phase. S-1 will be administered orally BID for 2 weeks (Day 1 through Day 14) followed by a 1-week recovery period (Day 15 through Day 21). This cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks.</description>

          7. Is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Exclude a patient from this study if he/she does not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or if
        any of the following conditions are observed:

          1. Has had treatment with any of the following within the specified time frame prior to
             study drug administration:

               1. Any investigational agent received either concurrently or within the last 30
                  days.

               2. Previous therapy for malignancy within 21 days, including any chemotherapy,
                  immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
                  mitomycin C).

               2. Known (at the time of entry) gastrointestinal disorder, including
                  malabsorption,chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea present to the extent that it
                  might interfere with oral intake and absorption of the study medication.

               3. Previous organ allograft, including liver transplantation.

               4. Known brain metastasis.

               8. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient
                  inappropriate for entry into this study. • 3. Is receiving a concomitant
                  treatment with drugs interacting with S-1. The following drugs are prohibited
                  because there may be an interaction with S-1:

               1. Sorivudine, uracil, dipyridamole, cimetidine and folinic acid (may enhance S-1
                  activity).

               2. Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 activity).

               3. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).

               4. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 and
                  flucytosine activity).

               5. Pilocarpine (may inhibit CYP2A6 activity).

        4. Has known sensitivity to 5-FU. 5. Is a pregnant or lactating female. 6. Is a patient
        with reproductive potential who refuses to use an adequate means of contraception
