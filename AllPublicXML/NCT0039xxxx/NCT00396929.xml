  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of Paclitaxel injection after a stent
      implantation in patients with stenosis in native coronary arteries to prevent restenosis in
      comparision with two admitted therapies.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the study is to examine whether in patients with stable or instable Angina
      pectoris and/or documented myocardial ischemia in the presence of de-novo stenosis in native
      coronary arteries with a degree of stenosis between 50 % and 99 % an additional local
      administration of paclitaxel after implantation of a conventional stent is superior to the
      implantation of a conventional stent alone with respect to late lumen loss (LLL). In case of
      superiority it will be examined whether an additional local administration of paclitaxel
      after implantation of a conventional stent is not inferior to the implantation of a
      paclitaxel-eluting stent with respect to late lumen-luss. Is this the case, superiority will
      be tested.
