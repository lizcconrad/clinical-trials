  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a nutritional supplement enriched in omega-3
      fatty acids is effective in improving the tolerance to chemotherapy treatment and improves
      quality of life.

      Colorectal cancer is one of the main causes of mortality in western countries. It is
      considered that in case of colorectal carcinoma, the frequency of weight loss at the moment
      of diagnosis is 54%. Undernourishment affects negatively the course of the illness and it
      confers a worse prognostic, increasing the morbidity and the mortality, while it entails an
      impairment in the quality of life of the patient.

      There is a narrow relationship in the oncologic pathology between undernourishment and the
      pathology itself, drawing a common syndrome called cancerous cachexia. It is usual that
      patients subjected to chemotherapy present nutritional alterations due to the treatments'
      side effects.

      With this study we want to assess the efficacy of a nutritional intervention with
      supplementation enriched in EPA to improve the tolerance to the antineoplastic treatment. As
      an index of tolerability to the chemotherapy treatment, it will be used the variation of
      changes in quality of life evaluated through the questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30, using the
      parameters of global quality of life and physical function.
