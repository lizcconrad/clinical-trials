  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the long-term protection offered by GSK Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine 134612 up to 3.5 years after vaccination. Subjects were vaccinated at
      15 to 19 years of age. This extension phase starts 18 months after vaccination and part of
      the subjects who were vaccinated in the primary study will be enrolled in this extension
      phase. No new subjects will be enrolled. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp;
      outcome measures of the extension phase 18, 30 and 42 months after vaccination. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT00126945). The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA
      Amendment Act, September 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were previously vaccinated at 15 to 19 years of age with GSK Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine 134612 or with Mencevax™ ACWY. This extension phase starts 18 months
      after vaccination and part of the subjects will be enrolled in this extension phase. No
      additional vaccines will be administered during this study and no new subjects will be
      enrolled. The subjects will have three blood samples taken: at 18, 30 and 42 months after
      vaccination.
