    <measure>Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Activities of Daily Living [ADL]) Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a standardized assessment scale used to measure a patient's disease state. It is completed by a blinded rater. There are 6 parts to the UPDRS. Part II (items 5-17; total score 0-52, calculated as the sum of the individual items) measures the patient's activities of daily living. A lower total score indicates greater symptom control. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in the UPDRS Part I (Mentation, Behavior, and Mood) Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a standardized assessment scale used to measure a patient's disease state. It is completed by a blinded rater. There are 6 parts to the UPDRS. Part I (items 1-4; total score 0-16, calculated as the sum of the individual items) measures the patient's mentation, mood and behavior. A lower total score indicates greater symptom control. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the UPDRS Part III (Motor Function) Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a standardized assessment scale used to measure a patient's disease state. It is completed by a blinded rater. There are 6 parts to the UPDRS. Part III (items 18-31; total score 0-56, calculated as the sum of the individual items) measures the patient's motor function. A lower total score indicates greater symptom control. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the UPDRS Part IV (Complications of Therapy) Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Part IV of the UPDRS measures complications the patient may be experiencing with therapy and was only collected at and after the visit at which the first dyskinesia or episode of wearing-off was recorded. Part IV is composed of 3 sections and 11 items: A (32-35, dyskinesia), B (36-39, clinical fluctuations, C (40-42, other complications) (total score 0-23, calculated as the sum of the individual items). A lower total score indicates greater symptom control. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Total Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is an instrument used to assess quality of life in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The questionnaire provides scores on eight scales: Mobility, activities of daily living, emotions, stigma, social support, cognitions, communication, and bodily discomfort. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The total score can range from 39 to 195. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A positive change score indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Investigator Global Evaluation of the Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Both the patient and the investigator made an evaluation of the change in the patient's condition by rating the condition of the patient at the end of the study compared to patient's condition at baseline. The rating was made on a scale ranging from -3 to +3: (-3: Very much improved, -2: much improved, -1: mild improvement, 0: no change, +1: mild deterioration, +2: much deterioration, +3: very much deterioration). A negative score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the QUICK Questionnaire (QQ) Score From Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The QQ is a self-administered questionnaire that includes 19 wearing-off (WO) symptoms (motor and non-motor). A positive answer to each of the 19 symptoms is given by patients if they presented with a symptom and the symptom disappeared after the next drug dose. Two positive answers are diagnostic of wearing-off (WO). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in the UPDRS Part IV (Complications of Therapy) Score From Baseline to Month 3</title>
          <description>Part IV of the UPDRS measures complications the patient may be experiencing with therapy and was only collected at and after the visit at which the first dyskinesia or episode of wearing-off was recorded. Part IV is composed of 3 sections and 11 items: A (32-35, dyskinesia), B (36-39, clinical fluctuations, C (40-42, other complications) (total score 0-23, calculated as the sum of the individual items). A lower total score indicates greater symptom control. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Total Score From Baseline to Month 3</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is an instrument used to assess quality of life in individuals with Parkinson’s disease. The questionnaire provides scores on eight scales: Mobility, activities of daily living, emotions, stigma, social support, cognitions, communication, and bodily discomfort. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The total score can range from 39 to 195. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A positive change score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The QQ is a self-administered questionnaire that includes 19 wearing-off (WO) symptoms (motor and non-motor). A positive answer to each of the 19 symptoms is given by patients if they presented with a symptom and the symptom disappeared after the next drug dose. Two positive answers are diagnostic of wearing-off (WO). A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
