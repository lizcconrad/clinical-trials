             allowed in the study

          -  Patients who suffer from longstanding stable hypothyroid disease, well treated
             substitution are allowed to be included including hypothyroidism as a sequelae to

             hypotension (clinical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension associated with a decline ≥
             20 mm Hg in systolic BP at one minute after standing compared with the previous supine
             systolic BP obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest) at screening visit
