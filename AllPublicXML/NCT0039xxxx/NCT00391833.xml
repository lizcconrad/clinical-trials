      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline of memory and intellectual
      abilities, interfering activity in daily living, the overall quality of life, and ultimately
      leads to death. Although pharmacologic treatments are currently approved for treating mild-
      to moderate AD using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACEI) or memantine, the NMDA
      antagonist, for the advanced stage of AD, the therapeutic efficacies need to be further
      improved.

      For millennia, ginseng or its components have been used to treat medical conditions, and the
      pharmacologic effects have been demonstrated in cardiovascular, endocrine and immune system
      (Attele et al., 1999). In means of memory and learning, a number of studies suggested that
      ginseng can attenuate learning deficits of damaged or ageing brains in rodent models (Kennedy
      et al., 2003; Zhao and McDaniel, 1998; Nitta et al., 1995). In studies with human healthy
      participants, correspondently, both acute and chronic dosage of ginseng increased the
      cognitive performance (Kennedy et al., 2001; Kennedy et al., 2003; D’Angelo et al., 1986;
      Sorensen and Sonne, 1996).

      In this study, we we will investigate the contribution of ginseng treatment in increasing the
      cognitive improvement of AD patients. In addition, we will test various bio-markers and
      hematopoietic progenitor cell count in those included patients using their blood samples.
      Patients with AD as well as memory decline will be included
