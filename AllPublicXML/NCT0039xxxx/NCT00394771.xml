    <textblock>
      This is a 4-arm study to evaluate and compare bleeding patterns between three different doses
      of DR-1031 oral contraceptive with Seasonale oral contraceptive. Study participants will
      receive physical and gynecological exams, including Pap smear. During the study, all
      participants will be required to complete a diary

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized study is designed to
      evaluate and compare bleeding patterns in women using one of three different doses of DR-1031
      oral contraceptive with Seasonale oral contraceptive.

      Patients who meet all study entrance criteria will be randomly assigned to one of four
      treatment groups,

      The overall study duration will be approximately 9 months; this will include a screening
      period of approximately 4 weeks, a run-in period of 4 weeks, a treatment period of
      approximately 6 months (two,91-day cycles) and a final study visit occurring 14-21 days after
      completion of study drug.
