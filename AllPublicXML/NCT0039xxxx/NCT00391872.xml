  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a new, reversible binding, anti-platelet medication. Anti-platelet medications
      work to prevent the formation of blood clots. Ticagrelor is being developed as a treatment
      for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS is a term that is used to describe both
      heart attacks in progress or the imminent threat of a heart attack. ACS is usually caused by
      the formation of a blood clot in an artery that partially or totally blocks the blood supply
      to a portion of the heart muscle. Ticagrelor will be compared with clopidogrel to determine
      which drug, when either is used in conjunction with aspirin, is better at reducing deaths
      from vascular causes, future heart attacks and/or strokes in patients with ACS.

      <recruitment_details>The first participant was enrolled on 11 October 2006 and the last participant completed the study on 27 February 2009. Study participants were randomized from 855 centers in 43 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants will already be hospitalized due to their acute condition, and must be enrolled and randomized within 24 hours of the onset of their most recent cardiac ischemic symptoms. Randomization should take place as soon as possible after presentation.</pre_assignment_details>
