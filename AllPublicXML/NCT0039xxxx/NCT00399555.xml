  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many improvements in the care of children with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome (HLHS). This has helped these children survive longer. Because these children now
      live longer, researchers are recognizing developmental disabilities (the children are behind
      in their thinking or physical activity) in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The
      purpose of this research study is to help the investigators learn more about developmental
      disabilities in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

      During the time of your child's first surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a monitor
      was placed on your child's forehead to measure the oxygen levels in the brain. This monitor
      is called Near Infrared Spectrometry (NIRS). The researchers involved in this study want to
      know if oxygen levels in the blood vessels of the brain have any effect on developmental
      disabilities later in life in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The researchers
      plan to enroll 60 research subjects.

      Our study is a cross-sectional, descriptive study to evaluate the developmental outcome for
      school-age children with HLHS. The general approach of the proposed research is confirmatory
      study/hypothesis testing. The hypothesis (neurodevelopmental outcome of children with HLHS is
      inversely correlated with cerebral oximetry values as measured by NIRS in the 48 hours
      following the Norwood operation) was formulated based on a meticulous review of the
      literature, which clearly demonstrates a substantial prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      deficits in children with HLHS who have undergone surgical palliation. The methodologies for
      measuring developmental outcome are highly reproducible and have been validated in this
      population.
