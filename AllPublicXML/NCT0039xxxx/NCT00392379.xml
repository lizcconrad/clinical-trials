      This study will be a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled two-group clinical trial. The
      independent variable is treatment assignment (active 4-mg nicotine lozenge vs. matching
      placebo lozenge), and the dependent variables are all tobacco and ST abstinence at 3 and 6
      months. ST users will be randomly assigned to either the 4-mg active nicotine lozenge or
      matching placebo.

      Smokeless tobacco (ST) users will be randomly assigned to either the 4-mg active nicotine
      lozenge or matching placebo. Both groups will receive a behavioral intervention. The two
      sites for this clinical trial will be the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (central
      coordinating site) and the Oregon Research Institute (ORI) in Eugene, OR. A total of 270 ST
      users will be recruited into this clinical trail. All subjects will be randomized to 4 mg
      Nicotine Lozenges (taken ad lib) or matching placebo. They will be on study medication for 12
      weeks and followed up for 6 months from study enrollment
