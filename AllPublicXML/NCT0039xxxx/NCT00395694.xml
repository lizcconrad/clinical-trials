    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Rash Event (Including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [SJS] and Any Other Serious Drug Eruption) During the Initial 8 Weeks of Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Any rash event (including SJS or any other serious drug eruption) includes: all event terms containing &quot;rash&quot;; drug eruption; SJS; toxic epidermal necrolysis; rash generalized; and events grouped into the &quot;Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders&quot; system organ class per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), including the above-mentioned events that the GSK medical advisors judged to be included as any rash event. SJS, also called as erythema multiforme, is a skin disorder resulting from an allergic reaction or infection.</description>

    <description>The rash events (including SJS and any other serious drug eruption) were classified into severe (rash prevents participant from leading a normal life), moderate (participant's discomfort due to rash interferes with daily life), and mild (no interference with participant's daily life due to rash), based on the intesity of the event.</description>

    <description>The adverse event of rash was considered to be drug-related when the Investigator answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the following question: &quot;Is there a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the investigational product?&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a 50 Percent Reduction in Seizure Frequency for the Indicated Types of Seizures</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Partial seizures are seizures that affect only a part of the brain at onset. Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) affect the entire brain and are characterized by a generalized involuntary muscular contraction and cessation of respiration followed by tonic and clonic spasms of the muscles. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a pediatric epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types; mental retardation or regression; and abnormal findings on an electroencephalogram (EEG), with paroxysms of fast activity and generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Seizure Frequency of the Indicated Types of Seizures</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (Day 0) and Week 8 of the Maintenance Phase (Study Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in seizure frequency was calculated as 100 * (pre-treatment seizures minus MP seizures)/pre-treatment seizures. Partial seizures are seizures that affect only a part of the brain at onset. Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) affect the entire brain and are characterized by a generalized involuntary muscular contraction and cessation of respiration followed by tonic and clonic spasms of the muscles. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a pediatric epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types, mental retardation or regression, and abnormal findings on an ECG.</description>

    <measure>Number of Rash Events (Including SJS and Any Other Serious Drug Eruption) Adjudicated by the Rash Adjudication Committee in Participants Taking VPA</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8 of the Maintenance Phase (Study Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The rash adjudication committee reviewed all rash events from a dermatologic standpoint based on the nature, onset site, affected area, time to onset, outcome, and the investigator's comments to adjudicate whether or not the reported event was a drug eruption. A drug eruption is an eruption or a solitary lesion caused by a drug taken internally, often a result of allergic sensitization.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Monocyte Values Outside the Normal Range (Shifted High) at Weeks 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Monocytes are a type of white blood cell (WBC; typically comprising 2%-8% of total WBCs) and are a part of the immune system. The normal range for adults is 0.2 to 0.95 * 10^3 cells per microliter (µL); the normal range for adolescents is 0 to 0.8 * 10^3 cells per µL. The monocyte count may increase during chronic inflammation, stress response, immune-mediated disease, viral fever, etc. The percentage of participants (par.) with monocyte values outside the normal range was calculated as 100 * (number of par. with monocyte values outside the normal range) divided by the total number of par.</description>

          <description>Adult participants were initiated on 12.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of BW430C (lamotrigine [LTG]) (as a tablet taken orally) once daily. Participants had their dose increased to an optimal maintenance dose (escalation phase) and then were maintained at that dose for 8 weeks (maintenance phase [MP]). During the 8-week MP, participants received up to a maximum of 200 mg/day for adults taking valproeic acid (VPA) or up to a maximum of 400 mg/day for adults not taking VPA plus an inducer of LTG glucuronidation. Participants who achieved adequate seizure control at the end of the MP and for whom no alternative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were available were allowed to continue treatment with LTG until the drug is marketed (continuation phase).</description>

        <description>Partial seizures are seizures that affect only a part of the brain at onset. Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) affect the entire brain and are characterized by a generalized involuntary muscular contraction and cessation of respiration followed by tonic and clonic spasms of the muscles. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a pediatric epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types; mental retardation or regression; and abnormal findings on an electroencephalogram (EEG), with paroxysms of fast activity and generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges.</description>

          <title>Adults: LTG</title>
          <description>Adult participants were initiated on 12.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of BW430C (lamotrigine [LTG]) (as a tablet taken orally) once daily. Participants had their dose increased to an optimal maintenance dose (escalation phase) and then were maintained at that dose for 8 weeks (maintenance phase [MP]). During the 8-week MP, participants received up to a maximum of 200 mg/day for adults taking valproeic acid (VPA) or up to a maximum of 400 mg/day for adults not taking VPA plus an inducer of LTG glucuronidation. Participants who achieved adequate seizure control at the end of the MP and for whom no alternative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were available were allowed to continue treatment with LTG until the drug is marketed (continuation phase).</description>

          <title>Adolescents: LTG</title>
          <description>Adolescent participants were initiated on 0.15 mg/kilogram (kg)/day. Participants had their dose increased to an optimal maintenance dose (escalation phase) and then were maintained at that dose for 8 weeks (MP). During the 8-week MP, adolescents taking VPA alone received up to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day, adolescents taking VPA with an inducer of LTG glucuronidation received up to a maximum of 5 mg/kg/day, and adolescents not taking VPA with an inducer of LTG glucuronidation received up to a maximum of 15 mg/kg/day. Participants who achieved adequate seizure control at the end of the MP and for whom no alternative AEDs were available were allowed to continue treatment with BW430C until the drug is marketed (continuation phase).</description>
