  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the articular surface replacement (ASR) prosthesis
      placed by the conventional positioning method and the ASR prosthesis placed by 'computer
      assisted surgery' (CAS) in variation between pre planned position of the femoral component
      and the actual position of the femoral component of the prosthesis. The hypothesis is that
      this variation is larger with the conventional positioning method than when CAS is used.

    <textblock>
      For patients who suffer from end stage of osteoarthritis of the hip, a joint replacement
      could result in an obvious improvement of the quality of life. However, because of the life
      expectation and high level of activity of young and active patients, the conventional total
      hip replacement does not offer an optimal solution.

      An alternative to a total hip replacement in young and active patients is the resurfacing hip
      prostheses. The articular surface replacement (ASR) hip prostheses can be placed by the
      conventional positioning method and by using 'computer assisted surgery' (CAS). The
      hypothesis is that the positioning of the femoral component by the conventional positioning
      method will show a larger variation between pre planned and actual position than when CAS is
      used.

      This study will compare the results of those who had an ASR prosthesis placed by the
      conventional positioning method with those patients in whom the ASR prosthesis was placed
      using CAS.
