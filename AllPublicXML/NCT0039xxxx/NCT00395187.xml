  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which is the
      therapeutic use of photochemical reactions, in treating hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a
      chronic inflammatory condition affecting areas of skin with sweat glands. We expect that PDT
      is effective in treating HS.

      This study will investigate the efficacy of PDT using aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and either
      blue light or intense pulsed light on active lesions of HS. We will attempt to validate the
      success noted in a previously published case series using PDT with ALA and blue light (Gold,
      Bridges et al). We will evaluate effect of treatment by number of lesions, global disease
      severity, and patient self-assessment with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

      Detailed informed consent will be obtained prior to treatment at study enrollment. The first
      four treatment visits will involve clinical evaluation, photography and application of the
      ALA to the affected area. After a 45 minute incubation period, the area will be washed and
      then treated with either blue light or intense pulsed light (IPL), depending on body
      area/investigator choice. One and three-month follow-up visits will involve evaluation of
      efficacy, but no active treatment.
