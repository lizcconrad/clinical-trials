  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although injection drug users (IDUs) account for over 70% of new cases of HCV infection/year,
      there is no consensus on how to approach their medical care. In some Canadian centres,
      patients must be free of recreational drug use for as long as 6 months before being
      considered for HCV therapy. This is not consistent with current North American guidelines.
      Over the past 5 years, we have developed a successful program for the treatment of HIV
      infection in this population, based on a multi-disciplinary comprehensive program including
      directly observed therapy (DOT). Even though the duration of therapy for HCV is shorter than
      for HIV (as little as 6 months vs. life-long), we must address issues of administration of a
      weekly injection (interferon), twice daily pills (ribavirin) and the risk of significant side
      effects (including anxiety and depression) to successfully expand our program to treat this
      disease. Further, it may be that even if the program is successful, its benefits will be
      negated by HCV re-infection due to continued risk behaviors for its transmission.

      We will determine the HCV infection status of potential study subjects within a cohort of
      2,000 IDUs receiving care in our centres (Appendix 1). For those who carry HCV antibodies
      (expected n = 1800), a test for HCV viremia and genotype will be performed. By these
      evaluations, we expect up to 600 individuals to be viremic and carry HCV genotype 2 or 3.
      Within this group, 200 consecutive patients (100/study strategy) will receive therapy for
      HCV, based on their eligibility to do so according to Provincial guidelines for the
      reimbursement of medications. Patient allocation will be according to the study site where
      they regularly receive care. At two sites, patients will be enrolled in a DOT program with
      on-site full-time nursing and counseling support (high intensity, 50 patients/site). At the
      other two sites, patients will receive medication on a weekly basis and will have access to
      part-time nursing and counseling support (low intensity, 50 patients/site). Medical follow-up
      will be according to current clinical standards, and the primary endpoint of the study will
      be the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) six months after completion of treatment.
      Within the study described above, we will use standardized methodologies to calculate the
      total health care costs related to the treatment of HCV infection. We will also assess the
      effect of treatment on the quality of life (QoL) of study participants.
