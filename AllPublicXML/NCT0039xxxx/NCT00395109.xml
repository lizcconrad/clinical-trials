  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer will be imaged with PET scan and CT scan in order to
      determine areas of the tumour that are hypoxic.

      It is hypothesized that PET /CT will provide information on hypoxia of the tumors and tumor
      regions in head and neck cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer greater than 3 cm will imaged with PET scan and CT scan in
      order to determine areas of the tumour that are hypoxic. Following surgical removal, samples
      of the tumour will be evaluated for the expression of hypoxia genes. The preoperative imaging
      will be compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot; measures of hypoxic response at the level of gene
      transcription and a new hypoxia marker with the hypoxyprobe detection system (pimonidazole).

      Hypothesis: FDG/PET visualization of glycolysis combined with CT visualization of blood flow
      will correlate with cellular response to hypoxic stress in head and neck tumors and
      intra-tumor regions. Measurement of relative levels of mRNAs encoding hypoxia response genes
      will be performed in cells microdissected from the surgical samples. Good correlation between
      imaging signals and direct molecular measures of hypoxic response in primary human tumors
      will provide information necessary to develop treatment strategies that employ targeted,
      increased radiation to hypoxic tumors.

      Pimonidazole is an exogenous nitro-imidazole marker, which can be detected through
      immunohistochemical analysis of frozen sections. It detects cellular hypoxia upon becoming
      reduced in cells with low oxygen tension, a property that can be detected through antibody
      mediated detection of the reduced form. It has also shown to reliably and specifically stain
      hypoxic regions within the tumor, and to correlate well with patient prognosis and treatment
      outcome.
