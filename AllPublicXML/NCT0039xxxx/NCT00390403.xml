      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gossypol and temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Gossypol may help
      temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Gossypol may also
      make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving gossypol and temozolomide
      together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gossypol when given
      together with temozolomide with or without radiation therapy in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gossypol (AT-101) when administered with
           radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the MTD of gossypol when administered with adjuvant TMZ after standard RT and
           concurrent TMZ in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of these treatment regimens.

        -  Assess and describe the pharmacokinetics of gossypol.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activities of these regimens.

        -  Determine the relationship between these regimens and cellular and molecular features
           identified in tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study of gossypol.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients who participate in group I are NOT
      eligible for group II.

        -  Group I: Patients receive oral gossypol and undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
           week for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive oral temozolomide once daily for up to 6
           weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Group II: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and oral gossypol once daily on
           days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients per treatment group receive escalating doses of gossypol until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 or
      3 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Tumor tissue
      samples are examined for biomarkers including, but not limited to, Bcl-2 family protein
      expression (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, MCl-1, Bax, Bak, and BH3 domain), MGMT gene methylation
      status, and gene expression array.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
