  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main focus of this pilot study is to construct a fairly complete protein profile of the
      epidermis. This will allow us to study how the epidermis responds to external stressors such
      as ultra-violet. We hypothesize that by using the cutting edge technology, proteomics, we
      will be able to construct a fairly complete profile of different epidermal cells
      (keratinocytes, epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs), melanocytes, Langerhans cell,...etc) of normal
      and ultraviolet (UV) irradiated skin.

      We will investigate the changes of the epidermal cell proteome after UV irradiation to the
      forearms of healthy young male volunteers. Knowledge of specific molecular markers may
      provide knowledge of basic biological systems and possibly targeted therapy of inflammation.

      By using combined proteomic methodologies we will be able to quantify protein changes at
      cytoplasmic and membrane protein levels of epidermal cells in normal vs. irradiated skins.

      This study may allow us to obtain fairly comprehensive profile of membrane integrated and
      cytoplasmic proteins of epidermal cell populations which will facilitate our understand of
      biological responses to UV irradiation.
