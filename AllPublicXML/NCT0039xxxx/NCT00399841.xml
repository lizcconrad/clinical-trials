  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and patient preference for
      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using the Precision device with the electrode array placed at
      T7 versus placement at T8. Eligible patients will have chronic intractable pain in the back
      or lower extremities and will have independently elected SCS as the next line of therapy.
      There is some anecdotal evidence that the coverage of the paresthesia resulting from T7
      placement is preferable to that obtained by the more commonly used T8 placement but there has
      been no study to support this observation.

    <textblock>
      The conventional implantation of the spinal cord stimulator calls for dual percutaneous leads
      placed at T8-T9 vertebral levels. Recently published studies as outlined in a letter to the
      editor of Neuromodulation suggest that a &quot;well placed single lead will generally perform
      better than a dual lead.&quot; Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest that lead placement at T7
      will capture axial back pain with greater success compared to lead placement at alternative
      sites.

      This study aims to achieve better pain treatment and paresthesia coverage by placing a single
      lead at T7.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have sensory loss in the low back or lower extremity as the primary complaint.

          -  Have any significant medical condition that is likely to interfere with study
             procedures or likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints.

          -  Have participated in any investigational drug or device trial in the last 4 weeks or
             plan to participate in any other study during the year.
