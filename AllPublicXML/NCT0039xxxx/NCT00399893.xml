      The purpose of this study is to investigate over a 6 month period the effect of octreotide
      therapy on food intake, sense of hunger, body weight, body composition, efficiency of burning
      calories, biomarkers of weight regulation and growth hormone markers in children and young
      Adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome(PWS).

    <textblock>
      Obesity continues to be a prevalent health concern affecting every race of the American
      population. According to data from the World Health Organization, 54% of U.S. adults are
      overweight (body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2 ) and 22% are obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2) (1). In
      addition, 25% of U.S. children are overweight or obese (1). Studies show that obese children
      are likely to become obese adults (2-5). Also, recent studies report significant years of
      life lost due to the impact of being an obese adult (6, 7). Thus, insights into the
      pathogenesis of childhood obesity and preventative measures are needed to combat the
      inevitable increase in worldwide incidence of obesity and its associated co-morbidities.
      Recent studies have identified a new gastroenteric hormone, ghrelin, as a long-term regulator
      of energy balance in humans (12). Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid acylated peptide which is an
      endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), a hypothalamic
      G-protein-coupled receptor (13). Enteroendocrine cells (X/A-like cells) of the stomach are
      the major site of ghrelin synthesis, although a minor proportion of ghrelin synthesis occurs
      in other sites such as the hypothalamus, pituitary, duodenum, jejunum and lung (14) (15, 16).

      The hypothesis that hyperghrelinemia causes some of the features of PWS predicts that this
      disorder will be ameliorated (partially or completely) by lowering ghrelin levels. We have
      recently shown that the somatostatin agonist, octreotide, suppresses ghrelin levels in
      humans. If octreotide remains effective in longer term studies, the drug may become an
      adjuvant therapy, in addition to growth hormone, to control the insatiable appetite and
      morbid obesity seen in this condition.
