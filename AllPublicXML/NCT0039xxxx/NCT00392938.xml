      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as PET scan, may help doctors predict a patient's
      response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying carbon-11 acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan
      of the bone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to the bone.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Correlate pre-treatment and 3-month post-treatment carbon-11 (^11C) acetate and
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (^18F-FDG PET) images with changes in
           clinical response measures in patients with bone-dominant metastatic prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scanning results with bone scintigraphy in these
           patients to determine which best predicts clinical response.

        -  Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with changes in prostate-specific
           antigen level.

        -  Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with clinical symptom parameters
           (pain scale scores and analgesic usage scales).

        -  Correlate ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scan response with clinical time to progression.

        -  Determine if PET scan response can predict duration of progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to hormone response
      (sensitive [stratum 1] vs refractory [stratum 2]).

      Patients undergo carbon-11 acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography
      imaging prior to and 3 months after initiation of either androgen-deprivation therapy
      (stratum 1) or docetaxel (stratum 2).

      Pain and quality of life are assessed at baseline and at 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of prostate cancer, meeting 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Metastatic hormone-sensitive disease prior to initiation of first-line
                  androgen-deprivation therapy and meets the following criteria:

                    -  Histologic confirmation of original diagnosis

                    -  Hormone-sensitive is defined as progressive disease in the absence of
                       androgen-deprivation therapy

                    -  Presence of ≥ 3 convincing bone metastases, as defined by bone scintigraphy,
