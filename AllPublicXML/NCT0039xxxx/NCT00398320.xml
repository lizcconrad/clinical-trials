  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of other viable treatment options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors,
      contrasted with our positive anecdotal experience, and the relative tolerability of the
      treatment regimen for colorectal cancer patients, we propose a single-institution phase II
      trial investigating the efficacy of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for patients
      with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.

      PRIMARY

        1. Determine an estimation of median time to progression (TTP) for patients treated with
           bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin

        2. Assess the toxicities associated with this regimen

      SECONDARY

        1. Determine objective response rate (RR) for patients treated with this regimen

        2. Conduct exploratory analyses of efficacy according to degree of tumor differentiation
           and primary location

        3. Determine utility of biochemical markers as a surrogate endpoint for tumor response

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must be treated at Stanford University Medical Center for the
        entire length of study participation.

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumor,
             including both well-differentiated tumors (carcinoid) or moderately to poorly
             differentiated tumors. Patients must be deemed unresectable due to involvement of
             critical vasculature, adjacent organ invasion, or presence of metastasis.

          -  Patients with prior surgical resection who develop radiological or clinical evidence
             of metastatic cancer do not require separate histological or cytological confirmation
             of metastatic disease unless an interval of &gt; 5 years has elapsed between the primary
             surgery and the development of metastatic disease. Clinicians should consider biopsy
             of lesions to establish diagnosis of metastatic disease if there is substantial
             clinical ambiguity regarding the nature or source of apparent metastases.

          -  Prior chemotherapy will be permitted, although the patient may not have had prior
             oxaliplatin.

             by Modified RECIST criteria (see Section 4.2) within 4 weeks prior to entry of study

          -  Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             to 2

                  alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3.0 x ULN (≤ 5.0 x ULN if liver metastases present). Note:
                  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) or percutaneous stenting may
                  be used to normalize the liver function tests.
