  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study was designed to assess the safety and hematological activity of AMD3100
      (plerixafor) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or multiple myeloma (MM) who were
      predicted to be unable to mobilize ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg within 3 apheresis days. Patients
      with NHL and MM were eligible to enter the study if they had undergone cyto-reductive
      chemotherapy, were to undergo autologous transplantation, and met the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      The purpose of this protocol was to determine whether plerixafor in combination with
      Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) can increase the circulating levels of
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) in patients whose peripheral CD34+ counts remain low
      after treatment with G-CSF alone, whether it was safe, and whether transplantation with the
      apheresis product was successful, as measured by time to engraftment of polymorphonuclear
      leukocytes (PMNs) and platelets (PLTs).

      A Phase 2, single-center, open-label study to assess the safety and hematological activity of
      plerixafor in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or multiple myeloma (MM) who were
      predicted to be unable to mobilize ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg within 3 apheresis days. The only
      change to the standard of care was the addition of plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilization regimen
      on the day prior to apheresis.

      Following screening procedures, eligible patients undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 µg/kg
      every day) for 5 days and their peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell count was measured on the
      fifth day.

      On Day 5, if the patient's peripheral CD34+ cell count was &lt;5 cells/µl or ≥20 cells/µl, the
      patient did not enter this study and was treated as per the policy of the study site.

      On Day 5, if the patient's peripheral CD34+ cell count was 5 to 7 cells/µl (inclusive), the
      patient did not undergo apheresis that day, but did receive plerixafor (240 µg/kg) that
      evening and G-CSF followed by apheresis the next morning. The evening dose of plerixafor
      followed the next morning by G-CSF and apheresis was repeated for up to a total of 3 days of
      apheresis or until ≥5*10^6 cells/kg are collected.

      On Day 5, if the patient's peripheral CD34+ cell count was 8 to 19 cells/µl (inclusive), then
      he/she underwent apheresis that day. If this apheresis yield was &lt;1.3*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg,
      then the patient was predicted to be unlikely to collect ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg in ≥3 days of
      apheresis and received plerixafor (240 µg/kg) that evening. However, if the apheresis yield
      on Day 5 was ≥1.3*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, then the patient did not enter the study.

      The next morning (Day 6), eligible patients received G-CSF (10 µg/kg) and began apheresis
      approximately 10 to 11 hours after the previous evening plerixafor dose. If the apheresis
      yield was at least double the apheresis yield on Day 5, then the patient received another
      10:00 pm dose of plerixafor and underwent apheresis again the next morning (Day 7) after
      receiving G-CSF. The evening dose of plerixafor followed the next morning by G-CSF and
      apheresis was repeated for up to a total of 3 days of apheresis or until ≥5*10^6 cells/kg
      were collected.

      All patients, after the completion of apheresis procedures (or after ≥5*10^6 cells/kg were
      collected), received high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation. Patients were
      transplanted with cells collected after receiving plerixafor with G-CSF. However, if there
      were insufficient cells, cells collected after receiving plerixafor with G-CSF could be
      pooled with cells collected after receiving G-CSF alone.

      Hematological activity of plerixafor was evaluated by assessing the number of CD34+ cells
      harvested during apheresis.

Patients received once daily plerixafor treatment (240 mg/kg) in the evening (10 to 11 hours prior to apheresis) for up to 3 days if peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts on Day 5 met the entry criteria. Morning doses of G-CSF (10 µg/kg) continued throughout apheresis.</description>
