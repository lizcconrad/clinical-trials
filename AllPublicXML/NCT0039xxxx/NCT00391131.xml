      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Ig
      NextGen 16% in people with antibody deficiency currently being treated with IntragamP. Ig
      NextGen 16% is a liquid immunoglobulin (antibody) preparation manufactured using
      predominately chromatographic techniques. Eligible patients will switch from monthly
      intravenous IntragamP therapy to weekly subcutaneous Ig NextGen 16% treatment. Initial
      hospital training will be required for subcutaneous administration and then the patient will
      perform the infusion in their own home, returning once a month for a supervised infusion.
      Patients will be monitored on the study for up to 10 months to assess blood IgG levels and
      rate of serious bacterial infections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Males or females 3 years of age or greater and at least 13 kg at enrolment.

               -  PID patients receiving Ig replacement therapy, with a diagnosis of X-linked
                  agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Common Variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with severe
                  hypogammaglobulinemia.

               -  Patients who have received a consistent dose of Intragam®P at 3-, 4-, 5- or
                  6-weekly intervals, within the range of 0.2 - 0.6 g/kg body weight, for at least
                  six months prior to the Screening visit.

               -  Patients must have maintained IgG trough serum level of ≥ 5 g/L during the six
                  months prior to Visit 0, with at least two trough levels to have been documented
                  during this period.

               -  Patients and/or their legally acceptable representative/guardian must give
                  written informed consent to participate in the study and must understand the
                  nature of the study and must be willing to comply with all protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Patients newly diagnosed with PID within six months of the Screening visit.

               -  Patients with known or suspected severe hypersensitivity or previous evidence of
                  severe side effects to immunoglobulin therapy or other blood products

               -  Patients with known selective IgA deficiency or antibodies to IgA

               -  Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment other than topical and/or inhaled
                  steroids and low dose oral steroids.

               -  Females who are pregnant, breast feeding or planning a pregnancy during the
                  course of the study. Females who are of child bearing potential must have a
                  negative pregnancy test at screening.

               -  Patients with protein-losing enteropathies, and kidney diseases with substantial
                  proteinuria

               -  Patients with malignancies of lymphoid cells such as chronic lymphocytic
                  leukaemia, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and immunodeficiency with thymoma.

               -  Patients who have within 30 days priors to the study screening visit,
                  participated in a clinical study or used an investigational compound (eg: a new
                  chemical entity not registered for clinical use).

               -  Patients with any of the following abnormal lab results:

                    -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x Upper limit of Normal (ULN).

                    -  Albumin &lt; 25 g/L

               -  Patients who are suffering from an acute or chronic medical condition, other than
                  PID, which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect the conduct of the
                  trial.

               -  Patients who are not willing or are unable to comply with protocol.
