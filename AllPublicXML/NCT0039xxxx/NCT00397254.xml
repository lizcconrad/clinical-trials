      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a clinical limit (CL) of rizatriptan (9
      rizatriptan 10mg Orally Disintegrating Tablet (ODT) per month) versus (vs.) a formulary limit
      (FL) of rizatriptan (27 rizatriptan 10mg ODT per month) as measured by the number of days of
      migraine per month.

    <textblock>
      A common clinical perception exists that less effective treatment of attacks increases the
      burden of disease across attacks in the form of increased attack frequency, severity,
      duration, and/or treatability. If this perception is true, more effective treatment decreases
      the burden of disease across attacks. There are multiple barriers to effective treatment. The
      triptan class of migraine medications is frequently dispensed in the context of health
      benefit plan formulary limitations. Because of limited supply, medications must be used very
      cautiously. Patients may hoard medication in reaction to fear of running out. Overly cautious
      use and hoarding may lead to greater disease burden.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two allocations of rizatriptan - a more
      limited allocation (&quot;Formulary Limit&quot;) vs. a less limited allocation (&quot;Clinical Limit&quot;) on
      disease burden.

             International Headache Society (IHS) criteria 1.1 and 1.2

          -  Patient typically has 3-8 migraine attacks/month

          -  Patient has less than 10 headache days/month with no evidence of IHS 8.2 Medication
             Overuse Headache

          -  Patient receives their triptan medication under a pre-determined prescribing
             allocation ranging from 6-12 tablets per month for the last 3 months preceding Visit
             1.

          -  Patient and investigator agree that multiple doses of rizatriptan described in the

          -  Patient of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception during the
             study. Adequate methods of contraception are to be determined by the investigator and
             should be consistent with contraceptive care administered in the regular clinical use
             of rizatriptan outside the study.

          -  Patient understands study procedures, alternative treatments available, and risks
             involved with the study, and voluntarily agrees to participate by giving written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has headache disorders beyond migraine or episodic tension-type headache IHS

        or equal to 325mg daily is allowed for cardioprotection.

        Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Propranolol Patient taking either an MAOI ro
        propranolol may be enrolled in the study, if in the clinical judgement of the investigator,
        either of these medications can be discontinued 2 weeks prior to study entry. Otherwise the
        use of MAOIs and propranolol are prohibited during the study.

          -  Patient has basilar or hemiplegic migraine headache.

             pectoris of any type, history of myocardial infarction or documented silent ischemia)
             or symptoms or finding consistent with ischemic heart disease, coronary artery
             vasospasm (including Prinzmetal's variant angina), or other significant underlying
             cardiovascular disease.

          -  Patient had clinical evidence of significant pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine,
             neurologic (apart from migraine), psychiatric or any other condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator may confound the results of the study, pose an additional
             risk, or interfere with optimal participation in the study.
