    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that insulin sensitivity is not different between
      growth hormone - treated subjects who are small for gestational age (SGA) and an SGA cohort
      of subjects matched by gender and body mass index (BMI) who are not treated with growth
      hormone (GH) and who remain short at final height.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with SGA treated with growth hormone in one of the following Genotropin
             studies (89-041, 89-070/071, 90-079, 90-080/98-8122-011) for at least 3 years and
             after having stopped GH treatment for 5-10 years

          -  Untreated SGA (based on birth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviations [SDs]
             for gestational age) matched to treated SGA by body mass index (+ or = 10%) and
             gender:

               -  Subjects born SGA with normal final height (within +/- 1.3 SD of their target
                  height); or

               -  Subjects born SGA with short stature (height SDs &gt; 1.3 below target at final
                  height).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diabetes type 1 or 2, or 1st degree relative of a patient with diabetes type 2
