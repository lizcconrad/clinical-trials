  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologic Oncology patients have several different chemotherapy regimens, and dexamethasone
      is now routinely given to prevent allergic reactions to the chemotherapeutic agents. The most
      common chemotherapeutic agents used are paclitaxel and carboplatin. This combination regimen
      is given every three weeks for a total of 5-6 doses. Each dose is given after administration
      of 20 mg dexamethasone twelve hours prior to and the morning of chemotherapy. Dexamethasone
      is used for its antiemetic effects, but also to minimize the potentially fatal
      hypersensitivity reaction that can occur with paclitaxel. Another commonly used chemotherapy
      regimens is weekly cisplatin given with one dose of dexamethasone for cervical cancer.
      Chronic steroids are known to cause adrenal suppression, but it is not known if the amount of
      dexamethasone given with the gynecologic cancer chemotherapy regimens described above causes
      adrenal insufficiency in these patients. The investigators hypothesis is that some women
      receiving steroids with their chemotherapy may have adrenal insufficiency, and that they will
      have greater than normal chemotherapy-related fatigue.

      This is a non-blinded, non-randomized, non-interventional prospective cohort study to
      evaluate the prevalence of adrenal suppression in gynecologic cancer patients undergoing
      chemotherapy regimens requiring concurrent dexamethasone. Women with gynecologic cancers
      (including cervical, endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers) who
      are scheduled to begin chemotherapy with any of the standard chemotherapy regimens that also
      receive dexamethasone. After informed consent is obtained, they will have peripheral blood
      samples drawn at the time of routine blood draw for (ideally a fasting morning) cortisol
      level at three different times in their routine care. Patients will also answer a quality of
      life questionnaire at the times of these blood draws to assess for symptoms associated with
      treatment (nausea, vomiting, fatigue). A total of 80 subjects will be recruited to
      participate. 40 subjects will be given chemotherapy regimens receiving dexamethasone with
      three chemotherapy treatments in a three week cycle. 40 subjects will be given chemotherapy
      regimens receiving dexamethasone with one chemotherapy treatment in a three week cycle.

        The study will be open to all women over the age of 18 scheduled to begin standard of care
        chemotherapy for a gynecologic malignancy, either every 3 weeks (carboplatin and taxol) or
        weekly (cisplatin). The study is restricted by gender due to the population of interest
        being women with gynecologic malignancies.

             primary adrenal dysfunction, or dysfunction due to administration of steroids for
             treatment (Addison's or Cushings disease, pituitary or hypothalamic disease, systemic
             lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma)

          2. Patients who have received chronic or pulsed steroids within the past 9 months.

          3. Patients with previous diagnosis of adrenal suppression.
