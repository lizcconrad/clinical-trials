  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Oral Osmotic Therapeutic
      System (OROS) hydromorphone hydrochloride (HCl) with controlled-release oxycodone HCl in
      participants with cancer-related pain.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (a medical research study in which neither the researchers nor the
      participants know what treatment the participants is receiving), randomized (study drug is
      assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on
      a medical research study), comparative, parallel-group (a clinical trial comparing the
      response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) study of OROS
      hydromorphone HCl compared with oxycodone HCl controlled-release in participants with
      moderate to severe cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body until it kills)
      pain. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening period (up to 14 days before
      randomization), a dose titration phase (up to 8 days), and a dose maintenance phase (28
      days). The study visits will be scheduled at weekly intervals. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either hydromorphone HCl once daily or oxycodone HCl twice daily
      (placebo will be administered when necessary for blinding). During titration phase, dosage of
      hydromorphone HCl or oxycodone HCl will be adjusted upward or downward to achieve stable pain
      control. It can be from 2 days to 8 days. Participants who complete dose titration will enter
      into the dose maintenance phase and will receive study treatment for 28 consecutive days.
      Morphine hydrochloride will be given as rescue analgesic (drug used to control pain)
      medication for breakthrough pain during the study. Primarily efficacy will be evaluated by
      measuring change in the score of Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire item 'worst pain'
      at end of maintenance period. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
