      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of combination
      antifungal therapy (CAT) of voriconazole plus micafungin versus voriconazole plus placebo
      equivalent as primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematological
      cancer.

      Patients will receive either IV micafungin 100 mg or placebo equivalent daily. Intravenous
      (IV)Voriconazole will be administered at a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for the
      first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. Patients may be
      switched to oral voriconazole 200 mg BID provided aspergillosis response is achieved and
      gastrointestinal functions are intact.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient or legally authorized representative has signed an informed
             consent/assent.

             Assent will be obtained as required by the UAMS IRB.

          2. The patient has a diagnosis of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis and with
             positive Aspergillus GM index (â‰¥0.5 ng/ml) provide the patient is not receiving
             antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, that are known to cause false positive
             GMI

          3. The patient is 18 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is being treated with an unlicensed investigational drug for
             aspergillosis.

          2. The patient has been administered an antifungal agent (voriconazole, itraconazole,
             posaconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, amphotericin B, or lipid
             formulation of amphotericin B) for &gt; 7 days immediately prior to randomization for
             treatment of the Probable, or Proven invasive aspergillosis for which the patient is
             being enrolled.

          3. Patient has invasive aspergillosis but with negative Aspergillus GM index.

          4. The patient is pregnant or lactating. If the patient is female and of childbearing
             potential, the patient must have a negative pregnancy test and avoid becoming pregnant
             while receiving study drug. A pregnancy test should be performed within 14 days prior
             to the first dose of study drug.

          5. The patient has alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST or total bilirubin greater than five
             times the upper limit of normal.

          6. The patient has hepatic cirrhosis.

          7. Patients with creatinine &gt; 3 will be enrolled only if able to receive oral
             voriconazole (specify oral loading dose is 6 mg/kg PO Q 12 hours for 24 hours) then
             oral maintenance 200 mg PO q 12 hours).

          8. The patient is on artificial ventilation, and unlikely to be extubated within 24 hours
             of study entry.

          9. The patient has a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to the
             azole or echinocandin class of antifungal agents.

         10. The patient has previously enrolled into this study.

         11. The patient has a concomitant medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator may create an unacceptable additional risk.

         12. The patient has an active microbiologically-documented deep infection due to a
             non-Aspergillus mold.

         13. The patient has a life expectancy of less than seven days.
