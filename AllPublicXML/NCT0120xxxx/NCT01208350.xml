  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel
      ways of structuring financial incentives to motivate and sustain long-term weight loss. The
      study will recruit eligible employees at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to
      participate in a 6-month weight loss program and an additional 3-month follow-up period. The
      primary outcome measure in this randomized control trial will be pounds of weight lost
      between baseline and 6 months. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether a novel
      financial incentive program delivered through a workplace can effectively encourage sustained
      weight loss among obese employees.

      The study hypotheses are 1) mean weight loss will be greater in all the intervention groups
      compared to the control group by the end of the 24-week intervention period; and 2)
      individuals in the intervention groups will have a lower mean weight at the end of the
      12-week follow-up period than individuals in the control group.
