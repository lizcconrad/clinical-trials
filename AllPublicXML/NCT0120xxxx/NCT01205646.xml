  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal for this trial is to assess the change in PET scans with the administration
      of zoledronate (bisphosphonate) therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. It has
      been established that zoledronate therapy may play a role in delaying and reducing the
      incidence of skeletal events. Researchers propose to evaluate the change in the uptake value
      of FMAU PET scan after the zoledronate therapy. It has been demonstrated that FMAU PET scans
      can successfully demonstrate and detect bony metastatic sites in prostate cancer.

      In addition, investigators would like to evaluate the change in the level of the
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the patient as well as outcome of bone scans.

    <measure>PET Response Rate in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Zoledronate Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PET response rate was pre-defined in Section 5.0 of the protocol based on the magnitude of change in the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), which is measured at each PET scan. Specifically, a decline in SUVmean of at least 15% pre/post Zometa was taken as evidence of a &quot;PET response&quot;. Per the protocol, Scan 2 was used as the pre-Zometa measure of SUVmean, and Scan 3 (1-2 weeks later) was used as the post-Zometa measure of SUVmean.</description>

After that, Zometa will be administered at a dose of 4mg IV over 15 minutes. A third PET scan will be obtained within 1-2 weeks after Zometa administration.
