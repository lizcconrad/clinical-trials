    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed with the hypothesis that combined PV Antral Isolation and
      Ablation of Complex Fractionated Electrograms (PVI+CFE) approach will offer a higher success
      rate compared to the Wide Circumferential Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation (PVI) approach and
      to the Combined PV Antral Isolation and Empiric Linear Ablation (PVI+Lines) approach.

    <measure>Freedom from AF</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from documented AF episodes &gt; 30 seconds at 18 months after one or two ablation procedure with/without antiarrhythmic medications (AAD).
In the CT.gov website and in our protocol, we have stated the above primary endpoint (PE). This was the identical PE used in the original STAR AF I study. The intent of this PE was to present the success rates after both 1 procedure and after 2 procedures separately as was done in the original STAR AF I study. However, this is not entirely clear from the way the PE is stated. It may appear that our PE is the success rate after 2 procedures (&quot;1 or 2&quot; may imply &quot;2&quot;). Since our sample size calculation for the STAR AF II study was based on a single procedure success rate, the single procedure success rate with/without AAD will be used as the PE. The success rate after 2 procedures will be provided as the 1st. secondary endpoint. This clarification is done prior to locking the database and prior to any data analysis.</description>
