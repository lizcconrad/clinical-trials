    <textblock>
      Children and adults commonly suffer from recurrent abdominal (stomach) pain. One type is
      called irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS in adults and children is one of the most common
      and costly health care problems in the US. Some children have pain frequently (recurrent
      pain) while others rarely have pain. The investigators are conducting this study to help us
      answer questions about the causes and treatments, and management of IBS in children.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if there is more than one type of IBS in children.
      If there is, this will be important in deciding the best treatments. The investigators also
      want to learn how children with IBS differ from those who do not have recurrent abdominal
      (stomach) pain.

    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs), in particular irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) in adults and children, are among the most common and costly health care problems in
      the US. IBS disproportionately affects adult women (10-15% in western nations) and adolescent
      girls. Yet, health care providers remain challenged to provide effective clinical management.
      The etiology of IBS is not well defined and likely multi-factorial.

      A Need to Define Subgroups of IBS:

      This study emerges from the claim that identification of patient subgroups will advance our
      understanding of IBS and ultimately help develop treatment approaches. Most studies have
      lumped together patients with IBS into 2 groups (constipation-, diarrhea-predominant) and
      tested whether they differ from healthy controls. We propose that a paradigm shift is in
      order. We should recognize that IBS likely has multiple causes and therefore, multiple
      expressions. We speculate that by understanding better defined patient subgroups and linking
      them to newer biomarkers or tests, ultimately will further the understanding of the origins
      and create effective treatments.

        We are studying only girls in this exploratory study because IBS is more common in girls
        than boys and the results of these studies can be compared with the results from studies of
        IBS in adults where the overwhelming number of patients are women.

        Girls who meet the Rome III criteria for IBS or healthy girls with no complaints of stomach
        pain.
