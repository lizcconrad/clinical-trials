  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepali, and Sri Lankan) individuals have high
      rates of cardiovascular disease that is not explained by traditional cardiovascular risk
      factors. Though South Asians represent over one-quarter of the world's population, there are
      no longitudinal studies in this high-risk ethnic group. The investigators aim to establish a
      longitudinal study of South Asians at two United States centers to identify risk factors
      linked to subclinical atherosclerosis and incident cardiovascular disease. The purpose of
      this study is to understand the causes of heart disease and stroke in South Asians and
      compare these causes to those in other United States ethnic groups.
