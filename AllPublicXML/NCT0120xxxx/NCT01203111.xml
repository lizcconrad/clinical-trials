      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of an intensive insulin regimen with insulin glargine and insulin
      glulisine in terms of change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from week 12 (visit 7) to week
      24 (visit 10).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Percentage of patients with HbA1c &lt; 7% at week 24.

        2. Percentage of patients with HbA1c &lt; 7% and no symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia event
           at week 24.

        3. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and 7-point Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) at week
           0, week 12 and week 24.

        4. Doses of insulin glargine and insulin glulisine: the daily dose (U) and the daily dose /
           kg (U/kg) will be calculated at week 24.

        5. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, weight change will be measured at
           week 0, week 12 and week 24.

        6. Number of patients suffering hypoglycemias (asymptomatic, symptomatic, nocturnal
           symptomatic, severe and nocturnal severe) will be evaluated during the treatment period.
           7-Adverse events.
