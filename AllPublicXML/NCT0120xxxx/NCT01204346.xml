      Mentalisation based treatment (MBT) for young people with co-morbid depression and emerging
      personality disorder will be more effective in a day/inpatient setting than treatment as
      usual.

    <textblock>
      Systematic literature review on outcomes with young people with depression and emerging
      personality disorder showed clear evidence that this group of young people are severely
      hampered and adult outcomes are strongly linked to both adult PD as well as adult psychiatric
      disturbance and lower levels of adult functioning. (Crawford et al, 2008; Kasen et al, 1999;
      Kasen et al, 2007; Lewinsohn et al, 1999) This argues very clearly for the need to diagnose
      young people presenting with co-morbid depression and emerging personality disorder in order
      to intervene and help these young people's struggles as it will prevent poor prognostic adult
      outcomes. There were no treatment programs that specifically focussed on the treatment of
      this co-morbid group in the literature. Several studies focussed on the treatment of
      depression alone and only one RCT focussed on the treatment of adolescent personality
      disorder (Chanen et al, 2007). In adult studies mentalization-based treatment programs were
      found to be effective ( as well as cost effective) in a day hospital setting for adults with
      personality disorder and depression (Bateman, et al, 2007) This study aims to conduct a
      control trial to test whether MBT will be more effective than TAU in this group. All cases
      will be tested on admission, at discharge and followed up at 2 years post discharge.
