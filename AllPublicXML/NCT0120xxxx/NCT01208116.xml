      The purpose of this study is to determine whether non-invasive atherosclerotic measurements
      (baPWV, IMT, FMD, CACS, ABI) are valuable predictors for cardiovascular events in elderly. At
      inception, routine physical examination and non-invasive atherosclerotic measurements will
      conducted on all participants. Then they will be followed prospectively for at least 2 years.
      All cardiovascular and other health events will be recorded.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the world,
      especially in elderly. Conventional risk factors are widely used in clinical practice, but it
      is inadequate and inaccurate due to no direct evaluation of artery. However, invasive method,
      it is difficult to be applied in atherosclerosis screening and only used in advanced
      institutions, is expensive and unacceptable. We are trying to assess the value of noninvasive
      measurements in predicting cardiovascular events.

      Five invasive methods will be applied in the study, including

        -  brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity(baPWV)

        -  Carotid Intimal-Medial Thickness(CIMT)

        -  Flow Mediated Dilation(FMD)

        -  Ankle-Brachial Index(ABI)

        -  Coronary Artery Calcification Score(CACS)

      These indices represent not only different phase of atherosclerosis, but also various
      sections and arterial layers.
