  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to study the use of a Core Questionnaire that included several
      questions from each PBRN (DPBRN, PEARL, PRECEDENT - collectively know as CONDOR) that had
      been extracted from questionnaires previously administered as part of their initial research
      program activities. This protocol was the first administration of this core questionnaire
      with the purpose of assessing dental practice changes that may have occured since the earlier
      administration of the individual questions with the separate networks.It also collected
      baseline data for others.

      The three dental PBRNs had a unique opportunity to measure the impact of research
      participation on potential changes in practice base of the research protocol. We were able to
      examine the effect of participation in research in general to the acceptance of research
      findings from other studies and the effect of association with but not participation in a
      research network.
