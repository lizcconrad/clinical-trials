      RATIONALE: Drugs such as temsirolimus and valproic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Valproic acid may also stop the growth
      of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of temsirolimus
      when given together with valproic acid in treating young patients with relapsed
      neuroblastoma, bone sarcoma, or soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify the maximum-tolerated dose of temsirolimus in combination with valproic acid
           in highly pretreated pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To explore the association between tumor IGF-IR, mTOR expression, HDAC, autophagy
           biomarkers, and sera levels of temsirolimus, valproate, and VEGF-A with toxicity and
           disease response.

        -  To evaluate the ability of selected member divisions of a newly developed North
           Carolina-based pediatric oncology consortium to cooperate in clinical trials.

      OUTLINE: This a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral
      valproic acid* 3 times daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and
      VEGF-A studies. Tumor tissue samples from archived biopsy are also analyzed for IGF-IR, mTOR
      expression, HDAC, and autophagy biomarkers.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      NOTE: * Doses of valproic acid are titrated beginning 3-7 days prior to starting temsirolimus
      to achieve plasma levels of 75-100 µg/mL.
