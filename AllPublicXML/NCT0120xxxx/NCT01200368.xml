  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to receive the following vaccines: Group
      1: 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular
      pertussis vaccine (DTaP), Group 2: 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) and DTaP,
      Group 3: DTaP alone. Group 3 subjects will also receive catch-up doses of Prevenar
      (commercial product of Prevenar in Japan) 13vPnC and 7vPnC will be blinded, and DTaP will be
      open-label. The main purpose of the study is to determine if the immune responses to 13vPnC
      are comparable to the immune responses to 7vPnC and if the immune responses to 13vPnC given
      with DTaP are comparable to those induced by DTaP given alone. In addition, the study aims to
      evaluate the side effects (safety profile) after vaccination of 13vPnC and 7vPnC when given
      with DTaP in healthy Japanese infants.

        <description>Percentage of participants achieving predefined antibody threshold &gt;=0.35 mcg/mL along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 7 common pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) and 6 additional pneumococcal serotypes specific to 13vPnC (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A) are presented. Exact 2-sided CI based on the observed proportion of participants.

GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated. Geometric means (GMs) were calculated using all participants with available data for the specified blood draw. To demonstrate non-inferiority, for 6 additional serotypes in 7vPnC + DTaP group, the lowest GMC observed among the 7 common serotypes in the group was taken as reference.</description>
