  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a number of studies have examined the effects of Tai Chi in older adult populations,
      few have methodically assessed its effects on vitality, fatigue and physical activity. Some
      studies have shown that fatigue relates to negative mood and poor health-related quality of
      life in older persons.

      Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese form of calisthenics that utilizes the body's internal energy
      (chi), mind, and breathing; which may be a useful exercise for older adults in increasing
      their activity level. A twenty-four of Yang style of Tai Chi is a simple form of Tai Chi that
      is particularly well-suited for older adults. This proposed study to investigate the effects
      of a Tai Chi intervention on decreasing fatigue level, and increasing level of activity in
      healthy older adults.

      The investigators research group has focused on the Tai Chi as a strategy to reduce stress
      and improve sleep, and their preliminary evidence suggest it strongly affects energy level
      and vitality. The investigators are focused on taking this intervention into the community
      testing its efficacy. The investigators preliminary data shows that Tai Chi is of benefit to
      older adults; however, this study will test whether their research findings are generalizable
      to community settings.

      Tai Chi-na√Øve participants from Culver City Senior Center will receive a 10-week Tai Chi. The
      investigators will compare this group to a wait-list control group. All subjects will receive
      a packet of questionnaires of pre- and post-intervention vitality, fatigue and health-related
      quality of life. Subjects will also be given an activity monitor to wear for 2 days before
      they start the Tai Chi class and for 2 days after they complete the class, to determine if
      there is a change in general physical activity level.
