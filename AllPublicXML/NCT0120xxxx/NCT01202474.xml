      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the percentage of patients achieving glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level &lt; 8% (in
      patients of 6-12 years old) and HbA1c level &lt; 7.5% (in patients of 13-17 year old) at 6 and
      12 months of treatment

      Secondary Objectives:

      Change in HbA1c level at 6 and 12 months of treatment Monthly rate of hypoglycaemia/per
      patient from the baseline to the end of the study Change in daily dose of glargine and
      glulisine at 6 and 12 months of treatment.
