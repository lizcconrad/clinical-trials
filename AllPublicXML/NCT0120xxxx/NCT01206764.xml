  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 200,000 new cases of cancer and over
      100,000 cancer deaths annually in the World (Ferlay, et al., 2004). It is estimated that
      there were about 15,000 new cases of RCC in the region that excludes the Americas, European
      Union and Japan. Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal tubal epithelium are more
      common in males than in females with an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 75 and a median age of
      diagnosis of 65 years.

      Everolimus (Certican®) has been approved since 2003 in more than 60 countries for the
      prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and cardiac transplantation. Everolimus
      (RAD001) is a derivative of rapamycin, which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It
      targets mTOR, a key protein kinase regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The
      mTOR pathway activity is modulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase
      B AKT (AKT) pathway, a pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers. RAD001
      (Afinitor®) has been investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

        -  directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation;

        -  indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent
           inhibition of tumor cell hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, VEGF production,
           and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells).

      Primary: To evaluate the PFS rate over time.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate the disease control rate (stable disease [SD] + partial response [PR] +
           complete response [CR]);

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR; where ORR = CR + PR) and duration;

        -  To describe the safety profile of RAD001.

        Inclusion Criteria: Patients may be entered in the study only if they meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years old;

          -  Patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma with confirmed clear or non-clear cell
             histology, with or without nephrectomy, and with any MSKCC prognosis;

          -  Prior cytokine therapy is permitted;

          -  Patients with at least one measurable lesion at baseline as per the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. If skin lesions are reported as
             target lesions, they must be documented (at baseline and at every physical exam) using
             color photography and a measuring device (such as a caliper) in clear focus to allow
             the size of the lesion(s) to be determined from the photograph;

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months. Life expectancy should be judged in relation to other
             determining patient eligibility factors such as laboratory results, Karnofsky
             Performance Status, etc.;
