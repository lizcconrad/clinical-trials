  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV and evidence of hepatic disease (elevated liver
      enzymes or evidence of cirrhosis) who have significant viremia are treated with anti HBV
      therapy. Currently the key goals of anti HBV therapy are profound and prolonged viral
      suppression and treatment efficacy is assessed by monitoring viral load and liver enzymes.
      However these do not always reflect the degree of liver impairment or the degree of
      improvement in response to therapy. Sebivo has been accepted in Israel as a first line
      therapy for HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive chronic HBV with evidence of liver damage.
      Viral load should decrease by 1 log every 3 months, otherwise patients should be offered
      add-on or alternative therapy. As the majority of patients in Israel are HBeAg negative
      chronic HBV and in order to have homogenous population we will select for our study only
      patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV. The 13C Methacetin breath test, assess liver
      function and specifically the function of the microsomal CYP4501A2. It has been shown to
      correlate with the degree of liver impairment and with clinical outcomes in both acute and
      chronic liver disease. The aim of this study is to determine the utility of the 13C
      Methacetin Breath Test to follow up patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV receiving anti
      viral therapy.
