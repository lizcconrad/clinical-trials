        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is older than 18 years of age

          2. Symptomatic CAD with chronic refractory angina pectoris classified as Canadian
             Cardiovascular Society grade III or IV despite attempted optimal medical therapy for
             thirty days prior to screening

          3. Patient has limited treatment options for revascularization by coronary artery bypass
             grafting or by percutaneous coronary intervention

          4. Evidence of reversible ischemia that is attributable to the left coronary arterial
             system by Dobutamine Echo

          5. Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 25%

          6. Male or non-pregnant female (NB: Females of child bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test)

          7. Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent
             prior to enrollment

          8. Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluation and can be contacted
             by telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent (within three months) acute coronary syndrome

          2. Recent (within six months) successful PCI or CABG

          3. Unstable angina (recent onset angina, crescendo angina, or rest angina with ECG
             changes) during the thirty days prior to screening

          4. De-compensated congestive heart failure (CHF) or hospitalization due to CHF during the
             three months prior to screening

          5. Life threatening rhythm disorders or any rhythm disorders that would require placement
             of an internal defibrillator and or pacemaker

          6. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as indicated by a forced
             expiratory volume in one second that is less than 55% of the predicted value

          7. Patient cannot undergo exercise tolerance test (bicycle) for reasons other than
             refractory angina

          8. Severe valvular heart disease

          9. Patient with pacemaker or defibrillator electrode in the right atrium, right
             ventricle, or coronary sinus

         10. Patient having undergone tricuspid valve replacement or repair

         11. Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL), including patients on chronic
             hemodialysis

         12. Moribund patients, or patients with comorbidities limiting life expectancy to less
             than one year

         13. Contraindication to required study medications that cannot be adequately controlled
             with pre-medication

         14. Known allergy to stainless steel or nickel

         15. Contraindication to having an MRI performed (NB: Cardiac MRI subset patients only)

         16. Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study
             endpoints

         17. Mean right atrial pressure higher than or equal to 15 mmHg

         18. Patient with anomalous or abnormal CS as demonstrated by angiogram. Abnormality
             defined as:

        Abnormal CS anatomy (e.g., tortuosity, aberrant branch, persistent left SVC) and/or; CS
        diameter at the site of planned reducer implantation less than 9.5 mm or greater than 13 mm
