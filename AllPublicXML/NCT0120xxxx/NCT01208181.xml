  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part (6 weeks duration for each part), randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. The hypothesis is that
      etoricoxib (60 mg and 90 mg) administration will demonstrate superior efficacy compared to
      placebo after 6 weeks of treatment, as measured by the greater mean improvement from baseline
      in the Disease Activity Score C-Reactive Protein (DAS-28 CRP), and by the greater mean
      improvement in Patient Global Assessment of Pain (PGAP) from baseline over 6 weeks of
      treatment. Additionally, the added benefit of increasing the dose of etoricoxib from 60 mg to
      90 mg will be assessed in the second part of the study.

    <description>Disease Activity Score Using C-Reactive Protein [DAS28-CRP] (0 - 10 Range). The DAS28-CRP index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). For each observation (Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 10, 12), components were combined into a single DAS28-CRP score using the following algorithm: 0.56*square root (sqrt) (tender joint count [28])+0.28*sqrt(swollen joint count [28] )+0.36* ln(crp+1) + 0.014* Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity + 0.96. The primary objectives of the study compared the efficacy of etoricoxib (90 mg, 60 mg) to placebo in Part 1 of this study so data for only these 3 arms are displayed.</description>

    <description>A participant overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed with a question concerning the amount of pain due to arthritis during the past 48 hours. Pain was assessed on an 100 mm VAS scale with a left-hand marker &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm) or right-hand marker &quot;extreme pain&quot; (100 mm).

    <description>A participant overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed with a question concerning the amount of pain due to arthritis during the past 48 hours. Pain was assessed on an 100 mm VAS scale with a left-hand marker &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm) or right-hand marker &quot;extreme pain&quot; (100 mm). In those participants who were considered inadequate responders to etoricoxib 60 mg in Part 1 (defined as a participant with &lt;50% improvement from baseline in PGAP [VAS] at Week 6), the incremental benefit of increasing the etoricoxib dose from 60 mg (in Part 1) to 90 mg (in Part 2) compared to remaining on 60 mg in Part 2 was evaluated via average change from Week 6 over Weeks 10 and 12 in Patient Global Assessment of Pain score. Therefore, data for only these 2 arms are displayed.</description>

The DAS28-CRP index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). For each observation (Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 10, 12), components were combined into a single DAS28-CRP score using the following algorithm: 0.56*square root (sqrt) (tender joint count [28])+0.28*sqrt(swollen joint count [28] )+0.36* ln(crp+1) + 0.014* Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity + 0.96. The primary objectives of the study compared the efficacy of etoricoxib (90 mg, 60 mg) to placebo in Part 1 of this study so data for only these 3 arms are displayed.</description>

          <description>Disease Activity Score Using C-Reactive Protein [DAS28-CRP] (0 - 10 Range). The DAS28-CRP index is a composite score of weighted components including tender joint counts of 28, swollen joint counts of 28, patient global assessment of disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). For each observation (Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 10, 12), components were combined into a single DAS28-CRP score using the following algorithm: 0.56*square root (sqrt) (tender joint count [28])+0.28*sqrt(swollen joint count [28] )+0.36* ln(crp+1) + 0.014* Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity + 0.96.

        <title>Average Change From Week 6 in Patient Global Assessment of Pain Over Weeks 10 and 12 in Part 2 Among Pain Inadequate Responders From Part 1</title>
        <description>A participant overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed with a question concerning the amount of pain due to arthritis during the past 48 hours. Pain was assessed on an 100 mm VAS scale with a left-hand marker &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm) or right-hand marker &quot;extreme pain&quot; (100 mm). In those participants who were considered inadequate responders to etoricoxib 60 mg in Part 1 (defined as a participant with &lt;50% improvement from baseline in PGAP [VAS] at Week 6), the incremental benefit of increasing the etoricoxib dose from 60 mg (in Part 1) to 90 mg (in Part 2) compared to remaining on 60 mg in Part 2 was evaluated via average change from Week 6 over Weeks 10 and 12 in Patient Global Assessment of Pain score. Therefore, data for only these 2 arms are displayed.</description>
