      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients receiving carboplatin
      and paclitaxel with or without sorafenib tosylate may help doctors learn more about the
      effects of this treatment on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients
      respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to chemotherapy in
      patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma previously treated with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel with or without sorafenib tosylate.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To independently correlate the gene expression and promoter methylation profiles to
           chemotherapy response in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma treated with
           carboplatin and paclitaxel with versus without sorafenib on clinical trial ECOG-E2603.

        -  To develop a predictive model of chemotherapy response utilizing integrated analysis of
           gene expression and promoter methylation data.

        -  To evaluate whether the NER pathway haplotypes are associated with platinum drug
           resistance and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression and promoter
      methylation profiles, and genes involved in the NER pathway.
