  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether

        -  Paclitaxel and bevacizumab showed improved PFS compared to paclitaxel alone. Recent
           results of the AVADO study report a similar result for the combination of docetaxel and
           bevacizumab. The AVADO study furthermore confirmed the dose of 15 mg/kg BW of
           bevacizumab.

        -  As in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) poly-chemotherapies are frequently used, regimens
           with bevacizumab and at least 2 cytotoxic agents should be investigated.

        -  Docetaxel and capecitabine showed a benefit in PFS and survival. This combi- nation is
           therefore a reasonable choice.

        -  Dose of capecitabine and docetaxel should be reduced to 1800 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 to
           improve tolerability without compromising efficacy.

        -  Paclitaxel and capecitabine is well tolerated and showed a PFS of 10.3 months.

        -  Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 as monotherapy in MBC not very often used b/o toxicity. 75 mg/m2
           much more accepted in daily practice. Better comparability with DBX, if both arms have
           75mg/m2 docetaxel as assumed.

      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer
      after treatment with taxane plus bevacizumab with (TXB) or without capecitabine (TB).

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To determine the objective response rate in both arms.

        -  To determine the duration of response in both arms.

        -  To determine the Time to Progression (TTP) in both arms.

        -  To determine the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks in
           both arms.

        -  To determine the overall survival rate 3 years after &quot;Last Patient In&quot;.

        -  To determine PFS and TTP response rates in patient's ≥ age 65.

        -  To determine the toxicity and compliance in both arms.

        -  To determine the predictive value of serum markers such as VEGF.
