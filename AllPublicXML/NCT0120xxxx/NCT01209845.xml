  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to see if a commonly used drug such as ketamine could help depressed
      ER patients feel better and improve their mood quickly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid-onset antidepressants could have important clinical impact if their benefits extended
      to Emergency Department (ED) patients. We hope to explore the preliminary feasibility,
      tolerability and efficacy of single-dose, intravenous (IV) ketamine in depressed ED patients
      who presented with suicide ideation (SI).
