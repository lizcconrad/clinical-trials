  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single institution phase I study for the treatment of patients with relapsed
      or refractory leukemia aged 12 years and older using 90Y-AHN-12.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dose escalation schema will be used with the initial patient receiving the current lowest
      dose of nonradiolabeled AHN-12 (from 0.20 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg). If a favorable biodistribution
      is not achieved and the patient remains negative for HAMA, the infusion may be repeated up to
      two more times (with a one level increase in nonradiolabeled AHN-12 each time) in an attempt
      of achieving favorable biodistribution.

      In order to achieve the primary objective of identifying the optimal nonradiolabeled dose of
      AHN-12 antibody for all patients, if the first patient at the current antibody dose does not
      achieve favorable biodistribution, the next patient(s) will be treated at the next higher
      dose level.

      Patients achieving favorable biodistribution and remaining negative for HAMA will be eligible
      for the therapeutic component of this trial. Those not meeting these requirements will be
      taken off study and followed.

    <description>The intervention consists of two parts.
The dose of cold AHN-12 to achieve favorable biodistribution through imaging using 111In-AHN-12.
Dose escalation of nonradiolabeled AHN-12:
Dose level= -1 0.20 mg/kg, Dose level=1 0.40 mg/kg, Dose level=2 0.80 mg/kg, Dose level=3 1.20 mg/kg, Dose level=4 1.60 mg/kg, Dose level=5 2.00 mg/kg
Phase I therapeutic dosing of cold AHN-12 at dose established plus 90Y-AHN-12.
the starting 90Y-AHN-12 dose level will be 4 Gy with the dose escalated in increments of 4 Gy to a maximum of 20 Gy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have one of the following histologically confirmed CD45+ diseases. If
             possible, AHN-12 positivity will be confirmed by flow cytometry on a recent bone
             marrow or a peripheral blood sample, if circulating blasts are present.

               -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), primary refractory or relapsed disease

               -  AML arising from pre-existing MDS, refractory

               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), primary refractory or relapsed disease

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) following blast crisis

          -  Age ≥ 12 years

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60% (16 years and older) or Lansky Play Score ≥ 60 (&lt;16

             are unknown.

          -  Source of allogeneic stem cells must have been identified in event of severe
             myelosuppression

          -  Able to give written consent.

          -  Both men and women of all ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing grade 2 or greater non-hematologic toxicity due to previously administered
             therapies

          -  &lt; 8 days from completion of therapy with any biologic agent

          -  Receiving any investigational agents

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia are excluded from this clinical trial

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to 90Y-AHN-12 or other agents used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements in the opinion of the enrolling medical provider.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because 90Y-AHN-12,
             being radioactive, as well as high dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI)
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
