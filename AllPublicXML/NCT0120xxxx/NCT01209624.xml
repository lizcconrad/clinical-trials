    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of latanoprost
      monotherapy in patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG) using a prospective, observational
      design. Visits were scheduled at 6-month intervals for 24 months. Intraocular pressure (IOP),
      optic nerve head findings, visual field status, and adverse events were recorded.
