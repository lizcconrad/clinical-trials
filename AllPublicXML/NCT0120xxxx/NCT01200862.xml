  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 2-part study, with Part 1 being open-label to best determine the
      appropriate dose levels to use in Part 2, which has a randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled design. The study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of BGS649, and
      determine whether or not BGS649 is able to normalize testosterone levels and improve insulin
      sensitivity in obese, hypogonadotropic hypogonadal (OHH) men

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males who meet the criteria of obese, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism defined as:

               -  Patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2

               -  Patients with a morning serum total testosterone level &lt; 300 ng/dL on at least
                  two separate occasions during the Screening and/or Baseline periods.

               -  Patients with inappropriately low gonadotropins at screening given the low
                  testosterone:

          -  Luteinizing hormone (LH) ≤ ULN

          -  Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ≤ ULN

          -  Estradiol within or above the normal range (defined as ≥ LLN of the approved assay)

               -  Normal hypothalamic/pituitary function, including:

          -  Prolactin: within the normal range

          -  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): within the normal range

          -  Ferritin: within the normal range

          -  Patients agree to use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom), for the
             duration of the study and for at least 3 months following their Study Completion visit
             to prevent BGS649 exposure to their partners.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hypogonadism, not related to obesity or as a result of other underlying
             issues

          -  Patients with significant major organ class illness (e.g. kidney or liver disease).

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
