    <textblock>
      Impact of loss of weight on knee arthrosis has not been thoroughly studied. The primary goal
      of this study is to compare the MRI parameters (aspect of cartilage and oedema of spongious
      sub-chondral bone) before and one year after bariatric surgery.

      Knee MRI is not currently part of the investigations preceding bariatric surgery.
