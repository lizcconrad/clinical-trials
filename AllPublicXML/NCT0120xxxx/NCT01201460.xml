      The principal goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of plasma glucose testing in
      private dental practice. A second aim was was to assess prevalence of plasma glucose
      abnormalities in dental patients seen by (DPBRN) practitioner-investigators.

      The specific aims of this study were:

        1. To quantify the percentage of (DPBRN) patients who meet the American Diabetes
           Association screening criteria and to describe the characteristics of these patients.

        2. To quantify the acceptability of conducting glucose testing in the dental office and
           barriers to regular screening, as reported by (DPBRN) patients and practices.

    <description>Patients participating in this study may be alerted to possible presence of (DM) or pre-(DM) or to inadequate glycemic control. In such a case, they were advised to follow-up with their physician for definitive diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis and improved glycemic control may be of significant benefit to the patients' health.</description>
