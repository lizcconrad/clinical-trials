  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clearly a need for further data on the efficacy of biologic agents in the treatment
      of nail and scalp psoriasis, especially in the routine clinical setting. A few case reports
      can be found, but no published data exists from non-interventional studies, such as
      post-marketing observational studies (PMOS) that reflect routine clinical practice.

      The aim of this PMOS is to evaluate the long-term (12-month) efficacy of adalimumab in the
      treatment of nail and scalp psoriatic lesions in routine dermatologic practice.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is post-marketing observational study (PMOS) in which HUMIRA® is prescribed in the usual
      manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regards to
      dose, population and indication, and following the local prescription and/or reimbursement
      guidance.

      Follow-up visits are not strictly scheduled, but rather left to the judgment of each
      investigator within the 12-month study period for each participant. Five visits are indicated
      within the 12-month observational period: Baseline and follow-up at 3 months, 6 months, 9
      months and at 12 months (Study End).

      As nails are not included in the general measures of disease severity (such as Psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index [PASI]), the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) will be used to assign
      a score of nail psoriasis. The scalp, though being involved in the general measures of
      disease severity (e.g. PASI), represents only 4-5% of the body surface and is therefore
      poorly represented. Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) will be used to quantify the
      intensity of scalp psoriasis and its changes during the study. The association between
      general skin and localized nail and scalp, and changes in quality of life in response to
      adalimumab therapy will also be examined.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>NAPSI grades nails for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The sum of these two scores is the total score for that nail. Nail matrix psoriasis consists of any of the following: pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed psoriasis is the presence or absence of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Scoring for each is based on the following scale:
0 = none;
1 = present in 1/4 nail quadrants;
2 = present in 2/4 nail quadrants;
3 = present in 3/4 nail quadrants;
4 = present in 4/4 nail quadrants.
The 2 most affected nails on either hands or feet were evaluated and summed for a score ranging from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 16 (psoriasis in 4/4 nail quadrants).
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value, calculated as: Month 12 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSI consists of two parts: an assessment of scalp area involved and an assessment of the 3 clinical symptoms erythema, induration and desquamation. Involved scalp area is measured on a scale from 0 (0% of scalp involved) to 6 (90-100% of scalp involved), clinical symptoms are each rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (severest possible). The composite score ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst) and is derived from the sum of symptom scores multiplied by the score of involved scalp area.
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Month 12 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. PASI data were missing for 2 participants at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) to Month 12</title>
        <description>NAPSI grades nails for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The sum of these two scores is the total score for that nail. Nail matrix psoriasis consists of any of the following: pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed psoriasis is the presence or absence of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Scoring for each is based on the following scale:
0 = none;
1 = present in 1/4 nail quadrants;
2 = present in 2/4 nail quadrants;
3 = present in 3/4 nail quadrants;
4 = present in 4/4 nail quadrants.
The 2 most affected nails on either hands or feet were evaluated and summed for a score ranging from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 16 (psoriasis in 4/4 nail quadrants).
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value, calculated as: Month 12 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</title>
          <description>NAPSI grades nails for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The sum of these two scores is the total score for that nail. Nail matrix psoriasis consists of any of the following: pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed psoriasis is the presence or absence of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Scoring for each is based on the following scale:
0 = none;
1 = present in 1/4 nail quadrants;
2 = present in 2/4 nail quadrants;
3 = present in 3/4 nail quadrants;
4 = present in 4/4 nail quadrants.
The 2 most affected nails on either hands or feet were evaluated and summed for a score ranging from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 16 (psoriasis in 4/4 nail quadrants).
A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Involved scalp area is measured on a scale from 0 (0% of scalp involved) to 6 (90-100% of scalp involved), clinical symptoms are each rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (severest possible). The composite score ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst) and is derived from the sum of symptom scores multiplied by the score of involved scalp area.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Good Clinical Response on Scalp</title>
        <description>Good clinical response on scalp is defined as a ≥ 50% improvement from Baseline in PSSI score.
The PSSI consists of two parts: an assessment of scalp area involved and an assessment of the 3 clinical symptoms erythema, induration and desquamation. Involved scalp area is measured on a scale from 0 (0% of scalp involved) to 6 (90-100% of scalp involved), clinical symptoms are each rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (severest possible). The composite score ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst) and is derived from the sum of symptom scores multiplied by the score of involved scalp area.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Month 12 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a PASI 90 Response</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with a ≥ 90% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from Baseline.
PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Month 12 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
