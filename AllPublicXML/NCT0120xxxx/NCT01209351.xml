      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of 10 consecutive, daily,
      subcutaneous doses of 4 mg of teduglutide as compared with placebo on gastric emptying as
      assessed by acetaminophen absorption kinetics in healthy subjects.

        (if multiple dose) or within 10 times the half-life of the respective investigational drug,
        whatever is longer, before the screening evaluation. For biologics the minimum period is at
        least 6 months or the time of duration of the pharmacodynamic effect or 10 times the
        half-life of the respective drug, whatever is longer, before the screening evaluation.
