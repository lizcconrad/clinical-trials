    <textblock>
      The purpose if to find out if analgesia with bilateral ultrasound-guided Tranversus Abdominis
      Plane (TAP) block with Ropivacaine 0.5% is better than analgesia with local infiltration of
      trochar sites with Ropivacaine 0.5% in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Our hypothesis is that in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bilateral TAP blocks will reduce
      postoperative pain scores when compared to conventional postoperative pain control with local
      infiltration of trochar insertion sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient ages 18-64

          2. American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status I, II or III

          3. Inpatients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Ben Taub General
             Hospital

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Open cholecystectomy - excluded due to increased levels of pain in open procedures

          2. Scheduled for ambulatory surgery

          3. Renal dysfunction (Serum Cr &gt; 1.2) - excluded due to potential altered metabolism of
             anesthetic and pain medications

          4. Coagulopathy or anticoagulation - increased risk of bleeding from nerve block
             injection

          5. Allergy or contraindication to any of the study medications or anesthetic agents

          6. Chronic opioid analgesic use at home - excluded due to potential difficulty in
             assessing pain caused by the procedure alone

          7. Patient inability to properly describe postoperative pain to investigators (language
             barrier, dementia, delirium, psychiatric disorder)

          8. Pregnancy

          9. Prisoners

         10. Patient or surgeon refusal
