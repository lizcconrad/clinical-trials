      The proposed research extends previous research on Quest® cigarette smoking behavior by
      testing whether compensatory smoking occurs as cigarette nicotine level decreases, and
      whether, as a result, biomarkers of harm exposure increase. This hypothesis will be tested in
      210 smokers who report smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day and have been smoking for at
      least five years and are not currently interested in quitting, but interested in trying a new
      cigarette product. Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) smoke their
      own preferred brand (control group); 2) smoke Quest® cigarettes in progressively decreasing
      cigarette nicotine level (step-down); or 3) Quest® cigarette non-step-down condition, where
      they will smoke Quest® cigarettes in a random order. The study will consist of 4 stages
      beginning with a 5-day preferred own brand cigarette smoking phase for all participants,
      followed by one of the three cigarette conditions. For those smoking Quest® cigarettes,
      cigarette nicotine level will change every 10 days, either in a step-down or random fashion.
      The primary behavioral outcome is smoking topography, a quantitative measurement of smoke
      exposure. Alveolar carbon monoxide (CO), a validated assessment of smoke exposure, and urine
      samples to assess carcinogen exposure, specifically NNAL
      (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) and 1-HOP (1-hydroxypyrere), and exhaled
      breath condensate will also be collected at the laboratory visits. At the initiation of the
      study, participants will view the Quest® print advertisement and complete a survey related to
      product expectations in order to determine the impact marketing and advertisement has on
      beliefs, attitudes and behaviors related to Quest® cigarettes.
