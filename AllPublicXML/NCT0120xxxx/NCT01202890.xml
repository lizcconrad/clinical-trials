    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of combining 3 drugs, Revlimid with Doxil and
      Bevacizumab,and gather preliminary data on the potential activity of the combination in
      patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Doxil with Avastin has several aspects of interest to ovarian cancer
      treatment: 1) independent single-agent activity, 2) enhanced localization of Doxil is
      possible tumoral interstitial pressure via increased half-life (if liposomal egress is
      diminished) and decreased [42], 3) improved Doxil distribution, and 4) likely favorable
      toxicity profile since Doxil's only common problematic toxicity is to the skin
      (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE). Lenalidomide has also antiangiogenic properties,
      with a different mechanism of action than Avastin. Given the preliminary results of the
      effect of the combination of Doxil with Avastin, showing an increase in progression-free
      survival, we are interested in using a new thalidomide analog to maximize the angiogenic
      inhibition. This study will test the feasibility of combining all 3 drugs, and gather
      preliminary data on the potential activity of the combination in patients with platinum
      resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.

If this regimen is not cumulatively tolerable, Avastin will be administered every other course. Patients will be received up to 6 cycles or disease progression, followed by Revlimid maintenance at 25 mg PO q Day for 3 weeks every 4 weeks in patients with stable disease.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  EOC patients must be platinum resistant/refractory (see 1.1 for definition) and be
             considered by the attending physician capable of being treated in this study according
             to GCP.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST criteria or evaluable disease by GCIC criteria

          -  No prior anthracycline or lenalidomide use, unless the dose received was equal or less
             than one cycle and the patient did not progress on treatment.

          -  Subjects must have calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60ml/min by Cockcroft-Gault
             formula during the escalation phase.
