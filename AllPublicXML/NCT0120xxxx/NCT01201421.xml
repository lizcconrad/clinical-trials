      The purpose of this study was to administer two questionnaires. The first, a Dental
      Satisfaction Questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with a restoration visit using
      patients recruited from practices participating in the Dental PBRN &quot;Reasons for replacement
      or repair of dental restorations&quot; study. The second questionnaire (completed by the
      practitioner) was a brief single page questionnaire to evaluate the patient visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was to assess a comprehensive range of determinants of patient satisfaction
      following the restoration replacement or repair to study the relative contribution of each
      determinant towards overall patient satisfaction.
