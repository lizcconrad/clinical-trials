      The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of the pregnancy on the muscles in the
      pelvis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pelvic muscle changes related to
      pregnancy; to assess if the ability to squeeze and relax these muscles has any effect on
      delivery mode and if there are any injuries to the pelvic muscles.

      Healthy women who are pregnant with their first child will be included in the study.
      Information about their general health will be gathered. These women will be screened for
      pelvic disorders at the start and end of study. Three-dimensional ultrasound will be
      performed three times: 12-24 weeks, 34-39 weeks and 4-6 weeks after delivery. Fetal
      measurements will be included in the third trimester ultrasound for prediction of estimated
      birth weight. The relationship of the predicted fetal weight and the likelihood of having a
      successful vaginal delivery will be studied. Images will be analyzed for pelvic muscles
      function and injuries. Information regarding the length of labor, types of delivery and
      vaginal tears will be gathered. The information obtained will be analyzed to look for the
      strength of correlation of variables to the outcomes.
