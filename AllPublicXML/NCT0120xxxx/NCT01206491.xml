    <textblock>
      Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion of World Health Organization listed eight
      classes of chronic disease which will be important globally in the future. And the sixth
      class is &quot;Chronic Rheumatic Condition&quot;, which includes rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis,
      osteoporosis, spinal disorders and severe limb trauma. Obviously the osteoporosis is a
      globally important health topic.

      Osteoporosis draws more and more attention, because osteoporosis has various influences, for
      example, (1) psychologically impact which occurs frequently in many chronic diseases, such as
      depression will appear evidently in patients with osteoporosis (2) patients with osteoporosis
      often lose their social role (3) osteoporosis might induce pain and limitation of body
      function (4) osteoporosis increases greatly the possibility of fracture. Osteoporosis will
      induce adverse outcomes, such as the fall of life quality, the increase of morbidity and
      mortality, as well as the increased abuse of medical service. In this project, the
      investigators will set up the intervention model for prevention of osteoporosis as well as
      falls.

      In this project, the investigators will recruit patients form outpatient services at WanFang
      Hospital. Through the collection of baseline data from questionnaire and bone density
      measurement, the investigators can clarify the risk of osteoporosis and falls in studied
      patients. By using double-blind randomized design, the patients will be collected to either
      one of intervention and control group. After eight weeks of intervention programs, the
      investigators will follow on both groups to understand the effect of this program and to
      increase the bone density of intervention group. The hospital or the Health center might take
      the outcome to be the reference of taking care the Osteoporosis.
