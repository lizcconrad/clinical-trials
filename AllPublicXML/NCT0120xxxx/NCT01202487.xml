  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor lacerations are a commonly treated injury in the paediatric emergency department . Over
      the past decade, standard closure of these lacerations has evolved from suture repair to
      closure with tissue adhesive (also referred to as &quot;skin glue&quot;). Local anaesthetic is not
      routinely used during application of skin glue as it was with sutures. There are, however,
      several potential advantages to pre-treating wounds with topical LET
      (Lidocaine-Epinephrine-Tetracaine), a liquid gel with anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive
      properties. Some believe LET can improve patient comfort, increase the ease of glue
      application, and lead to better healing when used on lacerations being repaired with tissue
      adhesive. This study aims to address the question of whether or not pre-treatment with LET
      improves outcomes in minor lacerations repaired with skin glue. The primary hypothesis is
      that pre-treatment of minor lacerations with LET will decrease pain (as measured on a Visual
      Analog Scale) during repair with tissue adhesive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged 0 to 17 years inclusive;

          -  with a laceration that is less than 3 cm in length (the upper limit recommended for
             tissue adhesive repair by the manufacturer).

          -  with said laceration on the face, torso, trunk or extremities;

          -  with said laceration deemed by the treating physician to be appropriate for repair via
             tissue adhesive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the wound for study needs debridement or suturing prior to first glue attempt

          -  said wound is an animal or human bite or scratch wound, puncture wound, stellate crush
             wound, wound crossing mucocutaneous junctions, a scalp laceration, an ear laceration,
             a wound crossing a joint line, a wound on the fingers or toes, or a wound in an area
             of concentrated hair such as the eyebrow

          -  the patient has a history of keloid formation or

          -  a known allergy to cyanoacrylates or

          -  is presently taking oral steroids, immunostimulants, anticoagulants or other
             medications known to impair wound healing or haemostasis; or
