    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether, when treated with corticoid
      infiltration, certain chronic lumbagos could be explained by the presence of a
      neo-articulation.The primary criteria is to determine the difference between the mean pain
      during the latest 24 hours preceding the infiltration and the mean pain preceding the visit
      S4 (visit 4 weeks after the infiltration)

    after 4 years of recruitment only 16 patients have been included. Due to this low rate of
    recruitment it was decided to stop the study
