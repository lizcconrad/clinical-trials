  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the clinical outcome of two switching strategies to iloperidone treatment in adult
      subjects with schizophrenia who require a change in their current antipsychotic treatment of
      risperidone, olanzapine, or aripiprazole due to suboptimal efficacy and/or
      safety/tolerability reasons.

    <measure>Integrated Clinical Global Impression of Change (I-CGI-C) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The I-CGI-C at Week 12 was the overall impression of medically qualified raters using three separate Clinical Global Impression of Change scales: efficacy (E-CGI-C); safety and tolerability (ST-CGI-S); and overall severity (I-CGI-S) combined for a total score. The I-CGI-C scale ranged from 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher scores indicating worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicating no change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM consisted of 14 questions about the patient's satisfaction with the drug in 4 domains: Effectiveness [3 questions scored as 1(extremely dissatisfied) to 7(extremely satisfied)], Side Effects [question 4 scored as 0(no) or 1(yes);question 5 scored as 1(extremely bothersome) to 5(not at all bothersome);questions 6 - 8 scored as 1(a great deal) to 5(not at all)], Convenience [questions 9 and 10 scored as 1(extremely difficult) to 7 (extremely easy);question 11 scored as 1(extremely inconvenient) to 5 (extremely convenient)] and Global Satisfaction [question 12 scored as 1(not at all confident) to 7(extremely confident);question 13 scored as 1(not at all certain) to 5(extremely certain);question 14 scored as 1(extremely dissatisfied) to 5(extremely satisfied)]. The scores of each of the domains were added together and an algorithm used to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher scores for each domain indicate a better outcome. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events or Death</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptoms, sign (including an abnormal lab finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline appear to worsen.
Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization , cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgments of the investigators represent significant hazards.
Additional information about adverse events can be found in the Adverse Event section.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Efficacy Clinical Global Impression of Severity (E-CGI-S) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Medically qualified raters use the E-CGI-S scale at Baseline and Week 12 to assess the effectiveness of treatment by examining changes in positive symptoms [hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs), paranoia (unfounded distrust), conceptual disorganization (loosening of associations), or hostility], negative symptoms [apathy (lack of interest), avolition (lack of motivation), alogia (poverty of speech), and anhedonia (absence of pleasure)] and cognitive symptoms [concentration difficulties, difficulties with executive function (integrative reasoning), and illogical thinking] in the previous 7 days on a scale of 1 to 7 (1=normal, 2=borderline mentally ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill or 7=among the most extremely ill). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Safety and Tolerability Clinical Global Impression of Severity (ST-CGI-S) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Medically qualified raters used the ST-CGI-S at Baseline and Week 12 to evaluate safety and tolerability in the previous 7 days on a scale of 1 to 7 (1=Normal-no symptoms, 2=borderline severity, 3=mild impairment, 4=moderate, 5=marked, 6=severe, 7=among the most severe.) A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Integrated Clinical Global Impression of Severity (I-CGI-S) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>I-CGI-S incorporated the overall, combined impression of illness severity based upon the E-CGI-S and ST-CGI-S. Medically qualified raters evaluated the patient's illness in the previous 7 days at Baseline and Week 12 on a scale of 1 to 7 (1=normal not at all ill, 2=borderline mental illness or impairment, 3=mildly ill or impaired, 4=moderately ill or impaired, 5=marked ill or impaired, 6= severely ill or impaired or 7=among the most extremely ill patients. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Integrated Clinical Global Impression of Change (I-CGI-C) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The I-CGI-C at Week 12 was the overall impression of medically qualified raters using three separate Clinical Global Impression of Change scales: efficacy (E-CGI-C); safety and tolerability (ST-CGI-S); and overall severity (I-CGI-S) combined for a total score. The I-CGI-C scale ranged from 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher scores indicating worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicating no change.</description>

The scores of each of the domains were added together and an algorithm used to create a score of 0 to 100. Higher scores for each domain indicate a better outcome.
