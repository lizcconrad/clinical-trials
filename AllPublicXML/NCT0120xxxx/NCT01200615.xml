  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we invetigate the influence of the nocebo effect (as part of obtaining informed
      consent) on the prevalence of side-effects. The study is prospective, focusing on the
      connection between what the physicians says to the patient about side-effects to the
      frequency of these side effects during treatment period. We also inquire whether informing
      the patient about the existence of the nocebo effect influences the extent of phenomena.

      In this study the investigators wish to inquire whether the nature of the explenation given
      to the patient as part of informed consent has an effect on the prevalence of side-effects.
      The study will take place in the out-patient clinic at the Shalvata Mental health Center.
      Three arms are included:

        1. 50 patients started on SSRI's will be updated about its common side effects

        2. 50 patients started on SSRI's will be updated about its common side effects and will
           receive an explenation on the nocebo effect

        3. 50 patients started on SSRI's will receive an explenation on the nocebo effect, but will
           not be updated about common side-effects. Nonetheless, they will be informed of severe
           side-effects.

      Following the prescription of an SSRI the subjects will we enter the follow-up phase of the
      study. They will attend two follow-up meetings: 3 days after the initiation point and one
      month after the starting point. During each meeting they will be asked to fill the
      Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist (ASEC)and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
