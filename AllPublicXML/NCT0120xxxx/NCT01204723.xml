  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this application is to test the neurobehavioral mechanisms and
      effects of aprepitant as a new cessation agent for cannabis, tobacco or both.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress (emotional, physical, social) facilitates drug seeking behavior through the activation
      of the HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain DA systems. Furthermore, alterations
      within several neuropeptide systems (CRF, Substance P, and others) also contribute to the
      role of stress in addiction. Central to this project is that anxiety and stress responses are
      modulated by substance P and its preferred target, the NK1 receptor. Therefore the aim of
      this pilot clinical trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of aprepitant (a neurokinin
      1 (NK1) receptor antagonist). We hypothesize that the NK1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant,
      will be safe, tolerable and efficacious at reducing the withdrawal symptoms, cue craving, and
      reinforcement value for both cannabis and tobacco resulting from the cessation of either or
      both drugs. We will assess this hypothesis in the context of a carefully controlled human
      laboratory study in which subjects (N=72) will be randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to
      one of 3 behavioral conditions; a) withdrawn from both substances, b) withdrawn from tobacco
      only, or c) withdrawn from cannabis only, and to receive one of 2 medication dose conditions:
      placebo or aprepitant (160 mg/day). Medication will be administered for 5 days, followed by a
      cue challenge, choice procedure, and then a consequence (i.e., oral cannabis or a cigarette
      or money) also on day 5.

    <description>The purpose of examining the neurocognitive function of our participants on days 1-4 is to examine the safety of the co-administration of aprepitant at 160 mg/day with oral THC (dronabinol 10 mg) on brain function. Tasks used are the DSST - The Digit Symbol Substitution Test measures the learning of integrating visual and motor skills, and the SRTT- The Simple reaction Time Task is a well validated computerized test for assessing the effects of psychoactive drugs on performance.</description>

             point in the past 30 days) dependence on a substance other than alcohol, nicotine,
             caffeine, or marijuana or physiological dependence on alcohol requiring medical
             detoxification.
