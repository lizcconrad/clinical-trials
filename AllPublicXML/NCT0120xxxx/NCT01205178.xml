  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-252263 (Tafenoquine, TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline (8-AQ) antimalarial drug being developed
      by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and
      Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). TQ is currently being developed for the radical cure of
      acute P. vivax malaria in combination with standard doses of CQ, which is 1500 mg over 3
      days.

      The current gold standard for radical cure of P. vivax malaria in many areas of the world is
      chloroquine (CQ) for clearance of the acute parasitemia immediately followed by primaquine
      (PQ) to clear the liver stages of the parasite and prevent disease relapse. The 8-AQ class of
      drugs, including PQ, is hemolytic in subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
      deficiency. The current study will identify a dose of TQ within the target efficacious dose
      range that has a hemolytic effect similar to or less than PQ 15 mg OD x 14 days (i.e. ≤
      25-30% hemoglobin decline in WHO class III G6PD-deficient subjects).
