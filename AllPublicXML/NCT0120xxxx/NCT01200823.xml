  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) is
      conducting a variety of laboratory research experiments that require blood, bone marrow,
      urine, stool, and/or tissue samples from patients with a diagnosis of an immunologic,
      autoimmune, or inflammatory disorder, as well as from their healthy relatives. Donated
      samples will be sent to the CHI laboratory at the National Institutes of Health to be used in
      research that may provide more information on the changes in the immune system caused by
      these specific disorders.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood, leukapheresis cells, bone marrow, urine, stool, cheek swab, and tissue
      samples from patients with immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, as well as from family
      members, for ongoing exploratory research studies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have been diagnosed with an immune-mediated or
           inflammatory disease, or have signs or symptoms of an immune or inflammatory disease
           without a formal diagnosis.

        -  Immediate family members (parent, child, sibling, grandchild) of the above mentioned
           individuals.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a complete medical history, physical examination, and
           blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants will provide blood, urine, stool, cheek swab, and tissue samples as
           required by the study researchers.

        -  Participants who have immune or inflammatory diseases will also provide blood and bone
           marrow samples collected through biopsies and leukapheresis (to collect specific blood
           cells).

        -  Adult relatives will provide additional samples through more invasive procedures such as
           leukapheresis and bone marrow biopsies. Child relatives (between 2 and 18 years of age)
           will not undergo these invasive procedures.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      BACKGROUND

      Clinical investigators in the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory
      Diseases (CHI) study the pathophysiology of a wide variety of immune-mediated and
      inflammatory diseases. One of the goals of the CHI is to better understand these diseases and
      to refine therapeutic approaches used in their management based on knowledge of the
      underlying pathophysiologies. This requires samples from patients with immune-mediated and
      inflammatory diseases for such clinical and laboratory assessments. Collection of samples
      from family members is necessary to identify genetic components of specific conditions.

      We expect the great majority of publications from the Center for Human Immunology,
      Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) over the next several decades will be generated
      from exploratory laboratory research studies done using blood and bone marrow and other
      tissue samples from such patients and their family members. These publications are expected
      to number in the hundreds. Ongoing and future research projects depend on the ready
      availability of samples of blood, tissue, leukapheresed cells, and bone marrow from patients
      for in vitro studies.

      OBJECTIVE

      To provide a mechanism for collection of blood, bone marrow, leukapheresis cells, urine,
      stool, buccal mucosa and/or tissue samples from patients with immune-mediated and
      inflammatory diseases, as well as from family members for ongoing exploratory research
      studies.

      STUDY DESIGN

      This study is not a treatment protocol. This is a sample and clinical data procurement
      protocol.

      All subjects with conditions of interest seen at the NIH Clinical Center will first be
      enrolled onto CHI protocol 09-H-0201 Screening protocol for subjects being evaluated for
      Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) protocols.
      Patients who require specific medical intervention will be enrolled on and receive treatment
      under another NIH or CHI Clinical Center protocol or will be under the care of their home
      health care provider. In exceptional cases in which it is not possible for patients to travel
      to the Clinical Center, they may be allowed the option of giving consent to provide samples
      for research studies, including genetic analyses, performed on blood, buccal mucosa, bone
      marrow, and tissue samples sent through their local physician without enrolling onto
      09-H-0201. Information will be obtained retrospectively by review of medical records and
      examination of archived materials and/or prospectively by clinical examinations and
      laboratory tests. The protocol is written for an indefinite period of time with subject
      accrual to occur both at the NIH Clinical Center or through home health care providers (off
      site).
