  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the extent of sulfation of toxic BAs and their urinary
      elimination can be used as a biomarker to predict the severity and prognosis of hepatobiliary
      diseases. The investigators rationale in this project is that the discovery of biomarkers
      specific to liver injury would provide the foundation for a specific and non-invasive tool to
      evaluate disease prognosis, determine patients with higher risk of developing end-stage liver
      diseases, and determine patients with higher risk of recurrence of hepatobiliary
      complications after liver transplant.

      Patients on the liver transplant list are continuously monitored during their hospitalization
      and are scheduled for follow-up visits for 12 months after their release post-surgery.
      Disease progression will be evaluated by monitoring MELD scores, survival, incidence of liver
      transplant, and incidence of complications related to hepatobiliary conditions such as fluid
      retention, GI bleeding, encephalopathy, and biliary stricture complications.

      The investigators propose the following specific aims to test the investigators hypothesis:

      Specific Aim #1: Establish a baseline of individual and total urinary BAs and BA-sulfates in
      healthy controls and patients with hepatobiliary diseases. A baseline reference of the
      average and distribution of the percentage of urinary BA-sulfates will be determined in
      healthy subjects and in patients with hepatobiliary diseases including chronic hepatitis C/B,
      alcoholic liver disease, hereditary, drug-induced, and autoimmune hepatobiliary diseases. The
      investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capability to sulfate total or specific
      BAs, as determined by the percentage of total or specific BAs excreted in the sulfate form,
      can predict the severity of hepatobiliary diseases, as determined by mayo model for end-stage
      liver disease (MELD) score and compensation status(compensated and decompensated). Patients
      with higher MELD score are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe hepatobiliary
      complications.

      Specific Aim #2: Determine the relationship between BA sulfation and the progression of
      hepatobiliary diseases. This is an exploratory aim to collect preliminary data on the
      relationship between urinary BAs and the progression of hepatobiliary diseases in
      liver-transplant and non-liver-transplant patients, as monitored over a1-year period. The
      investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capabilities of sulfating BAs determine
      the progression of the disease.

    <description>Bile acids (BAs), the end products of cholesterol metabolism, are synthesized in liver and excreted into bile, which flows to the small intestine via the bile duct. Most of the BAs are reabsorbed from the intestine into the portal circulation and undergo enterohepatic recirculation with minimal levels detected in urine and blood under normal conditions.</description>
