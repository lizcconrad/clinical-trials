      The study is the WP4 of the EU-funded (7th FW) project SATURN (Impact of Specific Antibiotic
      Therapies on the prevalence of hUman host ResistaNt bacteria). A total of 6 surgical and 6
      medical wards will participate in the study. Sites of the study are located in 3 countries
      (Italy, Serbia, Romania). This WP will compare nosocomial acquisition rates of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
      (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria (E.coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp.) among
      different treatment groups and define the temporal relationship between the start of
      antibiotic therapy, the acquisition of new colonisation in patients previously not colonised,
      and the development of a bacterial infection caused by the same strain isolated in a
      screening sample. This goal will be achieved by completing the following primary objectives:

        -  To determine the rate of acquisition of target antibiotic-resistant bacteria by 1,000
           antibiotic-days according to different classes of antibiotics, duration of therapy and
           antibiotic combination (monotherapy versus combination therapy);

        -  To determine genotypic relation between colonising and infecting strain in the same
           patient and patients' and hospital staff colonising strains (to be performed in
           collaboration with WP1 of the SATURN project);

        -  To study the virulence and fitness of the isolates (i.e. new colonising strains) causing
           subsequent nosocomial infections (to be performed in collaboration with WP1 of SATURN
           project);

        -  To predict the risk for nosocomial infections due to target bacteria after a single
           treatment therapy adjusted by length of hospitalisation and ward colonisation pressure.

      Nasal samples for the detection of MRSA and rectal samples (stoma sample in case of
      colostomy) for ESBL producing gram negative bacteria will be obtained at hospital admission
      and discharge. Patients starting antibiotic therapy per os and/or intravenously will be
      sampled at antibiotic start (t0, within one hour) and at the following intervals: day 3 (t1),
      7 (t2), 15 (t3), 30 (t4). Patients colonized with MRSA and/or ESBL-producing gram negative
      bacteria before starting antibiotic therapy (t0 sample) will be excluded from follow-up
      cultures and analysis. All patients included in the study will be followed to determine
      whether they develop clinical infections with the target ARB. Patients will be followed
      during the hospitalization and afterwards for a total of 30-day from the inclusion in the
      study. Screening will be performed in outpatient clinics after patients' discharge from the
      hospital within 30 days of starting antibiotic (t0 sample).

      Nasal and rectal cultures will be also obtained from the ward staff at the beginning and at
      the end of the study. This group includes nurses and all staff including doctors having
      contacts with patients. These cultures will be handled in the same manner as the patients'
      cultures
