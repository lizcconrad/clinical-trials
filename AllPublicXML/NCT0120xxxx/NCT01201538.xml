    <textblock>
      Acoustic Neuromas (otherwise known as Vestibular Schwannoma -VS) are benign tumors which grow
      on the hearing nerve and can cause progressive hearing loss and compression of vital brain
      structures and even death if it continues. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS. Secondary
      objectives of this study is to evaluate the toxicity profile, quality of life and symptom
      management of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UHN laboratory has demonstrated that targets of Imatinib (c-Kit and PDGFR-α and PDGFR-ß) are
      overexpressed and activated in both sporadic and NF2 VS.It has also been shown pre-clinically
      that Imatinib induced a reduction in proliferation and cell viability, with increased
      apoptosis, in HEI-193 human NF2-null VS cells.Nilotinib is a newer generation RTK inhibitor,
      with a similar target profile as Imatinib. It was designed by modifying the Imatinib
      molecule62, and has 30-fold increased potency compared to IImatinib43. In clinical studies of
      patients with CML or GIST resistant to Imatinib, Nilotinib has demonstrated efficacy with
      minimal toxicity. Nilotinib (Tasigna®, code number AMN107) was first approved in 2007 for use
      in Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic or accelerated phase in patients
      resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Thus making Nilotinib an ideal drug to study in
      understanding its benefit in VS patients.

        Inclusion

          1. Age &gt;18 years of age with either sporadic or NF-2 associated VS

          2. Growing VS defined as an increase in MRI volumetric growth (minimal 15%) on two
             successive scans within 18 months prior to registration

          3. Patients may be either treatment naïve or have recurrent VS after previous surgery/
             stereotactic radiosurgery

          4. Essentially neurologically asymptomatic (with the exception of sensorineural hearing
             loss, mild tinnitus and facial numbness) as assessed by the investigator

          5. Karnofsky performance score &gt;70

          6. Adequate renal, haematological, liver function within 7 days prior to registration

          7. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions

          8. Willingness and ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion

          1. Brain stem compression with symptoms

          2. Symptomatic hydrocephalus

          3. T2/Flair signal changes with distortion of adjacent brain stem and IVth ventricle

          4. Lower cranial nerve dysfunction

          5. Concurrent or previous invasive malignancy, except adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for

          6. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease which in the opinion of the
             investigator makes it undesirable for the subject to participate in the study

          7. Known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drug of similar chemical or biological
             composition
