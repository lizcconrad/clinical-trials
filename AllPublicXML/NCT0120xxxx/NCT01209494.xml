      The prospective EUTrigTreat multi-center study is an observational, advanced diagnostics and
      genetic risk stratification trial in patients with standard indications for ICD treatment,
      with and without myocardial infarction in their history.

      Its aims are fourfold: 1) To accurately risk stratify a large cohort of implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients for ICD shock risk and mortality using traditional
      risk markers as well as genetic markers 2) To find a link between repolarization biomarkers
      and genetic markers of calcium metabolism. 3) To compare invasive and noninvasive
      electrophysiologic (EP) testing systematically 4) To assess temporal changes of typical
      noninvasive risk stratifiers and their prognostic implication.

      In five European academic clinical centers, 700 ICD patients are prospectively enrolled
      (optionally the number of enrolled patients may be expanded to 1000 patients). Comprehensive
      non-invasive risk stratifying ECG diagnostics including beat-to-beat variability of
      repolarization (BVR) are applied, and candidate genes associated with malignant arrhythmias
      are analyzed. Programmed electrical stimulation is performed to test for inducibility of
      malignant ventricular arrhythmias and BVR. In a subset of patients, electrophysiologic
      studies include recording of monophasic action potentials (MAP) from the right ventricle for
      assessment of restitution properties. Non-invasive risk stratifying ECG methods are repeated
      annually. Outcome (mortality, ICD shocks) will be assessed until September 2014.

    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary
      and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Within this group, it is difficult to
      differentiate between patients at high risk with need for additional treatment and, on the
      other hand, patients at low risk without benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
      therapy. Risk stratification techniques have been studied extensively over the last decades,
      but no conclusive recommendations can be found in the current guidelines for prevention of
      SCD. Furthermore, new genetic markers associated with sudden cardiac death were discovered
      recently, however, have not been implemented in concurrent risk analysis. Last, time
      dependent changes of risk stratification assessment are unknown.

      The prospective EUTrigTreat multi-center study is an observational, advanced diagnostics and
      genetic risk stratification trial in patients with standard indications for ICD treatment and
      without myocardial infarction in their history.

      Its aims are fourfold: 1) To accurately risk stratify a large cohort of implantable

      and genetic markers of calcium metabolism. 3) To compare invasive and noninvasive
      electrophysiologic (EP) testing systematically 4) To assess temporal changes of typical
      noninvasive risk stratifiers and their prognostic implication.

      In four European academic clinical centers, 700 ICD patients are prospectively enrolled.
      Optionally, the number of patients may be expanded to 1000. Comprehensive non-invasive risk
      stratifying ECG diagnostics including beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) are

    <description>Appropriate shock is a secondary endpoint. ICD shock is classified as appropriate if delivered for a true ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the VT or VF zone. Appropriate ICD shock is classified as 1 primarily delivered in the VF zone, 2 secondarily delivered as a backup to failed ATP in the VT zone or 3 secondarily delivered after acceleration of failed ATP to VF zone.
Inappropriate shock is a secondary endpoint. Inappropriate shock is an ICD shock caused by oversensing of cardiac or non-cardiac electrical signals as VT or VF, or by inappropriate interpretation of SVT as VT/VF by the device.</description>

    <description>200 patients are studied before clinically indicated (according to AHA/ACC/ESC guidelines) first ICD implantation or ICD exchange. Invasive EP study is performed to test inducibility of malignant arrhythmia. In addition MAP recordings are performed for measurements of restitution properties. Pacing is done for 12-lead ECG and MAP recordings for analysis of BVR and TWA, if applicable.</description>

    <description>The assignment of patients to the invasive and noninvasive EP groups does not occur by randomization or for intervention.
In the noninvasive EP study group, 500 patients with chronically implanted ICD (&gt;3 month after implantation) are investigated using non-invasive EP study via ICD programmer. Programmed electrical stimulation is performed to test for inducibility of malignant arrhythmia. In addition pacing is done for measurements of BVR from the 12-lead ECG.</description>
