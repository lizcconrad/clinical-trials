  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and field-test new tools for diagnosis and hazard
      assessment of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) in people with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and
      to advance the evidence base with much needed information on CMR and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) burden in people with SCI. These data can be used to develop screening guidelines for
      early identification and prevention of CMR in SCI, as well as targeted approaches to primary
      disease management.

    <textblock>
      Unlike current assessments utilizing lipid scores, the new system will be anchored in more
      reliable measurements of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden using contemporary surrogate end
      points of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, coronary CT angiography and carotid intima
      media thickness (CIMT). By the end of the 5-year funding cycle we will develop an updatable
      web-based cardiometabolic risk assessment tool (RISK) that will allow clinicians and SCI
      consumers to quantify risk for a cardiovascular sentinel event (stroke, non-fatal heart
      attack, or death) and will also provide a body mass index (BMI) table adjusted for SCI.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Examine the relationships among surrogates of cardiovascular disease burden in persons
           with SCI and established cardiometabolic risks.

        2. Identify significant predictors of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) that are unique to persons
           with specific levels of SCI.

        3. Develop and validate SCI CMR assessment tool (RISK) based on cardiometabolic risk
           scores.

        4. Develop and validate an adjusted BMI table for SCI.

    <time_frame>1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Non-contrast cardiac CT will be used to measure coronary artery calcium, as the presence of any calcium detected in the coronary tree is diagnostic of atherosclerosis. The volume of calcium is quantified, providing a score of plaque burden analogous to a physiologic stress test. Coronary calcium scores directly correlate with risk of cardiac events, with higher scores indicating greater plaque burden and greater risk of cardiac events.</description>

    <description>Noninvasive CT angiography will be used in visualizing both calcified and non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques. This technique provides much finer anatomic detail and provides an opportunity to further identify latent atherosclerosis risk through the detection of both calcified and noncalcified atherosclerosis.</description>
