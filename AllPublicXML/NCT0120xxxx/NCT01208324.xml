    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of estrogen and serotonin on cognition,
      emotional processing, and brain activation. The investigators will study the effects of acute
      tryptophan (TRP) depletion on cognition and mood in healthy menopausal women before and after
      estrogen replacement treatment (ERT). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the
      investigators will identify differences in brain activation during memory tasks with and
      without TRP depletion and before and after estrogen therapy in order to determine which brain
      regions and cognitive functions are affected by each manipulation.

      The overarching purpose of this study is to further our understanding of the individual and
      interactive effects of the hormone estrogen and the neurotransmitter serotonin on certain
      aspects of cognition and brain activation in menopausal women ages 48 to 60 years. Women will
      undergo cognitive testing and fMRI sessions both before and after 6 weeks of either estrogen
      or placebo administration. We will recruit women who are across the first 10 years since
      their last menstrual period so that the investigators can gather information regarding the
      potential impact of time since menopause on our outcomes of interest. We anticipate that
      findings from this study will help scientist and clinicians to refine their use of estrogen
      therapy in menopausal women. In addition, should the role of serotonin be of utmost
      importance for maintenance of healthy cognition, these data aid future drug development to
      preserve health cognition and/or to treat dementias in which serotonin is an important
      factor. This proposal is both novel and timely as results from this study are likely to
      provide information critical to the on-going discussion regarding the risks and benefits of
      ET use in menopausal women.

    <description>150 subjects will be enrolled in a double blind placebo controlled study where they will be randomized to receive either treatment with 17β-estradiol (Vivelle Dot® 0.10 - 0.15 mg/day) or a look-alike placebo patch for a total of approximately 8 weeks. There will be four fMRI test sequences: two test sequences one week apart prior to estrogen treatment (ET) or placebo treatment (PT), and two sequences one week apart following approximately 6-weeks of double-blind ET or PT. During each test day, all subjects will have their blood drawn at specific time intervals and undergo a battery of cognitive testing.While on the ET or PT treatment, all subjects will be instructed to change the patch every 3.5 days.</description>

          7. Have a follicular stimulating hormone level (FSH) of &gt;30 IU/ml as per hormone testing
             results; women with an FSH below 30 will have the option to undergo an additional

          8. Are able to give written informed consent;

          9. Provide written documentation of having had a normal mammogram and a PAP smear
             (Papanicolaou test) within the recommended timeframe as defined by the American
             College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) - please visit their website for
             current recommendations;

         10. Must have clear urine toxicology screen upon recruitment;

         11. Are fluent in written and spoken English;

         12. Are right-handed.

          8. Known hypercoagulable state (thrombophilias) as per self-report;

          9. Severe lactose intolerance (sham depletion requires lactose/microcellulose
             administration; mild to moderate lactose intolerance is acceptable); Dr. Epperson will
             make the final decision whether an individual's lactose intolerance is severe enough
             to require exclusion;

         10. Use of estrogen- or progestin-containing medication or phytoestrogen containing
             supplements (e.g. soy concentrates or extracts) within 3 months of participation as
             per self-report; foods containing soy (e.g. tofu, soy milk) will be permissible;
             estrogen-based localized treatments such as creams and vaginal inserts will be
             permissible, so long as said treatments do not effect systemic estrogen levels (women
             using localized treatments must have estrogen levels similar to other women in the
             study of their age and menopause status). PI will have final decision about enrollment
             (see note 3 below);

         11. Have a Mini Mental Status Score of &lt; 25;

         12. Hamilton Depression Score &gt; 14;

         13. As per self-report, have taken a psychotropic medication within the previous month,
             with the exception of sleeping aids if the participant is willing to forgo use during
             study participation;

         14. Have a metallic implant as per self-report;

         15. Are claustrophobic as per self-report;

         16. Are pregnant (pertains to peri-menopausal women only).

        Note 1: In the case of participants with full or partial hysterectomy, timing of final
        menstrual period will be determined by Dr. Epperson (the study PI) or one of the study MDs.
        In cases in which final menstrual period cannot be established, subjects will be excluded
        from the study.

        Note 2: Women who undergo the repeat FSH blood test will be enrolled if their levels are &gt;
        30. Women will not be required to repeat all admission procedures unless they report
        experiencing a life event which would impact their mental or physical health and
        well-being. The PI will make the final determination regarding what, if any, screening
        procedures need to be repeated.

        Note 3: Women on localized estrogen treatments who show elevated systemic estrogen levels
        will not be enrolled. Instead, they will need to discontinue use for 1 month and then have
        their estrogen levels retested with an additional blood draw. PI will have the final
        decision regarding eligibility.
