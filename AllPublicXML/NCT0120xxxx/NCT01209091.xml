      Introduction: Many reimbursement authorities use economic evaluation to help guide decisions
      regarding the adoption of new treatments in reimbursement systems. Survival and quality of
      life are often the main measure of benefit used in an economic evaluation - expressed as a
      quality adjusted life year (QALY). In addition though, some decision makers will also
      consider the impact of a treatment on a patient's ability to continue working (expressed in
      terms of productivity). The aim of the present study is to estimate quality of life weights
      (utilities) and productivity loss for women with metastatic breast cancer (Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 positive or HER 2+).

      Methods: Separate surveys will be used to assess utilities and productivity in HER2+
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC). To capture utilities health state descriptions or vignettes
      describing progressive disease, stable disease, and seven grade 3/4 adverse events
      (diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia, leukopenia, anorexia, decreases in left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF), and skin rash) will be developed. The vignettes will be developed based on a
      literature review and in depth interviews with women with MBC in the Netherlands and Sweden.
      Clinical experts in both countries will review the health states for content validity. The
      health states will be translated using forward and back translation. Members of the general
      public will rate the states (100 men and women in NL; 100 women aged 50+ in Sweden) using the
      visual analogue scale and Time Trade Off method to determine utility values. In a separate
      survey women who are currently being treated or have recently completed their treatment for
      MBC will be surveyed regarding the impact of disease on their ability to work using a
      validated work productivity measure (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment) in women in
      the Netherlands and Sweden.

        A hundred members of the general public will be recruited in the Netherlands and in Sweden
        to participate in time trade off (TTO) interviews. In Sweden in order to try to match the
        socio-demographic profile of women suffering from HER2+ MBC, recruitment will be aimed at
        females aged over 50. In the Netherlands participants will be from both genders, and of
        mixed age, ethnicity, education and employment status categories. In Sweden, interviews
        will be conducted in Stockholm, Tyres√∂ and Malmo. In the Netherlands, interviews will be
        conducted in Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Colmschate.
