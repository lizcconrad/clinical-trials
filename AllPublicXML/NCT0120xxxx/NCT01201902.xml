      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the body's immune response to an
      experimental H1N1 influenza vaccine in healthy adult and elderly populations. The study will
      enroll up to 590 healthy adults ages 18 and older with no history of H1N1 infection or
      vaccination. 354 individuals will be 18-64 years old, and the other 236 will be greater than
      or equal to 65 years of age.

      ▶ Immunogenicity(Efficacy) Outcome Measures : Hemagglutination inhibition assay

        1. Proportion of subjects, stratified by group, with seroconversion to HI antibody

        2. Proportion of subjects, stratified by group, achieving a serum hemagglutination
           inhibition assay(HIA) antibody titer of 1:40 greater against the influenza H1N1 2009
           virus

        3. GMT(Geometric Mean Titer) and GMR(Geometric Mean Ratio) measuring by HIA antibody titer

             -  Safety Outcome Measures :

      1. Solicited adverse events(Day 0 ~ 6, Day 21 ~ 27) 2. Unsolicited adverse events(Day 0 ~ 42)
      3. Adverse events(Day 21 ~ 6 months)
