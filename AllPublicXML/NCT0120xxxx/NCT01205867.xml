             minutes in an in vitro screening test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, laboratory
             assessments, vital signs or ECG

          -  Present or medical history of cardiovascular disease which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put subject at risk because of participation in the study or
             influence the result of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study
