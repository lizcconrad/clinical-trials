    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the value in terms of sensitivity, specificity and
      likelihood ratio of the stress echocardiography in the screening of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension in patients with systemic sclerosis and indirect signs of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension.

      Pulmonary artery catheterization (rest and exertion) and treadmill stress echocardiography
      will be done to all patients of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of a 20 mmhg increase in the pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) during stress echocardiography and PAP using right heart catheterization.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Every patient will have both procedures; stress echocardiography and right heart catheterization. A positive stress echocardiography is defined as &gt;= 20 mmhg increase in the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) (between rest and stress) or an absolute value &gt;= 55 mmhg. A positive right heart catheterization at rest is defined as a PAPm &gt;25mmhg, wedge &lt; 18 and pulmonary vascular resistances &gt;3 wood units. Stress catheterization will also be perform and is defined as a PAPm &gt; 30mmhg and wedge &lt;18 mm hg.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of a 20 mmhg increase in the PAP during stress echocardiography and elevated NT-proBNP.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function of the left ventricle (left ventricular ejection fraction) at rest and at stress.</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up every year X 5</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that patients who do not increase their left ventricular ejection fraction at stress have a worst clinical outcome in the follow up.</description>

    <measure>Diastolic function at rest and at stress</measure>

    <description>We hypothesize that patients with diastolic dysfunction manifesting at stress have a worst clinical outcome in the follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function of the right ventricle</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up every year X 5</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesise that in patients with or without pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction is associated with a worse clinical outcome</description>
