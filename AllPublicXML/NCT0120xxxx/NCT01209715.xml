  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators wish to address the effect of a
      glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist preparation on endothelial function in COPD patients
      who do not currently smoke (ex-smokers) by measuring endothelium-dependent (albuterol
      response) and endothelium-independent (NTG response) vasodilation in the bronchial artery,
      reflecting endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation (drug-induced
      increase in Qaw, ΔQaw). With this approach the investigators will test the hypothesis that in
      stable ICS-naïve COPD patients, endothelium-dependent vasodilation is restored with a
      glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist preparation, presumably resulting from the
      glucocorticoid component.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the premise and to characterize the time dependence of the responses, the
      investigators propose the following two aims:

        1. To determine the effect of a medium dose glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist
           preparation (250 μg fluticasone plus 50 μg salmeterol) administered for 3 weeks on
           inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG induced vasodilation in the bronchial artery, as
           assessed by ΔQaw in stable glucocorticoid-naïve COPD patients, and to re-assess the
           responses after a 3 week glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist washout period.

        2. To determine inhaled albuterol and sub-lingual NTG-induced vasodilation (ΔQaw) before,
           and 30 min and 120 min after a single medium dose of an ICS (220 μg fluticasone) in
           stable glucocorticoid- naïve COPD patients.

      For both aims, the protocol design will be placebo-controlled and double-blind. For the
      second aim, only fluticasone pretreatment will be possible because the salmeterol component
      of the fluticasone/salmeterol combination preparation could influence albuterol
      responsiveness irrespective of any glucocorticoid effect. The timing of the endothelial
      function measurements in the long-term glucocorticoid/long-acting beta-agonist protocol and
      single dose ICS protocol is based on the past experience with ICS on airway vascular
      function. Single dose effects were seen within 15-30 min and waned by 90 min (25,26), while
      long-term treatment effects were no longer seen 3 weeks after ICS withdrawal (16).

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the ubiquitous use of ICS in the treatment of COPD in 2012, it was hard to find the
    study population.
