    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat when given
      together with isotretinoin to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk
      refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Isotretinoin may help vorinostat work
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving vorinostat together with
      isotretinoin may be an effective treatment for neuroblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat pediatric suspension
      administered daily 4 times per week orally for two weeks, in combination with twice daily
      13-cis-retinoic acid ([cisRA], isotretinoin) orally for 14 days to children with refractory
      or recurrent neuroblastoma.

      II. To define the toxicities of vorinostat administered in combination with cisRA.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat given as a pediatric suspension.

      II. To describe the relationship of vorinostat pharmacokinetics to the occurrence of systemic
      toxicity.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of cisRA given in combination with vorinostat.

      IV. To describe histone acetylation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after
      different doses of vorinostat.

      V. To describe, within the context of a Phase I study, the response rate of vorinostat
      combined with cisRA in patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma.

      VI. To describe the toxicity and response rate of vorinostat at the determined maximal
      tolerated dose combined with cisRA in patients ages 22-30 years of age at study entry with
      recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.

      Patients receive isotretinoin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, PO suspension* of
      vorinostat once daily (QD) on days 1-4 of course 1, and capsules of vorinostat PO QD on days
      1-4 and 8-11 of course 2 and subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      EXPANSION COHORT 1 (=&lt; 21 years of age): Once the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) has been
      determined, patients are treated at that dose level as above.

      EXPANSION COHORT 2 (22-30 years of age): Patients receive isotretinoin as above and
      vorinostat at the MTD on days 1-3 and 8-10.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.

      NOTE: *Patients less than 10 years of age are encouraged to continue to use oral suspension
      beyond course 1.

             versus host disease; patients receiving an autologous stem cell infusion to support
             non-myeloablative therapy are eligible at any time as long as they meet the
             hematologic and other organ function criteria for eligibility

             another investigational new drug [IND]) within 30 days of study entry or while on
             study

          -  Since valproic acid has histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity, patients must
             not have received valproic acid within 30 days of study entry

          -  Prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval has been rarely observed in adults
             receiving vorinostat; patients must not be receiving azole anti-fungal therapy at the
             time of study entry or while on protocol therapy; additional agents known to prolong
             the QTc interval should be avoided unless therapeutic alternative medications are not
             available

          -  Patients must not be receiving pentamidine therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
             prophylaxis at the time of study entry or while on protocol therapy

          -  Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study as long
             as they meet hematologic function criteria; patients with marrow disease are not
             evaluable for hematologic toxicity; if dose limiting hematologic toxicity occurs in
             two patients, then all subsequent patients enrolled must be evaluable for hematologic
             toxicity, therefore patients with marrow metastases will be ineligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding, or unwillingness to use effective contraception during the
             study; women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
