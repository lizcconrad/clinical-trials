    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that 24 weeks of treatment with exenatide
      will improve the histological acitvity of NASH (steatosis,necroinflammation, ballooning),
      summarized in the recently introduced NASH-score in patients with normal, impaired or
      diabetic glucose tolerance compared to dietary guidance alone.

    <textblock>
      Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a chronic liver disease characterized by insulin
      resistance, accumulation of hepatic fat and hepatocellular necroinflammation, has been
      recognized as a leading cause of (cryptogenic) liver cirrhosis in developed countries. Given
      the rising prevalence of NASH and the associated socio-economic burden associated, novel
      therapeutic options are warranted. The incretin mimetic Exenatide (Byetta®) exhibits strong
      glucoregulatory activities through its multiple biological effects. In addition, exenatide
      treatment has been shown to improve lipid homeostasis and reduce body weight. Since the
      development of NASH has been tightly linked to the presence of obesity, hyperlipidaemia and
      diabetes, this study will examine, whether 24 weeks of treatment with exenatide will also
      result in improvements in liver function in patients with NASH.

      60 patients with histologically proven NASH will be randomized to receive either exenatide (2
      x 5 µg s.c. for 4 weeks, 2 x 10 µg thereafter) or placebo treatment, in a 1:1 ratio. Liver
      biopsies will be performed after 24 weeks of treatment. In addition, a non-invasive
      assessment of hepatic mitochondrial function will be carried-out using a 13C-methionine
      breath test at baseline, and at weeks 12 and 24. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
      will be assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (baseline and week 24) and an oral
      glucose tolerance test (baseline, weeks 12 and 24). Hepatic fat content will be measured by
      magnetic resonance tomography. Liver enzymes will be monitored closely throughout the study
      period.

      These studies will clarify whether exenatide treatment, in addition to its beneficial effects
      on glucose homeostasis and body weight, will also result in improvements of liver function in
      patients with NASH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18 and 75 years, inclusive.

          2. Patients present with histologically proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ascertained
             by the single center pathologist between visit 1 and 2

          3. First liver biopsy was obtained not later than 6 months before visit 1

          4. Patients have HbA1c not exceeding 10.0%.

          5. Patients have a history of stable body weight (not varying by &gt;10% for at least 3
             months prior to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients are investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or are
             immediate family of investigator site personnel directly affiliated with the study.
             Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling, whether biological
             or legally adopted.

          2. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become
             pregnant or are not using adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptive
             measures include sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices, oral contraceptives,
             sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner). A male subject who is sexually active and
             has not been surgically sterilised must be informed that he must either use a condom
             during intercourse, ensure that his partner practices contraception, or he must
             refrain from sexual intercourse during the trial and until 1 month after completion of
             the trial. This is to prevent the possibility of a pregnancy from spermatocytes that
             can potentially be damaged by trial medication. It is strongly recommended that the
             female partners use a highly effective contraception (Pearl Index &lt; 1%).

          3. Patients have participated in an interventional medical, surgical, or pharmaceutical
             study (a study in which an experimental, drug, medical, or surgical treatment was
             given) within 30 days prior to screening. This criterion includes drugs that have not
             received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          4. Patients with evidence of viral or autoimmune hepatitis (positive testing for HBsAG,
             anti-HCV or anti-HIV, pos. AMA-screen, ANA-titer &gt; 1:160)

          5. Patients with inherited liver diseases (e.g. Wilson's disease, Hemochromatosis)

          6. Patients have alcohol consumption (&gt;20 g daily for males and &gt;10 g daily for females)

          7. Patients have decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score &gt;7)

          8. Patients have alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater than ten times the upper limit
             of the reference range.

          9. Patients have had greater than three episodes of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months
             prior to screening.

         10. Patients are undergoing therapy for a malignancy, other than basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer.

         11. Patients have cardiac disease that is Class III or IV, according to the New York Heart
             Association criteria.

         12. Patients have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to exenatide, or excipients
             contained in these agents.

         13. Patients have or had concomitant medication with thiazolidinediones.

         14. Patients have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal
             dialysis or have serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL for males and greater than or equal to
             &gt;1.5 mg/dL for females.

         15. Patients have known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia

         16. Patients are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid
             therapy (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy
             within 2 weeks immediately prior to screening.

         17. Patients have used any prescription drug to promote weight loss within 3 months prior
             to screening.

         18. Patients have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or
             psychiatric disorder) that precludes them from following and completing the protocol,
             in the opinion of the investigator.

         19. Patients fail to satisfy the investigator of suitability to participate for any other
             reason.
