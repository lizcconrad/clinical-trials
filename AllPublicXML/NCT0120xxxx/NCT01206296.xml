    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study evaluating the use of intraperitoneal gemcitabine given
      intraoperatively and as adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable pancreas cancer.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety of intraperitoneal
      gemcitabine given intraoperatively and postoperatively for adjuvant treatment of resectable
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment regimen as reflected
      in overall survival at 2-years, to study the patterns of disease recurrence following this
      treatment, to study the pharmacology of intraperitoneal gemcitabine and to study changes in
      peritoneal cytology with pancreatic cancer resection.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas or periampullary cancer (duodenum, ampulla of Vater or distal common bile
             duct).

          -  Patients without a histologically confirmed diagnosis prior to surgical exploration,
             will have intraoperative frozen section to confirm the diagnosis prior to the
             administration of intraoperative intraperitoneal gemcitabine.

          -  Patients must undergo adequate preoperative imaging evaluation to determine
             resectability including contrast enhanced CT scan or MRI with or without endoscopic
             ultrasound

          -  Patients must have a complete surgical resection to grossly negative margins. The
             margins will be assessed in a routine fashion: the surgeon will decide on the level of
             transection based on visual inspection making sure that the visible/palpable tumor is
             removed with a negative margin. The specimen will be assessed for pancreatic duct and
             bile duct margin by intraoperative frozen section and an attempt will be made to have
             microscopically negative margins in all cases.

          -  Patients who have not received chemotherapy for the treatment of their pancreatic
             cancer prior to surgery scheduled at the Washington Hospital Center may be included in
             the protocol.

          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of gemcitabine in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study
             but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 combination trials.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status &lt;2

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

          -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits or compatible with preoperative
             biliary obstruction caused by the tumor

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal or compatible with
             preoperative biliary obstruction caused by the tumor

          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

          -  creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/min

          -  The effects of gemcitabine on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to avoid pregnancy prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy or chemotherapy for their pancreatic cancer

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with metastatic disease in the liver or other distant sites, intraabdominal
             lymph nodes beyond regional draining lymph nodes or with malignant ascites

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to gemcitabine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine is an antimetabolite
             (pyrimidine analog) with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with gemcitabine, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with gemcitabine. These potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with gemcitabine. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
