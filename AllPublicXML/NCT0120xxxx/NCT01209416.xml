      This study will investigate the non-growth-hormone-dependent metabolic effects of the hormone
      Ghrelin in growth hormone deficient subjects by examining the insulin tolerance as well as
      signal proteins in fat and muscle biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ghrelin is a relatively 'new' hormone that is produced in the stomach and to a lesser extend
      in the hypothalamus of the brain. The actions of ghrelin are diverse and includes stimulation
      of the appetite center of the brain and the release of growth hormone. We have for the first
      time shown that ghrelin also stimulates the metabolism of fatty acids and induces insulin
      resistance in skeletal muscle. These effects have we confirmed in growth hormone deficient
      subjects on a stabile substitution treatment with growth hormone and hydrocortisone. With
      these subjects we can investigate the effects of ghrelin that are independent of growth
      hormone. The present study is a continuation of these findings, as we wish to investigate
      whether the insulin resistance effect of ghrelin is dependent of the concomitant metabolism
      of fatty acids. This is possible by administration of the niacin acid antagonist Acipimox,
      that blocks the fatty acid metabolism reversibly. We have applied this experimental principle
      in other settings with success.

      Knowledge of the effects of ghrelin in general can in shot-sight as well as in long-sight
      have great importance for the understanding of growth disorders from overweight and type 2
      diabetes to malnutrition and eating disorders.

    <description>Growth hormone deficient patient investigated with ghrelin infusion and pharmacological antilipolysis (Acipimox) in a randomized cross-over study with 4 study days. During each visit signal proteins in muscle and fat biopsies are investigated with PCR, wester blot and activity assays for ghrelin, growth hormone and insulin. Further is glucose metabolism investigated in basal conditions and during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.</description>
