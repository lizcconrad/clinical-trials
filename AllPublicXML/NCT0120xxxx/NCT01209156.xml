    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess PBR-111 positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging as a tool to detect microglial activation in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD)
      research participants and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, single-center, non-randomized single dose study to assess the
      kinetics, clearance and cerebral distribution of PBR-111 positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging in detecting microglial activation in the brain in patients with probable Alzheimer
      disease (AD) compared to healthy volunteers (HVs). All aspects related to image acquisition,
      processing and visual as well as quantitative evaluation will be developed, optimized and
      validated (where required).

      Each subject will be required to visit the study center during the screening phase and on the
      PBR-111 PET imaging day (baseline). A telephone follow-up visit will be performed 7 days (+/-
      3 days) after PBR-111 PET administration.

      At the screening visit, each subject (or caregiver in the case of AD subjects) will be asked
      to provide written informed consent or assent. During the screening phase (maximum duration -
      60 days) subject medical, neurological and surgical history, clinical assessments and a
      neuro-psychiatric evaluation will be performed on all eligible subjects. Subjects will be
      allowed to leave the center after all evaluations have been completed. During this period an
      MRI of the brain will be performed. During the PBR-111 PET imaging day, all subjects will
      receive a single IV injection of PBR-111 and scanning will be performed over a 3.5 hour
      period. Each subject will have a telephone follow-up 7 days (+/- 3 days) thereafter to assess
      for adverse events.
