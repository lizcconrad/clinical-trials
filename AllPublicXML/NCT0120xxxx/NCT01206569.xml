    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis is one of the major disease manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE). Around one-third of the patients, however, do not respond to conventional
      immunosuppressive therapy, and they have a high risk of progressing to dialysis-dependent
      renal failure. Recent studies suggest that immunosuppressive therapy targeted against the
      calcineurin pathway of T-helper cell, for example, tacrolimus, may be effective in the
      treatment of primary glomerulonephritis. The investigators plan to an open-label single-arm
      study the efficacy and safety of long-acting tacrolimus in the treatment of
      treatment-resistant lupus nephritis. Twenty-five patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis
      will be recruited. They will be treated with oral prednisolone and long-acting tacrolimus for
      6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance steroid and azathioprine. Proteinuria, renal
      function, clinical and serologic lupus activity will be monitored. This study will explore
      the potential role of long-acting tacrolimus in resistant lupus nephritis, which has a poor
      prognosis and no effective treatment at the moment.

    <description>complete response is defined as urinary protein &lt; 0.5 g/day, with normal urinary sediment, normal serum albumin, and serum creatinine &lt; 15% above the base-line value.

No response is defined as urinary protein &gt; 3 g/day or a value of 0.6 to 2.9 g/day but serum albumin &lt; 30 g/dL, an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 50 µmol/l or 15% above the base-line value, or the discontinuation of treatment due to side effects.</description>
