      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of perampanel on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of a single-dose oral contraceptive (OC)containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and
      levonorgestrel (LN) (Microgynon-30) and to investigate the effects of repeated dosing of OC
      containing EE and LN (Microgynon-30) on the PK of a single dose of perampanel.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, fixed sequence study in healthy female subjects.
      The study has 2 parts: Part A investigating the effects of steady state perampanel on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single-dose oral contraceptive (OC) containing ethinylestradiol
      (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) (Microgynon-30) and Part B investigating the effects of repeated
      dosing of an OC containing EE and LN (Microgynon-30) on the PK of a single dose of
      perampanel.

             intrauterine device (IUD), for at least 8 weeks prior to dosing;

          4. All females must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B- hCG) test
             result at Screening and negative urine B-hCG test result at each Baseline. Females of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 medically acceptable methods of
             contraception (eg, abstinence where this is the subject's preferred lifestyle, a
             non-hormonal intrauterine device, a double-barrier method such as condom + spermicide
             or condom + diaphragm with spermicide, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed
             azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 4 weeks after study drug
             discontinuation. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are
