  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study aims to pilot a family-centred tailored nutrition intervention at child welfare
      clinics, targeting the previously observed dietary defaults of Finnish children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating habits can predict diet-related health problems and obesity. The defaults observed
      previously in the diet of Finnish children include low consumption of vegetables, fruits and
      vegetable oil-based fats, high consumption of sucrose, poor quality of drinks and low
      frequency of family meals. Child welfare clinic is the place to promote healthy lifestyles
      because most Finnish families visit there at regular intervals.
