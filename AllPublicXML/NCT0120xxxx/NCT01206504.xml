        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease subjects: Have neurological signs and/or symptoms
             of West Nile meningitis, encephalitis, and/or acute flaccid paralysis

          2. For immunocompromised subjects with suspected West Nile virus infection:

               -  Receiving immunosuppressive treatment for any disease, such as autoimmune
                  diseases, or transplant recipients; or

               -  Have received organs or tissues or cells from donors likely infected with West
                  Nile virus (as shown by serology or PCR/NAT from the donor, organs, or tissues)
                  or

               -  Have acquired immunodeficiency (other than from immunosuppressive treatment or
                  from receiving infected transplants) or congenital immunodeficiency

          3. For subjects with substantial exposure to West Nile virus: Exposure by any route,
             including percutaneous, inhalation, or mucosal exposure (such as might occur in a
             laboratory accident)

          4. Develop signs and/or symptoms within 14 days before study enrollment
