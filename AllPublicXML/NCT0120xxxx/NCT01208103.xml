      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of capecitabine,
      oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab can help to control cancer of the small bowel or ampulla of
      Vater. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Oxaliplatin is designed to block new cancer cells from growing.

      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      growth of blood vessels.

      Capecitabine is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs in
      21-day &quot;study cycles.&quot;

      To receive oxaliplatin, you will have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a
      sterile, flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local
      anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be
      required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      You will receive oxaliplatin through the CVC over 2 hours on Day 1 of each cycle, before
      bevacizumab.

      You will receive bevacizumab through a needle in your vein on Day 1 of each cycle. The first
      time you receive bevacizumab, it will be given over 90 minutes. If you do not have
      infusion-related side effects from bevacizumab, all other bevacizumab doses will be given
      over 30-60 minutes.

      You will take capecitabine by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1-14 of each cycle. Capecitabine
      tablets should be taken 12 hours apart, within 30 minutes after eating a meal with a cup (8
      ounces) of water. If you miss a dose, do not try to make up the dose by doubling your next
      dose.

      Study Visits:

      There will be no study visits for Cycle 1. Up to 3 days before or on Day 1 of all Cycles
      after Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight, nerve function, and
           blood pressure.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, and so on:

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected to check your kidney function. Based on the results of the urine
           test, you may be asked to collect your urine over 24 hours to further test your kidney
           function. You will be given a container to collect the urine.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      you have intolerable side effects, or if the study is stopped.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 10 days after you stop taking the study drugs, you will have an end-of-treatment
      visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight, nerve function, and
           blood pressure.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of
           the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      The study staff will ask about any symptoms or side effects you may be having during the 30
      days after your last dose of the study drugs. The study staff may contact you by phone or at
      the time of a routine clinic visit. If the study staff contacts you by phone, the phone call
      should last about 15-30 minutes.

      The study staff will also review your medical records and/or contact you to check the status
      of the disease every 3 months after you stop receiving the study drugs. If you are contacted
      by phone, each phone call should take about 5 minutes.

      If you leave the study for any reason other than the disease getting worse, you will have a
      CT or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease every 12
      weeks unless you start receiving other treatment or the disease gets worse.

      Stopping Study Participation:

      You can decide to leave the study at any time. It is important to tell the study doctor if
      you are thinking about stopping so any side effects/risks from the treatment can be checked
      by your doctor. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to
      discuss what follow-up care and testing could be helpful for you.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine are each FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of some types of cancer, including
      colon and rectal cancer. They are not FDA approved for the treatment of small bowel or
      ampulla of Vater cancer. The use of the combination of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and
      bevacizumab in patients with cancer of the small bowel or ampulla of Vater is
      investigational.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the small bowel or
             ampulla of Vater.

          2. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy (including 5-FU, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin) for the
             treatment of adenocarcinoma of the small bowel or ampulla of Vater is allowed if
             completed &gt;/= 52 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.

          3. Prior capecitabine or 5-FU administered as a radiosensitizing agent concurrently with
             external beam radiotherapy is allowed.

          4. Patients must have metastatic disease

          5. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed from completion of any prior chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy or surgery and the start date of study therapy.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2.

          7. Adequate organ function including: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/ul;
             platelets &gt;/= 100,000/ul; total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)*; AST
             (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 3 x ULN; calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 50 cc/min
             (calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula). *In patients with known Gilbert's
             syndrome direct bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN will be used as organ function criteria,
             instead of total bilirubin.

          8. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential (defined
             as not post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical sterilization), within
             one week prior to initiation of treatment.

          9. Patients must sign an Informed Consent and Authorization indicating that they are
             aware of the investigational nature of this study and the known risks involved.

         10. The effects of the combination of CAPOX and bevacizumab on the developing fetus are
             unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for six months following the
             completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         11. (continued from # 8). Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with oxaliplatin or
             capecitabine or bevacizumab, breast feeding must be discontinued.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease are
             excluded. Chemotherapy if given as a radiation-sensitizer is allowed.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents nor have received any
             investigational drug 28 days prior to enrollment.

          3. Known history of dihydropyrimidine (DPD) deficiency.

          4. Peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or greater by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse

          5. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation.

          6. Because of the interaction between coumadin and capecitabine, patients taking
             therapeutic doses of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants are not eligible. Low-dose
             Coumadin (e.g. 1 mg PO per day) in patients with in-dwelling venous access devices is
             allowed but increased frequency of INR monitoring is recommended.

          7. Prior treatment with bevacizumab or known hypersensitivity to any component of
             bevacizumab.

          8. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg
             and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg).

          9. Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

         10. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of
             therapeutic anticoagulation).

         11. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.

             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1.

         15. History of hemoptysis (&gt;/= 1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1
             month prior to Day 1.

         16. History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation which must have resolved
             at least 6 months prior to Day 1.

         17. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course
             of the study.

         18. Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure excluding placement of a vascular access
             device, within 7 days prior to Day 1.

         20. Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by either (1) urine protein:creatinine (UPC)
             ratio of &gt;/= 1.0 or (2) urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;/= 2+ (patients discovered to
             have &gt;/= 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis should undergo a 24 hour urine
             collection and must demonstrate &lt;/= 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

         21. Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are
             defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no
             ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and
             brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose)
             are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy
             (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as
             deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

         22. (continued from # 21) Patients with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical resection
             or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will be excluded.

         23. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned

         25. Active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and superficial squamous (skin)
             cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, within last five years.

         26. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

         27. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit adherence with study requirements.

         28. Age &lt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of CAPOX and bevacizumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from
             this study.
