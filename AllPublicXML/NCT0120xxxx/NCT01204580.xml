      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the change in plasma levels of adiponectin and Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA)
      in type 2 diabetes patients after 12 weeks of treatment with Amaryl-M

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the role of Amaryl-M in the change of plasma levels of adiponectin and ADMA in
           type 2 diabetes patients after 8 weeks of therapy

        2. To evaluate the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) change after 8 and 12 weeks
           of therapy with Amaryl-M

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of Amaryl-M in the improvement of patients glycemic level
           (Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c))

        4. To evaluate the change of Tumor Necrosis Factor - Alfa (TNF-Alfa) after 12 weeks of
           therapy with Amaryl-M

        5. To evaluate the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) change
           after 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M

        6. To evaluate the HOMA-β change after 12 weeks of therapy with Amaryl-M

        7. To evaluate the relationship between adiponectin and ADMA level with FBG or HbA1c level
