    <textblock>
      Intra-uterine insemination (IUI), generally in combination with ovarian stimulation, is one
      of the most commonly used treatments for infertility. Accurate timing of insemination, in
      order to coincide with ovulation, has an important impact on the success rate. Optimal timing
      of insemination is achieved either by monitoring follicular growth through serial ultrasound
      measurements followed by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or by the
      detection of urinary luteinizing hormone (LH). However in cycles where follicular growth is
      monitored there is a possibility of premature LH rise before the administration of hCG, which
      may affect the outcome of the treatment. The goal of the study is to determine if adding the
      testing of urine LH in conjunction with ultrasound monitoring leads to an increase in
      pregnancy rates in IUI cycles when compared to ultrasound monitoring alone.

    <description>The study group will start urine LH (LHu) testing according to the mean diameter of the leading follicle on ultrasound as per :
13mm or less - Repeat ultrasound scan in 1-2 days 14-17mm - start urine LH testing the evening of the day of the scan 18mm or greater - do one LHu test in the afternoon of the day of the scan before HCG administration Once the patient has commenced LHu testing she will perform 2 tests per day. The tests will be performed at 7am and 7pm. LHu testing will continue until the time of HCG administration or positive uLH.If the LHu result is positive either in the morning or afternoon, the insemination will be the next morning without the administration of exogenous HCG.
If the patient has an inconclusive LHu result, a blood LH test will be taken. If the LH blood test is negative (&lt;8 IU\L) she will continue testing LHu. If the LH blood test is positive (≥ 8 IU\L) the insemination will be the next day.</description>
