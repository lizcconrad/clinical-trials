  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the research issue in establishing the role of periodontal disease (PD) in coronary
      heart disease (CHD) risk is to define the pathways that lead to cause-effect relationship
      between PD and CHD. There is no consensus on definition of a periodontal disease case or the
      threshold level that may give clear indication for this relationship. Periodontal therapy has
      been used in different studies with the hope that a change in periodontal disease status may
      modify the factors associated with CHD risk. Many of these studies, on role of periodontal
      therapy in the reduction of CHD associated risk-factors, were based on small study samples,
      and very few studies were randomized controlled trials. So a need for large prospective
      studies is warranted in literature.----------- A single-blind parallel-arm randomized
      controlled clinical trial was designed to observe the influence of periodontal treatment on
      serum inflammatory mediators of hsC-reactive protein, white blood cells and fibrinogen in CHD
      patients.

      Hypothesis: Periodontal therapy in CHD patients, by reducing periodontal inflammation, may
      decrease the host systemic inflammatory burden associated with atherogenic processes.
