  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vancomycin -resistant enterococci(VRE) has emerged as one of the most common nosocomial
      pathogen of health-care associated infection since 1988. Although the new antimicrobial
      agents such as Tigecycline , Daptomycin, Linezolid have clinically effectiveness for the
      treatment of VRE, but there was not appropriate drugs for eradicating the colonization of
      VRE. So the active surveillance and strict contact precaution are the best methods for VRE
      colonization and transmission.

      This is a one year study program, we select a unit as the study site. First month (January)
      is the prepare period. Therefore , we collect 3 months (from February to April) baseline
      data, then interrupted one month(May) for the health care worker's infection control
      education.

      Then the intervention period are three months (from June to August), and the last four
      months(from September to December) are the analysis and evaluation period. In the baseline
      period, we only do the patient's active surveillance and environmental culture. In the
      intervention period, beside the patient's active surveillance and environmental culture, we
      add contact precaution as the infection control method. If patient has VRE infection, we
      prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy until the culture result proved no growth of VRE.

      The aim of this study is to compare and analyze these two period (baseline period and
      intervention period) for understanding the transmission, risk factors and carriage rate of
      VRE, as the important guidelines for the VRE infection control in the future.
