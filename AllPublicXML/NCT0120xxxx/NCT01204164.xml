      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1/1b study.

      For Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the study, the primary objective is to determine the highest dose of
      TG02 citrate that can safely be given to patients with different types of hematological
      malignancy.

      For Part 4, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of once-weekly
      dosing at the maximum-tolerated dose/ Recommended Phase 2 Dose of TG02 in combination with
      carfilzomib.

      This study consists of four parts:

        -  Part 1: single agent TG02 in acute leukemia patients

        -  Part 2: single agent TG02 in multiple myeloma patients

        -  Part 3: TG02 in combination with carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients

        -  Part 4: TG02 in combination with carfilzomib in carfilzomib refractory multiple myeloma
           patients.
