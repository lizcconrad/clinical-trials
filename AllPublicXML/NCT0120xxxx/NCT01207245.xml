  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited life limiting condition which affects children.
      Patients with it develop lung infections which become difficult to clear, and damage the
      lungs. These are treated with antibiotics (such as tobramycin) into the vein (termed
      &quot;intravenous antibiotics&quot;). This has without doubt improved survival. However, all treatments
      have side effects. Tobramycin can cause kidney damage. The investigators have preliminary
      data that suggests that administering tobramycin in the morning may be safer for the kidneys
      than administering it in the evening.

      The investigators plan to approach children and adults with cystic fibrosis whose doctors
      have decided to administer a course of intravenous tobramycin. The investigators will
      randomly allocate them to receive it at either 0800h or 2200h. The investigators will measure
      the rate at which the body eliminates tobramycin from the bloodstream, by measuring the
      amount of tobramycin in the blood stream after administering the antibiotic. For each patient
      the study will last for the duration of the course of antibiotics. This is decided by the
      doctor looking after the patient (rather than the researcher), and would typically be 14
      days. The investigators will also measure substances in the blood and urine (&quot;biomarkers&quot;)
      which are sensitive indicators of low levels of kidney injury. The investigators will monitor
      lung function and lung bacteria in both the groups to ensure that the patients in both groups
      improve by the same amount.

      If the preliminary data are proved correct, this research will allow investigators to improve
      the safety profile of tobramycin, one of the most widely prescribed drugs in cystic fibrosis.
