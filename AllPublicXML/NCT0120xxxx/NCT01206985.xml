  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is the analgesic most used, indicated in the symptomatic treatment of fever and
      pain of mild to moderate. It comes in different dosage forms intended for oral, intravenous
      and rectal.

      The per-oral mucosal route is not used for the administration of paracetamol. It is a very
      interesting way for the rapid absorption of drugs such as nitrates used in angina pectoris,
      as it seeks a highly vascular area (the floor of the tongue or gingival groove) and allows
      very rapid action. In addition, the oral administration-oral mucosa, less restrictive than IV
      administration and faster than oral administration, seek a single medical procedure
      unattended after dosing, will entail no pain or risk for infections the patient (in contrast
      to the IV). The investigators tested a new oral dosage form permucosal (at 250mg/ml) of
      paracetamol and compared at pharmacological (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) with the
      only dosage form of reference used by the IV route in the protocol &quot;Pilot study Pharmacology
      paracetamol administered oral permucosal PMB. It seems interesting now to reduce the dose by
      half permucosal to assess how changing the pharmacodynamics of the form permucosal to
      125mg/ml. This form will be administered in oral permucosal buccal as well as sublingual
      (under the pillar of the language) and compared with paracetamol in IV.
