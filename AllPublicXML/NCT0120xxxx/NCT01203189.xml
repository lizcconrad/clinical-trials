  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to compare the effectiveness of antifungal foam versus antifungal
      shampoo and determine patient compliance and satisfaction with both vehicles among African
      American females with dandruff practicing less than once weekly hair washing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A wide variety of topical vehicles are available for medications that treat scalp disorders.
      Proper vehicle selection is important when managing scalp conditions, such as seborrheic
      dermatitis, because the efficacy of these treatments depends largely on compliance and the
      amount of active ingredient delivered to the scalp. It is therefore important to prescribe
      vehicles that are easy to apply and cause the least amount of disruption to the patients'
      pre-existing hair care practices. One of the most common rate limiting hair care practices
      among different cultures is wash frequency. Literature shows African American women are more
      likely to wash their hair less than once weekly versus Caucasian women. We hypothesize
      certain vehicles, such as foam preparations which do not require hair washing, will be more
      efficacious in African American women with seborrheic dermatitis than shampoo preparations.

    <description>The scalp will be divided into quadrants and for each quadrant the percent of involvement and degree of severity will be assessed. The percent of involvement will be measured on a scale of 0 to 4 in which a score of 0 means less than 10% involvement, and a score of 4, more than 76% involvement. Severity will be measured on a scale of 0 to 3 in which a score of 0 indicates normal skin, and a score of 3, marked erythema with thick confluent plates of yellowish white scales. The whole scalp score will then calculated by multiplying the total percent involvement score by the total severity score.
Quadrant scalp score = percent involvement score x severity score Total scalp score = summation of all the quadrant scores TDSS value ranges from 0-48, with 0 equal to no scale, which is the best outcome, compared to 48, which is the most severe and worse outcome</description>

        <title>Total Dandruff Severity Score (TDSS)</title>
        <description>The scalp will be divided into quadrants and for each quadrant the percent of involvement and degree of severity will be assessed. The percent of involvement will be measured on a scale of 0 to 4 in which a score of 0 means less than 10% involvement, and a score of 4, more than 76% involvement. Severity will be measured on a scale of 0 to 3 in which a score of 0 indicates normal skin, and a score of 3, marked erythema with thick confluent plates of yellowish white scales. The whole scalp score will then calculated by multiplying the total percent involvement score by the total severity score.
Quadrant scalp score = percent involvement score x severity score Total scalp score = summation of all the quadrant scores TDSS value ranges from 0-48, with 0 equal to no scale, which is the best outcome, compared to 48, which is the most severe and worse outcome</description>
