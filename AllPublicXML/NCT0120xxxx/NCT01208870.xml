      The purpose of this center grant is to translate basic behavioral science on habituation
      theory into clinical intervention using a vertical hierarchical approach from laboratory
      studies to field studies to the clinical intervention to improve weight loss outcomes in
      pediatric obesity treatment.

    <textblock>
      Habituation is one factor that may be related to excess energy intake. Research has shown
      that the rate of habituation is inversely related to the amount of food consumed and slower
      habituation may be a factor that is relevant to obesity, as overweight youth and adults
      habituate slower and consume more energy than their peers. Habituation is a basic form of
      learning that is observed in many response systems. We believe that habituation is an
      important process that mediates food regulation during a meal and across meals. However,
      there has been no research in children that translates basic research on habituation to food
      into clinical interventions for pediatric obesity. In the first phase, we will implement a
      series of laboratory studies to assess the effects of stimulus specificity and variety and
      the simultaneous reduction of variety for high energy density foods on short (within meal)
      and long-term (across meal) habituation. The second phase is designed to implement a series
      of field studies that will extend basic research from the first phase as well as define the
      optimal interval for reducing variety to facilitate long-term habituation to high energy
      density foods in the natural environment. The third phase is designed to develop and pilot
      test a family-based behavioral intervention for children that incorporates findings from
      phase2 into a clinical intervention.

    <description>Energy intake was calculated for parents and children as the different from baseline to six months of calories consumed. The first pilot used the calories generated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) report however the second pilot used calories from 24 hour recalls based on the Center of Disease Control data base or food labels.</description>

    <description>Kirby, small, medium and large reinforcers. The Kirby monetary choice questionnaire will be used to measure implusivity in parents and children. Participants are presented with a set of 27 choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards. An estimate of the participant's discounting rate parameter can be made from the pattern of choices and participants who discount the value of the delayed rewards more steeply are said to be more impulsive as measured in K-values. (0.25 impulsive to 0.00016 not impulsive)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Variety Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Variety of high energy density foods (RED) and low energy density foods (GREEN) were calculated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for pilot 1 and 24 hour recalls (24-HR) for pilot 2. High energy dense food or Red foods are low in nutrient density. Most Red foods come from the Fats, Oils and Sweets groups and are to be used sparingly. Modified foods from the Fats, Oils, and Sweets group are still considered to be Red foods, even if their energy level is low. These foods contribute little nutrients to the diet and compete for consumption of healthier foods. Green foods are high in nutrient density and low in energy density. Most Green foods come from the fruit and vegetable groups. Serving sizes were based off the serving sizes used in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) common serving sizes. Coding was based on the serving sizes of the specified food items and used to calculate the changes from baseline to six months.</description>

An estimate of the participant’s discounting rate parameter can be made from the pattern of choices and participants who discount the value of the delayed rewards more steeply are said to be more impulsive as measured in K-values.

        <title>Changes in Variety Measures</title>
        <description>Variety of high energy density foods (RED) and low energy density foods (GREEN) were calculated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for pilot 1 and 24 hour recalls (24-HR) for pilot 2. High energy dense food or Red foods are low in nutrient density. Most Red foods come from the Fats, Oils and Sweets groups and are to be used sparingly. Modified foods from the Fats, Oils, and Sweets group are still considered to be Red foods, even if their energy level is low. These foods contribute little nutrients to the diet and compete for consumption of healthier foods. Green foods are high in nutrient density and low in energy density. Most Green foods come from the fruit and vegetable groups. Serving sizes were based off the serving sizes used in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) common serving sizes. Coding was based on the serving sizes of the specified food items and used to calculate the changes from baseline to six months.</description>

          <title>Changes in Variety Measures</title>
          <description>Variety of high energy density foods (RED) and low energy density foods (GREEN) were calculated from the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for pilot 1 and 24 hour recalls (24-HR) for pilot 2. High energy dense food or Red foods are low in nutrient density. Most Red foods come from the Fats, Oils and Sweets groups and are to be used sparingly. Modified foods from the Fats, Oils, and Sweets group are still considered to be Red foods, even if their energy level is low. These foods contribute little nutrients to the diet and compete for consumption of healthier foods. Green foods are high in nutrient density and low in energy density. Most Green foods come from the fruit and vegetable groups. Serving sizes were based off the serving sizes used in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) common serving sizes. Coding was based on the serving sizes of the specified food items and used to calculate the changes from baseline to six months.</description>
