      The purpose of this study is to gather ECG data during normal activity, exercise, and sleep
      from normal subjects with or without well-controlled epilepsy. This normal subject data will
      serve as &quot;true negative&quot; (i.e., no seizure occurring) challenge data for testing cardiac
      based seizure detection algorithms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be 18 years or older and may be of either sex and of any race.

          2. Subject must be in good general health, fully ambulatory, and able to complete the
             physical aspects of testing requirements.

          3. Subject must be willing and able to complete informed consent and HIPAA authorization.

          4. Subject may be diagnosed with epilepsy but must be well controlled on their regular
             treatment regimen.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with skin abnormalities or conditions that would interfere with ECG electrode
             patch placement or cause subject discomfort with patch placement.

          2. Subjects report history of allergies or sensitivity to adhesive tapes or patches.

          3. Subjects with severe psychiatric disease that in the investigator's judgment would
             prevent the subject's successful completion of the study.

          4. Subjects with epilepsy experiencing status epilepticus within the last 6 months.

          5. Subjects with cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular or gait disorders that in the
             investigator's judgment would cause unnecessary risk or inability to participate in
             the protocol.

          6. Subjects with known cardiovascular arrhythmias or cardiac disease resulting in history
             of cardiac disease or abnormal ECG recordings. These include, but are not limited to,
             conditions such as chronic atrial fibrillation and permanent cardiac pacemaker
             implantation.

          7. Use of beta adrenergic antagonists (i.e., &quot;beta blockers&quot;) or calcium channel blocker
             agents that may affect heart rate.

          8. Subjects currently dependent on alcohol or narcotic drugs as defined by DSM IV-TR.
