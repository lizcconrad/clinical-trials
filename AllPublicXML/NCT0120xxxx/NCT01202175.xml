  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate subjects at high risk of future development of
      hypertension, those with a family history of hypertension and/or that already have high
      normal(SBP 120-139 mmHg or DBP 80-89 mmHg) blood pressure. The investigators plan to
      investigate whether these subjects have the same markers (such as microscopic protein in the
      urine or C-reactive protein in the blood) in the blood and urine that people with high blood
      pressure have, and whether they are improved before and after taking the beta-blocker
      nebivolol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Prehypertensive male and female subjects with SBP =120-139 or DBP =80-89 with at
             least one known family member (must be diagnosed prior to the age of 60) with
             essential hypertension (confirmation may be sought).

               -  All ethnicities

               -  Non-smokers and non-drug abusers, no current smoking or illicit drug use in the
                  prior 3 months.

               -  Aged 18-40 years

               -  No known serious medical conditions requiring close monitoring from physicians-
                  such as liver impairment, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes mellitus

               -  Subjects will need to remain in the San Diego area for the duration of the study
                  (10 weeks) and be accessible by telephone or email.

               -  Female subjects must be willing to use a birth control method, such as
                  abstinence, birth control pills, diaphragm, condom, or intrauterine device to
                  prevent pregnancy during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with SBP &gt;140 or SBP&lt;120 or DBP &gt;90 and DBP&lt;80

          -  We will exclude subjects whose family members have known secondary etiologies for
             hypertension such as hyperaldosteronism or Cushing's Disease.

          -  Subjects cannot have a chronic medical condition that is actively treated by a
             physician, such as liver impairment, diabetes, or kidney disease

          -  History of bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Subjects cannot be on any anti-hypertensive medications for any reason.

          -  Subjects may not have previous intolerance, hypersensitivity, or allergy to any beta
             blocker therapy or may have contraindications to beta blocker therapy such as asthma,
             bradycardia, etc.

          -  Subjects may not be taking medications which may affect the metabolism of nebivolol,
             such as those that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as fluoxetine or cimetidine)

          -  Nursing women, pregnant women, or those that plan to become pregnant in the study
             period will also be excluded. (Pregnancy tests will be performed on all female
             subjects at the start of the study)

          -  Subjects with pulse rate consistently &lt;60 beats per minute or evidence of arrythmias
             including atrioventricular block.

          -  Those that have smoked or used illicit drugs within the past 3 months

          -  Female subjects that are not willing to use a birth control method, such as
