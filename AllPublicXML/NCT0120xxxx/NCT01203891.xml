      The objective of the study is to acquire a database of Single Photon Emission Computed
      Tomographic (SPECT) studies of the brains of normal human subjects in resting and
      concentrating states. The database will provide a basis for subsequent investigation of
      meaningful brain differences between clinical and normal subject groups

    <description>For the baseline resting study with adult subjects approximately 20 milliCuries of Tc-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO, commercially marketed by Amersham Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Ceretec) will be injected after the initial equilibration period.

    <description>For the concentration study the subject will start the Conner's Continuous Performance Task, a 15-minute computer-administered test of attention, subsequent to the accommodation period. Three minutes into task performance HMPAO will be injected through the catheter with attention to minimal disruption of the subject's attention task. The subject will proceed to completion of the attention task.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study seeks to recruit 100 normal human subjects between ages 10 and 90 for SPECT brain
        imaging. Subjects will initially be screened for psychiatric and other major illnesses with
        a screening questionnaire; they will also be given a standard DSM-4 computer-administered
        questionnaire (The DISC for children and teens and the SCID for adults). They will also
        meet individually with a psychiatrist or psychological assistant for a screening interview.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Suicidal thinking or behavior

          2. Any psychiatric diagnosis assignable under contemporary DSM nosology

          3. Unstable medical condition

          4. epilepsy, serious head injury, or other significant neurological disorder or use of
             central nervous system medication.

          5. Dementia, mental retardation, or coma

          6. Substance abuse or alcoholism

          7. Unreliability or inability to adhere to the requirements of the study

          8. Inability to personally tolerate the requirements of the study

          9. Significant exposure to occupational, diagnostic, or therapeutic radiation within the
             prior year

         10. Pregnancy or breast-feeding

         11. A first-degree relative meeting any of criteria 1 through 6.
