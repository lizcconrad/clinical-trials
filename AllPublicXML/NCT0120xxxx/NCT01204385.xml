        Inclusion Criteria:

        A child will be eligible for inclusion if he/she meets the following criteria:

          -  Age: ≥ 3 months and &lt; 5 years at the time of enrolment. The subject becomes ineligible
             on the fifth birthday.

          -  Signs, symptoms, and conditions: i. One of the functional or general signs of otalgia
             (or its equivalent: irritability), conjunctivitis, fever AND EITHER ii. Paradise's
             criteria (bulging, diffused or localised inflamed tympanic membranes) OR iii.
             Spontaneous otorrhoea of less than 24 hours

          -  Onset of signs and symptoms of AOM within 72 hours prior to diagnosis of AOM by a
             physician. To be included as treatment failure, subjects must have then received
             antibiotic treatment from the physician, but remain symptomatic 48-72h after
             initiation of treatment

          -  Written informed consent obtained from parent or guardian prior to study start.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the
        child must not be included in the study.

          -  Hospitalised during the diagnosis of AOM or during treatment,

          -  Otitis externa, or otitis media with effusion

          -  Presence of a transtympanic aerator

          -  Systemic antibiotic treatment received for a disease other than AOM in the 72 hours
             prior to enrolment,

          -  Receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis for recurrent AOM,

          -  Provision of antibiotic by paediatrician/ENT specialist at the enrolment visit, prior
             to the sampling

          -  Patients on antibiotics for AOM who are clinically improving.
