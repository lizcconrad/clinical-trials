      This investigator-blinded study is designed to assess whether the order of application
      affects the efficacy of the combination treatment Clobex® Spray (clobetasol propionate) and
      Vecitcal® (calcitriol) Ointment in plaque psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral comparison study. A total of up to 12 subjects
      with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis will be enrolled in this study, so that at least 10
      subjects complete the 4 week trial. These 12 subjects will receive the combination therapy of
      Clobex® Spray and Vectical® Ointment to treat their psoriatic lesions (except those on the
      scalp, face, groin, axillae or other intertriginous areas). Half of the subjects will first
      apply the Clobex® Spray followed by the Vectical ointment to lesions on the right side of
      their bodies, and Vectical® Ointment first followed by Clobex® Spray to the lesions of the
      left side of their bodies. The other half of the subjects will first apply Clobex® Spray
      followed by Vectical® Ointment to the lesions of the left side of their bodies, and Vectical®
      Ointment first followed by Clobex® Spray to the lesions on right side of their bodies.
      Treatment will be applied twice daily for 4 weeks. One target area on each side of the
      subject's body will be chosen for target lesion assessment.

      All subjects will be consented prior to any study evaluations/procedures. Study evaluations
      including Target Lesion Severity Score (TLSS) and photography will be performed at
      Baseline/Day 0, week 2 and week 4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be at least 18 years of age and in good general health as confirmed by a
             medical history.

          2. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test on
             Baseline/Day 0 and must agree to use adequate birth control methods during the entire
             study (a barrier method {condoms, diaphragm}; hormonal contraceptives {birth control
             pills, implants [Norplant] or injections [DepoProvera]}; intrauterine device {IUD}; or
             abstinence {no sexual activity}).

          3. Subjects must be diagnosed with plaque psoriasis affecting &lt; 20% body surface area,
             with at least one discreet plaque on the each side of the body (excluding the face,
             scalp, groin, axillae or other intertriginous areas).

          4. Subjects must have at least 2 lesions suitable for evaluating response to test agents
             (one on the right side and one on the left side of the body). The severity of the
             disease for each target lesion at Baseline/Day 0 must be rated at least 2 (Mild) for
             each of the key psoriasis characteristics (scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation).

          5. Subjects must be able to understand the requirements of the study abide by the
             restrictions and return for the required examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study.

          2. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any components of the test medication.

          3. Subjects with non-plaque psoriasis (e.g. guttate, erythrodermic) or other related
             diseases not classified as plaque psoriasis.

          4. Subjects whose psoriasis involves only the scalp, face, groin, axillae, and/or other
             intertriginous areas.

          5. Subjects who have surface area involvement too large (&gt;20% BSA) that would require
             more than 59 ml/week (50 g/week) of Clobex® spray and/or more than 200 g/week of
             Vectical® ointment.

          6. Subjects requiring any other medication (topical or systemic) that may affect the
             course of the disease during the study period as determined by the study
             investigators.

          7. Subjects using biologics or any other systemic treatment (e.g. immunosuppressants,
             acitretin) for psoriasis within 12 weeks of entering the study.

          8. Subjects using systemic corticosteroids within 28 days of entering the study

          9. Subjects using topical corticosteroids or other topical therapies (other than
             emollients) at the target area locations within 2 weeks of entering the study

         10. Subjects using phototherapy (UVB, PUVA) within 4 weeks of entering the study.

         11. Subjects with overt pre-existing telangiectasias or skin atrophy at intended treatment
             sites (target areas).

         12. Subjects with intakes of more than 2,000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) of vitamin D (tolerable
             upper intake level) and/or more than 1,000 mg/day of calcium (based on Dietary
             Reference Intakes developed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
             Sciences).

         13. Subjects who have participated in another investigational drug or device research
             study (at the target areas) within 30 days of enrollment.

         14. Subjects who are using any medication or has any disease which in the judgment of the
             investigator will interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.
