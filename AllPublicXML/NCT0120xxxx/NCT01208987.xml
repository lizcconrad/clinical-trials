    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to develop a process to create an Enhanced Medication List. The INPC
      (Indiana Network for Patient Care) already obtains histories of medications dispensed by
      pharmacies from several sources: pharmacy benefit managers, RxHub, insurance companies,
      Medicaid, SureScripts, Wishard Health Services. The investigators will collect all the
      medication data available through the INPC for an individual patient. The investigators will
      enhance this medication list by including medication categories, improving the structure and
      appearance, displaying results of relevant laboratory tests, and adding decision support
      reminders. The investigators will test the value of such an &quot;Enhanced Medication List&quot; by
      providing it to outpatient physician practices (through the DOCS4DOCS clinical messaging
      service, or as a fax), preferably on the day that the patient has an office visit with the
      physician. The investigators will determine whether this intervention improves patient care:
      whether there are higher rates of recommended laboratory follow-up monitoring as a result;
      whether there are lower rates of harmful drug-drug interactions. The investigators will also
      seek the opinions of physicians regarding the benefit of this intervention.

    <measure>Count of medications (on a patient's medication list) for which recent (within 12 months) laboratory test monitoring is missing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Laboratory tests during the previous 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that the intervention (a medication history printed for the patient) would help the physician identify incomplete monitoring of laboratory test results for a subset of medications. (For example, Potassium test levels should be obtained every 12 months for patients using diuretics, according to NCQA HEDIS guidelines.) With time, the intervention group should have less medications for which laboratory test results are incomplete. Therefore, the intervention group should have less medications with decision support reminders warning of incomplete laboratory test monitoring.</description>
