  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia show deficits in social cognition, the ability to process
      information about other people such as identifying their emotional expressions. Social
      cognition is associated with everyday life functioning and could therefore be an important
      treatment target. Several social cognitive training programs have been developed during the
      last years. Results indicate that social cognitive performance can be ameliorated through
      commonly used intervention techniques. However, it is less clear whether this improvement
      generalizes to everyday life. The purpose of this study is to investigate if a social
      cognitive training program (Training in Affect Recognition) improves performance on social
      cognitive and neuropsychological tests and leads to improved everyday life functioning in
      persons with schizophrenia. The study also aims at examining if an improvement is present
      three months after completion of the training intervention.
