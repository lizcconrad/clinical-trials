  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the response rate of single agent
      zoledronic acid using a composite of criteria including the EORTC modified RECIST criteria
      and the EORTC tumor response criteria for 18F-FDG PET scans.

      This pilot study will examine the effect of bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in patients with
      malignant mesothelioma. Evaluation will be limited to patients with standard (CT scans) and
      functional instruments (FDG PET Scans) of tumor assessment after the administration of
      standard doses of zoledronic acid (4 mg IV every 3 weeks). We will also explore the biologic
      effect of zoledronic acid in patients using new serum markers as well as several blood level
      markers.

      <desc>Subjects with either stable disease or objective response continued treatment until disease progression and/or intolerable toxicity at which patients were taken off study. Subjects were monitored for toxicity using NCI CTAE v3.0 Criteria. Dose adjustment was allowed per standard guidelines for zoledronic acid for decreased creatinine clearance. Patients who completed at least one treatment cycle were included in data analysis.</desc>
