      Summary: This is a prospective randomize study to compare conservative and aggressive
      discectomy for treatment of disc herniation with radiculopathy.

      Study hypothesis: The investigators believe that conservative discectomy could preserve a
      higher disc space and has a better long-term outcomes.

      objectives:to compare the effect of two type surgery(conservative discectomy and aggressive
      discectomy)on disc herniation with radiculopathy after long-term follow-up.

      methods:the patients who were confirmed suffer from disc herniation with radiculopathy and
      failed to nonsurgical treatment will be divided into two groups, and will be follow up 3~6
      years for seeking the effect on disc space preservation and recurrent.

      outcome measures:the rate of pain release and patients satisfaction were measured by
      SF-36,ODI,VAS,score post-OP. the height of disc was measured on X-ray film by the end point.

             curative intent AND there has been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for
             at least 5 years.

          -  Current fracture, infection, and/or deformity (greater than 15 degrees of lumbar
             scoliosis, using Cobb measure technique) of the spine.

          -  Age less than 18 years.

          -  Cauda Equina syndrome or progressive neurological deficit (usually requiring urgent
             surgery).

          -  Unavailability for follow-up (planning to move, no telephone, etc.) or inability to
             complete data surveys.

          -  Symptoms less than 6 weeks.
