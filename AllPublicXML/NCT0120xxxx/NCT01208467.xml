  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying prognostic biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      endometrial cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate the clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation
      in endometrioid endometrial cancer cases with defective DNA mismatch repair.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA extracted from previously collected tumor samples is analyzed to validate the
      clinicopathologic associations and prognostic significance of ATR mutation.

    <description>Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests will be performed to evaluate the association between ATR mutation status and demographic and clinical data. Product-limit estimates according to Kaplan-Meier method will be calculated and difference between survival according to ATR mutation status will be assessed using a two sided log rank test. The predictive ability of the final model will be assessed using a concordance index (C-statistic).</description>
