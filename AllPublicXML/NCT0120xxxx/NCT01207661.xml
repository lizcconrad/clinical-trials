    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in
      terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative
      therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded in
      vitro and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has demonstrated
      that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation through its action
      on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one carried out in an
      equine by the investigators research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy
      evidence proposed treatment protocol.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential
      and safety of mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical
      manifestations.This study is designed to evaluate therapeutic potential and safety of
      mesenchymal stem cells in improvement of osteoarthritis clinical manifestations.

      Mesenchymal stem cells are pluripotent cells that can be obtained from various tissues .They
      have shown capabilities to differentiate into bone,cartilage,muscle,and adipose tissue,
      representing a new clinical strategy in regenerative medicine.An increasing number of reports
      have demonstrated effectiveness of percutaneous intra-articular infusion of MSCs in arthritic
      disease. In this study we perform a single intra articular injection of cultured mesenchymal
      stem cells in patients suffering from osteoarthritis, with the aim to assess its clinical
      safety and efficacy.Patients are assessed for response with MRI, X-Ray examination, WOMAC
      osteoarthritis index,VAS, and SF36 2,4,8 weeks and 6, and 12 months post infusion.
