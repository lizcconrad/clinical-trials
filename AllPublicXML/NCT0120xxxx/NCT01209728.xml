      This is a double-blind, parallel design study in elderly primary insomnia patients and
      demographically matched controls. The objectives if this study are primarily: 1. To determine
      if functional deficits in simulated driving performance can be demonstrated in primary
      insomnia patients, and detected in healthy volunteers, impaired by alcohol; and secondarily:
      2. To compare simulated driving performance deficits in elderly primary insomnia patients to
      those in healthy elderly volunteers impaired by alcohol, for at least one of the following
      driving endpoints: standard deviation of lane position (SDLP), standard deviation of speed
      (speed deviation), lane excursions, and a driving composite score.
