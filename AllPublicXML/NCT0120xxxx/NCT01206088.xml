      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of nilotinib in patients with
      Imatinib resistant or intolerant CML-CP or AC. Efficacy evaluation will be made by Complete
      cytogenetic response rate(CCyR) at 12 months after nilotinib administration.

                  cytogenetic response(Ph+&lt;35%) after 12 months treatment.

        Or

          -  Imatinib resistant Philadelphia positive CML-AC will be defined as at lease one
             following and no bast crisis before treatment.

               -  &lt;30% and ≥ 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow

                  be defined by increased numbers more than 50% of peripheral WBCs, blasts,
                  basophils and platelets.
