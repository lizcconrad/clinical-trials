  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a modified thermoplastic mask system in
      keeping an individual head stationary for a predefined amount of time. The investigators hope
      to know if the modified mask is study enough, and also if the modification on the mask will
      allow the investigator see and track the individual's movement underneath the mask by means
      of a camera that can detect light reflected from the individual. Participants will lay down
      on their backs and their heads will be held in place with the mask system for approximately 1
      hour.
