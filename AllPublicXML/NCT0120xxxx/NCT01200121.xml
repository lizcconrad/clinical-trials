  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant ascites represents a severe clinical problem for physicians and patients being
      confronted with this common symptom of advanced-stage gastrointestinal cancer. Unfortunately,
      there is no standardized and evidence-based treatment for malignant ascites and therapies
      which are commonly being used are only temporarily effective. Newer modes of therapy, such as
      the application of the tri-functional antibody catumaxomab, are associated with significant
      side effects and are limited to patients in stages of good overall performance. Therefore,
      there is still an urgent need for more effective, longer-lasting, and less toxic modes of
      treatment for peritoneal effusions caused by gastrointestinal cancers.

      Preclinical data strongly suggest that bevacizumab might be a very effective agent for the
      treatment of malignant ascites, which is in large part caused by the
      hyperpermeability-promoting factor VEGF. Emerging clinical results from cancer patients with
      malignant ascites treated with bevacizumab add further support to this idea. Bevacizumab has
      been tested in a variety of large clinical trials, has a good toxicity profile, and is
      effective in a number of human cancers underlying malignant ascites.

      In the present study, Bevacizumab will be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion at an
      absolute standardized dosage of 400 mg. This dosage was chosen because it is comparable to
      the approved standard dosage for intravenous administration which was also used in both
      studies reporting the successful and safe intraperitoneal administration of Bevacizumab to
      patients with malignant ascites. Finally, a standardized dosage seems more practical in the
      particular patient population treated in this study.
