    <textblock>
      The proposed study tests the efficacy of using pager-assisted messages combined with nicotine
      patches in facilitating smoking cessation and relapse prevention in a 2-arm randomized
      clinical trial. The hypothesis is that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters at 3
      and 12 months in the study arm randomized to receive therapeutic messages on alphanumeric
      pagers for 3 months along with individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches
      will be greater that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters who receive only
      individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches.

    <textblock>
      A total of 224 current smokers were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking cessation
      trial. Participants were community-living adult smokers of â‰¥10 cigarettes per day during the
      pre-enrollment week who were interested in quitting and recruited from the local area by
      means of print, media, and online advertisements. To be eligible, they needed to be smoking
      10 or more cigarettes per day, aged 18 or older, motivated to quit smoking, prepared to set a
      quit date, willing to use nicotine patches, and able to come to therapy sessions and be
      followed by telephone. Participants in the pager treatment were provided with alpha-numeric
      pagers free of charge for three months. Using specially-designed communication software, text
      messages were sent to participants aimed at facilitating motivation to quit, cessation
      strategies, and coping skills to maintain abstinence. Participants in both treatment groups
      were seen for two 60-minute sessions of standard smoking cessation counseling, and received
      three follow-up phone calls and two months of nicotine patches.
