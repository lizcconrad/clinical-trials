    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a male or female 18 years of age or older

          -  The subject has bilateral nasolabial folds that, in the opinion of both the Blinded
             Evaluating Investigator and the Unblinded Injecting Investigator, can be corrected
             with an injectable dermal implant

          -  The subject has the same Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) score of 3 or 4
             (moderate or severe) for each nasolabial fold

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has active skin disease or inflammation on or near a nasolabial fold that,
             in the Principal Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study device
             injections and/or study assessments.

          -  The subject has a history of sensitivity to hyaluronic acid

          -  The subject has a history of sensitivity to lidocaine or other amide type anesthetics

          -  The subject is, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, at undue risk based on the
             precautions, warnings and contraindications for local lidocaine anesthetics.
