  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of IMOAP study is to assess whether the efficacy of the healthcare
      professionals' usual practices, together with a motivational group intervention (delivered by
      a nurse trained by an expert psychologist), is more effective than an isolated traditional
      intervention on weight loss and its maintenance in overweight and obese patients.
      Furthermore, the study will evaluate whether this result has a positive impact on quality of
      life, changes in eating habits, and a reduction in the associated cardiovascular risk factors
      and overall cardiovascular risk.

  <detailed_description>

      The global mortality caused by cardiovascular disease increases with weight. The Framingham
      study showed that obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor independent of other risks such as
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking. Moreover, the main problem in the
      management of weight-loss is its maintenance, if it is achieved. We have designed a study in
      two geographically separated groups, one of which would receive the group motivational
      intervention, and the other one would receive the usual follow up.
