  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: Address 3 short term objectives; (1) Determine the effects
      of physiologic testosterone (T) therapy on neurological function and functional independence
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in hypogonadal men during inpatient rehabilitation;
      (2) Document the natural history of neuroendocrine dysfunction and recovery in men during
      inpatient rehabilitation after TBI; (3) Obtain data to validate the NIH toolbox, a novel
      assessment of neurological function for use in the TBI population; and two long-term
      objectives: (1) Utilize study findings to design a multicenter trial to further assess the
      impact of T therapy in hypogonadal men following TBI and (2) Impact TBI practice management
      with new information about neuroendocrine dysfunction after TBI and hormone treatments to
      improve outcomes.

      This study will assess the hormonal status of men on admission to an inpatient TBI
      rehabilitation program. Eighty-eight Individuals with low Testosterone (T) levels will be
      randomized to receive either physiologic T therapy or placebo. Fifty-six Individuals with
      sufficient levels of T will be followed as a second control group. All three groups will
      undergo serial assessment of neurological function (as measured by the NIH Toolbox) and
      functional independence (FIM) to correlate with hormone levels. Hormone levels will be
      assessed through analysis of blood samples drawn from all participants at the time of study
      screening and at two week intervals for a total of 7 blood draws during the 12 week study
      period. Demographics, injury characteristics, concomitant medication usage and adverse events
      will be documented by medical record review. Statistical analysis will be performed to test
      study hypotheses. Findings will be disseminated at professional and consumer conferences and
      in peer-reviewed journals and consumer-based publications. Results will also be made
      available through the Craig Hospital website and via summary report to the Colorado TBI Trust
      Fund Research Program. If T therapy is found to be effective, findings will be used as
      preliminary data for a grant proposal for a multi-center trial.

    <description>The most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community in the US. 18-item ordinal scale useful for assessment of progress during inpatient rehabilitation. Measures independent performance in self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. By adding the points for each item, the possible total score ranges from 18 to 126.</description>
