    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study to be conducted at
      approximately 5 investigative sites in the US that have expertise in the healthcare
      management of ostomates. Of the 25 subjects, this study targets a minimum of 15 current
      moldable users while the remaining users can be non-moldable users if moldable users can not
      be enrolled.
