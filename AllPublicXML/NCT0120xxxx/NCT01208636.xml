    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem. The principal source of vitamin D for humans is
      solar exposure, with cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D by photoconversion of
      7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to pre-vitamin D3. Latitude, altitude, season, skin
      pigmentation, and age are recognized factors that influence how much vitamin D can be made by
      solar exposure. Surprisingly, Vitamin D deficiency has been described in people dwelling in
      southern Florida and in surfers in Hawaii. We hypothesize that genetic variations in vitamin
      metabolism accounts for these differences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to consent and come for a study visit.

          -  Male or female between ages 18-60.

          -  Sun exposure &gt;3 hours daily for at least 5 days weekly for the last 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking Vitamin D supplements, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, steroids, having
             granulomatous disease, or liver or kidney disease as these medications and conditions
