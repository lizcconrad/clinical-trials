    <textblock>
      In this randomized study The investigators aim to compare the growth of very-low-birth-weight
      (VLBW) infants fed either a high protein or a standard protein preterm infant formula.

      Babies will be fed the assigned formula between the time they achieve full enteral feeds and
      hospital discharge, for a minimum of 3 weeks. The weight gain (g/d) will be measured and
      compared between groups. Feeding tolerance, protein-energy status and body composition
      between the study groups will also be analysed.

      After discharge, babies will be fed a post-discharge preterm infant formula (PDF) between
      hospital discharge and 3 m corrected age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Gestational age &lt;32 w, determined by maternal dates, fetal ultrasound,

          -  Tolerating an enteral intake of ≥100 ml/kg/d for ≥ 24 h

          -  Subject is anticipated to receive the study formula for ≥ 3 consecutive weeks after
             FEF have been achieved

          -  In infants fed human milk, formula is anticipated to provide 50% or more of total
             energy intake, calculated on a weekly basis and based on the assumption that human
             milk has an energy density of 67 kcal/dl

          -  Written informed consent has been obtained from the legal representative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac failure requiring fluid restriction with diuretic therapy for ≥ 3 consecutive
             days

          -  Peri-/intra-ventricular haemorrhage (grade 3-4) determined using cranial
             ultrasonography
