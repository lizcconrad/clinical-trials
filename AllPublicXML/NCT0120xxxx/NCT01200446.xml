  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a component of fish oil that is known to support a healthy
      cardiovascular system, maintain brain function, reduce depression, and improve inflammatory
      diseases. The study hypothesis is that DHA supplementation will diminish exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation as compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, fish oil supplementation studies in patients with asthma have used a combination of
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A study on the specific formula that is most effective
      in preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) has yet to be conducted in humans.
      Nevertheless, it has been shown that a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolite, protectin D1,
      is involved in the active resolution of airway inflammation and that its concentration is
      greater in healthy control subjects' exhaled breath condensates as compared to patients with
      asthma during a clinical exacerbation. Supplementing asthmatics with DHA could enable an
      increased availability of protectin D1 to help resolve airway inflammation during an asthma
      attack. Furthermore, DHA is known to support a healthy cardiovascular system, maintain brain
      function, and reduce depression in addition to alleviating inflammatory diseases. Thus, pure
      DHA supplementation could help patients manage their asthma while providing for their overall
      health.

      The main aim of this study is to determine whether pure DHA can attenuate EIB and airway
      inflammation in adults with asthma. It is hypothesized that DHA supplementation will diminish
      EIB and airway inflammation compared to placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of asthma, based on medication use as well as history and symptoms as
             outlined in the NHLBI Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma

          -  Diagnosis of EIB, based on a â‰¥10% fall in FEV1, a measure of lung function, after dry
             air eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH), a simulated exercise challenge

          -  Not currently taking asthma maintenance medication or physician approval to
             discontinue current asthma medication for the duration of the study
