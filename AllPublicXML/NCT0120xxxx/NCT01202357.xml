      A total of 160 subjects, who aged 18-35 and had completed the first 2 years of case
      management in the EASY programme will be randomized in 1:1 ratio into either (1) receiving an
      additional year of case management, or (2) terminating case management for the next 12
      months. The current study aims to investigate whether an additional year of case management
      in year 3 will confer additional benefits in outcome, in terms of functioning, symptoms,
      quality of life and health economics.

      Psychotic disorders involve disturbances in perceptual, cognitive and motivational processes
      central to the human life experience, which resulting in long-term and pervasive functional
      disability. In order to achieve the best possible long-term community outcome of psychotic
      disorders, early intervention service is set up, focusing on the first few years (the
      critical period) of the illness.

      In Hong Kong, early intervention for psychotic disorder was provided since 2001. The
      integrated Early Assessment Service for Young people with psychosis (EASY) provide
      specialized care to early psychosis patients up to age 25. Evaluation of the EASY programme
      using a matched historical control suggesting that early intervention is a promising approach
      to promote community care for patients with psychosis.

      In the current service, case management for patients will terminate after two years, and the
      patients will make transition to general psychiatric care afterwards. It is not clear whether
      the provision of additional case management in the community (e.g., for another year) will
      significantly enhance outcome further.

      The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness of providing community based case
      management for an additional year for patients with psychotic disorders by using a randomized
      controlled design. The study recruit patients who had completed the first 2 years of case
      management in the EASY programme and randomized them to receive either an additional year of
      case management, or to terminate case management for the next 12 months. The hypothesis is
      that better outcome are found in patients who had 3-year case management compared with those
      who had only 2 years.
