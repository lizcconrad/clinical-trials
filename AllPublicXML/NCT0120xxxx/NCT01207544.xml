  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) often have poor postural control and
      motor skills that affect their activities of daily living and participation in school
      activities. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of fitball
      training versus task-oriented motor training for children with DCD.
