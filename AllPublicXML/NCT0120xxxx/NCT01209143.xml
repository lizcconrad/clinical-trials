    <measure>Geometric Mean Ratio of the Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of Rosiglitazone</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours, between 8 and 12 hours, and 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>On Days 1 and 8, blood samples were taken prior to the administration of rosiglitazone and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours, between 8 and 12 hours, and 24 hours post-dose. Plasma concentrations of rosiglitazone were determined using a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) assay. Individual and mean plasma rosiglitazone concentration versus time data were tabulated and plotted by analyte. The pharmacokinetic parameters of each analyte were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods (WinNonlin version 5.2.1, Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). The geometric mean ratio of AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone was defined as the AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone on Day 8/AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Ratio of the Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of Rosiglitazone</title>
        <description>On Days 1 and 8, blood samples were taken prior to the administration of rosiglitazone and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours, between 8 and 12 hours, and 24 hours post-dose. Plasma concentrations of rosiglitazone were determined using a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) assay. Individual and mean plasma rosiglitazone concentration versus time data were tabulated and plotted by analyte. The pharmacokinetic parameters of each analyte were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods (WinNonlin version 5.2.1, Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). The geometric mean ratio of AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone was defined as the AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone on Day 8/AUC(0-inf) of rosiglitazone on Day 1.</description>
