  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Increased clinical attention has been paid to the evaluation and management of
      bioterrorism-related illness (such as anthrax infection) and emerging infectious diseases
      (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] and new strains of influenza). However,
      evaluation and treatment data for these illnesses are often limited because human infections
      to date have been relatively limited. Further knowledge about diseases of bioterrorism
      concern and emerging infectious diseases may lead to more effective forms of therapy to
      prevent disease-related illnesses and deaths.

      Objectives:

      - To apply standardized, documented, and carefully monitored evaluation and treatment methods
      for bioterrorism- and biodefense-related illnesses and emerging infectious diseases at the
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have confirmed or suspected infection by a
           biodefense or bioterrorism agent, or an emerging infectious disease agent.

        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have confirmed or suspected exposure to a
           biodefense or bioterrorism agent, an emerging infectious disease agent, or who have
           close exposure to an individual who is suspected of being infected with one of these
           agents.

        -  Health care workers who are involved in medical treatment of the abovementioned infected
           or exposed individuals.

      Design:

        -  All eligible persons will have an initial screening evaluation to determine the
           circumstances of possible infectious exposure (e.g., where, when, and how exposed),
           current medical condition and medical care given, and any aspects of medical history
           that might be relevant to the exposure.

        -  Participants may be seen in an outpatient clinic or in the Special Clinical Studies Unit
           (SCSU) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH SCSU is a hospital ward
           specially designed to minimize the risk of spreading infection to others.

        -  Upon admission, participants will provide blood and urine samples, have an
           electrocardiogram to measure heart activity, and have specific tests or procedures
           associated with the particular infectious agent.

        -  Participants who develop illnesses will be treated with the standard of care for known
           diseases or with experimental measures, depending on the nature of the illness. Separate
           consent may be required for these treatments.

        -  Participants will remain on this study for at least 1 year following the period of
           active evaluation and treatment. Participants may be asked to come to the NIH outpatient
           clinic on a periodic basis for medical evaluations and blood tests, and may be asked to
           keep a diary card to record any unusual signs or symptoms of possible infection.

      Since the fall 2001 distribution of letters containing Bacillus anthracis spores via the US
      postal system, increased attention has been paid to the evaluation and management of
      bioterrorism-related illness. Similarly, the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS) and other infectious diseases, along with the ongoing threat of global influenza
      pandemics, have fostered intensive interest in the evaluation and management of emerging
      infections both in the US and internationally. Data to this end are often limited, however,
      in that while many such diseases exist in nature, human illness may only rarely occur. The
      primary purpose of this protocol is to apply standardized, documented, and carefully
      monitored evaluation and prophylactic and treatment measures in the event of suspected or
      confirmed exposure to the causative agent of any disease of bioterrorism concern (whether of
      natural or deliberate origin), to agents under study in biodefense-related research
      laboratories, or to emerging infectious disease pathogens. Other goals include the
      characterization of natural history and clinical course of such diseases via the evaluation
      of close contacts of potentially exposed persons, as well as those who have recovered from
      illness; the elucidation of the pathophysiology of such diseases; the characterization of
      immune responses to such diseases; and the evaluation of diagnostic tests for the rapid
      identification of the causative agents of such diseases in clinical specimens. Further
      knowledge about diseases of bioterrorism concern and emerging infectious diseases may lead to
      more effective forms of therapy and improve disease-related morbidity and mortality.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Confirmed Infection Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Laboratory diagnosis of infection by a select agent under study in a biodefense
             research facility, by an agent of bioterrorism, by a naturally-occurring pathogen in

          2. Clinically stable for transfer to the Clinical Center.

          3. The ability and understanding to provide written informed consent. In cases of 1)
