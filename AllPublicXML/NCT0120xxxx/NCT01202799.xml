  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that PENNSAID Gel will minimize systemic exposure versus oral diclofenac
      administered twice a day (BID). In addition, PENNSAID Gel should result in greater subject
      convenience and compliance with a comparable bioavailability, safety and tolerability profile
      to that of the approved PENNSAID solution administered four times a day (QID).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PENNSAID Gel is a new topical gel formulation of diclofenac sodium that is similar in
      composition to PENNSAID solution.

      No clinical studies have been conducted using PENNSAID Gel. The current study will compare
      the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, safety and tolerability of diclofenac after the
      topical application of PENNSAID Gel with the approved formulations of topical PENNSAID
      Solution and oral Sandoz 75 mg diclofenac sodium delayed release tablets in healthy subjects.

      The efficacy profile of PENNSAID Gel is based on the known efficacy profile of PENNSAID
      solution. Support for the BID dosing regimen includes the higher concentration of diclofenac
      sodium in PENNSAID Gel (2.0%) compared to PENNSAID solution (1.5%). In addition, compared to
      PENNSAID solution, PENNSAID Gel is designed to have better penetration of diclofenac to allow
      for a reduction in the number of applications per day from four to two while maintaining
      effectiveness.

                  at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an acceptable form of contraception

               4. Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) ≥19 and ≤29 kg/m².

               5. The findings from the ECG interpretation must be within the normal range.

               6. Subjects whose health status is assessed by the investigator as &quot;normal healthy&quot;

                  screening.

               7. Administration of a sedative hypnotic medication for insomnia within 14 days
                  prior to screening.
