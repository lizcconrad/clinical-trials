    <measure>Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>A trained assessor interviewed the patient and graded the degree of impairment due to dyspnea (difficulty breathing). TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with Baseline Dyspnea Index Score and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Over 26 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The number of puffs of rescue medication taken in the previous 12 hours was record in patient diary in the morning and in the evening for 26 weeks. The total number of puffs per day was calculated and divided by the number of days with data to determine the mean daily number of puffs of rescue medication for each patient. Rescue medication data recorded during the 14 day run-in was used to calculate the baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline number of puffs and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume In One Second (FEV1) After 26 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Spirometry was performed according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the 23 hour 15 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose values. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline FEV1 and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

        <description>A trained assessor interviewed the patient and graded the degree of impairment due to dyspnea (difficulty breathing). TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with Baseline Dyspnea Index Score and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates.

        <title>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume In One Second (FEV1) After 26 Weeks of Treatment With QVA149 Compared to Tiotropium</title>
        <description>Spirometry was performed according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the 23 hour 15 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose values. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline FEV1 and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Baseline Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI) Focal Score at Week 12 and Week 26</title>
        <description>A trained assessor interviewed the patient and graded the degree of impairment due to dyspnea (difficulty breathing). BDI/TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort and captures changes from baseline. BDI was measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best). TDI captures changes from baseline. Each domain is scored from -3=major deterioration to 3=major improvement to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.
A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with Baseline Dyspnea Index Score and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators as covariates and included baseline smoking status, baseline inhaled corticosteroids and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

        <description>SGRQ is a health related quality of life questionnaire consisting of 51 items in three areas: symptoms (respiratory symptoms and severity), activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness) and impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances due to airway disease). The total score is 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating poorer health status. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with Baseline SGRQ and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

          <title>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score After 12 and 26 Weeks of Treatment</title>
          <description>SGRQ is a health related quality of life questionnaire consisting of 51 items in three areas: symptoms (respiratory symptoms and severity), activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness) and impacts (social functioning and psychological disturbances due to airway disease). The total score is 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating poorer health status. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with Baseline SGRQ and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>
          <population>Participants from the Full Analysis Set, included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug, with data available for analysis. Missing data were imputed with Last Observation Carried Forward but not more than 14 weeks and data within 4 weeks of day 1 were not carried forward.</population>

        <description>Patients answered the question &quot;Did your respiratory symptoms stop you performing your usual activities today?-Not at all in their daily diary. The percentage of days is calculated by the number of days patient is able to perform daily activities/total number of days with evaluable data X 100. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline Percent of Days and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

The percentage of days is calculated by the number of days with no rescue medicine use/total number of days with evaluable data X 100. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline number of puffs and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>

          <title>Standardized FEV1 (With Respect to Length of Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 5 Minutes to 23 Hours 45 Minutes at Week 26</title>
          <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made at 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose. The standardized AUC FEV1 was calculated as the sum of trapezoids divided by the length of time. A mixed model was used with treatment as a fixed effect with baseline FEV1 and FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 minutes post inhalation of two short acting bronchodilators (components of reversibility at Day -14) as covariates. The model also included baseline smoking status (current/ex-smoker), baseline ICS use (Yes/No) and region as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect.</description>
