      To compare the differential influence of 1st line doublet chemotherapy containing Docetaxel
      versus Pemetrexed on clinical efficacy of Erlotinib as a second line therapy in patients with
      relapsed or progressed non-squamous NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains challenging.
      Initial therapies for advanced NSCLC with platinum-based regimens have shown consistent
      overall response rates of 30% to 40% with progression-free intervals of 4-5 months and 1-year
      survival rates of 35% to 40% [1-3]. First line doublet chemotherapy commonly used in daily
      practice includes Gemcitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel and docetaxel those have proven
      efficacy with platinum against best supportive care, prolonging survival for approximately 3
      months. Recently, pemetrexed, a multi-target antifolate agent, has been introduced into the
      1st line doublet chemotherapy with platinum-based regimen to have similar efficacy and a
      better safety profile compared to docetaxel or gemcitabine [4]. Although those agents seem to
      have equivalent efficacy, tolerability tends to be a concern for docetoxel.

      Myelosuppression with the standard docetaxel schedule of 75 mg/m2 administered once every 3
      weeks is extremely frequent and severe; neutropenia occurs in 54% to 67% of patients and
      febrile neutropenia occurs in 1.8% to 8.0% of patients [5, 6]. Moreover, non-hematologic
      toxicities, such as grade 3-4 asthenia (12% to 18%), and nausea and vomiting (1% to 3.6%),
      are not uncommon [5, 6]. To increase tolerability of docetaxel, alternative schedules have
      been extensively studied. Accumulating evidence suggests that a weekly schedule of docetaxel
      (35 mg/m2) reduces severe and febrile neutropenia without decreasing antitumor activity
      [7-10]. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed for anemia, thrombocytopenia,
      and non-hematologic toxicity [7]. For the same reason, a lower dose of docetaxel (60 mg/m2
      every 3 weeks) has been recommended in Japan [11, 12]. However, recent large scale trials
      with such a dose of docetaxel still revealed high incidences of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (up
      to 82.9%) [12-14]. Different schedules of low dose docetaxel have not been studied, nor has a
      comparison been made between low dose docetaxel and the less toxic agent, pemetrexed.

      Currently, the investigators have been following a schedule of weekly low dose docetaxel (30
      mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; 60 mg/m2 accumulated dose for each cycle) at our
      hospital in an effort to achieve better tolerability (in press-chemotherapy 2010). The
      investigators therefore perform an exploratory study, by prospective analysis, to investigate
      the efficacy and toxicity of such a low dose docetaxel schedule compared to that of
      pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who are chemotherapy naive.

      Erlotinib, an orally-available epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitor (TKI), significantly prolongs survival and produces significant symptom and
      quality-of-life benefits compared with best supportive care in unselected patients with
      relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [15, 16]. In a large, phase III,
      placebo-controlled study (BR.21), erlotinib produced a survival benefit across all patient
      sub-groups studied [15].

    <description>Eligible patients will be randomized to receive 1st line chemotherapy with either Docetaxel (60mg/m2)/Cisplatin (75mg/m2) or Pemetrexed (500mg/m2)/Cisplatin (75mg/m2) for 4-6 cycles. Patients will be followed up without any maintenance treatment after 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy.
Once patients are found tumor relapse or in progression, all the patients will be prescribed Erlotinib 150 mg/day until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. Patients will be followed up every 2-3 months for their responsive rate.</description>

    <time_frame>12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Erlotinib 150 mg daily will be given to patients who are in progression after 1st line cisplatin-base doublet chemotherapy. Treatment will continue until documented disease progression, or patient refusal to continue. The progression-free survival encompasses the time from the start date of the Erlotinib treatment to documented progression, or death from any cause. The Overall survival from each arm of treatment is calculated from the start date of the treatment to death or to the last follow-up visit.</description>
