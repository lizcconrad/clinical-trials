  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot, single blind, placebo run-in, dose finding study of
      pioglitazone in children with autism with the ultimate goal of identifying appropriate dosing
      and outcome measures for a larger follow-up randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. The
      specific aims of this study are: 1) To examine the safety of pioglitazone in children with
      autism spectrum disorders (ASD) ages 5-12 years; 2) To identify appropriate outcome measures
      to be used in a follow-up multisite randomized control trial of pioglitazone in children with
      ASD; 3) To determine the maximum tolerated dose to be used in the follow-up multisite
      randomized controlled trial; 4) To examine the effect of pioglitazone on markers of
      inflammation (cytokine levels) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, malonyl
      aldehydes); 5) To explore the relationship between different doses and response to treatment.

    <description>A modified dose finding method will be used to determine safety and dose response among three dose levels (0.25mg/kg QD, 0.5mg/kg QD, and 0.75mg/kg QD). The dose has been based on the per weight maximum adult dose. Specifically, the FDA has approved 45mg as the maximum adult dose. For a 60kg adult, this is 0.75mg/kg. There will be 14 weeks of active treatment.</description>

             (DSM-IV) criteria. DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder or Asperger's Disorder
             (autism spectrum disorder) will be confirmed by a clinician with expertise with
             individuals with ASD. Best estimate Diagnosis will be reached using DSM-IV criteria,
             the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G) and the Autism Diagnostic
             Interview-Revised (ADI-R).

          3. Have a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score â‰¥ 4 (moderately ill) at

             interventions, have continuous participation during the preceding 3 months prior to
             Screening and will not electively initiate new or modify ongoing interventions for the
             duration of the study.

          5. Have normal physical examination and laboratory test results at Screening. If
             abnormal, the finding(s) must be deemed clinically insignificant by the Investigator.

             using the birth control pill for whatever reason.

          6. Patients with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being.

             endocrine, cardiovascular (including any rhythm disorder), respiratory, renal,

             months) and on stable doses of antiepileptic medications (no changes in 3 months) will
             be allowed in the study.

          7. Patients taking psychoactive medication(s).
