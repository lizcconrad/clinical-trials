  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Pralatrexate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving pralatrexate together with fluorouracil may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of pralatrexate when
      given together with fluorouracil in treating patients with recurrent solid tumors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended dose of PDX (pralatrexate) given in combination with a fixed
      dose of 5-FU (fluorouracil) administered as a 48-hour infusion given every other week.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess clinical response to therapy in subjects with measurable disease and time to
      disease progression in all subjects.

      II. To assess the toxicity profile of the combination of PDX and 5-FU. III. To determine the
      pharmacokinetics of PDX and 5-FU and correlate with clinical toxicity.

      IV. To analyze polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase
      (TS) and correlate with clinical toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pralatrexate.

      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 48 hours on days 2 and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
