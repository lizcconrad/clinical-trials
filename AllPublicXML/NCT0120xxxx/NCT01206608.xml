  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of SKY0402 over
      conventional, commercially-available bupivacaine HCl with respect to the duration of the
      analgesic effect achieved by a single local administration of the study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, parallel-group, active-control, randomized, double-blind study conducted
      to evaluate a single local administration of low dose or high dose of SKY0402 compared with
      75 mg of bupivacaine HCl (i.e., MarcaineÂ® 0.5%) in women undergoing bilateral, cosmetic,
      sub-muscular, augmentation mammoplasty under general anesthesia. Each subject was to serve as
      her own control.

      A total of 40 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following
      regimens:

        -  Low-dose SKY0402 in one side and Marcaine 75 mg in the contralateral side.

        -  Mid-dose SKY0402 in one side and Marcaine 75 mg in the contralateral side.

      Study drug was administered locally into the breast implant pocket at the end of surgery.
      After surgery, subjects were to receive standard treatment with acetaminophen 1000 mg three
      times daily and rescue analgesia with immediate-release oxycodone, as needed, for
      breakthrough pain.

      Assessments of postoperative pain were conducted through 96 hours. Safety assessments were
      conducted including monitoring of local and systemic adverse events (AEs).

    <description>Assessments of postoperative pain were conducted through 96 hours and included pain intensity at rest (NRS-R) and with activity (NRS-A). The prescribed activity was to consist of raising the arm, in full extension at the elbow and wrist, to a position parallel with the axis of the torso. Pain intensity was scored on an 11-point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who met all of the following criteria were eligible for inclusion in the study:

          1. Women, 18-40 years of age at the Screening Visit.

             contraception for at least 30 days after surgery including any of the following:
             hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral, injectable, implantable starting at least 30 days
             before study drug administration), effective double-barrier methods (e.g., condoms
             with spermicide), intrauterine device, lifestyle with a personal choice of abstinence,
             nonheterosexual lifestyle, or a strictly monogamous relationship with a partner who
             has had a vasectomy.

               7. Significant medical conditions or laboratory results that, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator, indicated an increased vulnerability to study drugs and procedures,
                  and exposed the subject to an unreasonable risk as a result of participating in
                  this clinical trial (e.g., severe hepatic insufficiency, hypotension, heart
                  block, or severely impaired cardiac function).

        <description>Assessments of postoperative pain were conducted through 96 hours and included pain intensity at rest (NRS-R) and with activity (NRS-A). The prescribed activity was to consist of raising the arm, in full extension at the elbow and wrist, to a position parallel with the axis of the torso. Pain intensity was scored on an 11-point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain.</description>
