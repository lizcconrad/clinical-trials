  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental phobia represents a clinical condition that affects 5-15% of the community and is
      characterized by severe anxiety of dental treatment which leads to avoidance of treatment
      and, as a consequence, severe dental as well as psychosocial problems.

      Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) has been developed for the treatment of
      patients with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Its efficacy in PTSD patients has often
      been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials.

      Recently it has been demonstrated that dental phobia is often induced by traumatic events
      during dental treatment and goes along with symptoms of PTSD in numerous patients.

      A pilot study (de Jongh et al. 2002) gave hints on the efficacy of EMDR in four dental phobia
      patients with a history of traumatization during dental treatment.

      This randomized wait-list control study aims to evaluate the efficacy of EMDR in a larger
      sample of dental phobia patients.
