      The prevalence of endometrial polyp is 24% in the general population but is much higher in
      postmenopausal women. The incidence of malignant or pre-malignant findings in endometrial
      polyps ranges from 2 to 10% in menopausal women.

      Removal of endometrial polyps in postmenopausal symptomatic women is the standard of care,
      same goes for asymptomatic women with risk factors for endometrial malignancy, however
      treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial polyp but no risk factors is
      disputable.

      In light of ambiguity in literature regarding the rate of malignant and pre-malignant
      findings in polyps in asymptomatic post-menopausal women, the investigators are asking to
      conduct a prospective study in order to evaluate and compare the incidence of malignant and
      pre-malignant changes in symptomatic and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial
      polyp

    <textblock>
      Endometrial polyp is a common finding in postmenopausal women. The prevalence of endometrial
      polyps is 24% in the general population, but is much higher in postmenopausal in compare to
      premenopausal women. The incidence of malignant or pre-malignant findings in endometrial
      polyps ranges from 0.5 to 4.8% in the general population and from 2 to 10% in menopausal
      women. There is an increased risk for malignant or pre-malignant polyp in postmenopausal
      women and it correlates with age.

      Removal of endometrial polyps in postmenopausal symptomatic (bleeding, pain, vaginal
      discharge) women is the standard of care, same goes for asymptomatic women with risk factors
      (e.g., hypertension, history of breast, ovary, endometrial or colon cancer, Tamoxifen or
      estrogen treatment, over-weight, no ovulation, previous endometrial hyperplasia) due to a
      relatively high risk for malignancy. However treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women
      endometrial polyp but no risk factors is disputable.

      Article published in the recent years introduced a similar rate of involvement of malignant
      and pre-malignant changes in polyps removed from post-menopausal women, symptomatic and
      asymptomatic (3.2% versus 3.9%, respectively).

      In light of ambiguity in literature regarding the rate of malignant and pre-malignant
      findings in polyps in asymptomatic post-menopausal women, and in light of the fact that all
      major studies in this field were made retrospectively, we are asking to conduct a prospective
      study in order to evaluate and compare the incidence of malignant and pre-malignant changes
      in symptomatic and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial polyp
