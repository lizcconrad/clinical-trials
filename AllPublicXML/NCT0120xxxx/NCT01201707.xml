  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to determine if venous angioplasty is an effective treatment for
      chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). In this condition, areas of narrowing or
      blockages are present in the internal jugular or azygos veins (veins which drain blood from
      the central nervous system) and these blockages may be associated with symptoms classically
      attributed to MS. Therefore, angioplasty may help to improve the symptoms associated with
      CCSVI and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      effectiveness of angioplasty in the treatment of CCSVI by comparing two the outcomes of two
      groups of patients: one group with CCSVI diagnosed on a venogram and treated with angioplasty
      and one group with CCSVI diagnosed on a venogram but not treated. The patients enrolled in
      this study, and the neurologist evaluating patients after the procedure, will not know
      whether or not they were treated with angioplasty.
