  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are hoping to figure out how youth with type 1 diabetes can best control
      their blood glucose levels after meals, by determining whether accurate carbohydrate dosing
      or the timing of the bolus is more important. There is evidence to suggest that each strategy
      is important for blood glucose control. Unfortunately, for some people, prebolusing is
      difficult, because they may not know how much they are going to eat. To give an exact dose of
      insulin 20 minutes before a meal can be difficult. In this study, the investigators would
      like to show that taking even just part of the insulin bolus 20 minutes before the meal is
      preferable to waiting until mealtime and taking the entire bolus. To do this, the
      investigators will have 24 patients in the study, who will each spend 4 mornings at The
      investigators clinic. The order of the visits will be selected randomly. The visits will
      include: taking full bolus at mealtime, taking full bolus 20 minute before mealtime, taking ½
      bolus at mealtime, and taking ½ bolus 20 minutes before mealtime. At each visit, the person
      will eat the same meal, but the timing and amount of the bolus will be different. The
      investigators will measure the blood glucose levels with a blood glucose meter, and also with
      a laboratory test called YSI. The investigators will also be measuring the glucose levels
      under the person's skin with a continuous glucose monitor. The investigators will compare the
      area under the curve for the different visits, as well as the glucose levels at different
      points after the meal.
