      Main object is to investigate the safety profile of Levitra in combination use with
      alpha-blockers in patients with erectile dysfunction used in clinical practice after launch.

      In the initial combination date and the first and second observation after initial
      combination date, number of tablets prescribed, dose of tablets and number of tablets taken
      until follow-up visit will be investigated. The efficacy and tolerability will be evaluated
      at 2 months after initial combination date.
