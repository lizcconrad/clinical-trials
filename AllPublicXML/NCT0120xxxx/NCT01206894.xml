  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (75% of lung cancer) is associated with involvement of the
      parietal pleura and or chest wall (soft tissue and/or bone) in 5-8% of patients. Invasion of
      the chest wall increases the T staging in the Tumor, Node, Mestasis (TNM) classification
      system of lung cancer to a T3 and is associated with decreased survival and more extensive
      operative procedures. The reported 5-year survival for patients with T2 tumors is 58%
      compared to 38% in patients with T3 lesions. The American college of Chest Physician has
      still not identified the best tool to assess chest wall invasion by lung cancer, CT-Scan
      being used by physicians for this assessment. In some studies, CT scan has been shown to have
      a sensitivity ranging from 42 % to 68 % in assessing chest wall invasion, and a specificity
      ranging from 66 % to 100 %.

      Trans-thoracic Ultrasound (US) has the capacity of allowing for dynamic real-time imaging of
      the pulmonary lesion and the chest wall. Therefore, US has the potential to allow for the
      appreciation of subtle findings related to the movement of the lesion and lung over the chest
      wall. Hence, US might be an accurate tool to assess chest wall invasion by lung cancer; thus
      improving pre-operative diagnosis, staging and operative planning of patient with chest wall
      invasion.

      However US is not currently utilized in the pre-operative assessment of patients with lung
      cancer invading the pleura and chest wall, and has not been extensively studied.

      In some rare studies evaluating the accuracy of US, results have shown a sensitivity ranging
      from 89% to 100% and a specificity ranging from 95% to 98% for US detecting chest wall
      invasion by lung cancer. However those studies got criticized. Bandi et al study, got
      criticized by the fact that the operators in the study were experienced interventional
      pulmonologists who perform hundreds of thoracic and endoscopic ultrasound per year. Nobuo et
      al study took place in 1993, since when the device of US has evolved, the investigators can
      not apply with certainty the findings of this study.

      Consequently, there is a need to conduct a study to evaluate the accuracy of US to assess
      chest wall invasion by lung cancer.

      In this prospective study the investigators will assess the accuracy of US, and then compare
      it to the accuracy of the CT-Scan
