  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute splenic sequestration is a frequent and life threatening complication occurring in
      approximately 10 % of homozygous children. Maximal incidence is between 6 and 18 months.

      The investigators formulate the hypothesis that there are clinical, biological and genetic
      markers predictive of severe complications notably acute splenic sequestration in SCD
      children. The present research project thus aims at analyzing in a forward-looking way the
      profile of severity by analysing clinical, biological and genetic characteristics in a
      multicentric cohort of 60 SCD children

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multicentric analysis will be conducted in a cohort of 150 SS or S ß ° children
      diagnosed at birth, included at 3 -5 months and followed up to the age of 24 months.

      Five visits, superimposed to the usual follow-up of SCD children, (Recommendations of the
      High Authority of Health) at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months will
      allow a clinical evaluation and an additional sampling of blood (5 mL) at each visit.

      The samples will allow 1.analysis of the red blood cell phenotype (adhesion and
      deformability) and densities 2. the genetic profile 3.to establish a cell bank, a sera bank
      and a DNA bank, Spleen function in the cohort will be estimated by spleen scintigraphy,
      coupled with blood markers (pitted cells, Howell-Jolly bodies counts)
