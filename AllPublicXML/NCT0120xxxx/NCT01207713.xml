    <textblock>
      To assess the functional and cosmetic outcomes of enucleation with rectus end-to-end suturing
      surgical technique between 2005 and 2009. All the patients underwent primary enucleation and
      implantation of non-wrapped HA implants using a technique that involves drawing the ends of
      the rectus muscles anteriorly and suturing them into a cross-shape in front of the implant.
      Main outcome measures included occurrence of pain or discharge, soft tissue problems, implant
      motility, upper lid position, and patients' satisfaction.
