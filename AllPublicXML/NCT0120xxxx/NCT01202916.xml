    <textblock>
      Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are the first cause of congenital malformations with an
      incidence of 8 for 1000 births. Within the two past decades prenatal diagnosis has had a
      great impact on CHD prevalence. France was the first country to show the impact of prenatal
      diagnosis on the lowering prevalence of the most severe CHD, the hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome. Since the 90's, great advances in pediatric cardiac surgery, intensive care and
      cardiac catheterization have led to lower mortality and morbidity in this population.
      Prevalence of &quot; GUCH &quot;, grown-ups with congenital heart disease has thus been significantly
      increasing. For all these reasons and as the investigators can also see in other many chronic
      diseases, new questions about the quality of life of these patients arise among patients,
      parents/future parents, doctors, patients associations, and public health organizations. In
      2007 French government promoted a national public health plan for &quot;improvement of the quality
      of life among patients suffering from chronic illnesses&quot;. First step of such a program is to
      correctly evaluate this quality of life. Indeed the concept of &quot;quality of life&quot; (QoL)
      remains subjective and difficult to appreciate and measure. Its analysis requires the use of
      validated questionnaires. Few questionnaires are available in Europe, especially in
      pediatrics. Few studies in this population have been led and no comparative study to a
      control randomized group has been published. The investigators study aims to analyze in the
      investigators tertiary care center in pediatric cardiology the QoL among 8 to 18 year old
      French patients with CHD using a validated questionnaire (Kidscreen™) and to compare it to
      same aged healthy children. The investigators secondarily intend to :- validate the French
      version of one reference pediatric QoL questionnaire used in most publications in the USA
      (PedsQL™). - compare the QoL to the severity of the CHD using a published semi-quantitative
      score.- compare the QoL to the severity of the CHD using the results of routine exercise
      tests (VO2 max) performed routinely in the investigators center. The investigators hypothesis
      are that :- Quality of life of most common and not severe CHD is close to that of healthy
      children. - QoL of severe CHD is not so well correlated to severity of CHD.- PedsQL™ is a
      simple questionnaire which can be used in France in routine follow-up of children with CHD.
