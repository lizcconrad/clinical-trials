    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of single, oral ascending doses, and repeat oral doses of GSK1325756
      administered to healthy adult male volunteers. This study is the First Time in Human study
      for GSK1325756.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK) and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of single and repeat oral doses of GSK1325756 in healthy, male volunteer subjects,
      including the assessment of the effect of GSK1325756 on ex vivo 'C-X-C Motif Ligand 1'
      (CXCL1)-induced 'Cluster of Differentiation 11b' (CD11b) cell surface expression on
      peripheral blood neutrophils. Selective antagonism of the interaction between 'C-X-C Receptor
      Type 2' (CXCR2) and its various chemokine ligands provides a potential strategy for reducing
      the underlying inflammation that contributes to the progression of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This study is the first administration of GSK1325756 to humans and
      will be conducted in four cohorts.

      Cohorts 1 and 2 will comprise of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation
      of GSK132576 in healthy adult males in two interlocking cohorts.

      The data generated from this single dose escalation component of the study (safety,
      tolerability, and where applicable, PK profile, and, if available, PD data) will enable
      decisions regarding progression from one to dose the next higher dose later within Cohorts 1
      and 2. This data will also be reviewed in decisions regarding study progression to repeat
      dosing in Cohorts 3 and 4, and the most suitable doses of GSK1325756 that should be selected
      for these repeat dose cohorts.

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
