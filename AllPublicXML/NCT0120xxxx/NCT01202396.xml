  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pouchitis is a common complication following proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal
      anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). It affects the quality of life
      and can become a chronic problem. The aetiology of pouchitis is not completely understood. A
      crucial role of the intestinal microbiota has been suggested, but no causative agent has been
      identified so far. Furthermore, the defensin expression and the epithelial integrity are
      altered in inflammatory bowel diseases and may play an important role in the development of
      intestinal inflammation. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the interaction between an
      altered microbiota composition, a defective epithelial integrity and changes in innate
      defense parameters such as defensins has a pivotal role in the development of pouchitis in UC
      patients.

    <description>A phylogenetic microarray will be used to characterize the luminal and mucosal microbiota composition (based on the SSU rRNA gene)of pouch patients with and without pouchitis. Anticipated results are the identification of specific bacterial profiles, genera and/or species dat are discriminating between subgroups.</description>
