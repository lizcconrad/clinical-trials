  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
      phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Elevated plasma levels of phenylalanine (phe) cause mental
      retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, eczema, and behavior problems. Adequate
      control of the plasma levels of phe by a phe-restricted diet can prevent the developmental
      and behavioral problems.

      The foundation of this diet is a phe-free medical product/formula made from free amino acids.
      Based on longitudinal studies, it has been reported that the most benefit is attained by
      individuals who maintain a phe-restricted diet throughout life. Despite the obvious benefits
      of the diet, it has been suggested that the dietary restrictions may be associated with poor
      bone health in these patients. However, data supporting this has been reported in studies
      with small sample sizes and/or inadequate sample populations that include children. There is
      a paucity of data on bone health in adults with HPA.

      The investigators propose an observational study to describe the bone health status among
      adults with a diagnosis of HPA and to compare them to established normative age and
      gender-specific values among healthy individuals. The investigators hypothesize that adults
      with HPA will have lower bone density as measured by a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan
      compared to the established normative values.
