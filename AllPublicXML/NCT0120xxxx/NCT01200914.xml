  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon angioplasty is used to open up a narrowing that forms in hemodialysis fistula. Two
      areas of particular problems are the terminal portion of the cephalic vein near the shoulder
      and the central veins in the chest. Although angioplasty is standard of care the treated
      narrowed segments of vein mostly renarrow within 3 months requiring retreatment to keep your
      dialysis access functional. Recently there has been introduction of a new technology called a
      covered stent graft. Initial studies suggest that placing this device across the area of
      narrowing leads to dialysis access staying open longer and needing less angioplasty
      treatments.

      This study is designed to compare angioplasty (standard of care) versus using a covered stent
      graft. The investigators will then look at the dialysis records and future fistulograms to
      see if there is decreased flow through the fistula at 3, 6 and 12 months after the initial
      procedure.

      This is a randomized, prospective, unblinded study with 1:1 randomization. Both groups will
      undergo PTA of stenotic lesion and patients will be randomized such that 50% will receive a
      covered stent in addition to the PTA. Patients will be followed at 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-procedure. Follow-up will be conducted with either angiographic and/or transonic
      measurements.
