    <textblock>
      Psychoeducation has been the only group treatment developed for bipolar disorder thus far.
      Deficits in emotion regulation, a core impairment among patients with bipolar disorder, are
      not directly addressed in this treatment. The objective of this study is to develop a group
      treatment for bipolar disorder that focuses on emotion regulation strategies (Enhancing
      Emotion Regulation; EER). This study will examine the efficacy of this treatment using an
      open trial design. It is hypothesized that patients who receive EER will show a reduction in
      mood symptoms and improvement in well-being. Reductions in emotion regulation difficulties
      will predict improvements.
