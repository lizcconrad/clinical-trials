  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) can have tumors that grow on the auditory
      nerves and cause hearing loss. These tumors are called vestibular schwannomas (VSs), or
      acoustic neuromas. People with NF2 can also get schwannomas in other parts of their body, as
      well as tumors called meningiomas and ependymomas. Because VSs can cause hearing loss, many
      people with NF2 will have treatment to preserve their hearing. This treatment usually
      involves surgery. Because surgery has risks and is not able to help everyone with VSs, other
      methods of treatment are being explored. One area of exploration is looking to see if there
      is a drug that can be taken that might prevent the VSs from growing larger and causing
      hearing loss or brainstem compression. This study is exploring whether a drug that is
      approved by the FDA and is currently used to treat other tumors might also work to treat VSs.
      Based on people who have taken this drug to treat VSs already, there is some reason to think
      that it might be helpful to certain people with NF2. People enrolled in this study will
      receive the drug one time every three weeks for one year by infusion. This study will follow
      subjects over the course of the year that the person is taking the drug and for six months
      after the drug is stopped. This study is recruiting people who have NF2 and are currently
      having symptoms of tinnitus, dizziness, and/or hearing loss from their VSs. If you have NF2
      and are currently having symptoms caused by your VSs, you may be eligible to participate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the activity of bevacizumab for
      treatment of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas (VS) defined as progressive hearing loss in
      patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) based on objective hearing response.

      SECONDARY OJBECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab in this patient population on an
      every three week dosing schedule of 7.5mg/kg for 12 months of therapy.

      II. Assess the rate of radiographic response (&gt;= 20% reduction in volume). III. Determine the
      growth rate of VS using volumetric MRI analysis in comparison to 1-dimensional and
      2-dimensional measurements.

      IV. Assess changes in function of the auditory system during bevacizumab treatment.

      V. Assess the vascular permeability (Ktrans), relative cerebral blood volume/flow, mean
      transit time, and mean vessel diameter from perfusion-weighted MRI.

      VI. Assess the change in circulating endothelial cells, circulating progenitor cells, and
      plasma angiogenic proteins in subjects receiving bevacizumab treatment.

      VII. Observe the impact of bevacizumab on non-VS tumors in patients with NF2 via whole body
      MRI.

      VIII. Explore hearing related QOL measures throughout treatment. IX. Explore the effect of
      treatment with bevacizumab on vestibular function (to be evaluated at NCI only).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 3 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.

    <description>A hearing response was defined as increased word recognition score above the 95% critical threshold that is maintained across two sequential evaluation time points. The word recognition score (WRS) is the percentage of phonetically-balanced, monosyllabic words that a patient can accurately repeat presented at either most comfortable level or most intelligible level.The proportion of patients with hearing response in the target ear was estimated using a binomial distribution along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>The primary DPOAE measurement will be treated non-parametrically (present or absent across time) DPOAE's will be considered present at the frequency of F2 when the distortion product is 6dB above the noise floor. Variables will be analyzed for differences using t-tests if the effects and sample sizes warrant, but this may not be advisable given the small numbers to be accrued.</description>

    <description>Correlation assessment were planned for imaging parameters and hearing response based on the estimated changes in Ktrans: a MRI measure of vascular permeability. Only 1/14 participants had complete Ktrans data that was amenable to analysis at baseline and week 72. Hence, these statistical analyses were not possible.</description>

             informed consent process

          -  The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because anti-angiogenic agents are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with nervous system tumors associated with NF2 (e.g., schwannomas,
             meningiomas, ependymomas, or gliomas) will not be excluded from this clinical trial as
             long as these tumors do not require treatment with radiation, surgery, or medical

             anesthesia

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as:

               -  Inadequately controlled HTN (adult subjects: SBP &gt; 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt; 90 mmHg
                  despite antihypertensive medication, pediatric subjects: Requirement for
                  antihypertensive treatment prior to enrollment, or diastolic blood pressure &gt;

               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

          -  Pregnant women (positive pregnancy test) are excluded from this study because
             bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with bevacizumab; both
             fertile men and women must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures during study
             therapy and for at least 6 months after the completion of bevacizumab therapy;
             abstinence is considered an adequate contraceptive measure

               -  In the event that a minor (age 12-17) who undergoes a pregnancy test as part of
                  the screening process receives a positive result, they will be excluded from the
                  study and their parent(s) of record will be notified of this result

          -  HIV-positive patients or cancer survivors are eligible for this study if they fulfill
             all other eligibility criteria

          -  Inability to perform volumetric measurement of target VS (e.g., due to the MRI
             artifact from auditory brainstem implant or due to presence of collision tumor (two or
             more tumors abutting each other) in the cerebellopontine angle); Note: questions about
             the ability to perform volumetric analysis on a baseline MRI scan should be directed
             to the study radiologist, Dr. Gregory Sorensen

          -  Concurrent use of anti-coagulant drugs (not including prophylactic doses), history of
             coagulopathy, or evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  Imaging (CT or MRI) evidence of newly identified hemorrhage (new within the last in
             the 6 months prior to enrollment), any history of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage,
             or any history of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage

          -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 6 months prior to day 1

          -  Invasive procedures defined as follows:

               -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28
                  days prior to Day 1 therapy

               -  Brain biopsy within 28 days prior to day 1 of therapy (wounds must be fully
                  healed from brain biopsies performed more than 28 days prior to day 1 of therapy)

               -  Anticipation of need for major surgical procedures during the course of the study

               -  Core biopsy within 7 days prior to D1 therapy

          -  Prior treatment with bevacizumab or other VEGF targeting therapies

          -  Personal history of autoimmune coagulopathy, including idiopathic thrombocytopenia

          <description>The Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale is a provider reported measure of functional status. Decile scores are assigned, ranging from 0 to 100. A lower score (minimum 0) represents greater functional impairment. A higher score (maximum 100) represents less functional impairment. KPS can be used measure changes in a patient's functional status.</description>

        <description>A hearing response was defined as increased word recognition score above the 95% critical threshold that is maintained across two sequential evaluation time points. The word recognition score (WRS) is the percentage of phonetically-balanced, monosyllabic words that a patient can accurately repeat presented at either most comfortable level or most intelligible level.The proportion of patients with hearing response in the target ear was estimated using a binomial distribution along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

          <description>A hearing response was defined as increased word recognition score above the 95% critical threshold that is maintained across two sequential evaluation time points. The word recognition score (WRS) is the percentage of phonetically-balanced, monosyllabic words that a patient can accurately repeat presented at either most comfortable level or most intelligible level.The proportion of patients with hearing response in the target ear was estimated using a binomial distribution along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>
          <population>All people who underwent treatment were analyzed. Two patients stopped treatment early. One due to toxicity at week 25 and one due to need for medical care not permitted while on treatment at week 49.</population>

        <title>Quality of Life as Assessed by the Speech and Spatial Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ)</title>
        <description>The SSQ is a 49 item patient-reported outcome with three subscales: speech understanding (14 questions), spatial location of sounds (17 questions), and the qualities of sounds (18 questions) as they appear to the patient with hearing impairment. Responses are recorded on an 11 point scale (0 - 10), with the anchor points &quot;not at all&quot; (= 0) and &quot;perfectly&quot; (=10). A higher score indicates better hearing.</description>
