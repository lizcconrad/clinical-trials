  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-marketing study is to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety
      outcome of treatment with ChondroMimetic in a patient population within the proposed
      indication (osteochondral cartilage defects), over a 36 months post-implantation follow-up
      period.

      The primary objective is to collect post-marketing safety data in a real life setting by
      means of (S)ADR reporting.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Clinical outcome as assessed by patient reported EuroQoL-5D

        -  Structural repair as assessed by MRI

        -  The number of treatment failures and the time to treatment failure

        -  The ease of use of ChondroMimetic as reported by the surgeon

    <measure>EuroQoL-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12, 24, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Structural repair will be assessed by MRI. The available MRIs will be collected and scored by an independent radiologist, using the published MOCART score , and one additional item, level of the subchondral bone plate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure is defined as &quot;a re-intervention on the index lesion, prompted by persistence or recurrence of symptoms related to the index knee&quot;. The date of failure is the actual date of re-intervention.</description>

    <description>The Chondromimetic implant is intended to serve as a scaffold for cellular and tissue ingrowth in osteochrondral defect repair such as bone and/or cartilage.
The plug consists of a chondral layer with collagen and GAG and an osseus layer with collagen, GAG, and calcium phosphate.</description>
