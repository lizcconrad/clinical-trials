  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative right ventricular end-systolic area (RV-ESA) and hemoglobin level were suggested
      as independent prognosticator for predicting long-term prognosis in patients with isolated
      severe TR undergoing corrective surgery We attempted to explore whether early postoperative
      echocardiography provides additional prognostic information on top of preoperative clinical
      and echocardiographic variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We prospectively recruited patients with isolated severe TR undergoing corrective surgery.
      Comprehensive preoperative echocardiography was performed in all patients, with the
      performance of early postoperative echocardiography in all patients. During follow-up,
      clinical events, defined as operative mortality (death within 30 days after surgery or before
      discharge), cardiovascular death, repeated open heart surgery, and readmission due to
      cardiovascular problems were investigated.
