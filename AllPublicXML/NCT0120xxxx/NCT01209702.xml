  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have
      failed treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and are naïve to tumor necrsos
      factor (TNF) antagonist therapy. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be randomized to
      receive either RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo every 4 weeks for 12
      weeks. In Part 2, patients will be randomized to receive RoActemra at either 8 mg/kg or 4
      mg/kg IV or placebo every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The double-blind treatment period will be
      followed by open-label treatment with RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks until Week
      208 for all patients. Anticipated time on study treatment is 208 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a Phase II/III seamless, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in patients with AS who were naïve to TNF antagonist therapy. The
      study consisted of 2 parts, each preceded by a screening visit and followed by a common
      open-label extension phase. Recruitment into Part 2 commenced after completion of enrollment
      for Part 1.

      Part 1 was designed as a Phase II study exploring the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab
      therapy versus placebo. Part 1 was intended to determine whether Part 2 of the study would
      continue, based on a Week 12 analysis.

      Part 2 was designed to provide pivotal Phase III efficacy and safety data for tocilizumab in
      patients with AS. Approximately 400 patients were to be enrolled. Once randomization into
      Part 1 was complete, randomization into Part 2 of the study was to be initiated.

      Based on the results of the Week 12 Part 1 analyses of the primary endpoint (ASAS20) and
      secondary endpoints, and in consideration of all available safety data, a benefit/risk
      assessment was made and it was decided to halt the study because of lack of overall efficacy.
      Most patients did not complete the 24-week double-blind treatment period in Part 2.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is a patient-administered assessment of 6 parameters specific to AS. The following parameters were assessed on a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness, and duration of morning stiffness. For questions 1 to 5, the left-hand extreme of the line (0) represents &quot;none&quot; (symptom-free) and the right-hand extreme (100) represents &quot;very severe&quot; (maximum severity). For question 6, a time axis was used, with the left-hand extreme of the line representing &quot;0 hours&quot; and the right-hand extreme representing &quot;2 or more hours&quot;. The BASDAI score was calculated as follows:
BASDAI = [Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + (Q5 + Q6)/2]/5. The total score is tabulated on a scale from 0 (best) to 10 cm (worst).</description>

    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index linear function is a combined index of 5 clinical measurements (performed by the Joint Assessor) which reflect axial mobility in the AS patient. The measurements to assess mobility are:
Tragus-to-wall;
Modified Schober (lumbar flexion);
Cervical rotation;
Lateral spinal flexion;
Intermalleolar distance.
The BASMI linear result is the average of the 5 assessments and ranges from 0 to 10. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their AS.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>In Part 1, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or tocilizumab (TCZ) 8 mg/kg. In Part 2, patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to TCZ 8 mg/kg, TCZ 4 mg/kg, or placebo, respectively. Due to the early stopping of the study and limitations in available data the TCZ dose groups in Part 2 were combined.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>ASAS is composed of four domains. To achieve an ASAS20 response required improvement of ≥20% and ≥ 1 unit (10 mm) in at least 3 domains and no worsening of ≥ 20 % and ≥ 1 unit (10 mm) in the remaining domain.
The patient's global assessment of current disease status, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), from symptom-free / no AS symptoms (0) to maximum AS disease severity (100).
The patient’s overall assessment of the severity of spinal pain based on responses to 2 questions assessed on a 100 mm VAS, from no pain (0) to most severe pain (100). The spinal pain score is the mean of these 2 questions.
The function component was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). The patient provides self-assessment of 10 questions on a 100 mm VAS. The BASFI score is the mean of these values.
The inflammation component of the ASAS was determined by the mean of questions 5 and 6 of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI).</description>

        <description>Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) is composed of four domains.
The patient's global assessment of current disease status, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), from symptom-free / no AS symptoms (0) to maximum AS disease severity (100).
The patient's overall assessment of the severity of spinal pain based on responses to 2 questions assessed on a 100 mm VAS, from no pain (0) to most severe pain (100). The spinal pain score is the mean of these 2 questions.
The function component was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the mean of 10 self-assessment questions on a 100 mm VAS.
The inflammation component of the ASAS was determined by the mean of questions 5 and 6 of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI).
Each of the above 4 domains are measured on a scale from 0-100 mm, but reported on a 0-10 cm scale. A score of less than 2 units (20 mm) in each domain is defined as partial remission.</description>

        <description>The BASDAI is a patient-administered assessment of 6 parameters specific to AS. The following parameters were assessed on a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue: fatigue, spinal pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, intensity of morning stiffness, and duration of morning stiffness. For questions 1 to 5, the left-hand extreme of the line (0) represents &quot;none&quot; (symptom-free) and the right-hand extreme (100) represents &quot;very severe&quot; (maximum severity). For question 6, a time axis was used, with the left-hand extreme of the line representing &quot;0 hours&quot; and the right-hand extreme representing &quot;2 or more hours&quot;. The BASDAI score was calculated as follows:
BASDAI = [Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + (Q5 + Q6)/2]/5. The total score is tabulated on a scale from 0 (best) to 10 cm (worst).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</title>
        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is an assessment of function in AS patients. The participant provides their assessment of their ability to perform 10 activities on a 100 mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (easy) to 100 (impossible). The BASFI score is the mean of these values and is tabulated on a 0 (best) to 10 (worst) cm scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI)</title>
        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index linear function is a combined index of 5 clinical measurements (performed by the Joint Assessor) which reflect axial mobility in the AS patient. The measurements to assess mobility are:
Tragus-to-wall;
Modified Schober (lumbar flexion);
Cervical rotation;
Lateral spinal flexion;
Intermalleolar distance.
The BASMI linear result is the average of the 5 assessments and ranges from 0 to 10. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient’s limitation of movement due to their AS.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving a 20% Improvement in Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS20) at Week 12</title>
        <description>ASAS is composed of four domains. To achieve an ASAS20 response required improvement of ≥20% and ≥ 1 unit (10 mm) in at least 3 domains and no worsening of ≥ 20 % and ≥ 1 unit (10 mm) in the remaining domain.
The patient's global assessment of current disease status, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), from symptom-free / no AS symptoms (0) to maximum AS disease severity (100).
The patient's overall assessment of the severity of spinal pain based on responses to 2 questions assessed on a 100 mm VAS, from no pain (0) to most severe pain (100). The spinal pain score is the mean of these 2 questions.
The function component was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI). The patient provides self-assessment of 10 questions on a 100 mm VAS. The BASFI score is the mean of these values.
The inflammation component of the ASAS was determined by the mean of questions 5 and 6 of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI).</description>
