      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and either kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radioactive
      substances together with antibodies may be effective treatment for some advanced cancers.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin
      calcium (FOLFIRI), work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies together with combination
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of
      yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) monoclonal antibody M5A when given
      together with combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab in treating patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a combination of FOLFIRI
      chemotherapy, and intravenous yttrium-90 (90Y) M5A anti-CEA antibody.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To study the progression free survival and response rate of this
      combined treatment in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.II. To evaluate the
      biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of 90Y and 111In (indium-111) M5A administered
      intravenously.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody
      M5A. Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over
      2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      once every 2 weeks. Patients also receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A
      IV over 25 minutes once in weeks 3 and 9. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
