  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantation is used to treat a wide range of
      life-threatening conditions. T lymphocytes carried in the graft have powerful beneficial
      effects and play a vital role in the eradication of leukaemia and in fighting infection, but
      can also damage healthy tissues and cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      To safeguard against GVHD, the investigators propose modifying T cells to encode a 'switch'
      so that they can be eliminated if problems arise.

      Children receiving half-matched (haploidentical) transplants from a parent are most likely to
      benefit from this strategy. At present these patients receive blood stem cells from a parent,
      but the T cells are removed because the risk of serious GVHD is unacceptable. This means that
      they are much more likely to suffer from life threatening infections or experience a relapse
      of leukaemia. The investigators want to use gene therapy to produce &quot;safe&quot; T cells which can
      be used to strengthen the transplant and prevent these serious complications.
