  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-site dose sparing intradermal influenza vaccination in elderly had been studied but
      resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes. The investigators evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of the two-site intradermal injection of influenza vaccine containing all 6 and 12 micrograms
      of hemagglutinin antigen per strain (with 4/10th and 8/10th of a regular 15 microgram
      HA/strain intramuscular vaccine respectively) in elderly over 60 years of age. An influenza
      vaccine administered intramuscularly at the standard dose is used as the reference vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects would be randomly divided into three groups of 60 subjects each. Group1 receives
      a single intramuscular dose of 0.5 ml of trivalent influenza vaccine, containing at least 15
      microgram of hemagglutinin antigen per strain, Group II receives two-site intradermal dose of
      0.1 ml each, containing at least 3 microgram of hemagglutinin antigen per strain per site and
      group III receives two-site intradermal dose of 0.2 ml each, containing at least 6 microgram
      of hemagglutinin antigen per strain per site. Check for HA Antibody
