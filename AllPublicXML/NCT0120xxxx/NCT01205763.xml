    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators intend to demonstrate that the hook plate may have adverse
      effects on subacromial structures even with a short period of hardware retention. The
      investigators also sought to determine if musculoskeletal sonography could be used as a tool
      to demonstrate shoulder pathology such as subacromial impingement or rotator cuff tear in
      patients receiving hook plate fixation. The clinical results of patients receiving hook plate
      fixation, specifically bony union, pain relief, shoulder function and range of motion (ROM),
      were also evaluated.
