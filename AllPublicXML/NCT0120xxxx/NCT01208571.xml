    <textblock>
      The effect of alcohol interventions seems to be related to the intensity of the
      interventions. In this study the investigators will assess the effect of a interdisciplinary
      &quot;booster session&quot; in primary care, given to patients who were admitted to hospitals with
      alcohol related conditions, and who were given Brief Intervention before discharge. The
      booster session is based on a motivational interview.

      The study is a randomized clinical trial, and aims to recruit 60 X 2 patients. Patients
      admitted to Stavanger University Hospital with an alcohol contributed condition, and who has
      been given a brief alcohol intervention may be recruited. Candidates for secondary healthcare
      related to alcohol misuse will be excluded. The interdisciplinary &quot;booster&quot; session will be
      given two weeks after discharge, and will be given in the facility of the primary care
      physician, facilitated by both the physician and an liaison alcohol nurse from Stavanger
      University Hospital. The intervention is based on motivational interview technique. The
      primary outcome will be assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-C, six
      months after discharge. The outcome assessor will be blinded for the intervention. All
      outcomes will be collected by telephone interview.

      The study aims to start recruiting candidates in October-November 2010, and will stoop
      recruiting in December 2012 at the latest.

      The study was approved by the national ethical comite in August 2011. The results of the
      study wil be published in international referee based journals.
