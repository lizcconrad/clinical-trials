  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV medicines have led to dramatic improvements in health. However, there remains a concern
      for potential drug toxicities, cost of drugs, and need for life-long treatment. In addition,
      research has found that health is not completely restored in HIV-infected patients, even if
      they have been taking effective HIV medicines for a long time. This may be due to direct
      drug-toxicity, continued replication of the virus, and/or inflammation of the body in
      response to the virus. Therefore, a more complete understanding of how HIV stays in the body
      is necessary.

      Recent research has shown that one of the places that HIV can stay in the body is in
      lymphatic tissues such as lymph nodes (even in patients who have been taking HIV medicines
      for a long time). In addition, the amount of damage to the lymphatic tissues can predict how
      the immune system (CD4+ T cell count) will respond to therapy.

      The investigators therefore propose a study in which lymph nodes from the groin area will be
      removed, with the goals of: 1) seeing how much HIV is in lymph nodes and 2) seeing how much
      damage has happened to the lymph node architecture.

        We propose a study in which inguinal lymph node biopsies will be performed on HIV-infected
        and uninfected subjects, with the goals of: 1) quantifying and characterizing residual
        virus in lymph nodes and 2) quantifying and comparing lymph node architecture in untreated
        subjects, HAART-suppressed subjects, elite controllers, and HIV-negative subjects. This
        research study will permit a lymph node biopsy to be performed and peripheral blood to be
        obtained from patients with HIV disease. Subjects with HIV or without HIV infection who
        have no contraindications to lymph node biopsy will be invited to participate in this
        study.
