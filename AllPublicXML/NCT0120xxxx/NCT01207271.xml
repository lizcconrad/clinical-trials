  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare supportive-expressive therapy, a type of psychodynamic
      psychotherapy, with cognitive therapy for the treatment of depression in community mental
      health consumers.

      Hypothesized mediators of treatment will also be examined.

      The goal of this study is to conduct a randomized, comparative, non-inferiority clinical
      trial that tests the hypothesis that a widely used form of manualized dynamic psychotherapy
      (supportive-expressive psychodynamic therapy) is not inferior to cognitive therapy when
      implemented in community mental health settings for the treatment of major depressive
      disorder (MDD). The specific aims are (1) to conduct a randomized non-inferiority trial to
      compare supportive-expressive psychodynamic therapy and cognitive therapy for patients with
      MDD and (2) to assess the comparative effectiveness of supportive-expressive psychodynamic
      therapy and cognitive therapy on secondary measures of symptoms, patient functioning, and
      quality of life.

      Patient mediators of outcome will also be examined through an additional grant awarded to
      Paul Crits-Christoph, Ph.D. This grant was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health
      - RO1MH092363-01. This grant is entitled:&quot;The mechanisms of cognitive and dynamic therapy in
      community settings.&quot;

      Recruitment will occur solely through community mental health clinics in and around
      Philadelphia.
