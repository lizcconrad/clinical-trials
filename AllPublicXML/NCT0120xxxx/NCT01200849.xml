  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to test the efficacy of an evidence-based, enhanced Rx
      container label design to improve Spanish speaking patients' understanding of instructions
      for use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=960) to evaluate the efficacy
      of the enhanced Rx container label to improve, Spanish speaking, diabetic and/or hypertensive
      patients' understanding of actual prescribed medicines, compared to a standard label format.
      Spanish-speaking patients with type II diabetes and/or hypertension at safety-net clinics
      affiliated with one central-fill pharmacy (Nova Scripts Central - NSC) receive all their
      prescribed medicines from this location. Recruited diabetic and/or hypertensive subjects in
      this study will be randomly assigned to either intervention (enhanced Rx container label) or
      control (standard Rx label). All pill-form, regular dosing schedule medicines, including
      diabetes and hypertensive (i.e. ACE inhibitor) medicines associated with patients' treatment
      will be labeled according to study arm by the central-fill pharmacy. Study subjects will be
      interviewed at the time of dispensing the prescribed medicines at the clinic, again three
      months later (dispensing of refill), and finally nine months after baseline (dispensing of
      refill). Pharmacy refill data and medical record information - linked at these clinics - will
      be collected for exploratory analyses. Patients' ability to read and demonstrate Rx label
      instructions, including auxiliary warnings, will be the primary outcomes for this aim. Data
      from the actual use trial will be processed, reviewed, analyzed (in order of hypotheses), and
      reports prepared during the final months of this last phase of the study. We anticipate
      several manuscripts to be developed as a result of this project, supported by the diverse key
      personnel and collaborating faculty enlisted.
