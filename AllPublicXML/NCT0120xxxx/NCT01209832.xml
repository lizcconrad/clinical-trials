  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether tasisulam acts as an inducer of CYP3A using
      midazolam as a sensitive and specific probe substrate of CYP3A.

      The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of tasisulam and midazolam given in
      combination and document any antitumor activity with tasisulam.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy or lymphoma that is
             advanced and/or metastatic disease which has not responded to standard therapy or for
             which no standard therapy exists.

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, cancer-related hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at
             least 30 days (45 days for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and
             recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Limited field radiotherapy is permitted
             (in consultation with the investigator)

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy, in the judgment of the investigator, of greater
             than or equal to 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             experimental agent for non-cancer indications that has not received regulatory
             approval for any indication

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not
             required). Patients with active brain metastasis are excluded

          -  Have current acute or chronic leukemia

          -  Patients who have clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
             or other respiratory diseases that may be at risk during periods of conscious sedation
             under midazolam

          -  Patients with a known history of obstructive sleep apnea, difficult intubation, or
             syndromes associated with airway abnormalities.
