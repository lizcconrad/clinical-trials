      General and specific objectives of the search: evaluate the effects of the administration of
      Antithrombin III (ATIII) on the activation of the coagulation system and of the fibrinolysis,
      platelet function, inflammatory response and markers of organ damage in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with low plasma levels of post-operative
      Antithrombin (AT).
