  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and North America. The aim of this trial is to investigate
      if liraglutide treatment can increase the proportion of insulin-independent subjects one year
      after islet cell transplantation who required only one (single-donor) islet cell transplant.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The decision to close the NN2211-3619 trial was based on the very low recruitment rate as well
    as challenges relating to trial execution and study completion.
