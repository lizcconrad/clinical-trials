      Participants complete up to two study visits of approximately 3-4 hours each. The first study
      visit involves an interview about life experiences and emotions. If the participant is
      eligible for the second assessment, the average length of time between visit 1 and visit 2
      will be 1-7 days. The second visit included physical measurements such as cholesterol and
      blood pressure, performing math and speaking tasks, and surveys to help us learn about
      healthy behaviors and emotions. No further follow-up of participants is conducted beyond the
      two study visits.
