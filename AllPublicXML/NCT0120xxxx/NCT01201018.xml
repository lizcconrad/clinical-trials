    <textblock>
      The study will be non randomized, open label, dose rising study in cancer patients. Cancer
      treatment is consisting of 2 different drugs: Oshadi D and Oshadi R that will be administered
      orally.

      The study will include two sessions:

        -  A single dose period to evaluate acute toxicity of each drug

        -  Consecutive multiple increment dose escalation period of both drugs to determine the
           long-term safety, and the anticancer activity.
