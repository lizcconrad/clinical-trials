  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multinational registry (3 USA, 2 European centers) will capture in the ED continuous non
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring (using Nexfin finger cuff technology) of patients presenting
      with acute heart failure, stroke syndromes and systemic infection. Patients will be observed
      after their Emergency Department (ED) disposition to determine clinical outcomes (length of
      stay in the hospital, the development of any organ dysfunction, mortality and need for
      unscheduled medical care within the ensuing 30 days). It is anticipated that specific ED
      hemodynamic profiles will be predictive of better clinical outcomes than others. This
      information will provide the outcome data needed to design future therapeutic trials that
      will evaluate the effect of ED hemodynamic manipulations on overall patient management and
      outcomes.

      The PREMIUM Registry is a multinational, prospective, observational convenience study of the
      ED hemodynamic profiles of patients presenting with acute CHF, stroke and systemic infections
      and their potential relationship with patient outcomes. Continuous hemodynamics will be
      measured by noninvasive means using the Nexfin device and outcomes (in hospital length of
      stay, the interval development of organ dysfunction and mortality or the need for unscheduled
      medical care within the ensuing 30 days) will be captured within the registry.

      The treating ED physicians will be blinded to the hemodynamic monitoring and there will be no
      modification of the standard care that each patient receives. Hospital charts will be
      reviewed and patients/family members will be additionally called at 30 days after the
      hospital visit in order to collect any additional outcome data.
