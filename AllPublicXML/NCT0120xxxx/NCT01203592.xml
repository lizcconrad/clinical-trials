      The study tests the notion that patients suffering from certain types of congenital
      myasthenic syndromes are benefitted by the use of Albuterol at doses used in clinical
      practice.

    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposal is to evaluate the effects of albuterol, an adrenergic agonist, in
      the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). Over the past 2 decades I found that
      some CMS patients refractory to or worsened by cholinergic agonists, namely those suffering
      from defects in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or Dok-7, respond to ephedrine, a medication used
      for over half-a-century in the treatment of autoimmune myasthenia gravis. After ephedrine
      became unavailable, I treated the same type of patients with albuterol in doses ranging from
      4 mg daily to twice daily for adults; the dose for children 6 to 12 years is 2 mg two or
      three times daily; the dose for children 2 to 6 years is 0.1 mg/kg/day (maximum 2 mg) three
      times daily. Evaluation of the effects of the medications are based on the Table shown below.

      effects of the medication. Continue on other side or separate page if necessary. Return this
      questionnaire to Dr. Andrew Engel (email:schaefer.cleo@mayo.edu) ,after treatment with
      albuterol for 1 month and then monthly thereafter, or mail to Dr. Andrew Engel, Department of
