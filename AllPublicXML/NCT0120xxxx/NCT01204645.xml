  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10-18% of the adult population and is becoming
      recognized as one of the most serious disorders causing increased risk for cardiovascular
      disease and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease 26% have increased creatinine,
      which rises to 40% if patients also have diabetes mellitus. Risk increases as renal function
      diminishes, and just slowing the rate of decline in renal function would have a tremendous
      impact on health and morbidity. This association is commonly termed the Cardiorenal Syndrome,
      though it is caused by a much more complex interplay between major pathogenetic pathways such
      as glucose metabolism and diabetes, systemic and tissue inflammation, tissue metabolism,
      coagulation, mineral metabolism, sympathetic activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
      activation, endothelial dysfunction, lipid metabolism, fetal programming etc.

      Karolinska Institutet recently merged basic and clinical researchers in all these fields,
      creating a Karolinska Kardiorenal Theme Centre; ultimately aiming to explore the syndrome and
      provide improved care for the individual patient.

      The investigators road to success:

        -  Creating a Biobank (blood, DNA, plasma) from the majority of all hosptalized patients
           with ACS in Stockholm county - Stockholmheartbank.

        -  This Theme Center include all teaching hospitals associated with Karolinska Institutet;
           Danderyd University Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and SÃ¶dersjukhuset
           University Hospital. Together theses hospitals serve as emergency hospitals for 1.9
           million people. The investigators are aiming at creating a biobank from all patients
           admitted for an acute coronary event (about 2.300/yr), which is a unique asset for
           molecular and genetic research as well as observational and intervention studies.

        -  The investigators have access to the National registry with 100% coverage, that contains
           data on all patients admitted to Stockholms coronary care units since 1995.

        -  To ensure translation in to clinical practice, most of the researchers are also MD:s,
           and several are clinically active.

        -  The clinical network facilitates the development of novel therapies and translational
           research.

        -  Steering groups for Education and a Clinical Practice implementation program.
