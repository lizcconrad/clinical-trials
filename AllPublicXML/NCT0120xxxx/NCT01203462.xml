  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of probiotic supplemented yogurt in
      reducing colonic transit time (CTT) in females between the ages of 18-65 years old. Two
      yogurts will be administered, one containing a specific strain of probiotic in the
      Bifidobacterium genus and the other without the probiotic supplement. It is hypothesized that
      subjects receiving the probiotic supplemented yogurt will experience reduced CTT and improved
      gastrointestinal comfort and quality of life compared to those receiving the non-probiotic
      supplemented yogurt.
