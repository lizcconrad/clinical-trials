  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is observational clinical trial to study adult urothelial cancer patients treated with
      cisplatin‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Hypothesis: Identification of genetic and molecular &quot;cisplatin susceptibility&quot; biomarkers
      will allow identification of urothelial cancer patients most likely to benefit from
      cisplatin‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial patients will submit germline (blood) and tumor tissue samples as part of two
      existing sample collection protocols for analysis of genetic and molecular markers governing
      response to chemotherapy. Pathologic review of tissue samples after neoadjuvant therapy will
      allow determination of the complete response rate (pT0 rate) and this will be compared
      between patients with &quot;susceptible&quot; and &quot;resistant&quot; genetic/molecular cisplatin
      susceptibility variants.

      Primary Endpoint: Analysis of whether a small set of previously‐identified germline
      &quot;cisplatin susceptibility&quot; polymorphisms associate with achievement of a complete pathologic
      response to neoadjuvant cisplatin‐based chemotherapy in urothelial cancer patients.

      Secondary Endpoints: To perform companion genetic or molecular analyses of other
      previously‐identified gene, SNP, or microRNA &quot;cisplatin susceptibility&quot; candidates in these
      patients, using tumor and/or germline tissue.

      Exploratory Endpoints: To perform unbiased, hypothesis‐generating SNP, gene, or microRNA
      array studies to identify novel germline or tumor determinants which may predict response to
      cisplatin‐based chemotherapy.

      Blood (germline) and tumor tissue samples will be used to perform genetic analysis. The
      purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a set of &quot;cisplatin susceptibility&quot;
      polymorphisms predict complete pathologic response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and to
      identify novel determinants which may predict response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      Samples will be biobanked for future analysis of genetic determinants.

        Eligible patients who are about to begin neoadjuvant cisplatin‐based chemotherapy for
        urothelial cancer and who have consented to IRB approved protocols #15550B and/or TRIDOM

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinical T2 through T4 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or upper
             tract.

          -  Patients must be deemed appropriate by the treating physician to require
             cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for urothelial cancer. Consideration of
             regional nodal status as part of the decision for appropriateness for neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy will be left to the treating physician.

          -  Patients must be scheduled to proceed to definitive urothelial cancer surgery,
             including either cystectomy or nephrectomy/ureterectomy, after chemotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving cisplatin‐based chemotherapy for urothelial cancer in the adjuvant
             setting or for metastatic disease.
