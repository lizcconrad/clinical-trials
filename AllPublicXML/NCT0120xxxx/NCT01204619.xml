  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the emergence of home peritoneal dialysis as an alternative to in-center hemodialysis
      for chronic renal replacement therapy in the late 1970s, the percentage of dialysis patients
      on PD has continued to decrease each year. There have been a growing concern and research on
      patient and technique survival of peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis to find influential
      factors for better clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, technique failure rates were significantly
      higher in small centers treating less than twenty five PD patients. And there was a result
      for better technique survival after the second year, among the patients trained at the
      BREC(Baxter Renal Education Center). Better technique survival in large centers can be
      assumed with not only their more experience with patient management but also their
      educational infrastructure compared to small-sized centers.

      Throughout our experiences in the last 30 years, we have recognized that a major element of
      PD program is patient training, however few data are available in terms of the relationship
      between PD training and treatment outcome and mostly are retrospective and non-randomized.
      Moreover, the technique survival and patient survival were analyzed with no significant
      difference.

      From the insight, we decided to study prospectively to evaluate the efficacy of
      well-structured education program in terms of various patient outcomes in incident patients
      on PD.

      This study will be conducted as multi-center, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. One
      hundred four patient starting PD will be randomized into two training groups. Patients in the
      conventional training group (CG) will be given non-standardized in-center conventional
      training programs plus two sessions of training by home visit, while those in intensive
      training group (IG) given in-center conventional training programs plus repeated home visits
      regularly over 24-month period (total thirteen visits). The primary end point of the study is
      exit site infection (ESI). Secondary endpoints are peritonitis and all-cause infection.
      Generalized Estimating Equations will be used to assess the adjusted effect of training level
      on the ESI and Cox regression model employed to evaluate the effect on the peritonitis and
      other secondary outcomes.
