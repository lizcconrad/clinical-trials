      The Social/Mobile Approach to Reduce Weight (SMART) study is a 24-month randomized control
      trial designed to evaluate the hypothesis that weight status at 24 months will be
      significantly better for the SMART intervention recipients than for those who receive the
      comparison condition.

      The focus of the SMART study is to develop an intervention to promote weight loss in
      overweight or obese young adults. The investigators will recruit college and university
      students to evaluate the effects of SMART on weight status and other metabolic, behavioral
      and psychosocial outcomes up to and including 24 months.

      The Primary aim of the study is to evaluate between condition differences in weight status at
      24 months.

      Secondary aims will assess the impact of the SMART intervention on: Diet, physical activity,
      sedentary behaviors, quality of life and depression at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months;
      Anthropometric measures (BP, waist circumference) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months; Differences in
      weight status at 6, 18 and 24 months; Level of satisfaction and amount of use of the
      intervention components.

      These aims will be applied to overweight/obese young adults. Among overweight/obese young
      adults, the investigators will determine whether SMART produces weight loss.
