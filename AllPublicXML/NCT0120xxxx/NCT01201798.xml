  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that difluprednate 0.05% (Durezol) dosed 4 times
      daily is noninferior to prednisolone 1% (Pred Forte) dosed 8 times daily for the treatment of
      endogenous anterior uveitis.

    <description>The following signs were each graded on a 0 - 3 scale (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe): posterior synechia, hypopyon, limbal injection, and keratic precipitates. Peripheral synechia was graded by the combined number of clock hours affected (0 = absent; 1 = &lt; 3 hrs; 2 = 3-6 hours; 3 = &gt; 6 hours). The total sign score was calculated as the sum of the 5 individual sign scores, the anterior chamber cell grade and the anterior chamber flare grade. The minimum/best total sign score was 0, and the maximum/worst total sign score was 23.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 0) in Slit-Lamp Total Sign Score at All Visits</title>
        <description>The following signs were each graded on a 0 – 3 scale (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe): posterior synechia, hypopyon, limbal injection, and keratic precipitates. Peripheral synechia was graded by the combined number of clock hours affected (0 = absent; 1 = &lt; 3 hrs; 2 = 3-6 hours; 3 = &gt; 6 hours). The total sign score was calculated as the sum of the 5 individual sign scores, the anterior chamber cell grade and the anterior chamber flare grade. The minimum/best total sign score was 0, and the maximum/worst total sign score was 23.</description>
