  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most boxing injuries occurs over head and neck which leads to potentially acute or chronic
      head and neck injuries. Patients with whiplash injury has been reported, reflected by
      increased body sway and reduced ability to overcome challenging balance tasks. The purpose of
      this research is to evaluate the fitness and balance outcomes between the boxers and the
      control group, and boxers undergoing posterior-neck icing effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injuries are common in boxing, occurring most often to the head, neck, face, and hands.
      Traumatic minor cervical strains are common place in high-impact sports and premature
      degenerative changes have been documented in sports people exposed to recurrent impact trauma
      or repetitive forces. Whiplash injury may result in extensive trauma to muscles and
      ligamentous structures within the cervical spine . Many of these structures, particularly the
      muscles, contain mechanoreceptors that play a key role in position sense. Studies have shown
      that head and neck position sense may become impaired following whiplash injury.
      Subsequently, poor movement patterns, together with the perpetuation of pain and other
      symptoms may develop.

      Posture control is achieved by integration of sensory inputs emanating from somatosensory,
      vestibular, and visual systems. Patients with whiplash injury has been reported, reflected by
      increased body sway and reduced ability to overcome challenging balance tasks. In this study
      we have attempted to evaluate the influence of boxing on balance performances, isometric
      strength and flexibility; furthermore, evaluate the therapeutic effect of ice massage on
      boxers.

    <description>The intervention, ice massage, was conducted by replacing a bag of crushed ice (100 cc) inside a moistened towel and lightly rubbed over lumbosacral region for 10 minutes. The moisture towel increased the intensity of the cooling sensation more than the dry wrappings</description>
