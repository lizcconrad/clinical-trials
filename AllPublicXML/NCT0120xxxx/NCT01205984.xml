      The place of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of children with chronic
      rhinosinusitis (CRS) remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and tolerability
      of oral methylprednisolone (MP) as an anti-inflammatory adjunct in the treatment of CRS in
      children.Forty-eight children (age 6-17 years) with clinically and radiologically proven CRS
      were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMX/C)
      and MP or AMX/C and placebo (P) twice daily for 30 days. Oral MP was administered for the
      first 15 days with a tapering schedule. Primary parameters were mean change in symptom and
      sinus computed tomography (CT) scan scores after treatment. Secondary study parameters were
      mean changes in individual symptom scores after treatment, relapse rate and tolerability.
      Forty-five patients completed the study, 22 received AMX/C and MP, and 23 AMX/C and P. Both
      groups demonstrated significant improvements in symptom and sinus CT scores, comparing
      baseline to end of the treatment (p&lt;0.001). Methylprednisolone as an adjunct was
      significantly more effective than placebo in reducing CT scores (p=0.004), total
      rhinosinusitis symptoms (p=0.001) and individual symptoms of nasal obstruction (p=0.001),
      postnasal discharge (p=0.007), and cough (p=0.009). At the end of the treatment, 48% of the
      children in the P group still had abnormal findings in CT versus 14% in the MP group (p =
      0.013). Therapy-related adverse events were not different between groups. Although
      insignificant, the incidence of clinical relapses was also less in the MP group (25%)
      compared to P group (43%) (p = 0.137). Oral MP is well tolerated and provides added benefit
      to treatment with antibiotics for children with CRS.

    <description>Rhinosinusitis symptoms were assessed by the patients and their parents with the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) rating symptoms from 0 (none) to 10 (most severe). A coronal sinus CT scanning was performed on all subjects before and at the end of the treatment. The scans were evaluated and scored according to the Lund-Mackay staging system.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in the study were given either oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMX/C) or metylprednisolone (MP) (group MP) or AMX/C and placebo (group P) twice daily using a random allocation chart based on a table of random numbers. Oral AMX/C was administered 45/6.4 mg/kg/d (maximum 2000/285 mg/d) for 30 days for both groups. Oral MP was administered for the first 15 days: 1 mg/kg/d (maximum 40 mg/d) for 10 days, 0.75 mg/kg/d for 2 days, 0.5 mg/kg/d for 2 days, and 0.25 mg/kg/d for 1 day. Placebo tablets contained lactose and were of same size and color as MP tablets.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:All patients presented with nasal and/or postnasal purulence, and one or
        more of the following symptoms: nasal obstruction, cough, halitosis, headache, or facial
        pain/pressure. The diagnosis of CRS was made on the basis of sinonasal symptoms and signs
        present for a period of more than 3 months in the presence of abnormalities on coronal
        sinus CT scans.

        Exclusion Criteria:Patients were excluded if they had used systemic corticosteroids in the
        last 2 months prior to the study, systemic antibiotics and inhaler or intranasal
        corticosteroids in the last 4 weeks prior to the study or if they had other respiratory
        disorders (cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, nasal polyps, large adenoids, asthma),
        immune deficiency, systemic disease, gastro-esophageal reflux, aspirin sensitivity, and
        acquired or congenital sinonasal abnormalities, or a contraindication to corticosteroid
        use.
