    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare the relative bioavailabilities of
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma from a single dose of
      Epanova or Lovaza during periods of high- and low -fat consumption.

          -  Use of flaxseed, perilla seed, hemp, spirulina, or black currant oils within 7 days of
             Visit 2, or during the study.

             pancreatic insufficiency, small bowel resection.

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study
             period, or women of childbearing potential who are not using acceptable contraceptive
             methods. A woman is considered of childbearing potential if she is not surgically
             sterile or is less than 1 year since last menstrual period. Examples of acceptable
             contraceptive methods include abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or double barrier
             method, oral or injectable contraceptives.

          -  Recent history (past 12 months) of drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse will be
             defined as &gt;14 drinks per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz hard
             liquor).

          -  Any other condition the investigator believes would interfere with the subject's
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, or which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.

      <recruitment_details>The enrollment period started October 2010 and the last subject visit was November 2010. All subjects were qualified at the clinical site and eligibility was determined by the PI (one US clinical site).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a 4-way crossover study with a minimum 7-day washout period between each treatment. Subjects were healthy volunteers aged ≥ 18 with a body mass index 25-35 kg/m2 and who were not intolerant to omega-3 products or fish. Subjects were instructed to follow the TLC diet and abstain from omega-3 products or fish for screening and all periods.</pre_assignment_details>
