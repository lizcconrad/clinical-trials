  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the present study are to investigate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI
      671800, its major metabolite CD6384, and 14C-radioactivity, including mass balance, excretion
      pathways and metabolism following a single oral dose of 400 mg [14C]BI 671800 HEA to healthy
      male volunteers. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability following a
      single oral dose of 400 mg [14C]BI 671800 HEA to healthy male volunteers.
