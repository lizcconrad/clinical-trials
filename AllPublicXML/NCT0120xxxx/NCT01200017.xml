  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol provides expanded access to bone marrow transplants for children who lack a
      histocompatible (tissue matched) stem cell or bone marrow donor when an alternative donor
      (unrelated donor or half-matched related donor) is available to donate. In this procedure,
      some of the blood forming cells (the stem cells) are collected from the blood of a partially
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched (haploidentical) donor and are transplanted into the
      patient (the recipient) after administration of a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot;. A conditioning
      regimen consists of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation to the entire body (total body
      irradiation, or TBI), which is meant to destroy the cancer cells and suppress the recipient's
      immune system to allow the transplanted cells to take (grow). A major problem after a
      transplant from an alternative donor is increased risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD),
      which occurs when donor T cells (white blood cells that are involved with the body's immune
      response) attack other tissues or organs like the skin, liver and intestines of the
      transplant recipient. In this study, stem cells that are obtained from a partially-matched
      donor will be highly purified using the investigational CliniMACS® stem cell selection device
      in an effort to achieve specific T cell target values. The primary aim of the study is to
      help improve overall survival with haploidentical stem cell transplant in a high risk patient
      population by limiting the complication of GVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled with alternative (mismatched/haplocompatible) related donors or
      unrelated donors either for an initial transplant or as a rescue following rejection of a
      previous graft or relapse following a previous transplant. For patients with mismatched
      related donors, the majority of clinical experience has been with a T cell-depleted PBSC
      product. Currently, no FDA-approved method for T cell depletion exists. Recent experience
      with the CliniMACS® device has produced excellent results with a 70-75% survival in children,
      many of whom were high risk patients.

      Patients that receive transplants from unrelated donors usually receive stem cells that are
      not T cell-depleted. However, this is associated with a high risk of GVHD. The excellent
      results with mismatched related donor transplants justify expanding this approach to
      unrelated donor transplant recipients if the HLA mismatch is sufficiently great. It is
      anticipated that the use of the CliniMACS® device will result in a very low risk of GVHD
      without the need for post-transplant immunosuppression. The outcomes in relatively small
      studies for children receiving unrelated donor transplants using the CliniMACS® have been
      comparable to or better than those receiving T replete transplants with post-transplant
      immunosuppression.

      This protocol will allow the use of patient-specific conditioning regimens. Some patients
      have contraindications to certain components of the conditioning regimen used for our ongoing
      study under BB-IND 8817 (CC# 01151). An example is a patient with pre-existing organ
      dysfunction that would be better served by the use of a reduced intensity conditioning
      regimen. Another example is a patient for whom total body irradiation is contraindicated due
      to very young age or prior radiation therapy. Finally, patients who would be otherwise
      eligible for the predecessor study but who do not have an eligible related donor or a closely
      matched unrelated donor would be eligible for this study. The target CD3+ T cell dose that
      will be given will be 3 x 10^4/kg. The UCSF 01151 protocol uses a dose of 3 x 10^4/kg. The T
      cell dose in the graft is usually &lt; 1 x 10^4/kg after processing and T cells are added to the
      product.

               -  For Related donor: sibling, half-sibling, parent, cousin, aunt, uncle or
                  grandparent will all be considered eligible.

               -  For Related donor: HLA antigen genotypic match ≥ 4/8 and ≤ 7/8 (haplocompatible).

               -  For unrelated donor: 6/8 or 7/8 HLA antigen match (if two mismatches, they must
                  be at different loci).

               -  Absence of anti-HLA antibodies in recipient directed against donor antigens.

               -  Donor must be willing to sign informed consent for this study. If donor is &lt; 18
                  years of age, donor must be willing to give assent and parents willing to sign
                  informed consent.

          -  Be suitable for an autologous gene-modified transplant:

               -  Using either bone marrow or cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells
                  (PBSC).

               -  Patient or authorized guardian must sign informed consent for this study.

          -  For unrelated donors: Per New Algorithm, Jan. 14, 2016, effective immediately, NMDP/Be
             The Match is adopting a revised algorithm for determining if a donor is a research
             subject on their recipient's research protocol: The NMDP will inform the donor of the
             activities and the use of donor's apheresis product to be used in this study and
             obtain written consent from the donor. Transplant centers are sent documentation of
             the donor consent to participate in the research support activities. (The revised
             algorithm can be found on the &quot;Be the Match Clinical Network&quot;)

          -  Criteria to consider when choosing among related haplo donors:

               -  CMV positive donor is preferred over other factors. CMV negative donor can be
                  used ONLY if recipient is CMV negative.

               -  HLA disparity i.e. 2 Ag mismatch preferred over 3 Ag mismatch; Drβ1 match
                  preferred over class I match; HLA-C matched preferred over A and B match.
