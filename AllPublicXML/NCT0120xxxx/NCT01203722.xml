  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If transplantation using mismatched unrelated donors or non-first-degree relatives could be
      performed with an acceptable toxicity profile, an important unmet need would be served.
      Towards this goal, the current study extends our platform of nonmyeloablative, partially
      HLA-mismatched BMT to the use of such donors, investigating up to several postgrafting
      immunosuppression regimens that incorporate high-dose Cy. Of central interest is the
      incorporation of sirolimus into this postgrafting immunosuppression regimen. The primary goal
      is to identify a transplant regimen associated with acceptable rates of severe acute GVHD and
      NRM by Day 100.

               -  Previous BMT within 6 months prior to start of conditioning. NOTE:Patients who
                  have received treatment outside of these windows may be eligible if it is deemed
                  sufficient to reduce graft rejection risk; this will be decided on a case-by-case
                  basis by the PI or co-PI.

          7. Any previous BMT must have occurred at least 3 months prior to start of conditioning.

          8. Adequate end-organ function.

          9. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 or Karnofsky or Lansky score &gt; 60

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Not pregnant or breast-feeding.

          2. HIV positive.

          3. No uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection.

          4. No previous allogeneic BMT (syngeneic BMT permissible).

          5. Active extramedullary leukemia or known active CNS involvement by malignancy. Such
             disease treated into remission is permitted.

        Donor Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Potential donors consist of:

               -  Unrelated donors

               -  Second-degree relatives

               -  First cousins

          2. The donor and recipient must be identical at at least 5 HLA alleles based on high
             resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -Cw, -DRB1, and -DQB1, with at least one allele
             matched for a HLA class I gene (HLA-A, -B, or -Cw) and at least one allele matched for
             a class II gene (HLA-DRB1 or -DQB1).

          3. Meets institutional selection criteria and medically fit to donate.

          4. Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody. Note: In some instances, low level,
             non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a
             level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a
             case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors. Pheresis to
             reduce anti-HLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the
             transplant regimen would be contingent upon the result.

        Donor Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Donor must not be HLA identical to the recipient.

          2. Has not donated blood products to recipient.
