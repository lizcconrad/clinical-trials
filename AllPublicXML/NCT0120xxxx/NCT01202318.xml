      This study will compare the diagnostic accuracy of Card 28 stroke protocol to Card 28 and
      Cincinnati Stroke Scale, when used by emergency medical dispatchers to interrogate a 911 call
      suggestive of stroke.

      The authors hypothesize that a combination of Card 28 plus the Cincinnati Stroke Scale (CSS)
      will improve the diagnostic accuracy of emergency medical dispatchers for stroke.

        The target study population consists of all 911 callers with symptoms suggestive of stroke
        in the participating county. Specifically, the accessible population for this study is the
        group of patients whose 911 calls are answered and interrogated by the emergency medical
        dispatchers at the County Communication Center, Santa Clara.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All 911 calls transferred by local Public Service Answering Points (PSAPs) to the
             County Communication center of Santa Clara County where the emergency medical
             dispatchers complete the interrogation using MPDS protocols.

          2. All 911 calls received directly at the County Communication center of Santa Clara
             County where emergency medical dispatchers complete the interrogation using the MPDS
             protocols.

          3. All 911 calls received from subjects (patient) aged &gt; 18 years or second party calls
             (by-stander or family who are in close proximity to the patient and can administer the
             tool) by subjects &gt; 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. All calls that require immediate response (ECHO level determinant for life threatening
             conditions) and emergency medical dispatchers cannot complete Card 28

          2. Calls answered by emergency medical dispatchers who have not completed training on the
             use of Cincinnati Stroke Scale.

          3. Calls originating from the cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara,
             and San Jose that are not interrogated by the County Communication Center for Santa
             Clara County.

          4. 911 calls with no available outcomes in the final discharge database.
