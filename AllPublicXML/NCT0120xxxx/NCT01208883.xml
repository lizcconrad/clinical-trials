      Treatment adaptation to biological and anatomical changes occurring during treatment can
      increase the chance of cure at minimized radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck cancer
      patients. This trial investigates the feasibility of using repetitive per-treatment
      [18F]FDG-PET acquired during treatment in adaptive [18F]FDG-PET-voxel intensity-based
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head
      and neck cancer.

          -  Primary unresectable tumor and/or patients refused surgery.

          -  Stage T1-4; T3-4 N0 or Tany N1-3 for cancer of the glottis.

          -  Multidisciplinary decision of curative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥70%.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Informed consent obtained, signed and dated before specific protocol procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment combined with brachytherapy.

          -  Prior irradiation to the head and neck region.

          -  Distant metastases.

          -  Second primary tumors that are not under control

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) ≤ 60 mL/min before treatment.

             possible consequences of the study.

          -  Patient unlikely to comply with protocol, i.e. uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits, and unlikely to complete the study.
