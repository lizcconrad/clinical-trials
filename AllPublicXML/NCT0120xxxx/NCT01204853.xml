  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy at 100 mg once daily for oral dose of sitaxentan sodium were
      demonstrated in the STRIDE clinical trial program. Sitaxentan sodium was approved in the EU,
      Canada and Australia. In this study, the safety and efficacy after administrations of
      sitaxentan sodium at a dose of 100 mg alone or in combination with another medication will be
      investigated in Japanese PAH patients.

  <why_stopped>
    Safety Issue: The trial was prematurely terminated on Dec 9, 2010, due to safety concerns,
    specifically new emerging evidence of hepatic injury.
