  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with FXS are predisposed to manifesting a particular profile of intellectual
      strengths and weaknesses, including specific deficits in math, visual-spatial skills,
      executive functioning, and social skills. Until now, intensive behavioral interventions have
      not been targeted to syndrome-specific weaknesses. In the present study we will develop and
      evaluate behavioral strategies to aid skill acquisition in children with FXS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no experimental data of skill acquisition using matching-to-sample techniques (or
      any other specific cognitive intervention) conducted with individuals with FXS. Further, no
      studies have been conducted to examine the possible underlying or mediating brain processes
      involved during matching-to-sample skill acquisition in children with FXS or any other
      neurodevelopmental disorder.

      Previous pilot data have indicated that the computerized match-to-sample procedure, even when
      conducted in time-limited sessions, may significantly help individuals with FXS learn new
      skills. We plan to utilize brain imaging methodology to compare functional connectivity
      networks for those who pass and those who fail the equivalence test. 30 subjects with FXS and
      30 control subjects with idiopathic developmental disability will be enrolled in the study.
      All subjects will be enrolled at Stanford.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (a) 10 to 23 years of age (this age range was chosen to maximize the probability that
             subjects will cooperate with the imaging procedures as well as benefit from the
             interventions),

          -  (b) in good physical health,

          -  (c) able to participate in the imaging component of the project,

          -  (d) IQ between 50 and 80. We have found that individuals with IQ's less than 50 points
             are generally unable to comply with the scanning procedures.

          -  (e) diagnosis of FXS (for FXS group) and non-specific developmental disorder (for
             control group).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria include

          -  contraindications for MRI (e.g., pacemaker, braces),

          -  the presence of neurological or sensory problems not associated with the conditions of
             interest (e.g., head trauma, blindness), or inability to discontinue psychotropic
             medication for 4 weeks prior to the scan.

          -  Additional exclusion criteria for the control group include the presence of any known
             identifiable syndrome (e.g., fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome,
             Turner syndrome, PKU, fetal alcohol syndrome, Williams syndrome).
