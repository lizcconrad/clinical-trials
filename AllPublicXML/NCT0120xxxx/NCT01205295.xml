  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies have shown that anxiety and dissatisfaction with patient
      progress are predictors for increased postoperative pain and reduced impact and efficacy of
      pain treatment. However, it remains to be shown whether patient anxiety and concern are
      predictors for the perceived quality of patient progress and the perceived efficacy of
      treatment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between preoperative
      anxiety and concern, and the perceived quality and efficacy of postoperative treatment. The
      hypothesis is that anxious and concerned patients are less satisfied with treatment and have
      a poorer response of their treatment.

      Methods/design: This PhD-project consists of four coherent studies. 1) A methodological study
      evaluating the CMD-SQ (Common Mental Disorder - Screening Questionnaire) questionnaire by a
      test-retest study. 2) The main study, a prospective follow-up study, has the aim of
      investigating the correlation between patient anxiety and concern, their perceived quality of
      patient progress and the perceived efficacy of treatment. This correlation will be detected
      by means of five questionnaires: CMD-SQ, EQ-5D, SF-12, HVOK, OHS or OSS. 3) A study
      consisting of an explicit internal medical audit with the aim to investigate whether the
      medical assessment of patient efficacy of treatment is consistent with their own
      self-reported efficacy of treatment. 4) An intervention study designed as a randomized
      clinical trial. The aim is to investigate whether a targeted effort towards patients with a
      high score of CMD-SQ, i.e. patients with anxiety and concern, can increase their
      self-reported efficacies of treatment and their perceived quality of progress. A total of 800
      hip- and shoulder-patients will be included.

      Discussion: If a correlation between patient anxiety and concern, their perceived quality of
      progress and the perceived efficacy of treatment is found, it will be relevant to screen all
      hip- and shoulder-patients for anxiety and concern preoperatively and deal with this before
      their operation. This study will provide a proposition of how these patients can be taken
      care of through cognitive behavioural therapy as a targeted effort towards their anxiety and
      concern.

      Aim and hypothesis: The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation
      between patient anxiety and concern, and their perceived quality and efficacy of treatment.
      The overall hypothesis is that patients who are anxious and concerned are less satisfied with
      their treatment and have a poorer overall efficacy of their treatment.

    <description>CMD-SQ contains 38 items and was prepared as a tool for general practitioners to increase the focus on patient anxiety and concern. The questionnaire was translated into Danish and then validated without the test-retest. CMD-SQ consists of the following six subscales, each of them has been validated: SCL-AS, Whiteley-7, SCL-ANX4, SCL-8, SCL-DEF6 and CAGE. The patients respond on a Likert scale. A normal score is lower than four in the SCL-AS scale and no more than two in the remaining scales. A manual for assessing and validating the score of CMD-SQ is available.</description>

The score 100 corresponds to the best self-reported health situation.</description>

The calculated scores can be between 12 and 60 points. 12 points reflects the best possible effect of treatment, and a score above 36 is categorized as an expression of a poor patient-assessed efficacy of treatment.</description>
