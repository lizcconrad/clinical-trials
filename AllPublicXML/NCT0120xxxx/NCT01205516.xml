      INTRODUCTION: There is an important need for inexpensive drugs that treat neuropathic pain.
      Early research suggests that methadone may be a good, inexpensive drug to treat neuropathic
      pain. Methadone is available in a low cost powder that is easily prepared for different
      routes of administration. This study will look at the effect and safety of methadone compared
      to the regular treatment of morphine for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

      OBJECTIVES: First the investigators want to determine if methadone is effective and safe for
      the treatment of neuropathic pain. Since a placebo control group would be unethical, the
      proposed comparator will consist of the &quot;gold standard&quot; conventional treatment, controlled
      release morphine. The investigators will compare methadone to controlled-release morphine
      with regard to how it affects the level of pain and extent of side effects. Next the
      investigators want to examine safety as well as to determine whether methadone leads to
      improvements in physical and emotional functioning, and participants' satisfaction with the
      treatment.

      METHODS: A double blind, randomized trial comparing methadone and controlled release morphine
      is proposed. After 1-week, participants will be randomly assigned to either methadone or
      controlled release morphine and will gradually build to a dose at which they receive adequate
      pain relief without unacceptable levels of side effects. This 5-week phase will be followed
      by a 6-week dose phase and then a 4-week tapering off phase.

      Study drug: The study drug is methadone supplied in 2.5 mg tablets. The comparator will
      consist of controlled release morphine in 10 mg tablets. The dose of each will range from
      1-12 tablets taken every 12 hours (dose ranges methadone 5-60 mg/day, controlled release
      morphine 20-240 mg/day).

      Setting: This is a 3-site study involving pain clinics in Halifax, Nova Scotia; London,
      Ontario; and Calgary, Alberta.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than18 years

          -  Chronic neuropathic pain of central or peripheral origin for 3 months or longer as
             determined by the study physician and a score of 4/10 or greater on the DN4

          -  Moderate to severe pain as defined by average 7-day pain score of greater than 4 on an
             11-point numerical rating scale for pain intensity (NRS-PI).

          -  Physician has identified that an opioid is a valid adjunctive treatment for the
             chronic neuropathic pain.

          -  Concomitant non-opioid analgesic medications must have been stable for 14 days.

          -  Co-interventions such as TENS, acupuncture and massage must have been stable for 14
             days prior to the trial

          -  If taking an opioid, maximum dose of opioid in oral morphine equivalents (OME) is 90

          -  Ability to follow the protocol with reference to cognitive and situational conditions;
             e.g., stable housing, able to attend follow-up visits.

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormalities above 1.5 times upper range of normal on screening CBC, blood chemistry
