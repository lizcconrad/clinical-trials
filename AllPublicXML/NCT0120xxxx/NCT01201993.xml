      The investigators hypothesis is that a significant number of patients may remain without
      specific cause and have recurrent syncope with its associated physical and mental morbidity.

      1. Patients with diagnosis of syncope who were admitted to the medical ward will be
           interviewed and their charts reviewed to rule in or out the diagnosis of syncope.

        2. Assess physical and mental injury as a result of syncope.

        3. The lab workup will be documented including;

             1. - Routine blood tests.

                  -  troponin level.

             2. - ECG.

                  -  Echocardiogram

                  -  Brain CT.

                  -  EEG.

                  -  U/S doppler of carotids.

                  -  Tilt tests.

        4. At the time of diagnosis the final diagnosis will be documented including
           recommendations for patients to prevent syncope after discharge.

        5. Follow up after patients by phone verifying recurrence of syncope and resulting physical
           and or mental injury if any.
