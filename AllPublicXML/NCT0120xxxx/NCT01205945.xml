  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA) occurs when the infrarenal aorta expands to a maximal diameter
      of 3.0cm or greater. Although AAA may asymptomatic for many years, almost one third
      eventually rupture if left untreated.

      Several randomized trials showed that ultrasonographic screening for AAA could reduce the
      frequency of acute operations and AAA-related mortality.

      However, all of randomized trials were performed in Western countries. There was no
      randomized trials for AAA screening in Asian countries.

      This randomized, controlled trial is to analyze the benefits of screening old population for
      AAA in Korea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Old population, aged from 60 to 85 years, are randomized into two groups; one group is
      invited for ultrasonographic screening for AAA, and the other acts as age- and sex-matched
      controls.

      For screening group, The anterioposterior and transverse diameter of the infrarenal aorta is
      measured at their maximal sizes. The subsequent surveillance of screened patients is done as
      follows

        -  Aortic diameter less than 3.0cm, no further testing

        -  AAA 3 to 4cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every year

        -  AAA 4 to 5cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every 6 months

        -  AAA greater than 5cm, referral to a vascular surgeon

      For control group, the information for any causes of death is collected every year.
