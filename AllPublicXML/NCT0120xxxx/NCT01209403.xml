      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the anabolic potentials of insulin may be
      used to reverse the catabolic effects of hemodialysis in non-diabetic patients with end-stage
      renal failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional markers such as lean body mass and serum albumin are strong predictors of the
      mortality and morbidity in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) on maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD). Maintenance HD is considered to contribute to the malnutrition of patients
      with ESRF, but the exact mechanism has remained unknown. However, we have recently shown that
      the bioactivity of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is reduced by 50% during HD.
      Furthermore, we showed that the reduction in the bioactivity of IGF-I is directly linked to
      an up-regulation of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), the only acutely regulated IGFBP, which
      increased by 6-fold during HD. IGFBP-1 is produced in the liver, primarily under the control
      of insulin, which promptly inhibits the hepatic production of IGFBP-1. As plasma insulin
      remains fairly low during a maintenance HD, the increase in IGFBP-1 may be explained by the
      absence of insulin.

      The finding that HD acutely down-regulates the bioactivity of IGF-I by an up-regulation of
      IGFBP-1 may not only explain the catabolic mechanisms of HD per se, it also opens for a new
      treatment strategy of ESRF patients undergoing maintenance HD. Thus, on the basis of our
      previous study we hypothesize that treatment of ERSF patients with high doses of insulin
      during maintenance HD may counter-act the HD-induced stimulation of IGFBP-1, making it
      possible to preserve the bioactivity of IGF-I, and thereby abolishing the catabolic impact of
      HD.
