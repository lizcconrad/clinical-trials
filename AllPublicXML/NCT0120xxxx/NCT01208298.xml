      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and performance of a cold sore
      patch for the treatment of herpes labialis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open, single-center multi-site, non-comparative study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of CSP-Night under actual-use conditions in subjects with herpes labialis of the
      lips and/or perioral skin. A sufficient number of subjects were screened to ensure that 45
      subjects experienced and treated a cold sore outbreak in the course of 14 weeks. Subjects
      were instructed to initiate therapy within approximately 1 hour of onset of their first sign
      or symptom. Treatment was continued until the lesion healed, or for a maximum of 10 days. All
      subjects were expected to return to the study center for clinical assessments within 24 hours
      and 48 hours after initiating treatment, and every other day thereafter, with a final visit
      at Day 10 or at the time of completion/discontinuation if before Day 10. Diaries were
      completed each day, beginning upon initiation of therapy and continuing until study
      completion/ discontinuation, and included information on study product applications and
      compliance.
