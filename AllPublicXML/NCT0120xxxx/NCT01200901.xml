    <textblock>
      In summary, the investigators propose to integrate fMRI assessments within a clinical trial
      of quetiapine XR in patients with melancholic depression in order to test the predictions
      that:

        1. quetiapine XR treatment will be effective and safe for patients with major depression
           with melancholic features

        2. successful treatment with quetiapine XR will be associated with normalization of limbic
           areas associated with increased salivary cortisol response to a stressful task as well
           as normalization on the emotional faces task differences in the melancholic group
           compared with healthy volunteers.

        3. successful treatment with quetiapine XR will be associated with normalization of the
           salivary cortisol response to the stressful math task (i.e. there will be a diminished
           post-treatment mean AUC for cortisol secretion after the stress task compared to the
           pre-treatment AUC values in the patient group)

      Patients with major depression (N=20) will be recruited for the 8-week clinical trial of
      quetiapine XR 100 - 300 mg (flexible dosing). Patients who consent to participate will be
      referred for an initial fMRI scanning session prior to the initiation of quetiapine XR.
      Baseline fMRI will be obtained during the index assessment prior to initiating quetiapine XR
      therapy and then will be re-acquired at the final study visit at 8 weeks (the time of
      scheduled visits). Ten demographically matched healthy subjects will receive the same fMRI
      investigations on two occasions in order to provide a healthy baseline comparison to permit
      interpretation of the patient findings (e.g., whether initial and final fMRI measures in
      patients are abnormal and to control for any adaptation to the task that may normally occur).
