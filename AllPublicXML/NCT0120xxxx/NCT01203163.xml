  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three main adverse reactions, namely photosensitivity (reaction that is similar to sunburn),
      oesophageal stenosis (narrowing or closure of the food pipe), perforation of the treated area
      (a tear or puncture of the tissue), have been identified in research studies evaluating
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porfimer sodium. Because of the low incidence of the disease
      or the variation in the occurrence of these adverse reactions among different indications, it
      is difficult to determine the occurrence and frequency of these safety issues in routine
      clinical practice.

      This post-marketing safety surveillance registry is set-up to evaluate the safety of PDT
      using porfimer sodium. A registry allows the collection of data to evaluate real-world
      results in the practice of medicine. The registry will monitor the patient's health and any
      events, with a main focus on photosensitivity, oesophageal stenosis, and perforation of the
      treated area. This registry will involve 500 patients, across 20 to 36 hospitals in the US
      and Europe, scheduled to receive an injection of porfimer sodium with PDT for the treatment
      of lung cancer, esophageal [food pipe] cancer, or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) (precancerous
      change in the food pipe tissue) in Barrett's esophagus.

      Patients will be enrolled in the registry upon injection of the porfimer sodium. During
      normal medical examination, criteria for entry onto the registry will be verified to confirm
      eligibility, and medical procedures including demographic information, disease history,
      medical history, physical exam, and clinical laboratory testing performed under normal
      practice will be collected. Patients will receive PDT as per current practice and will be
      repeated as per the physician's judgment. All patients will be assessed as per current
      practice, that is usually at least three times, after a PDT session. Additional visits will
      be sought for those patients who are presenting photosensitivity reaction, esophageal
      stenosis, perforation at the site of laser light application, or any unresolved serious
      adverse reactions at the third visit after treatment. All patients will be requested by their
      physician to complete a two-part Daily Diary to record adverse reactions using a check-list
      form and a general section for reporting any adverse events and intake of concomitant
      medications at the time of the adverse event.
