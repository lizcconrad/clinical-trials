  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 diabetes (T1D) coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality. Although serum cholesterol concentrations are not always elevated in T1D,
      cholesterol metabolism is different from non-diabetics, so that cholesterol absorption is
      enhanced. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of plant stanol esters on serum
      lipid and lipoprotein lipid concentrations, plant sterol and cholestanol concentrations as
      well as cholesterol metabolism in T1 diabetics on statin use. The study will give new
      information about how addition of plant stanol esters on statin use improve hypolipidemic
      effects in type 1 diabetes.

      In type 1 diabetes (T1D) coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality. Although serum cholesterol concentrations are not always elevated in T1D,
      cholesterol metabolism is different from non-diabetics, so that cholesterol absorption is
      enhanced. Thus, theoretically, the best way to reduce serum cholesterol concentrations is to
      reduce cholesterol absorption. However, statins are recommended to T1 diabetics at the same
      LDL cholesterol levels as for type 2 diabetics to reduce risk to CAD.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of plant stanol esters on serum lipid and
      lipoprotein lipid concentrations, plant sterol and cholestanol concentrations as well as
      cholesterol metabolism in T1 diabetics on statin use.

      Altogether, twenty-four T1 diabetics (HbA1c &lt;9%) on stabile statin use will be recruited to
      the study from an announcement in the local newspaper and from Kuopio University Hospital and
      Harjula Hospital. The study is carried out with a randomized, double-blind and parallel
      design. The intervention group (n=12) consumes spread enriched with plant stanol esters (3
      g/d stanols) and the control group (n=12) the same spread containing no added stanols for 4
      weeks. The fasting blood samples are taken at weeks 0, 3 and 4. From blood samples
      concentrations of serum lipids, squalene and non-cholesterol sterols will be analyzed.
