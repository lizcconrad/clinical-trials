    <description>This group consisted in infants aged 6-14 weeks at primary vaccination who received a 3-dose primary vaccination of Synflorix™ vaccine, co-administered with the Infanrix hexa™ vaccine at Study Months 0, 1 and 2. Subjects also received a booster dose of each of these vaccines, administered at Study Month 10. The 3 primary doses of Synflorix™ and Infanrix hexa™ vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the thigh, on the right and left side, respectively. Booster doses were administered IM into the deltoid or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate, on the left side for Synflorix™ and on the right side for Infanrix hexa™.</description>

        <description>Grade 3 fever was defined as fever by rectal measurement &gt; 40.0°C. Related was defined as causal relationship to vaccination. This endpoint was assessed after each primary vaccination dose and across doses and in subjects in the 10PP-LD/Infanrix hexa (or 10PP-LD) and Synflorix/Infanrix hexa (or 10PN) groups only.</description>

Subjects also received a booster dose of each of these vaccines, administered at Study Month 10. The 3 primary doses of the 10PP and Infanrix hexa™ vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the thigh, on the right and left side, respectively. Booster doses were administered IM into the deltoid or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate, on the left side for the 10PP vaccine and on the right side for Infanrix hexa™.</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes – Booster Phase of the Study</title>
        <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine/cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -3, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration higher than or equal to (≥) 0.05 µg/mL. This outcome concerns results for the Booster Phase of the study.</description>
        <time_frame>At Months 10 and 11, e.g. prior to and at one month post booster vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine (10PP, Synflorix™ or Prevnar 13™)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity adapted for each epoch which included all evaluable subjects for whom immunogenicity data were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine component after primary vaccination (primary phase) or before or after booster vaccination (booster phase).</population>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 6-14 weeks at primary vaccination who received a 3-dose primary vaccination of the GSK 2189242A (or 10PP) vaccine combined with low doses (LD) of pneumococcal pneumolysin toxoid proteins (dPly) and pneumococcal histidine protein D (PhtD) co-administered with the Infanrix hexa™ vaccine at Study Months 0, 1 and 2. Subjects also received a booster dose of each of these vaccines, administered at Study Month 10. The 3 primary doses of the 10PP and Infanrix hexa™ vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the thigh, on the right and left side, respectively. Booster doses were administered IM into the deltoid or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate, on the left side for the 10PP vaccine and on the right side for Infanrix hexa™.</description>

        <title>Titers for Opsonophagocytic Activity Against Pneumococcal Serotypes – Primary Phase of the Study</title>
        <description>Titers for opsonophagocytic activity assessed for this outcome measure were those for opsonophagocytic activity against the vaccine/cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F (OPA-1, -3, -4, -5, -6A, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19A, -19F and -23F). The Seropositivity cut-off of the assay was a titer for opsonophagocytic activity higher than or equal to (≥) 8. This outcome concerns results for the Primary Phase of the study. Results for humoral immune response to the opsonophagocytic activity testing for OPA-19A will be updated when validated results become available.</description>

            <description>This group consisted in infants aged 6-14 weeks at primary vaccination who received a 3-dose primary vaccination of Prevnar 13™ vaccine, co-administered with the Infanrix hexa™ vaccine at Study Months 0, 1 and 2. Subjects also received a booster dose of each of these vaccines, administered at Study Month 10. The 3 primary doses of Prevnar 13™ and Infanrix hexa™ vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM) in the thigh, on the right and left side, respectively. Booster doses were administered IM into the deltoid or thigh if the deltoid muscle size was not adequate, on the left side for Prevnar 13™ and on the right side for Infanrix hexa™.</description>

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For the marketed products administered in the study, this also included failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse of the product. Any = Occurrence of an unsolicited AE, regardless of intensity or relationship to vaccination.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort of Booster Phase, which included all subjects who received the booster dose of vaccine against pneumococcal diseases.</population>
