  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the most effective immunotherapy vaccine
      components in patients with malignant glioma. Teh investigators previous phase I study (IRB
      #03-04-053) already confirmed that this vaccine procedure is safe in patients with malignant
      brain tumors, and with an indication of extended survival in several patients. However, the
      previous trial design did not allow us to test which formulation of the vaccine was the most
      effective. This phase II study will attempt to dissect out which components are most
      effective together. Dendritic cells (DC) (cells which &quot;present&quot; or &quot;show&quot; cell identifiers to
      the immune system) isolated from the subject's own blood will be treated with tumor-cell
      lysate isolated from tumor tissue taken from the same subject during surgery. This pulsing
      (combining) of antigen-presenting and tumor lysate will be done to try to stimulate the
      immune system to recognize and destroy the patient's intracranial brain tumor. These pulsed
      DCs will then be injected back into the patient intradermally as a vaccine. The investigators
      will also utilize adjuvant imiquimod or poly ICLC (interstitial Cajal-like cell) in some
      treatment cohorts. It is thought that the host immune system might be taught to &quot;recognize&quot;
      the malignant brain tumor cells as &quot;foreign&quot; to the body by effectively presenting unique
      tumor antigens to the host immune cells (T-cells) in vivo.

        PATIENT ELIGIBILITY

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioma of WHO Grade III or IV {anaplastic
             astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic astro-oligodendroglioma (AO), or glioblastoma (GBM)} will
             be eligible for this protocol.

          2. Patients must have had surgical resection at UCLA (University of California, Los
             Angeles), for which a separate informed consent was signed for the collection of their
             tumor prior to surgery.

          3. After surgery, a pathological diagnosis of malignant glioma (WHO Grade III or IV) will
             need to be established.

          4. Patients must be 18 years or older and able to read and understand the informed
             consent document. Patients must sign the informed consent indicating that they are
             aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          5. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) rating of &gt; 60 prior to
             initiating treatment. Patients may be enrolled at a KPS of &lt; 60 if it is felt that the
             patient will have adequate opportunity to recover to a KPS of &gt; 60 by the initiation
             of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with an active infection.

          2. Inability to obtain informed consent because of psychiatric or complicating medical
             problems.

          3. Unstable or severe intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions as determined by the
             Investigator.

          4. Females of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or lactating or who are not using
             approved contraception.

          5. History of immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV) or autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, polymyositis-dermatomyositis,
             scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, or juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes) that
             may be exacerbated by immunotherapy.

          6. Subjects with organ allografts.

          7. Inability or unwillingness to return for required visits and follow-up exams.

          8. Subjects who have an uncontrolled systemic malignancy that is not in remission.
