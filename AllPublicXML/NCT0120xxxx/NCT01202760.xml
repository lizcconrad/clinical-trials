    <textblock>
      In consideration of disease severity, all participants were assessed for non-response at Week
      16. A total of 66 joints were examined for swelling, and a total of 66 joint were examined
      for tenderness. For participants who had at least 5 swollen and 5 tender joints at baseline,
      Week 16 non-responders (NRs) were defined as participants with &lt;20% improvement from baseline
      in both tender joint counts and swollen joint counts. For participants who did not have at
      least 5 swollen and 5 tender joints at baseline, Week 16 NRs were defined as participants who
      had at least 2 additional tender and 2 additional swollen joints from baseline. All Week 16
      NRs and all participants who discontinued study treatment at any time, for any reason, were
      defined as NRs starting at that timepoint and going forward for all American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR) imputed analyses, including the Week 24 endpoint.

    <measure>Mean Percent Improvement in American College of Rheumatology Percent Improvement (ACR-N)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACR-N is a continuous measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis that characterizes percentage of improvement in disease activity from baseline based on ACR core set. Percentage of improvement was truncated to range of -100 to 100 to minimize impact of outliers (greater values indicate greater percent improvement). This index was calculated as minimum of a) percentage of improvement in TJ count, b) percentage of improvement in SJ count, or c) third highest percentage of improvement of remaining 5 ACR core criteria: If &gt;=3 components of the 5 ACR core criteria were missing, then c) was set to missing; if any of 3 components a), b), or c) were missing, then ACR-N was set to missing. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Tender Joint Count (68 Joint Count)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tender joint count is the number of tender and painful joints determined for each participant by examination of 68 joints. Joints were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Participants were asked for pain sensations on these manipulations and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any positive response on pressure, movement, or both is translated into a single tender-versus-nontender dichotomy. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Disease Activity Score (Based on 28 Joint Count)-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Activity Score (DAS) modified to include 28 joint count (DAS28) consisted of composite score of following variables: tender joint count (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per liter), and participant global assessment of disease activity using visual analog scale (VAS) (participant global VAS). DAS28-CRP was calculated using following formula: DAS28-CRP=0.56*square root (sqrt)(TJC28)+0.28*sqrt(SJC28)+0.36*natural log(CRP+1)+0.014*participant global VAS+0.96. Scores ranged 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity and remission is DAS28-CRP &lt;2.6. A decrease in DAS28-CRP indicated an improvement in participant's condition. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI questionnaire assesses the participant's self-perception on the degree of difficulty [0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty), and 3 (unable to do)] when dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and performing other daily activities. Scores for each functional area, which ranged from 0 (no disability) to 3 (severe disability), were averaged to calculate HAQ-DI. A decrease in HAQ-DI score indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Tender Joint Count (68 Count)</title>
          <description>Tender joint count is the number of tender and painful joints determined for each participant by examination of 68 joints. Joints were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Participants were asked for pain sensations on these manipulations and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any positive response on pressure, movement, or both is translated into a single tender-versus-nontender dichotomy.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Improvement in American College of Rheumatology Percent Improvement (ACR-N)</title>
        <description>ACR-N is a continuous measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis that characterizes percentage of improvement in disease activity from baseline based on ACR core set. Percentage of improvement was truncated to range of -100 to 100 to minimize impact of outliers (greater values indicate greater percent improvement). This index was calculated as minimum of a) percentage of improvement in TJ count, b) percentage of improvement in SJ count, or c) third highest percentage of improvement of remaining 5 ACR core criteria: If &gt;=3 components of the 5 ACR core criteria were missing, then c) was set to missing; if any of 3 components a), b), or c) were missing, then ACR-N was set to missing. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Tender Joint Count (68 Joint Count)</title>
        <description>Tender joint count is the number of tender and painful joints determined for each participant by examination of 68 joints. Joints were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Participants were asked for pain sensations on these manipulations and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any positive response on pressure, movement, or both is translated into a single tender-versus-nontender dichotomy. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (Visual Analog Scale)</title>
        <description>Physician's assessment of the participant's current arthritis disease activity using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranged from 0 millimeters (mm) (no arthritis activity) to 100 mm (extremely active arthritis). A decrease in disease activity score indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Probability of an ACR20 Response by 24 Weeks</title>
          <description>ACR20 Responder Index: Composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of rheumatoid arthritis. ACR20 Responder: had &gt;= 20% improvement from baseline in both 68 tender and 66 swollen joint counts and &gt;=20% improvement in at least 3 of 5 criteria: participant's and physician's global assessment of disease activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (which measured participants' perceived degree of difficulty performing daily activities), joint pain, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to summarize time to ACR20 response over the Treatment Period (24 weeks). The time to American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response (in weeks) is calculated as:
(Date of the first postbaseline visit during the Treatment Period meeting ACR20 response criteria - Date of first injection of study treatment + 1) / 7.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants with at least 5/68 tender joints and at least 5/66 swollen joints at baseline and with evaluable ACR20 response data. Week 16 non-responders were counted as responders if they responded prior to Week 16. Otherwise, they were censored at the date of the Week 16 injection.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Status Survey Domain and Summary Scores</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a health-related survey that assesses participant's quality of life and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems and emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality, and 2 component scores (mental [MCS] and physical health [PCS]). Domain scores calculated by summing each item for each domain and transforming scores into 0-100 scale; higher scores indicated better health status. MCS score consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales. PCS score consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment, region, tumor necrosis factor-inadequate responder treatment history, and DMARD background as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
