    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) for Part A, or male aged
             between 25 and 55 years (inclusive) for Part B.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate in Part A if she is of:

        Non childbearing potential defined as pre menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
        higher than 40 mIU/mL and oestradiol lower than 40 pg/mL [lower than 140 pmol/L] is
        confirmatory).

          -  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post menopausal status
             prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood sampling; this interval depends on the
             type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post menopausal status, they
             can resume the use of HRT during the study without the use of a contraceptive method.

          -  A male subject must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the first investigational product dosing
             day until at least 3 months after receiving the last dose of the investigational
             product.

          -  Body weight higher than or equal to 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range
             18 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  QTcB or QTcF lower than 450 msec.

          -  Demonstrates no evidence of mental impairment or co morbid psychiatric disorders or
             suicidal risk (as determined with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C
             SSRS]).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre study hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) antibody test result within 3 months of Screening.

          -  A positive test result for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1/2.

          -  Significant renal abnormality (from medical history or as indicated by laboratory
             investigations. In addition, subjects with idiopathic haematuria or proteinuria or
             conditions such as benign orthostatic proteinuria and benign familial haematuria
             should be excluded from the study).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study start defined as:

        An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater
        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a half
        pint (220 mL) of beer or 1 measure (25 mL) of spirits or 1 glass (125 mL) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 3 month prior to the first investigational product dosing day in the
             current study.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             investigational product dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving the
             first dose of the investigational product, unless in the opinion of the Investigator
             and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products, or components thereof
             or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation in the study.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 600 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or other clinically
             significant cardiac disease.

          -  Smokers confirmed by a positive urinary cotinine test (greater than the local
             laboratory lower limit of quantification [LLQ] of 200 ng/mL or lower). Urine cotinine
             levels will be measured during Screening and at Baseline.

          -  Consumption of Seville oranges (including marmalade) and/or grapefruit and/or Chinese
             grapefruit (pomelo) and/or grapefruit hybrids and/or exotic citrus fruits and/or their

             day.

        For Part B only:

          -  Abnormal Allen's test for adequate collateral blood flow to the hand.

          -  Previous inclusion in a research and/or medical protocol involving nuclear medicine,
             PET or radiological investigations with significant radiation burden (a significant
             radiation burden being defined as International Commission on Radiological Protection
             (ICRP) Category IIb or above: No more than 10 mSv in addition to natural background
             radiation, in the previous 3 years including the dose from this study).

          -  Family history of cancer (one or more first degree relative diagnosed before the age
             of 55 years, inclusive).

          -  History of or suffers from claustrophobia or feels that they will be unable to lie
             still on their back in the PET camera for a period of approximately 2 hours.

          -  History of neurological or psychiatric conditions (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain
             injury, epilepsy, space occupying lesions, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,
             vascular dementia, transient ischaemic attack, schizophrenia, major depression, etc)
             that may influence the outcome or analysis of the scan results.

          -  Presence of a cardiac pacemaker or other electronic device or ferromagnetic metal
             foreign bodies in vulnerable positions as assessed by a standard pre MRI questionnaire
