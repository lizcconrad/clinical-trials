      Iodine 131 (131I） treatment on Graves disease and Graves ophthalmopathy relationship has
      always been the focus of debate. Majority view is that the current treatment does not
      increase 131I Graves ophthalmopathy, therefore,Graves disease associated with exophthalmos is
      not a contraindication of 131I treatment. While treatment with corticosteroids, a timely
      corrective measures to be effective in preventing Graves ophthalmopathy adverse effects. But
      the merger with severe proptosis in patients with Graves , especially infiltrative
      exophthalmos , the application of 131I treatment will induce or aggravate not yet reached
      consensus, so, the 131I treatment is still very careful , mainly due to plaque prospective
      study and visual assessment is not lack of uniform standards, and a variety of factors
      (including smoking, work status, and 131I treatment of thyroid doses, etc.) may also
      interfere or influence the ultimate effect of 131I on the Graves ophthalmopathy. In the view
      of this situation Graves disease patients with Graves ophthalmopathy could be 131I treatment
      or not, how to dose adjustments, and the use of which required treatment with systemic issues
      such as research, explore treatment exophthalmos reduction and mitigation of increased
      proptosis reasonable treatment of symptoms. To further promote the standardization of 131I
      treatment of Graves disease on basis.
