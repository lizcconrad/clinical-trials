      The study investigated the effectiveness of home-based exercise combined with a slight
      caloric restriction on weight change during 12 months in non-obese women. In addition the
      investigators evaluate the effects of baseline insulin resistance on modulation of weight
      change.

      A randomized clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted from 2003 to 2005. Two
      hundred three middle-aged women (Rio de Janeiro/Brazil), 25-45 years, were randomly assigned
      to one of two groups: control (CG) and home-based exercise (HB). The HB group received a
      booklet on aerobic exercise that could be practiced at home (3 times/week - 40 min/session),
      in low-moderate intensity, during 12 months. Both groups received dietary counseling aimed at
      a slight energy restriction of 100-300 calories per day.

      The HB experienced a greater weight loss in the first 6 months (-1.4 vs. -0.8 kg; p=0.04),
      but after 12 months there was no differences between groups (-1.1 vs. -1.0; p=0.20). Of the
      serum biochemical markers, HDL-cholesterol showed major change, with an increase at month 12
      of 18.3 mg/dl in the HB compared to 9.5 in the CG (p&lt;0.01). At baseline the non-IR group
      (n=121) compared to IR (n=64) had similar values of BMI (26.7 vs. 26.3 p=0.21), but
      statistically significant lower values of waist, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR, as expected.
      When the group non-IR and IR were further stratified by GI diet, there were no differences
      according to diet in both groups. Women classified as IR at baseline had greater weight loss
      after 12 months of follow-up (-1.62 kg vs. -1.08 kg; p=0.01), and HB exercise helped to
      reduce weight only among NIR women (-1.51 vs. -0.68; p=0.04); no differences were observed
      between intervention groups for IR women (-1.54 vs. -1.66; p=0.24). There were no differences
      between IR and NIR groups for lipid profile after adjustment for weight changes. During
      follow-up, changes were more pronounced among those women in the high GI diet. These
      differences were statistically significant for weight and BMI and were greater among the IR
      compared to the non-IR. Changes in HOMA-IR after 3 months of follow-up were different
      comparing non-IR with IR at baseline. The IR had a reduction in the HOMA-IR, whereas in the
      non-IR this value increased (-0.73 vs. +0.37; p=&lt;0.001). Also this reduction was greater
      among high compared to low GI diet (p=0.04).
