  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 12-month double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to
      determine if the impact of treating water with chlorine at the household level is effective
      in preventing diarrhea among young children. For more than a century, chlorine has be used to
      treat water in municipal systems in developed countries. Lack of infrastructure has prevented
      its use in lower-income settings. NaDCC is a tablet form of chlorine that has been used for
      more than 30 years in emergencies and has recently been approved for routine treatment of
      drinking water by the WHO and US Environmental Protection Agency. The placebo will consist of
      the food-grade ingredients in the effective tablet, without the chlorine. Study participants
      will be supplied with tablets (intervention or placebo) and instructed to use the same to
      treat their water daily. Monthly follow-up visits will assess diarrhoea morbidity and
      weight-for-age Z scores in &lt;5s. Chlorine residual and bacteriological quality of water stored
      in the home will be measured each month. The study will also assess the impact of the
      intervention on absenteeism from school and work and on health care expenditure for
      diarrhoea.
