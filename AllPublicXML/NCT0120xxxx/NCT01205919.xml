      self-help training provided via the internet on tinnitus distress in a German sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long waiting periods and the deficiency of outpatient therapies stimulated the development of
      internet-based interventions for a variety of mental disorders during the last years. A
      Swedish research group developed an internet-based self-help training for patients with
      chronic tinnitus showing promising results (Andersson et al., 2002; Kaldo et al., 2007; Kaldo
      et al., 2008). This self-help training was now adapted for German-speaking patients. The
      present study evaluates the efficacy of this treatment in a randomized controlled trial
      conducted in Germany. Further aims are a process evaluation of the treatment and the
      identification of predictors of efficacy.

    <description>This self-help training is exclusively provided via Internet over a period of 10 weeks. The treatment is based on the cognitive-behavioral approach and consists of 18 modules with helpful strategies to cope with tinnitus (e.g., applied relaxation, positive imagery, attention shift exercises, cognitive restructuring, sleep management, concentration management,). All modules include an information text, detailed practice instructions, worksheets and homework assignments. At the end of each treatment week, there is an e-mail contact between the participants and their therapist. The participants report on their work with the modules and if they had encountered any problems. The therapist provides feedback, support and recommendations on how to proceed.</description>
