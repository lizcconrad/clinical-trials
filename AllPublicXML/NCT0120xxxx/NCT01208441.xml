  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 when given
      together with letrozole in treating post-menopausal women with stage II or stage III breast
      cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving
      RO4929097 together with letrozole may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum-tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in combination with letrozole in
      post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive stage II or III breast cancer.

      II. To assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen, taking into consideration the induction
      of CYP3A4, in these patients.

      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of letrozole prior to and during
      administration of RO4929097 with attention to suppression of estradiol and estrone levels.

      III. To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of letrozole with or without RO4929097 on the
      NOTCH pathway, proliferation, angiogenesis, stromal cell infiltration/pathways, and
      comprehensive genomic analysis in tumor tissue of these patients.

      IV. To describe the response, including clinical complete or partial objective response,
      pathological complete response, and attainment of pathologic stage 0 or I status in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor
      RO4929097(RO4929097).

      Patients receive oral letrozole once daily on days 1-21. Beginning in course 2, patients also
      receive oral RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning 1 week after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo surgery or tumor
      biopsy. Patients continue to receive oral letrozole once daily during surgery and for an
      additional 4 weeks.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 1 month and then every 6
      months for 5 years.
