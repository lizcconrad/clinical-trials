    <textblock>
      The following study is based on a previous clinical trial performed at ikfe GmbH in Mainz in
      2006 and 2007 (PIOswitch). [2] The purpose of this trial was to demonstrate that type 2
      diabetes patients treated with insulin can be effectively switched to a
      pioglitazone/glimepiride combination without loss of glycemic control. The study was
      performed with 100 patients, out of whom 76 were finally successfully switched, resulting in
      a cheaper and more convenient therapy with indications of an improved laboratory
      cardiovascular risk biomarker profile (Hohberg et al., Diabetes Obes. Metab. 11:464-471,
      2009). [2] Glimeperide is an agent with unspecific stimulating effect on the ß-cell and is
      considered to accelerate the progression of the disease while still controlling blood
      glucose. In addition, it may cause hypoglycemia. The combination of pioglitazone with
      glimepiride was selected, because pioglitazone requires approx. 5-6 weeks for developing its
      full anti-diabetic efficacy and an immediate effect on glucose was required to avoid glycemic
      deterioration.

      It is tempting to speculate that the combination of a drug providing ß-cell protection (like
      saxagliptin) with a drug effectively and rapidly lowering blood glucose through a different
      mechanism of action (metformin) instead of unspecific ß-cell stimulation would result in an
      even improved outcome without risk of hypoglycemia. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the success rate of a switch from insulin therapy to a metformin &amp; saxagliptin
      combination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
