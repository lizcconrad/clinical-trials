  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the artesunate-amodiaquine combination is
      effective in treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children with severe
      acute malnutrition.

      Infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality in malnourished children. Malnutrition is known to have a modulating effect on the
      incidence of malaria infections, its severity and effectiveness of treatments. However,
      little data exists on antimalarial drug efficacy in malnourished children.
      Artesunate-amodiaquine combination is the first line treatment used in Médecins Sans
      Frontières programmes in Niger. The assumption of current efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine
      is based on non malnourished children. The aim of this study is to measure the clinical and
      parasitological efficacy in severely malnourished children.

      The study is consistent with the standard WHO protocol for monitoring antimalarial drug
      efficacy (WHO: Methods for surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy. Geneva; 2009), except
      for one inclusion criterion. Severe acute malnutrition is an inclusion criteria, instead of
      being an exclusion criteria. The study will encompass a pharmacokinetic part that will
      provide important information on the absorption of the drug.
