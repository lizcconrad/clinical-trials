  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      GSK1358820 for treatment in post-stroke subjects with focal wrist, finger and in some cases,
      thumb spasticity. Qualified patients who complete GSK double-blind study 112958 will be
      enrolled. Subjects will receive a single treatment session of intramuscular GSK1358820 &quot;200U
      or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)&quot;. The subjects will be observed until 12 weeks post
      injection. Outcome measures include changes from baseline at every post injection visit as
      measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) and Global
      Assessment Scale. Safety parameters will be measured including adverse events, vital signs
      (pulse and blood pressure) and clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and
      urinanalysis).

      This trial is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      GSK1358820 for the treatment of patients with focal wrist, finger and in some cases, thumb
      spasticity post-stroke. Qualified patients will be eligible for enrollment upon completion of
      double-blind study 112958. Patients will receive a single treatment session with
      intramuscular injections of GSK1358820 &quot;200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)&quot;.The
      subjects will be observed for 12 weeks post injection.

      Each completed subject will attend 4 clinic visits. The maximum study duration is 13 weeks.
      The study includes a 1 week pretreatment period, during which the screening visit (visit 1
      could be the last visit of previous double-blind study 112958 or any time within 3 months
      after completion of previous study) is to take place. Only one upper limb (meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be evaluated and treated in the study. Subjects will
      receive a single intramuscular treatment with investigated drug at day 0 (visit 2). There
      will be two post-injection follow-up visits at week 6 and 12 (visits 3 to 4).

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 6 and Week 12 for Wrist Flexor Muscle Tone as Measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</title>
        <description>The investigator or assessor extended the participant's wrist as quickly as possible to grade flexor muscle tone. The MAS wrist score was calculated by using the 6-point MAS (0, 1, 1+ [regarded as 1.5], 2, 3, and 4; 0=no increase in muscle tone; 4=affected part[s] rigid in flexion/extension). Change from Baseline at Week 6 or Week 12 was calculated as the value at Week 6 or Week 12 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Global Assessment Scale (GAS) Score as Evaluated by the Physician at Week 6 and Week 12</title>
        <description>The physician used the GAS to assess response to treatment at each visit after injection. The assessor was the same throughout the study period. GAS scores were assessed by using the 9-point GAS (-4, -3, -2, -1, -0, +1, +2, +3, +4; -4=very marked worsening, -0=unchanged, +4=very marked improvement) at Week 6 and Week 12.</description>
