  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Endovascular thrombolysis, with or without mechanical clot removal (ET), may be
      beneficial for a subgroup of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT), who have a
      poor prognosis despite treatment with heparin. Published experience with ET is promising, but
      only based on case series and not on controlled trials.

      Objective: The main objective of the TO-ACT trial is to determine if ET improves the
      functional outcome of patients with a severe form of CVT

      Study design: The TO-ACT trial will be designed as a multi-centre, prospective, randomized,
      open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial.

      Study population: Patients are eligible if they have a radiologically proven CVT, a high
      probability of poor outcome (defined by presence of one or more of the following risk
      factors: mental status disorder, coma, intracranial hemorrhagic lesion or thrombosis of the
      deep cerebral venous system) and the responsible physician is uncertain if ET or standard
      anti-coagulant treatment is better.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to receive either ET or standard therapy
      (therapeutic doses of heparin). ET consists of local application of alteplase or urokinase
      within the thrombosed sinuses, and/or mechanical thrombectomy. Glasgow coma score, NIH stroke
      scale and relevant laboratory parameters will be assessed at baseline.

      Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 12 months. The most
      important secondary outcomes are the mRS, mortality and recanalization rate at 6 months.
      Major intra- and extracranial hemorrhagic complications within one week following the
      intervention are the principal safety outcome. Results will be analyzed according to the
      &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; principle. Assessment of study endpoints will be carried out according
      to standardized questionnaires by a blinded neurologist or research nurse who is not involved
      in the treatment of the patient.

      Study size: To detect a 50% relative reduction in mRS≥2 (from 40 to 20%), 164 patients (82 in
      each treatment arm) have to be included (two-sided alpha, 80% power).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Included patients may benefit directly from ET. Complications of ET, most
      notably intracranial hemorrhages, constitute the most important risk of the study.

    <description>Outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mortality included) at 12 months after randomization is considered the primary study outcome to determine the efficacy of thrombolytic treatment.

Any bleeding requiring operation or leading to death is regarded as major. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is defined as any apparently extravascular blood in the brain associated with an increase of 4 points or more on the NIHSS score, or leading to death.</description>

    <measure>Interim analyses: Favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin score 0-1)</measure>
    <time_frame>After inclusion of 1/3rd and 2/3rd of patients</time_frame>
    <description>The DSMB will perform two interim analyses after 55 and 110 patients (1/3rd and 2/3rd of all patients) have been randomized and completed the 12-month follow-up evaluation. As a stopping rule for efficacy, the Haybittle-Peto method will be used:
Interim analysis 1: p = 0,001
Interim analysis 2: p = 0,001
In addition, the DSMB will assess futility during the interim analyses. The trial will be discontinued for futility if the conditional power (or probability of observing a statistically significant result in favor of the intervention group given the data obtained so far) is below 20%. This conditional power will be calculated under the assumption that in the remaining two-thirds/one-thirds of the study population the distributions of the primary endpoint will be the same as observed at the interim analysis.
For the interim analyses the DSMB will use the primary outcome measure (modified Rankin score 0-1 at 12 months) for the determination of efficacy and futility.</description>
