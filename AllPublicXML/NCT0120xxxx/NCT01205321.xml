        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers:

               -  males, &gt;/=50 and &lt;/= 65 years of age

          -  Cancer patients:

               -  males &gt;/= 45 years of age

               -  Patients had an MRI of the prostate and/or a positive choline or acetate PET/CT
                  for diagnosis (Note: MRI, choline and acetate PET/CT are optional for primary
                  prostate cancer patients) of recurrence prostate cancer and the primary cancer
                  disease is/ will be histologically confirmed.

               -  The prostate cancer is histologically confirmed and results of histology are
                  available.

               -  Patients with primary prostate cancer: &gt;/= 20 percent of biopsy material should
                  be affected by cancer in the histopathological evaluation.

               -  Patients with primary prostate cancer: Patient is scheduled to undergo
                  prostatectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease (e.g.
             poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 12
             months prior to planned injection of BAY86-7548, unstable and uncontrolled
             hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease) which could
             compromise participation in the study

          -  Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation.
