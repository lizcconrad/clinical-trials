    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data prospectively on the safety and efficacy of the
      Laparoscopic Gastric Plication operation for patients with Severe or Morbid Obesity.

      The 95% confidence interval for average percentage of weight loss and body mass index will be
      computed at 6 months, one year and then annually. Analysis of comorbid conditions changes,
      quality of life and adverse events will be performed. With 50 subjects in the study, limited
      power is expected and no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.

    <textblock>
      The laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) is a new restrictive bariatric surgical technique
      that has the potential to eliminate the complications associated with other restrictive
      procedures (i.e., gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy) by creating a restriction without the
      use of an implant and without performing gastric resection. LGP is notably similar to a
      sleeve gastrectomy in that it generates a gastric tube by means of eliminating the greater
      curvature but does so without gastric resection.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable is weight loss, which is measured in pounds and evaluated in terms of % excess weight loss (EWL) and body mass index (BMI), both of which will be measured at each follow-up visit.
Percent EWL is calculated by the following equation: [Weight Lost]/ [(Pre-op Weight)-(Ideal Body Weight)]. BMI is calculated by the equation: Weight (kg) divided by Height (m) squared [kg/m2].</description>

    <measure>Status of comorbid conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement, resolution or worsening of pre-operative co-morbidities will be evaluated and reported at one year and annually up to 3 years. Status will be evaluated according to the necessity of medications to maintain normal physiologic values such as fasting serum glucose in diabetic patients, normal blood pressure in hypertensive patients, and use of a CPAP machine for patients with obstructive sleep apnea.</description>

    <description>The procedure is performed laparoscopic. The greater curvature of the stomach is separated from the greater omentum using a harmonic scalpel starting approximately 3-5 cm from the pylorus and ending at the angle of His. As needed, adhesions to the posterior surface of the stomach may be transected. At least two rows stitches will be placed laparoscopically about the greater curvature of the stomach starting at or near the angle of His and ending in the antrum. A calibration tube or endoscope will be used to maintain a lumen during the procedure, ensuring one exists after the procedure.</description>
