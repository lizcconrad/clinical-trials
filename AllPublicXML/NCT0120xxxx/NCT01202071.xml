  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of 5 mg, 10 mg,
      20 mg and 40 mg of Rabeprazole sodium (E3810) when administered repeatedly once daily for 5
      days to healthy adult male Japanese participants. This was a single-center, open-label,
      randomized, four-treatment, four-way crossover study.

    <measure>Percentage Duration With An Intragastric pH &gt;= 4 During The Entire 24 Hours Of Day 5 Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 of administration during Period I-IV</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring was performed on Day 5 of administration in each study period (Period I-IV). Data was displayed based on the participant's CYP2C19 genotype: CYP2C19-EM are extensive metabolizers who have normal metabolizing capacity. CYP2C19-PM are poor metabolizers with a metabolizing capacity deficiency or remarkably decreased metabolizing capacity.</description>

    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameter: maximal drug concentration (Cmax) measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) was calculated on Day 1 and Day 5 of administration during each Period (I-IV).
Data was displayed based on the participant's CYP2C19 genotype: CYP2C19-EM are extensive metabolizers who have normal metabolizing capacity. CYP2C19-PM are poor metabolizers with a metabolizing capacity deficiency or remarkably decreased metabolizing capacity.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic Parameter: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Time t (AUC[0-t])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 5 of administration during Period I-IV (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameter: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 (administration of the drug) to time t (the last quantifiable concentration time point). AUC measured in nanogram hours per milliliter (ng*h/mL) was calculated on Day 1 and Day 5 of administration during each Period (I-IV).
Data was displayed based on the participant's CYP2C19 genotype: CYP2C19-EM are extensive metabolizers who have normal metabolizing capacity. CYP2C19-PM are poor metabolizers with a metabolizing capacity deficiency or remarkably decreased metabolizing capacity.</description>
