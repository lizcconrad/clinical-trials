    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised, double-blind crossover study was to determine whether Doxycycline
      has an impact on the persistent symptoms post-neuroborreliosis, through alterations in the
      immune response and whether such an effect could influence the clinical outcome.

      Persistent symptoms after treatment of neuroborreliosis (NB) are not uncommon. There is
      currently no evidence for improvement of symptoms after repeated or prolonged antibiotic
      treatment. However, clinical observations have indicated that some patients improve during
      treatment with doxycycline (DOX), but regain the symptoms some time after completed
      treatment. This may be due to an immunomodulatory effect of the drug. The aim of this
      randomised, double-blind crossover study was to determine whether DOX has an impact on the
      persistent symptoms through alterations in the immune response and whether such an effect can
      influence the clinical outcome.

      A total of 15 patients from South-East Sweden with previously adequately diagnosed NB with
      diverse persistent symptoms ≥6months after antibiotic treatment were randomised in a
      double-blind, crossover fashion to receive either DOX 200 mg or placebo (PBO) once daily for
      three weeks, followed by a wash-out period of six weeks and a further three-weeks treatment
      with either DOX 200 mg or PBO once daily for three weeks. The primary outcome measures were
      improvement of the persistent symptoms and physical and mental health, evaluated using the
      visual analogue scale (VAS), the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and through
      physical examination with special emphasis on neurologic status at the follow-up visits.
      Secondary outcome measures were changes in drug-induced antigen-stimulated and unstimulated
      cytokine responses.
