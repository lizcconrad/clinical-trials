      Background: Abdominal bloating is a frequent and bothersome complaint in patients with
      functional gut disorders without satisfactory treatment to date. Recent data from our
      laboratory indicate that abdominal distention in these patients is produced by
      abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia: diaphragmatic contraction associated with abdominal wall
      relaxation (particularly the internal oblique). In analogy to other clinical situations (e.g.
      functional outlet obstruction, rumination or aerophagia) behavioral treatment by means of
      biofeedback might be equally effective in these patients. The investigators hypothesized that
      abdomino-phrenic coordination and abdominal distention can be controlled by biofeedback
      techniques.

      Aim: to prove the efficacy of behavioural treatment using biofeedback techniques for
      abdominal distension.

      Randomization: Patients will be randomized into biofeedback and placebo groups.

      Intervention. Biofeedback: patients will be taught to control abdominothoracic muscular
      activity by bio-feedback using online electromyography information. Placebo: patients will be
      given a pill containing placebo medication. Interventions will be delivered in 3 sessions (20
      min each) over 10-day period

      . Measurements: Sensation of abdominal distension will be assessed by means of graphic rating
      scales graded from 0 (no perception) to 6 (very intense sensation). The activity of the
      abdomino-thoracic muscles will be recorded. Abdominal distension will be measured by a metric
      tape fixed to a non-stretch belt placed over the umbilicus.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: Change in sensation of abdominal sensation. Secondary outcomes: a)
      changes in thoraco-abdominal activity of the muscular walls; activity of thoraco-abdominal
      muscles (intercostals, diaphragm, external oblique, internal oblique, upper rectus, lower
      rectus) will be measured by electromyography; b) changes in girth; abdominal girth will be
      measured using a nonstretch belt (48mm wide) that is placed over the umbilicus. The
      overlapping ends of the belt will be adjusted carefully with two elastic bands to adapt
      constantly to the abdominal wall.

    <description>Abdominal girth will be continuously measured using a nonstretch belt (48mm wide) that is placed over the umbilicus and ﬁxed to the skin on the back to prevent slipping. The overlapping ends of the belt will be adjusted carefully with two elastic bands to adapt constantly to the abdominal wall. Measurements will be taken before and at the beginning at the end of each intervention session.</description>
