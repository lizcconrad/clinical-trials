  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Variations in tear osmolarity and tear meniscus volume in patients with dry eyes and in healthy control subjects over an 8-hr daytime period.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The mean tear osmolarity of the dry eye patients was 304.0±10.8 mOsm/L, and the mean tear osmolarity of the normal subjects was 298.0±14.2 mOsm/L (P.0.05). Over the course of 8 hrs, the average measured osmolarities of the dry eye group varied by approximately 21.9±13.5 mOsm/L (range, 6-43 mOsm/L), and the average measured tear osmolarities of the normal group varied by approximately 21.0±9.2 mOsm/L (range, 8-35 mOsm/L). At 2:30 PM, the average volume of the tear menisci in the dry eye group was significantly lower than that of the subjects in the normal group (P,0.05). No correlations between the tear meniscus volumes and tear osmolarities of either group were observed.</description>
