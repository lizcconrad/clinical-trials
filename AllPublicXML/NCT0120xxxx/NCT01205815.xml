        Inclusion criteria

          -  Pathologically-proven diagnosis of melanoma.

          -  Patient must have a test or procedure that has the potential to provide left-over
             tissue that can be banked for future research purposes OR the patient has already had
             a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure but who has not yet been approached to
             participate is also eligible.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Any patient with significant contraindications to venipuncture (e.g., severe anemia)
             will be excluded from blood collection procedures. However, if the patient provides
             consent and a paraffin-embedded block or 10-15 unstained slides of their tissue
             diagnosis, they will not be excluded from this protocol.

          -  Any patient unable or unwilling to provide consent.
