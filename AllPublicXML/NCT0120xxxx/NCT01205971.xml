  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is increasing in prevalence
      in children 2-5 years old. Racial and ethnic minority groups as well as economically
      disadvantaged individuals are affected the most by this health outcome. This study will test
      if a community-based multimodal intervention will reduce 2-year incidence of early childhood
      caries (ECC) in children aged 0-5 living in public housing developments. The intervention
      combines the components of motivational interviewing (counseling) delivered by dental health
      advocates, fluoride varnish application, oral health assessment and referral. The
      investigators hypothesize that the multimodal intervention with motivational interviewing
      will reduce ECC behavioral risk factors thereby leading to a reduction of ECC incidence when
      compared to fluoride varnish application, written oral health education materials and oral
      health assessment and referral.

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most common, chronic disease of childhood, is increasing in prevalence,
      and disproportionately affects individuals who are financially disadvantaged and from racial
      and ethnic minority groups. Given the chronic nature of dental caries, clinically based
      preventive and restorative care alone will likely be inadequate to decrease disparities in
      early childhood caries (ECC) prevalence. We posit that a multimodal community-based approach,
      which addresses the chronic, infectious and multifactorial nature of dental caries, will be
      more effective than either behavioral counseling and the chemotherapeutic effects of fluoride
      alone. In addition to counseling and fluoride application, a successful community-based
      multimodal intervention will also need to equip caregivers with the skills to become involved
      in the prevention and management of ECC.

      This group randomized clinical trial will test if a community-based multimodal intervention
      will reduce the 2-year ECC incidence of children aged 0-5 living in public housing
      developments. The intervention combines evidence based components and a unique delivery
      setting (public housing). We hypothesize that the multimodal intervention comprised of oral
      health assessment and feedback, fluoride varnish application, and motivational interviewing
      delivered by Dental Health Advocates (trained public housing residents) can reduce incidence
      of ECC in 0-5 year olds compared with a control group that receives oral health assessment
      and feedback, fluoride varnish application, and written oral health education materials.

      This study is well poised for dissemination. Ultimately, this work could be disseminated
      nationwide and could potentially improve the oral health of over 500,000 family households
      and over 1 million children living in public housing.
