  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MTN-009 is a multi-site, cross-sectional study that will provide an estimate of the
      prevalence of ARV resistance in the population of women who present to study sites to be
      pre-screened or screened for participation in an HIV prevention trial. To date, a
      comprehensive surveillance of HIV drug resistance in newly diagnosed women of reproductive
      age has yet to be undertaken. The primary goal of MTN-009 is to assess the frequency of HIV
      drug resistance mutations among women who test HIV-positive when presenting to screen for
      participation in HIV prevention trials.

      MTN-009 is a multi-site, cross-sectional study that will provide an estimate of the
      prevalence of ARV resistance in the population of women who present to study sites to be
      pre-screened or screened for participation in an HIV prevention trial. To date, a
      comprehensive surveillance of HIV drug resistance in newly diagnosed women of reproductive
      age has yet to be undertaken. The primary goal of MTN-009 is to assess the frequency of HIV
      drug resistance mutations among women who test HIV-positive when presenting to screen for
      participation in HIV prevention trials. Secondary aims include the identification and
      evaluation of behavioral indicators including self or sexual partner(s) exposures to
      antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as risk factors for drug resistant HIV infection, as well as the
      characterization of the degree of immunodeficiency and risk of disease progression by
      quantifying plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4-positive T cells among women who test HIV-positive when
      presenting to screen for participation in an HIV prevention trial. Exploratory aims include
      the identification of polymorphic or subtype-specific sequence changes in HIV-1 that may
      impact susceptibility to ARVs, and the estimation of the proportion of HIV-positive women who
      have chronic versus recent HIV infection.

      The finding of significant resistance, or lack thereof, to ARV-based study products delivered
      vaginally or taken orally may guide decisions related to future microbicide and PrEP studies.
      In addition, MTN-009 will provide valuable comparison data for the resistance data obtained
      in MTN-015, the MTN seroconverter study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Present to an MTN-009 study site to pre-screen or screen for an HIV prevention trial

          -  Age 18-40 years, verified per site standard operating procedures (SOP)

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent for participation in MTN-009
