    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of an internet-based guided self-help
      training for chronic tinnitus with a well-established outpatient group therapy and a
      discussion forum group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tinnitus can result in significant psychological suffering and reduce quality of
      life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in decreasing the
      impairment caused by tinnitus. One recent way delivering CBT is an internet-based self-help
      intervention. Internet interventions for patients with chronic tinnitus, developed by Swedish
      scientists, showed promising results (Andersson et al., 2002; Kaldo et al., 2007; Kaldo et
      al., 2008). The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of this internet-based
      self-help training for chronic tinnitus with a traditional well-established CBT group
      treatment and with a discussion forum group in a randomized controlled trial. Secondary goals
      are a process evaluation of both treatments, the identification of predictors of treatment
      success, an estimation of the cost-effectiveness of each treatment and the validation of the
      Tinnitus Cognitions Questionnaire (T-Cog; Hiller &amp; Haerkötter, 2005).

    <description>This self-help training is exclusively provided via Internet over a period of 10 weeks. The treatment is based on the cognitive-behavioral approach and consists of 18 modules with helpful strategies to cope with tinnitus (e.g., applied relaxation, positive imagery, attention shift exercises, cognitive restructuring, sleep management, concentration management,). All modules include an information text, detailed practice instructions, worksheets and homework assignments. At the end of each treatment week, there is an e-mail contact between the participants and their therapist. The participants report on their work with the modules and if they had encountered any problems. The therapist provides feedback, support and recommendations on how to proceed.</description>
