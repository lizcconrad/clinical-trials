    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nodules are one of the most common thoracic radiographic abnormalities. They are
      usually found accidentally as discrete well emarginated pulmonary lesions found within the
      lung parenchyma during a routine chest x-ray. Pulmonary nodules are usually asymptomatic.
      Most solitary lung nodules are benign; however these nodules can represent early stage lung
      cancer. The identification of malignant pulmonary nodules is important because they represent
      a potential form of curable lung malignancy. Every lung nodule should therefore be
      investigated for the possibility of malignancy.

      Ultrasound has been beneficial in almost all medical and surgical specialities. The idea of
      using ultrasound during VATS has emerged from its use in laparoscopic procedures. Few studies
      have investigated the use intracavitary ultrasound for localizing pulmonary nodules. The
      sensitivity of ultrasound detecting pulmonary nodules is high (92%). In some studies,
      ultrasound could detect all pulmonary nodules detected by high resolution CT. It has also
      been shown to be able to locate nodules not visualized on spiral CT.

      The use of intracavitary ultrasound has been suggested by many authors as a safe and
      effective method for localizing hard to find nodules. It is a real time technique with no
      associated complications, low cost, and has the potential to save operative time. Most
      importantly, it may be able to prevent conversion of VATS to open operations in cases where
      nodules are not visualizable or locatable using VATS techniques.

      The use of intracavitary US as a localization method by surgeons intra-operatively could lead
      to better identification of nodules. Also, this technique could avoid performing multiple
      procedures on patients (CT guided targeting followed by surgery) and therefore is more
      cost-efficient. If proven accurate, surgeon-performed intracavitary ultrasound could be used
      routinely during VATS procedures, increasing the chances of finding and localizing pulmonary
      nodules using minimally invasive techniques.
