      The study hypothesis is that changes in serially obtained nerve conduction study data
      obtained every 3-4 weeks in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy can be used to predict the
      development of a clinically significant / disabling drug induced neuropathy six and twelve
      months following the start of treatment. Patients with breast cancer, colon cancer,
      gastroesophageal cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma will be enrolled. Six lower extremity
      nerves--three in each leg--will be electrically stimulated and their responses recorded at
      three to four week intervals coinciding with patient's scheduled chemotherapy.
