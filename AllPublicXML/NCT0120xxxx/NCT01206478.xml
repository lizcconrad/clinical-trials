  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrojejunal (G-J) feeding tubes are placed in infants and children who refuse to eat or are
      unable to eat enough to have normal growth. Although often intended as temporary short-term
      solutions to medical complications, feeding tubes can become a permanent method for eating.

      While tube feeding routinely saves the lives of children who have long term food refusal,
      continuation of tube feeding can be hard for patients, caregivers, and families. At the
      current time there are few treatments for helping children move from tube to oral feeding.
      Some patients may be treated with the help of inpatient programs such as a combination of
      medical and behavioral techniques to train children to eat orally. These programs typically
      require hospital stays of 2-4 months.

      By doing the current study the investigators hope to learn if the investigational drug
      amitriptyline is helpful in moving children from tube to oral feeding, and to look at whether
      or not the treatment of pain helps with this transition.

      This research study involves a study drugs called amitriptyline and megestrol. Amitriptyline
      might help children who have feeding problems with pain and megestrol is known to increase
      appetite. Amitriptyline and megestrol are liquid syrups that are given by feeding tube daily.

      Amitriptyline has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of child with feeding problems. Amitriptyline is an investigational drug
      that is being studied to find out what the side effects are, and whether or not the product
      works for child with feeding problems. Amitriptyline is approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of depression.

      Megestrol has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of children with feeding problems. Megestrol is an investigational drug that is
      being studied to find out what the side effects are, and whether or not the product works for
      children with feeding problems. Megestrol has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      adults. Though megestrol is not FDA approved to treat children with feeding problems, it is
      often used for this purpose.

      Megestrol and Amitriptyline both affect the nerve cells that carry pain sensations to and
      from the brain. Both drugs reduce the intensity of the pain signals going to the part of the
      brain that feels pain. Each drug attaches to the nerve cell but at separate spots on the
      nerve cell so pain can be better managed.

    <measure>Change in Non-communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Revised (NCCPC-R) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Non-communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Revised (NCCPC-R) used to measure outcome. The NCCPC-R is a 30 item measure intended to assess pain in children who are unable to speak because of cognitive or physical impairments. There are 7 sub-scales including vocal, social, facial, activity, body/limbs, physiological, and eating/sleeping. Each question has a potential score of 0 to 3. Scores are totaled for each sub-scale. Sub-scale scores are then added together for the Total Score. Total Scores can range from 0 to 90. The higher the score, the higher level of pain indicated by the child. This measure was completed by parents at week 0, week 10, and week 24.</description>

At Visit 2, after participating in the study for ten weeks, children in both Groups 1 and 2 will receive a prescription for the appetite stimulant megestrol. The dose your child will receive depends on your child's age and weight. The dose of megestrol is 6 mg/kg divided into two doses per day.</description>

          <title>% Calories Taken Orally</title>
          <description>Percent Kilocalories (kcal) Obtained Orally. This measure was obtained using the 24 hour food recall, a standardized five-pass method developed by the US Department of Agriculture for use in national dietary surveillance. This measure has been widely used in several large trials and data suggest it is the most valid and reliable method of dietary assessment for children (20). The data were collected at week 0, week 10, and week 24 using standardized probes by highly trained research staff, and parents were presented with paper food models and measuring devices prior to interviews to reference during the recall. Recalls were analyzed with the Nutritional Data System for Research, version 2005; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.</description>

        <description>Non-communicating Children’s Pain Checklist - Revised (NCCPC-R) used to measure outcome. The NCCPC-R is a 30 item measure intended to assess pain in children who are unable to speak because of cognitive or physical impairments. There are 7 sub-scales including vocal, social, facial, activity, body/limbs, physiological, and eating/sleeping. Each question has a potential score of 0 to 3. Scores are totaled for each sub-scale. Sub-scale scores are then added together for the Total Score. Total Scores can range from 0 to 90. The higher the score, the higher level of pain indicated by the child. This measure was completed by parents at week 0, week 10, and week 24.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Major weakness was our small sample size, which was directly due to problems with recruitment, which occurred uniformly across sites.
