      This study intended to investigate and compare the changes that may occur in response to
      cryolipolysis (localized cool exposure) and subcision (surgical technique) on cellulite. The
      cryolipolysis cooling device used is FDA approved for skin cooling, but still investigational
      in the treatment of cellulite. It has previously been used for fat reduction on love handles
      or back fat. During cryolipolysis, the system drew fat tissue into an applicator then exposes
      the extracted fat tissue to cold temperatures. The cold exposure caused fat cells to die,
      with the goal to decrease the raised areas of cellulite. Subcision is a process used to treat
      scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases and has been noted to improve moderate to
      severe cellulite. Subcision is a simple surgical procedure that is performed by inserting a
      specially designed needle under the skin after local numbing medication is injected. The
      needle is moved in a repetitive motion parallel to the skin to separate the surface tissue
      from the deeper scar tissue with the goal to improve the dimpling caused by these tissues
      sticking together. This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these
      procedures.

          <title>Cryolipolysis</title>
          <description>cryolipolysis : During cryolipolysis, the system drew fat tissue into an applicator then exposed the extracted fat tissue to cold temperatures. The cold exposure caused fat cells to die, with the goal to decrease the raised areas of cellulite</description>

          <title>Subcision</title>
          <description>Subcision : Subcision was performed by inserting a specially designed needle under the skin after local numbing medication is injected. The needle was moved in a repetitive motion parallel to the skin to separate the surface tissue from the deeper scar tissue with the goal to improve the dimpling caused by these tissues sticking together.</description>
