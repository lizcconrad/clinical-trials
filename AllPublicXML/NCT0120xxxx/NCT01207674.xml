  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is a transversal study and corresponds
      to the recruitment of participants, which will last about two years. Three groups of gamblers
      will be constituted : Non-problematic gamblers (NPG), Problematic gamblers Not in Care (PGNC)
      and Problematic gamblers in Care (PGC).The second stage is a prospective 5-year follow-up
      study of the cohort (only the initial NPG and PGNC groups are concerned by the follow-up
      study), that consists on an annual follow-up evaluation. The main objective of the first
      stage of the study is to compare the characteristics of the three groups of gamblers on some
      socio-demographic and clinical data. These comparisons will allow us to identify, among all
      data, those that will be most likely to explain the evolution of the practice of gambling
      (appearance or resolution of a gambling problem), and recourse to specific care. These such
      isolated data will be tested in the second stage of the study, in order to determine those
      that are predictive factors of three steps of the gambling course of some gamblers :
      evolution of a controlled gambling practice into a problematic gambling practice, resolution
      of the problematic gambling practice without intervention of care, and first recourse to
      specific care.

    <description>The study is conducted at the same time by 7 French specialised centres. The recruitment period is comprised between April 2009 and September 2011.For the first stage of the study, an initial evaluation will be performed at the time of recruitment. It consists in an individual face-to-face interview based on standardized and semi-structured questionnaires, during approximately one and half hour, and focused mainly on gambling trajectory and severity, and on psychiatric and addictive comorbidities. The evaluation is completed by a set of self-administered questionnaires focused on cognitive distortions, temperament and character, ADHD, etc.For the second stage of the study, the cohort will be re-evaluated each year, based on the same questionnaires that for initial evaluation. Each participant will be followed-up during 5 years. The study will thus end up in September 2016.</description>
