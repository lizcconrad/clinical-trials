  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has a
      specific inhibitory activity against Gram positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

      Dosage of 600 mg discontinuous administration twice a day was about studies in safety
      volunteers. The intensive care units patients, with mechanical ventilation, and with severe
      sepsis, represent highly heterogeneous population responsible of hight variability in
      pharmacokinetics parameters (augmentation in total volume of distribution, modification in
      glomerular filtration) wich can lead to antibiotic inefficacy.

      In a first time, this study describe the pharmacokinetics of Linezolid in intensive care
      units patients with severe MRSA infection. The aim of this study is to define and validate a
      population pharmacokinetic model including the influence of patients' characteristic on the
      pharmacokinetics of Linezolid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demographic, clinical and biological parameters are collected. Patients receive Linezolid
      as 600 mg twice a day during an administration of 60 minutes.

      Blood sampling are collected on the second day after beginning of treatment at the following
      time : H1, H2, H3, H6 and H12.

      The population pharmacokinétics analysis will be carried out using Monolix, a software for
      the analysis of nonlinear mixed effects models.
