      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of Atomoxetine (ATMX) in
      the treatments of adolescent and young adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      with comorbid Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The secondary objective of the study is to
      determine the efficacy of ATMX in preventing SUD relapse. As previous pre-clinical work has
      demonstrated that ATMX has led to significant improvement in ADHD in children and lacks abuse
      liability, the investigators hypothesize that ATMX will be efficacious in treating ADHD in
      adolescents and young adults with SUD, and that ATMX will also be efficacious in preventing
      SUD relapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female outpatients 15-30 years.

          -  Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD (combined or inattentive subtype) as
             determined by clinical evaluation and/or ADHD module of structured diagnostic
             interview, completed by the study clinician.

          -  Subjects with a current or recent (within three months) substance use disorder (drugs
             or alcohol) as determined through clinical evaluation and/or ascertained through
             structured diagnostic interview.

          -  Subjects with an ADHD CGI-S of &gt;= 4 (moderate impairment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing females.

          -  Subjects with a clinically unstable medical condition that will either jeopardize
             patient safety or affect the scientific merit of the study, or who undergo a change in
             treatment during the study.

          -  Recent history of intravenous drug use, or subjects who have current DSM-IV criteria
             for abuse or dependence of cocaine, MDA, MDMA, gammahydroxybutyrate, methamphetamines,
             amphetamines, opioids, PCP, or benzodiazepines that in the opinion of the investigator
             will interfere in their ability to participate safely in the study.

          -  Subjects who are psychotic or have a history of bipolar disorder.

          -  Participants who are taking any psychotropic or anti-SUD medications will be excluded
