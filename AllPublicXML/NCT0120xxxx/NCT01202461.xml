      This study is designed to report 3-year result of triple therapy of vitrectomy, intravitreal
      triamcinolone and macular laser photocoagulation for intractable diabetic macular edema.

      Previously author reported 1-year result(Am J Ophthalmol. 2007 Dec;144(6):878-885. Epub 2007
      Oct 15.).

    <description>all pars plana vitrectomy were accompanied with removal of retinal Internal limiting membrane (ILM) around fovea in round fashion with a dimension of approximately 2 disc diameters.
IVTA was introduced at the end of surgery or on the next day (4mg in 0.1cc). Two weeks afterward, fluorescein angiography guided macular laser photocoagulation which consisted of direct photocoagulation on leaking microaneurysms and application of grid pattern laser was undertaken.</description>
