      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of LOVAZA (fish oil capsules) to
      decrease inflammation in children and adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). It has been
      found that besides the damage caused by sickle red blood cells themselves, the inflammatory
      response that occurs in SCD patients could potentially play a significant role in the
      occurrence of painful episodes or pain crises. The investigators will also study whether the
      subject/caregiver feels that there is an improvement in the child's quality of life by taking
      the medication. Besides the effect of LOVAZA on inflammation,the investigators are also
      testing whether the drug will have a beneficial effect on blood clotting ability (which is
      known to be increased in SCD) and on the anemia (low red blood cells) that is part of the
      disease entity.
