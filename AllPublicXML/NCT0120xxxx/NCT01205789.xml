      The purpose of the Universal Registry is to assess the proportion and reasons for which
      subjects with angiographically significant ULMCA disease requiring revascularization during
      the time course of this study are not randomized; to compare the baseline characteristics of
      subjects; and to assess the variability in randomization eligibility and treatment patterns.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 consecutive subjects who otherwise meet all enrollment criteria, will be
      analyzed separately as intermediate lesion subjects, and will be followed through the time of
      initial treatment per standard of care with intended PCI, CABG or medical treatment.
