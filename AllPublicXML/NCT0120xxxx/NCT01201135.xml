  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with thalassemia intermedia, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I , and
      sideroblastic anemia were found to express very high levels of serum GDF15, and this
      contributed to the inappropriate suppression of hepcidin with subsequent secondary iron
      overload.The aim of our present study is to asses the levels of GDF15 and hepcidin in
      patients with Sickle cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis

      The identification of the ferroportin/hepcidin axis has allowed the effect of erythroid
      activity on iron balance to be studied and has created the basis for better defining the
      erythroid regulators.

      In iron-loading anemias, ineffective erythropoiesis suppresses hepcidin production, which
      result in dysregulating iron homeostasis. Miller and co-workers showed that release of
      cytokines like growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) during the process of ineffective
      erythropoiesis inhibits hepcidin production, thus defining a molecular link between
      ineffective erythropoiesis, suppression of hepcidin production and parenchymal iron loading.

        The study will contain 40 patients with Sickle cell disease and 40 patients with hereditary
        spherocytosis.

        After ICF (Informed Consent Form) has been signed by the patients the following laboratory
        tests will be taken once during the study:

          1. GDF 15( 3ml of serum) (at the laboratory of hematology at Wolfson Medical
             Center/Israel)

          2. Hepcidine (3ml of serum) (at the laboratory of Prof. T. Ganz, USA). The blood samples
             should be taken at least one week apart from blood transfusion.

        In case of infection or acute inflammation , blood samples should be taken only one week
        after resolution of these conditions.
