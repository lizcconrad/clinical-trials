    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about the safety of the study drug bevacizumab(Avastin®),
      when used to treat radiation necrosis.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the feasibility of treating Central Nervous
      System (CNS) tumor patients suffering from radiation necrosis with bevacizumab every 2 weeks.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate improvement in neurologic symptoms associated with bevacizumab as assessed
           by clinical evaluation;

        -  To investigate the neuro-imaging changes in radiation necrosis associated edema,
           including Mass Resonance (MR) spectroscopy;

        -  To evaluate changes in corticosteroid use in patients with radiation necrosis following
           treatment with bevacizumab;

        -  To evaluate changes in quality of life.

      Treatment Plan:

      For patient consented and enrolled on study, bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 10
      mg/kg IV every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses (3 doses/cycle).

      Patients are expected to receive at least 1 cycle (6 weeks) of study treatment unless an
      unacceptable drug reaction occurs. Patients will receive a second cycle of treatment as long
      as treatment is tolerated. Response assessment will be performed every 6 weeks (three
      doses/cycle of study drug) including clinical and radiological assessment. Secondary measures
      including documentation of total equivalent steroid dose, length of time on steroids, and
      quality of life using the modified McMaster Health Instrument scale will also be collected
      while on treatment and 30 days after finishing treatment.

      Safety will be assessed by routine physical and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events will
      be recorded and the severity graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (version 4.0).

    <description>This pilot study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of treating pediatric patients with CNS radiation necrosis with bevacizumab. This regimen will be deemed feasible if a majority (7 out of 10) patients are able to successfully receive at least 5 of the 6 scheduled doses of bevacizumab without increase in serious adverse events as compared to patients post-radiation therapy alone.</description>

    <description>Outcome 1: Monitor overall neurologic status and symptoms before, during and 1 month following treatment with bevacizumab.
Outcome 2: Dose and duration of corticosteroid use prior to, during, and up to 1 month following bevacizumab treatment will also be collected and evaluated.
Outcome 3: Changes in neuro-imaging through MRI which will include Mass Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).
