  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1325756 is a potent, competitive, selective and reversible CXCR2 receptor antagonist that
      is being developed as a once-daily oral anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Selective antagonism of the interaction between
      CXCR2 and its various chemokine ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the underlying
      inflammation in COPD via the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and activation. The current
      study explores the effects of age, gender and food (high fat meal) on the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK1325756.

      Because a significant proportion of COPD subjects are prescribed proton pump inhibitors
      (PPI's) such as omeprazole in order to alleviate symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease
      (GERD), it is important to understand the absorption of the current formulation of GSK1325756
      in an environment of raised intra-gastric pH as will be encountered in patients taking PPI's.
      Therefore, this study will also evaluate the impact of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole
      on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1325756.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and
             study objectives.

             However, subjects taking a stable dose of anti-hypertensive medication for at least 3
             months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK Medical
             Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives. In all cases,
             subjects should have a resting BP of 140/90 irrespective of anti-hypertensive
             medication status.

             Subjects taking a stable dose of lipid lowering medications (statins or fibrates) for
             at least 3 months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives.

          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) more than 40 MlU/ml
             and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method.

          3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until least 3-months post-last dose of study drug.

          4. Body weight more than or equal to 60 kg (110 lbs) for men and more than or equal to 45
             kg (99lbs) for women and BMI within the range 19-32 kg/m2 inclusive.

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          6. Willingness to complete all study procedures and complete all planned treatment
             periods and follow up assessments.

        7.12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the Investigator,
        and average QTcB or QTcF less than 450 msec 8.AST and ALT less than 2xULN; alkaline
        phosphatase and bilirubin less than 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin more than 1.5xULN is
        acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          2. A neutrophil count at screening of less than 2 x 109/L

          3. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          4. A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          5. A positive test for HIV antibody.

          6. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of more than 14 drinks for males or more than 7 drinks for
             females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5
             ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          9. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures,s compromise
             subject safety, or interfere with the objectives of the study. All concomitant
             medications should be queried with the GSK Medical Monitor.

         10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

         11. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         12. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

         13. Lactating females.

         14. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

         15. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

         16. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

         17. Urinary cotinine/ exhaled breath CO levels indicative of smoking or history or regular
             use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.
