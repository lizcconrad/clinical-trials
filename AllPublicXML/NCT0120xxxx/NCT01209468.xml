  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a serious and common disorder affecting one in twenty-five
      men and one in fifty women over the age of 30. This breathing abnormality occurs during sleep
      and is characterised by snoring and episodes of sleep disturbances. The symptoms of untreated
      OSA (e.g. excessive daytime sleepiness), can result in significant reductions in the
      patients' quality of life. The key treatment modalities today include Continuous Positive Air
      Pressure (CPAP), surgery and the use of oral appliances (OAs). Increasingly, OAs have been
      advocated in the treatment of the symptoms of OSA since they offer a non-invasive form of
      treatment and also because patients often prefer this treatment to other treatment
      modalities. There is increasing evidence to support the effectiveness of OAs in the
      management of OSA, at least as a short term measure. What is still unclear is which types of
      OA are most effective and whether OAs are effective in the long term management of OSA. This
      randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate two differently designed OAs in terms of their
      effect on patients' quality of life and on the physiological symptoms of OSA
      (apnoea/hypopnoea index AHI). Around 45 patients with OSA will be recruited from a pool of
      patients referred to the dental hospital for treatment from the medical faculty. The
      treatment with OAs will commence after randomization to two treatment groups; follow-up
      examinations will take place over a period of 12 months. The results of this study will help
      inform practitioners and patients of the feasibility of using OAs in the long term management
      of OSA and help determine the most appropriate type of OAs for the management of OSA and
      improvement in quality of life.

    <description>Patients in treatment arm/group B will have a customized twinblock OA constructed for them individually. They will undergo an appliance acclimatization period of 4-5 weeks. Three months after baseline assessments - T1 (6 weeks of 'active' treatment), physiological measurements will be evaluated, clinical oral examinations conducted, quality of life and compliance assessed. Following this, a customized monobloc OA will be constructed for subjects individually and they will acclimatize to it for 4-5 weeks (so that the mandible is protruded to the maximum position they feel comfortable with when the appliance is worn). Prior to the active treatment phase, patients will not wear the monobloc OA for 1 week (washout phase). Three months later - T2 (6 weeks of 'active' treatment), all the previous measurements will be conducted again.</description>
