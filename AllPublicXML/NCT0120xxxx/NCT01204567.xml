      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of aerobic fitness training on mental health
      (health-related quality of life),cognitive and physical capacity in older people discharge
      from hospital and to assess if further aerobic training at home enhances the effect.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial conducted at Oslo University Hospital, department of
      Medicine in conjunction with Oslo University College. The subjects will be randomized into
      one intervention group (training group) or one control group.

      Outcome measure:

      Health-related quality of life Physical function Cognitive capacity Physical activity Body
      composition Physical activity level

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has indicated that participation in a regular exercise program is an effective
      intervention to maintain and enhance cognitive and physical function in older
      individuals.Despite good evidence regarding the positive effects of exercise, a sedentary or
      inactive lifestyle is common among people over 65 years of old, especially among persons with
      chronic diseases. Research shows that good mental health and physical capacity is of vital
      importance for living independently in the community and we know that participation in
      physical activity offers good opportunities to extend years of active independent life.
      Nevertheless our knowledge is sparse regarding the evidence of effective programs for health
      promotion in groups of elderly, especially after discharge from hospital. Our knowledge is
      also sparse as to which intervention program is the most effective, group-based training or
      home- based training.

    <description>Group-based Aerobic Interval Training twice a week in 12 weeks, based on the Ulleval model. The Norwegian Ulleval Model is a group-based aerobic interval training program which is widely used in Scandinavian hospitals for patients with coronary disease. It is designed to improve physical capacity, body awareness and emotional well-being.</description>
