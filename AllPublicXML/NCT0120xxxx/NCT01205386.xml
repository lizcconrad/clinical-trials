      The purpose of this study is to determine if the CROSSER CTO Recanalization System can
      facilitate the successful crossing of Chronic Total Occlusions in the Central lumen of the
      Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA). A Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) is defined as 100%
      narrowing of the artery, with no angiographically detectable antegrade blood flow, and the
      assessment that the lesion has been in existence for a minimum of 30 days. This study will
      enroll up to 100 patients at up to 8 clinical sites. The CROSSER CTO Recanalization System
      was cleared for commercialization by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration. This study also
      involves an imaging device called the IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging) catheter. This
      device has been cleared for commercialization by the US Food and Drug Administration and will
      be studied for its cleared intended use. The IVUS catheter is used to generate real-time
      images of the artery, which will allow for evaluation of the artery after the occlusion is
      crossed. This is a post-market registry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have objective evidence of lower extremity ischemia and scheduled to
             undergo an endovascular recanalization.

          -  Occluded artery must be the native superficial femoral artery.

          -  Patient must have a totally occlusive lesion classified angiographically as absolute
             (100% occlusion with no flow).

          -  Patient's target vessel occlusion length is ≤ 30 cm.

          -  Patient's reference vessel diameter is greater than or equal to 3.0mm.

          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for PTA, peripheral artery bypass surgery or
             peripheral artery stent implantation.

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             72 hours prior to the study procedure.

          -  Patient or guardian must have been informed of the nature of the study, agree to its
             provisions, and provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin or radiographic
             contrast agents which cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          -  The patient requires immediate treatment in more than one occluded vessel, in any
             combination of grafts or native vessels.

          -  Patient's occlusion is a flush occlusion initiating less than 2cm from the ostium.

             follow-up period.

          -  Patient has no collateral flow distal to the occlusion.

          -  Patient's target occlusion has a dissection that occurred within the past 60 days
             caused by a guidewire attempt.
