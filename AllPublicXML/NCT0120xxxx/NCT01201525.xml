      Hypothesis: Improvement of recent surgical scars after treatment with 595nm Pulsed dye laser
      treatments.

      Study design: Prospective single blinded within patient controlled randomised trial. Recent
      surgical scars of at least 5cm will be divided into 2 parts and randomized. 1 part will be
      treated with 4 595nm Pulsed dye laser treatments on a 4 weeks interval. The other part will
      serve as a within patient control. 1 and 6 months after the intervention both parts of the
      scar will be evaluated.
