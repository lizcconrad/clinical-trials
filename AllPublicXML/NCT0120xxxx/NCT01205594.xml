  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Briefly, after the induction of anesthesia and the placement of TEE, hemodynamic variables
      (pulmonary and systemic blood pressure, central and pulmonary venous pressure, cardiac
      output, calculated SVR, etc.) will be collected. In addition, left ventricular performance
      (including estimates of LVEDV, LVESV, EF, FAC, etc.) will be assessed using TEE. Once these
      baseline data are recorded, the ITPR will be inserted in the anesthesia circuit and activated
      to provide -9 mmHg ETP. After the ITPR has been active for at least two minutes, the same
      hemodynamic and TEE data obtained above will be gathered. After the data is recorded, the
      ITPR will be disconnected and no further interventions will be made. In addition to the
      hemodynamic and echocardiographic data described above, an arterial blood gas will be
      obtained from the pre-existing radial artery catheter during the on- and off- states.

      Finally, the TEE examination will be recorded on videotape or DVD. A second
      echocardiographer, blinded to patient and ITPR status will review each echocardiogram and
      assess left ventricular performance. In addition to the data derived at the time of testing,
      the second echocardiographer will assess, if possible, changes in EF using Simpson's method
      of disks is used to calculate the LV volume.

      This is a proof of concept/feasibility study designed to test the primary hypothesis that use
      of the ITPR will result in increased systemic blood pressure and cardiac output in patients
      undergoing CABG surgery. The effect of the ITPR on other secondary indicators of cardiac
      performance will also be examined. These include but are not limited to left ventricular end
      diastolic volume (LVEDV), ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular end systolic volume
      (LVESV), and fractional area change (FAC) as assessed by echocardiography, pulmonary artery
      pressure, and calculated systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

    <textblock>
      The ITPR is an FDA-approved device intended to increase circulation and blood pressure in
      hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock. The device is inserted within a standard respiratory
      circuit between the patient and the ventilator. It functions by decreasing intrathoracic
      pressure during the expiratory phase to subatmospheric levels after each positive pressure
      ventilation. The decrease in intrathoracic pressure creates a vacuum within the thorax
      relative to the rest of the body thereby enhancing blood return to the heart and consequently
      increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Activation of the device is also accompanied by
      a decrease in SVR. The end result is a device that simultaneously improves cardiac output by
      increasing LVEDP/LVEDV and decreasing SVR while increasing coronary perfusion pressure by
      increasing blood pressure and decreasing LVESP/LVESV.1-8
