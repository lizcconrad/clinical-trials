  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a dramatic rise from 46% to 59% in the percentage of households with only 1-2
      people from 1970 to 2000. A 40% increase in the number of people living alone is projected
      for 2010. Social isolation is consistently one of the strongest predictors mortality in older
      adults. Recent research is demonstrating that stress plays an important role linking social
      isolation with poor health. Socially isolated older adults are more likely to feel
      chronically stressed and overwhelmed with everyday life demands. Furthermore, isolated adults
      respond to stress differently, both psychologically and physiologically. Socially isolated
      and lonely older adults show long-term elevations in &quot;inflammatory cytokines&quot;, which are
      signaling molecules related by immune cells. These Inflammatory cytokines play a role in a
      number of age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and
      arthritis. Novel, readily useable interventions aimed at decreasing isolation and
      &quot;re-calibrating&quot; stress responses might be helpful to older adults.

      Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese form of calisthenics that promotes relaxation and decreases
      feelings of stress and as such, it may be a useful intervention for socially isolated,
      stressed older adults. However, its effects on stress responses are unknown. Tai Chi Chih
      (TCC) is a simplified, manualized, readily exportable form of Tai Chi particularly
      well-suited for older adults. This proposed study will test the effects of a TCC intervention
      with socially isolated older adults on loneliness, stress and health outcomes, including
      inflammatory assessment. Tai Chi-naïve participants who perceive themselves as socially
      isolated, as measured by the UCLA Loneliness Scale will be randomized to receive either Tai
      Chi or education control for a 12-week period. Subjects will undergo pre- and
      post-intervention stress assessment, including exposure to a psychological stress task, to
      assess whether Tai Chi affects how subjects physiologically and psychologically respond to
      stress.
