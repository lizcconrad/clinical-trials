  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inpatients in the neurology rehabilitation units at Riverview Health Center― people who are
      brain-injured and or who have had a stroke ― often have dysphagia as a result of their
      condition. They are considered at high risk of aspiration, which can result in pneumonia. To
      limit that risk, these patients are only allowed to consume thickened liquids at the
      beginning of their rehabilitation. They are restricted from consuming thin liquids, which
      means they can't even drink water. Depending on the rate of their rehabilitation, these
      restrictions can last from six months to a year.

      Patients on a diet of thickened liquids sometimes have difficulty consuming the required
      daily intake of fluids and they become dehydrated, which in turn can lead to other health
      complications. As well, thickened liquids do not always satisfy a patient's thirst, says
      Pooyania.

      While Riverview does not allow inpatients with dyspagia to have water at the beginning of
      their rehabilitation, many rehab facilities in Canada and the U.S. follow the &quot;Frazier Free
      Water Protocol,&quot; which does allow patients unrestricted water intake prior to and 30 minutes
      after meals. The belief that this protocol is safe is based on research done at the Frazier
      Rehabilitation Institute, where a study demonstrated no difference in rates of aspiration
      pneumonia between an experimental group on a free water protocol and a control group.

      The Frazer study was only one randomized controlled trial with a very limited number of
      patients. There have been a few case reports as well, but at Riverview centre, the protocol
      is not accepted because the investigators don't believe there is enough evidence behind it.
      The investigators intend to provide more clinical evidence so that both the risks and
      benefits of a free water protocol can be assessed.

      The investigators will be screening patients admitted to the neurology rehabilitation units
      at RCH, including both the stroke and acquired brain injury programs. The investigators
      expect to find at least 30 suitable candidates.

      Participants will be educated about dysphagia and the free water protocol, and the treatment
      group will be allowed unrestricted water intake prior to and 30 minutes after meals.
      Individualized intervention to minimize aspiration will be provided. Daily and weekly
      monitoring and testing of all patients will take place. The pilot study will continue for 11
      months. A secondary objective of the research is to determine the feasibility of expanding
      into a multi-centre clinical trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research to determine the impact of a free water protocol on inpatients in a neurological
      rehabilitation setting is extremely relevant to the patient population at Riverview Health
      Centre (RHC), as many patients at RHC receive a modified diet consisting of thickened
      liquids. To date, the research base for the use of free water protocols is limited. Despite
      the general lack of research evidence, modified versions of a free water protocol have been
      adopted at numerous facilities across North America. Pursuing clinical research to measure
      the effects of a free water protocol on rate of aspiration pneumonia, quality of life related
      to swallowing, fluid intake, and hydration levels, would provide research evidence to help
      guide patient care. If such research were to show that a free water protocol could be used
      without increased risk to patients with dysphagia, the patient population at Riverview, and
      at other rehabilitation centers, could benefit.
