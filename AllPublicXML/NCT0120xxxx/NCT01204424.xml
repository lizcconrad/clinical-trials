    <textblock>
      The success of dental implants is based on a variety of factors including; surgical
      technique, health of the patient, operator skill and, to a significant part, sufficient bone
      for the placement and integration of dental implants. To that end, the replacement of the
      maxillary posterior teeth have presented a considerable challenge because, after the loss of
      maxillary posterior teeth the quality and quantity of the remaining supporting bone may be
      insufficient to support implants properly or reliably. To overcome the deficiency of
      insufficient vertical bone mass of the maxilla, several surgical techniques have been
      developed to increase available bone mass for the replacement of dental implants by bone
      augmentation.

      The conventional procedure for a sinus lift (Caldwell-Luc procedure) requires preparation of
      a mucoperiosteal flap in the buccal molar region and to cut an oval window in the thus
      exposed bone, without damage to the subjacent maxillary sinus membrane. The procedure is very
      invasive and subjects the patient to great stress as a result of substantial swelling and
      discoloration of up to 10 days, and possibly of pain. This surgical procedure is oftentimes
      referred to as &quot;open&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; sinus lift. This technique is fraught with many risks and
      complications because of the limitations of healing potential in the maxillary sinus. In
      spite of these risks many patients undergo this procedure because of the strong desire to
      replace missing maxillary teeth with dental implants.

      An alternative approach to the maxillary sinus from the inferior approach of the alveolar
      ridge utilizing solid cylindrical osteotomes was described by Dr. Summers (crestal sinus
      lift). It is a more conservative approach and is less invasive. It was developed to eliminate
      the risks described above.While this technique is safer, an overzealous use of an osteotome
      during the placement of the regenerative material can result in the perforation of the
      subantral membrane with disadvantages discussed above.

      Dr. Eder has developed an innovative way - the JEDER System - of carrying out a crestal sinus
      lift that substantially reduces the risk of perforating the subantral membrane. This minimal-
      invasive way uses 2 newly developed and successfully patented instruments, the
      &quot;Druckkammerknochenfräse&quot; DKK and the &quot;Sinusvibrationspumpe&quot; SVP. Following JEDER Syst. the
      mucous membrane of the mouth is opened from the toothless part of the maxillary crest up to
      the bone and the bone is scraped by a cylindrical cutter in the shape of a tunnel up to
      slightly underneath the maxillary sinus membrane.

      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the JEDER Syst., which was
      already demonstrated in 50 treatment attempts. The results of this study will be used for the
      certification process to enable the declaration of conformity for the market approval.

      The main outcome parameter is the perforation rate of the subantral membrane intraoperatively
      and within 6 weeks after the operation.

      Risk benefit assessment:

      In the present study there will be no additional examinations undertaken compared to patients
      which undergo the conventional procedure. The conventional procedure is associated with a
      risk of membrane perforation and consecutive diseases like infection, swelling and pain. All
      these inconveniences should be avoided by using the JEDER Syst. If the worst case scenario -
      the perforation of the subantral membrane - happens, the conventional method will be used.
      Therefore, the risk-benefit assessment

    <description>The mucous membrane is opened from the toothless part of the maxillary crest up to the bone and the bone is scraped by a cylindrical cutter in the shape of a tunnel up to slightly underneath the maxillary sinus membrane and hydraulic pressure is being built up within the DKK. A centrally placed drill within the DKK slowly moves in the direction of the membrane. At the moment of the first minimal perforation of the remaining bone the pressurized fluid pushes the membrane back and ensures that the membrane is not perforated by the drill.
The SVP is used to generate hydraulic vibrations, which help to further raise the membrane from the bone (principle of the &quot;percussion drill&quot;). After the maxillary sinus membrane has successfully been elevated, the working fluid is extracted and bone replacement material is introduced via the bore.</description>
