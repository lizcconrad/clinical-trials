      The application scenario is shown in the figure below: the user utilizes an ECG-based
      wireless sensor (WiBoC Chipset), and transmit those signals to a mobile-phone device that has
      an embedded expert system integrated. With the aid of 3G system, a remote healthcare
      monitoring center receives those uploaded signals and stores into the application server.
      According to the events from this server, the people on service responses to the emergency
      and takes the corresponding process.
