    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to extend a previously reported 1 year follow-up on carpal tunnel
      release, in matched diabetic and non-diabetic patients,to compare outcomes 5 years after
      surgery.

      The Follow-up investigation includes:

        1. Clinical examination of sensory and motor function

        2. Generic and disease specific self-administered questionnaires

        3. Nerve conduction study

        4. Vibration threshold testing
