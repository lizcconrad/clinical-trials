The total score ranged from 0 to 42, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment value done on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <description>The area of the infected lesion size was calculated as the product between the length (L) and width (W) of the lesion size. The wound was measured by the investigator in centimeters (cm), using a standard metric ruler. Baseline was defined as the assessment value done on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up (28 Day Follow-up, Day 40)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success was defined as total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection recorded at Baseline, or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was necessary, including a pus/exudates SIS of 0. The pathogens isolated at Baseline included staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] as defined by susceptibility to cefoxitin or oxacilin), streptococcus pyogenes, other streptococcus species, other Gram-positive pathogens and Gram-negative pathogens. Data is categorized for the percentage of participants with clinical success for each of the pathogens, all pathogens and no pathogens.</description>

        <description>Vital sign assessments were conducted at Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 2 (pre-dose), Day 3 (pre-dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-dose), Day 8 (pre-dose) and Day 11. The assessments were made with the participant in a semi-supine position, having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three HR measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1. The mean value recorded at pre-dose was classified as Baseline. Single HR was obtained at all other time points during the study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in SBP and DBP at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessments were conducted at Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 2 (pre-dose), Day 3 (pre-dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-dose), Day 8 (pre-dose) and Day 11. The assessments were made with the participant in a semi-supine position, having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three BP measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1. The mean value recorded at pre-dose was classified as Baseline. Single BP was obtained at all other time points during the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in HR at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessments were conducted at Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 2 (pre-dose), Day 3 (pre-dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-dose), Day 8 (pre-dose) and Day 11. The assessments were made with the participant in a semi-supine position, having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three HR measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1. The mean value recorded at pre-dose was classified as Baseline. Single HR was obtained at all other time points during the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in RR at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessments were conducted at Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 2 (pre-dose), Day 3 (pre-dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-dose), Day 8 (pre-dose) and Day 11. The assessments were made with the participant in a semi-supine position, having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three RR measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1. The mean value recorded at pre-dose was classified as Baseline. Single RR was obtained at all other time points during the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Electrocardiogram (ECG) Values at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR, QRS, RR, QT, and QTc intervals. It was performed with the participant in a semi-supine position having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1 at least 5 minutes apart. The mean PR interval, RR interval, QRS duration, uncorrected QT interval (UncQT) and QTcB (QT corrected by Bazett’s formula) and QTcF (corrected by Friedericia's formula) was calculated from automated ECG readings. The assessments were done at Day 1 (pre-dose, 0.25-1.5 hours post-initial dose and 1.5-3 hours post-initial dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-morning dose), Day 8 (pre-morning dose) and Day 11 (0 hour). The mean value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 was classified as Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in ECG Values at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR, QRS, RR, QT, and QTc intervals. It was performed with the participant in a semi-supine position having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1 at least 5 minutes apart. The mean PR interval, RR interval, QRS duration, uncorrected QT interval (UncQT) and QTcB (QT corrected by Bazett’s formula) and QTcF (corrected by Friedericia's formula) was calculated from automated ECG readings. The assessments were done at Day 1 (pre-dose, 0.25-1.5 hours post-initial dose and 1.5-3 hours post-initial dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-morning dose), Day 8 (pre-morning dose) and Day 11 (0 hour). Mean value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 was classified as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from individual post-Baseline (Day 1 post-dose, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11) values.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in ECG Rhythms at Indicated Time Points</title>
          <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rhythm and measured PR, QRS, RR, QT, and QTc intervals. It was performed with the participant in a semi-supine position having rested in that position for at least 10 minutes beforehand. Three measurements were taken at pre-dose on Day 1 at least 5 minutes apart and the mean of the three measurements was calculated. The assessments were done at Day 1 (pre-dose, 0.25-1.5 hours post-initial dose and 1.5-3 hours post-initial dose), Day 4 (4-12 hours post-morning dose), Day 8 (pre-morning dose) and Day 11 (0 hour). The value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 was the Baseline. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 1 post-dose, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 11) values.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Transition From Baseline in Hematology Values Relative to Normal Range</title>
        <description>The parameters of clinical chemistry included basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, total neutrophils, WBC count, platelet count, MCV, hemoglobin, MCHC, MCH, RBC count and reticulocyte count. The assessments were done at Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1 (pre-dose). Data is reported for number of participants with abnormal transition from Baseline ‘to high’ or ‘to low’ relative to normal range. Only those parameters for which at least one value of abnormal transition was reported are summarized.</description>

        <description>The clinical response was evaluated by the investigator at end of therapy (within 3 days post therapy; Day 12-14) and Follow-up (7 day Follow-up; Day 16 to 19 and 28 day Follow-up; Day 37 to 40). Clinical response was determined after clinical evaluation of reviewing clinical signs and symptoms. Clinical success was defined as total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection recorded at Baseline, or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was necessary, including a pus/exudate skin infection score (SIS) of 0.</description>

        <description>Therapeutic outcome was combined clinical and microbiological outcome. Therapeutic outcome was a measure of the overall efficacy response, and a therapeutic success referred to participants who had been deemed both a 'clinical success' and a 'microbiological success'. All other combinations (other than 'clinical success' + 'microbiological success') were deemed failures for therapeutic outcome. Therapeutic outcome was determined programmatically, obtained at 7 day Follow-up.</description>

        <title>Mean Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) Sub-score of Continuous Pain, Intermittent Pain, Neuropathic Pain and Affective Descriptors at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>SF-MPQ-2 is composed of 22 items that describes different quantities of pain and related symptoms. Sub-score of continuous pain represents mean of throbbing pain, cramping pain, gnawing pain, aching pain, heavy pain and tender (mean of items 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10). Sub-score of intermittent pain represents mean of shooting pain, stabbing pain, sharp pain, splitting pain, electric-shock pain and piercing (mean of items 2, 3, 4, 11, 16 and 18). Sub-score of neuropathic pain represents mean of hot-burning pain, cold-freezing pain, pain caused by light touch, itching, tingling or pins and needles, numbness (mean of items 7, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22). Sub-score of affective descriptors represents mean of tiring-exhaustive, sickening, fearful, punishing-cruel (mean of items 12, 13, 14 and 15). Scores ranged from 0 to 10, where 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Assessments were done at Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11 and 7 Day Follow-up.</description>

        <description>The investigator evaluated the infection by grading the infected lesion according to SIS. The SIS consist of 7 items of exudate or pus, crusting, erythema or inflammation, tissue warmth, tissue edema, itching and pain. The items were rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 indicated absence of symptom and 6 indicated severe symptom. The total score ranged from 0 to 42, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Assessments were done at Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Total SIS at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>The investigator evaluated the infection by grading the infected lesion according to SIS. The SIS consist of 7 items of exudate or pus, crusting, erythema or inflammation, tissue warmth, tissue edema, itching and pain. The items were rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 indicated absence of symptom and 6 indicated severe symptom. The total score ranged from 0 to 42, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated more severe symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment value done on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Wound Area at Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>The area of the infected lesion size was calculated as the product between the length (L) and width (W) of the lesion size. The wound was measured by the investigator in centimeters (cm), using a standard metric ruler. Baseline was defined as the assessment value done on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 8, Day 11, 7 Day Follow-up and 28 Day Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>
