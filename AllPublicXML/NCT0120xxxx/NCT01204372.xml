    <textblock>
      GATE 1 is an open-label, non-comparative, multicentric study evaluating the efficacy and
      tolerance of the combined use of Gemcitabine, Trastuzumab and Erlotinib as a first-line
      chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.

      The patients will be treated intravenously with Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 for 30
      min. For the first eight weeks, Gemcitabine will be administered once weekly for 7 weeks
      followed by one week of rest. Subsequently, Gemcitabine will be administered once weekly for
      three weeks followed by one week of rest.

      Trastuzumab will be administered once a week at a dose of 4 mg/kg over 90 min. at D1 and then
      at 2 mg/kg over 30 min. for the subsequent infusions.

      Erlotinib will be administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/day from C1D1.

      The patients will be subjected to research for the EGFR, HER2 and KRAS status.
