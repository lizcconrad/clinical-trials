  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was well known that long term intubation caused a various kind of abnormal presentations
      of dysphagia such as the increased aspiration risk, the decreased gag reflex, mucosal
      pathology, the airway stenosis and so on. It was thought that the freezing and impaired
      proprioception to be developed as a result of dis-use around the pharynx and the larynx while
      intubation was one of the reason.

      Preemptive swallowing manual stimulation applied on the oral cavity to avoid the vicious
      cycle of dis-use was reported to improve dysphagia after extubation.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation have been utilized for a wide variety of dysphagia of
      multiple causes of neuro-muscular disorder.

      Supposing that preemptive transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation to be delivered
      to the muscles of being involved in swallowing could decrease the degree of dis-use during
      intubation so that it could reduce the occurence and severity of dysphagia developed after
      extubation, the investigators plan to perform randomized prospective double blind placebo
      controlled clinical interventional study.

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous neuro-muscular electrical stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Neuro-muscular electrical stimulation with two pairs of surface electrodes was applied to submental area. One paired electrodes to be placed horizontally was attached on the anterior half of area between mandible and hyoid bone. The other was affixed to posterior half of the same area far laterally. Bipolar electrical stimulation with pulse rate of 80-Hz, duration of 700 Âµs and intensity to evoke visible muscle contraction was performed for 60 minutes a day until one day before extubation.</description>
