      This study is planned to evaluate emotional disorders during treatment by interferon (IFN)
      beta in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects. This is an open-label
      exploratory study with no change of therapeutic behavior but with standardized
      neuropsychologic follow-up.

      This study is planned to evaluate emotional disorders during treatment by IFN beta in RRMS
      subjects. This is an open-label, prospective, interventional, multicentric study with no
      change of therapeutic behavior but with standardized neuropsychologic follow-up. Subjects
      will undergo 13 evaluations (categorical and dimensional evaluations), 3 evaluations will be
      performed before the treatment (Baseline, Day 7 and 15) and 10 evaluations after the
      treatment (Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Emotional Dyscontrol Sub-score of the Depressive Mood Scale (Echelle d'Humeur Depressive [EHD]) Scale at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>EHD scale is a tool to assess the depressive mood dimensions 'lack of emotional control' (emotional dyscontrol) and 'blunted effect' which comprises of 11 items graded in 4 degrees from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), where 4 corresponds to the worst state. The emotional dyscontrol sub-score is the sum of items 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11. The total possible score range from 1 (not at all) to 28 (very much), where 28 corresponds to worst state.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI State) Score at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>STAI state scale is an auto-evaluation scale for anxiety. This scale includes 20 items that allow quantifying feeling of apprehension, tension, nervousness and worry that the participant feels at the time of the completion of the questionnaire. The 20 items are graded from 1 (no) to 4 (yes), where 'yes' corresponds to the best state for items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 (scoring was reversed before calculation of total score); and to the worst state for items 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18. The total score ranged from 1 (best state) to 80 (worst state). (Spielberger CD et al., 1983)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Score at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>CES-D is an auto-questionnaire including 20 items to screen for depressive feelings and behaviour. The 20 items of this scale are graded from 0 (never) to 3 (always), where 3 corresponds to the most severe state with the exception of items 4, 8, 12 and 16 (scoring was reversed before the calculation of the total score). Total score ranged from 0 (never) to 60 (always), where 60 corresponds to most severe state. (Radloff LS, 1977)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Center for State-trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-state) Score at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>STAXI-state scale measures the intensity of anger as an emotional state (state anger) and the disposition to experience angry feelings as a personality trait (trait anger). In this study only 1 of the original 6 scales was used, the state anger scale, which measures the intensity of anger at a given moment as emotional state. This scale consists of 15 items graded in 4 degrees from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), where 4 corresponds to the worst state. The total score range from 1 (not at all) to 60 (very much), where 60 corresponds to the worst state. (Spielberger CD, 1996)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fatigue Score at Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue scale was derived from the United Kingdom Neurological Disability Scale (UKNDS), and evaluates fatigue according to the participant's subjective impression and the functional disability that it causes. 'Yes' or 'No' answers result in a score that ranges from 0 to 5, where a score 5 shows worse state. (Sharrack B et al., 1999)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Emotional Dyscontrol Sub-score of the Depressive Mood Scale (Echelle d'Humeur Depressive [EHD]) Scale at Month 12</title>
        <description>EHD scale is a tool to assess the depressive mood dimensions 'lack of emotional control' (emotional dyscontrol) and 'blunted effect' which comprises of 11 items graded in 4 degrees from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), where 4 corresponds to the worst state. The emotional dyscontrol sub-score is the sum of items 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11. The total possible score range from 1 (not at all) to 28 (very much), where 28 corresponds to worst state.

        <title>Change From Baseline in State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI State) Score at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>STAI state scale is an auto-evaluation scale for anxiety. This scale includes 20 items that allow quantifying feeling of apprehension, tension, nervousness and worry that the participant feels at the time of the completion of the questionnaire. The 20 items are graded from 1 (no) to 4 (yes), where 'yes' corresponds to the best state for items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 (scoring was reversed before calculation of total score); and to the worst state for items 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18. The total score ranged from 1 (best state) to 80 (worst state). (Spielberger CD et al., 1983)</description>

          <description>STAI state scale is an auto-evaluation scale for anxiety. This scale includes 20 items that allow quantifying feeling of apprehension, tension, nervousness and worry that the participant feels at the time of the completion of the questionnaire. The 20 items are graded from 1 (no) to 4 (yes), where 'yes' corresponds to the best state for items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20 (scoring was reversed before calculation of total score); and to the worst state for items 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18. The total score ranged from 1 (best state) to 80 (worst state). (Spielberger CD et al., 1983)</description>

        <description>STAXI-state scale measures the intensity of anger as an emotional state (state anger) and the disposition to experience angry feelings as a personality trait (trait anger). In this study only 1 of the original 6 scales was used, the state anger scale, which measures the intensity of anger at a given moment as emotional state. This scale consists of 15 items graded in 4 degrees from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), where 4 corresponds to the worst state. The total score range from 1 (not at all) to 60 (very much), where 60 corresponds to the worst state. (Spielberger CD, 1996)</description>
