  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chordoma is a rare, slow growing, often fatal bone cancer derived from remnants of the
      embryonic notochord. It occurs mostly in the axial skeleton (skull base, vertebrae, sacrum
      and coccyx), is more frequent in males than females, and has a median age at diagnosis of
      58.5 years, with a wide age range. This typically sporadic tumor is often advanced at
      presentation, and mortality is high due to local recurrence or distant metastases. The usual
      treatment is surgery, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Chemotherapy has not had a
      significant treatment role. Reports of a small number of families worldwide with two or more
      relatives with chordoma support a role for susceptibility genes in chordoma etiology.
      Recently we determined that duplications of the T gene co-segregated with disease in four
      multiplex chordoma families. The T gene encodes brachyury, a tissue-specific transcription
      factor that is expressed in notochord cells and is essential for formation and maintenance of
      the notochord. Some of the other chordoma families that we studied did not have T-gene
      duplications; the aggregation of chordomas in these families may result from changes in other
      susceptibility genes or other types of mutations targeting the T gene. We are continuing gene
      identification studies of multiplex chordoma families at the NIH Clinical Center under
      protocol 78-C-0039. We also want to determine whether alterations in any identified chordoma
      susceptibility genes are associated with sporadic chordoma in the general population.

      Objectives:

      The major goal of this protocol is to identify sporadic chordoma patients willing to provide
      germline and tumor DNA for studies to determine the frequency of alterations in chordoma
      susceptibility genes. Our previous protocols with SEER and Massachusetts General Hospital to
      identify chordoma patients were limited to residents of specific geographic regions in the
      U.S. (2 states and 2 metropolitan areas) or to patients with pediatric skull base tumors.
      This protocol will enroll patients who more broadly represent the age, site and gender
      distributions of sporadic chordoma in the general U.S. population.

      Eligibility:

      Eligible patients are males and females in the U.S. with chordoma diagnosed at any age and at
      any primary site. Because we want to obtain saliva from all participants, eligibility is
      limited to patients who will be greater than or equal to age 6 years at the time of
      enrollment.

      Design:

      The study description and contacting information including an e-mail link to the study
      contact person will be posted on web sites of two chordoma support groups. We will mail study
      information to be given to patients to colleagues at major medical centers that treat
      chordoma.

      The components of the study will be carried out in subjects' homes using materials mailed to
      them. Up to 100 participants will: 1) complete a self-administered Personal and Family
      Medical History Questionnaire, 2) collect saliva using a saliva collection kit, and 3)
      provide permission to obtain medical/pathology records, and paraffin blocks or slides on each
      primary chordoma. Parents will serve as proxies for minor children.

      We will recontact patients who report chordoma in at least one blood relative. If we confirm
      the relative's chordoma diagnosis, we will invite the study subject and selected family
      members to participate in clinical and gene mapping studies under protocol 78-C-0039. We may
      also recontact study participants to tell them about any new studies on chordoma etiology.
      They can decide at that time whether they want to participate in them.
