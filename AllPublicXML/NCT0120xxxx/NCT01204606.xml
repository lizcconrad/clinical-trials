      -  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of periarticular injections
           consisting of ropivacaine, morphine, epinephrine, cefotetan, and hyaluronic acid with
           the efficacy of periarticular injections consisting of the same amount of
           placebo(isotonic saline) during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

        -  Adding of multimodal analgesia(MMA) to conventional rotator cuff repair, it was expected
           that could reduce postoperative pain and narcotic consumption.

    <description>Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lazy lateral decubitus position on the operating table.
The surgical area was prepared and draped with Betadine.
Small stab incisions were made in the creation of 4 or 5 portals as needed.
A scope was explored via the arthroscopic portal into the GH joint &amp; subacromial space.
Repaired of rotator cuff tear was done with suture anchors.
Mixed MMA drugs(ropivacaine 300mg;40ml, morphine 10mg;1ml, cefotetan 1g; dilution to ropivacaine, epinephrine 0.3mg;0.3ml, total volume:41.3ml) and sodium hyaluronate 20mg;2ml were injected divisionally periarticular area; intra-articular(sodium hyaluronate 20ml;2ml + 10.3ml); posterior joint capsule(10ml); subacromial space and around suprascapular nerve(11ml); anterior capsule(10ml).
The skin was closed with Nylon or medical staples.
Sterile dressing was applied on surgical wound.
Peripheral intravenous PCA(Patient Controlled Analgesia) was connected.</description>
