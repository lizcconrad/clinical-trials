  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in stent technology and clot reducing drug therapy, acute stent
      occlusion or thrombosis (ST), still occurs and can be life threatening. It has been shown
      that certain features of how the stent relates to the artery wall may predict ST. One such
      feature, so-called stent strut malapposition (SSM), can be assessed after implantation but
      current imaging techniques are relatively unreliable. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a
      newer technology that can be performed safely and easily after angioplasty and may allow the
      stent struts to be assessed more accurately and reliably.

      This study will use OCT to examine how two different types of commonly used drug-eluting
      stents relate to the artery wall. The Xience V (Abbott Vascular, USA) stent has thinner
      struts and a more open frame than the Cypher (Cordis, USA) stent. We hypothesise therefore
      that the potentially more pliable structure of the Xience V stent will be associated with
      greater contact with the vessel wall. This may have a bearing on the relative rate of SSM,
      although large studies have shown the rate to be low in both the Cypher and the Xience V
      stent. We believe that OCT imaging of SSM and symmetry of the stent immediately after
      angioplasty will compliment conventional visual assessment and may identify those patients in
      whom further improvement of stent with a balloon is necessary.

      This study will involve the random allocation of forty patients requiring coronary
      angioplasty to one of the Cypher or Xience V stent. The procedure will be performed in the
      usual manner as indicated clinically and will include imaging of the stented artery segment
      with OCT once the operator is satisfied with the visual result by angiography.

    <measure>Stent strut malapposition (SSM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post stent deployment during the same angiographic procedure within 60 minutes</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent eccentricity index (SEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post stent deployment during the same angiographic procedure within 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a commonly used measure that is designed to quantify the uniformity and symmetry of the stent after it has been deployed in the coronary artery. It is calculated as the minimum diameter of the stent divided by the maximum diameter of the stent at a preset point. The mean SEI will be compared between two stent type groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of stent embedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post stent deployment during the same angiographic procedure within 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This relates to what degree, if at all, the stent strut is 'buried' within the coronary artery wall. The proportion of each strut that is buried or embedded will be calculated and then averaged for each stent group. A strut that is buried in the vessel wall for more than half its thickness will be defined as 'embedded'.</description>
