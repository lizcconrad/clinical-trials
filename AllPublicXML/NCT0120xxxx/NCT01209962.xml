  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer are treated with combinations of surgery, radiation therapy
      and chemotherapy, depending on the location of the cancer and other individual patient health
      factors. The goals of therapy are to reduce or eliminate the cancer cells, but without
      serious damage to normal cells. Investigators at The University of Michigan are conducting a
      research project, to see if treatment effects on an individual patient's cancer cells can be
      detected early by new imaging tests in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer undergoing
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.

    <description>The goal is to develop a functional imaging method that would be a better predictor of pathological response than the current CT standard. Diffusion MRI has the potential to measure early cellular changes that occur in response to successful therapies, such as chemoradiation, and has been demonstrated to be an early predictor not only of therapeutic response, but also of overall survival for other malignancies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologic or cytologic proof of pancreatic cancer, for whom the
             treatment plan, at the time of enrollment, is neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 60
             mL/min/m2), to minimize the small risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis associated
             with gadolinium injection.
