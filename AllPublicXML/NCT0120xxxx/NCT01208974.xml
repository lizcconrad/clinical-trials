      Overall rationale: Prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and
      immediate reconstruction for patient with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer
      will allow better cosmesis and patient's satisfaction:

        -  The use of NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC (nipple-areola complex)
           external beam radiotherapy for selected patient with early stage invasive or in-situ
           breast cancers will be technically feasible and with acceptable complication rates.

        -  The cosmetic results after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative external
           beam radiotherapy to the NAC will be better comparable with Skin Sparing Mastectomy.

        -  The local control rate in the NAC will be more than expected for a NAC sparing
           mastectomy without postoperative radiotherapy.

        -  The patient's satisfaction after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC
           external beam radiotherapy will be better than after Skin Sparing Mastectomy.

      Study design: Phase I trial assessing the safety, feasibility and toxicity of prophylactic
      NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in
      patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer.

      Primary objective: To determine the recommended phase I dose of post-operative prophylactic
      NAC irradiation.

      Secondary objectives: To provide extensive descriptive data regarding NAC-sparing surgery
      with reconstruction, including both surgeon experience and patient evaluation of cosmetic
      results. Survival and recurrence will be assessed.

      Study size: Between 12 and 18 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation/deescalation
      part of this phase I study. An additional expansion cohort of 12 patients will be enrolled at
      the &quot;potential&quot; recommended phase II dose (RP2D) over an expected accrual period of 2 years.

    <measure>Levels of Cosmetic Outcome in Study Participants - Number</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of cosmetic results will be assessed by both the physician(s) and the patients at 3, 6 and 12 months, using a 4-category ordinal scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor). Data will be summarized in terms of number of patients in these 4 possible categories at those assessment times separately for assessment by physician and by patient.</description>

    <measure>Disease-Free Survival Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival rate in study participants will be assessed. Disease-free survival is defined from the date of surgery until the date of documented recurrence (local or distant) or breast cancer-related death, whichever occurs first. Patients who die without documentation of recurrence will be considered to have had disease recurrence at the time of death, unless there is documented evidence that no recurrence occurred before death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival rate in study participants will be assessed. Overall survival is the defined from the date of surgery until the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of death, follow-up time will be censored by the date of last contact..</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrence Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of disease recurrence in study participants. The definition of local recurrence is histologic evidence of recurrent carcinoma, either invasive or non-invasive in the nipple-areola complex in the ipsilateral breast. Clinical evidence of carcinoma by physical exam and/or mammograms/MRI will not be evidence of local recurrence until biopsy proof.</description>
