    <textblock>
      This is the first study in which TAK-441 is administered to humans. The patient population
      will consist of adults aged 18 or older who have advanced nonhematologic malignancies and for
      whom standard treatment is no longer effective or does not offer curative or life-prolonging
      potential. Following completion of the dose escalation study, patients will be enrolled as
      part of 2 expansion cohorts.

    <description>TAK-441 will be administered as an oral tablet as follows:
Patients enrolled in the dose escalation cohorts will receive:
A single-dose administration on Day 1, followed by a 1-week washout period during which pharmacokinetics is assessed
Continuous daily dosing on Days 8 through 28 in Cycle 1
In subsequent cycles, continuous daily dosing over 21 days, repeated continuously
Patients enrolled in the expansion cohorts will receive continuous daily dosing on Days 1 through 21 of each 21-day cycle</description>
