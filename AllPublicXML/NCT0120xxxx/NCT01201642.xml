  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of prednisolone and staging acupuncture in
      the recovery of the affected facial nerve, and to verify that whether in combination with
      staging acupuncture is more effective than prednisolone alone for Bell's palsy in a large
      number of patients.

      Patients will be recruited between Sep, 2010, and Dec, 2014. Baseline assessments before the
      start of treatment include neurological examination, grading of facial function, measurement
      of ipsilateral pain, documentation of concurrent medication.

      These patients are assigned to receive one of the following treatment groups, i.e. 1)the
      hormone group: oral hormone drugs, do not accept acupuncture treatment; 2)acupuncture group:
      using acupuncture therapy, do not accept oral hormone therapy; 3)hormone-acupuncture combined
      treatment group: receive oral hormone and acupuncture therapy at the same time; 4)other
      treatment group: other treatment in addition to the above 3 groups of treatment abroad. The
      secondary factor grouping (subgroup): According to the different time of treatment after the
      onset of disease, the acupuncture group and the hormone- acupuncture combined treatment group
      can be divided into Type Ⅰ subgroup (patients receive acupuncture within 10 days of the onset
      of disease) and Type II subgroups (patients receive acupuncture after 10 days of the onset of
      disease). The primary outcome is the time to complete recovery of facial function, assessed
      by Sunnybrook system and House-Brackmann scale. The secondary outcomes include the incidence
      of ipsilateral pain in the early stage of palsy (and the duration of this pain), the
      proportion of patients with severe pain, the occurrence of synkinesis, facial spasm or
      contracture, and the severity of residual facial symptoms during the study period.

The acupuncture points used were Dicang (ST4), Jiache (ST6), Yangbai (GB14), Xiaguan (ST7), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Quanliao (SI18) and Yifeng (TE17) on the affected side, and Hegu (LI4) bilaterally. For acute stages acupuncture, shallow puncturing is used at facial acupoints and routine puncturing is used at other acupoints within 72 h after onset of Bell's palsy. Yifeng (TE17), Hegu (LI4) are punctured 0.5-1.0 cun, the others are punctured 0.1-0.3 cun. and the needles were retained for 30 minutes, once a day, five times a week, for a total period of four weeks.</description>
