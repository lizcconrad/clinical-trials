    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators are going to explore the oxidative status of HS-RBC
      and its contribution to hemolysis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oxidative status of cells, which is determined by the balance between pro-oxidants, such
      as the reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants, is a major regulator of cellular
      functions. Impaired balance between pro- and antioxidants causes oxidative stress which may
      result in oxidation of proteins, lipids and DNA with the final outcome of premature cell
      aging and apoptosis [1,2]. Oxidatively stressed red blood cell (RBC) have been observed in
      various congenital and acquired hemolytic anemias, including thalassemia, sickle cell anemia,
      congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, G6PD deficiency and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
      (PNH) as well as in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the primary etiology is
      different in these anemias, oxidative stress mediates several of their pathologies, mainly
      hemolysis [3].

      Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is a genetic disorder of the RBC skeleton with primary
      deficiency in spectrin, ankyrin-1, band 3 or protein 4.2 associated with chronic hemolytic
      anemia [4]. Secondary protein deficiencies resulting from oxidative stress are often observed
      and may be involved in the clinical manifestations of the disease [5].

    <description>ROS, reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxides will be measured in RBC following incubation with with 100 μM 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, 40 μM [1-(4-chloromercuryphenyl-azo-2-naphthol)] and fluor-DHPE, respectively for ROS [8] and with mercury orange for GSH [9]. After being washed twice, the cells will be resuspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry .</description>

    <description>Hemolysis will be assayed by suspending 3 ml of packed RBC in PBS or in the autologous plasma and overnight incubation in the presence of various concentrations of antioxidants such as fermented papaya preparation (FPP)</description>

    <description>Hemolysis will be assayed by suspending 3 ml of packed RBC in PBS or in the autologous plasma and overnight incubation in the presence of various concentrations of antioxidants such as fermented papaya preparation (FPP) at 37oC in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air (10). Following 5 min centrifugation at 800 rpm, the supernatants will collected for Hb determination by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm.</description>
