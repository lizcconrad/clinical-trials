  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a physical therapy intervention for foot and ankle of diabetic
      neuropathic individuals would affect positively the way they walk, lowering the harmful
      forces that these segments receive, that are associated mainly with lower range of movement,
      muscle weakness and loss of sensation. The participants will be randomly assigned into
      control group (regular treatment prescribed by their medical group) or into treatment group,
      that will receive 12 weeks of physical therapy intervention, twice a week, for 45 minutes
      each session. This will aim for increasing foot and ankle range of movement, muscle strength
      and improving sensory inputs.

      In this study, were included subjects diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy, aged between 45 and
      65 years old. We aimed to assess the effect of a physical therapy program on biomechanics of
      lower limbs during gait.
