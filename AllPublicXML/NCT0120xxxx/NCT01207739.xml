      The purpose of the study is to establish whether prolonged antibiotic treatment of patients
      diagnosed with proven or presumed PLD (as endorsed by the international ILADS guidelines)
      leads to better patient outcome than short-term treatment as endorsed by the Dutch CBO
      guidelines.

    <description>Because different operationalizations of the term 'Global score 36-item Short-form General Health Survey (SF 36)' exist, the primary outcome measure is specified here as the 'physical component summary score' (PCS) of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (RAND SF-36, Hays 1998), which is similar to the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36). The PCS is also known as the physical health composite score (PHC). This specification has been communicated to the local Ethics Committee on March 1, 2011, and was approved on April 6, 2011.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are 18 years or older.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use contraception methods other than
             oral contraceptives during the study therapy period, since failure of oral
             contraceptives due to long-term antibiotic use has been described and doxycycline
             might be teratogenic.

          -  Patients with presumed or proven PLD. In this study, clinical suspicion of PLD is
             defined as complaints of musculoskeletal pain, arthritis or arthralgia, neuralgia or
             sensory disturbances (such as paresthesias or dysesthesias), neuropsychological or
             cognitive disorders, and persistent fatigue, that are:

               -  temporally related to an episode of erythema migrans or otherwise proven
                  symptomatic Lyme disease (defined as within 4 months after erythema migrans as
                  assessed by a physician, or positive biopsy, PCR, culture, intrathecal B.
                  burgdorferi antibodies), OR

               -  accompanied by a positive B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM immunoblot (as defined by
                  strict criteria in line with the European Union Concerted Action on Lyme
                  Borreliosis (EUCALB)), regardless of prior ELISA IgG/IgM screening results.

          -  Subjects must sign a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a known history of allergy or intolerance to tetracyclines, macrolides,
             hydroxychloroquine or ceftriaxone.

          -  Subjects who have had more than 5 days of antimicrobial therapy with activity against
             B. burgdorferi within the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Subjects with a presumed diagnosis of neuroborreliosis (CSF pleocytosis or intrathecal
             antibody production) for which intravenous antimicrobial therapy is required.

          -  Subjects with a known diagnosis of HIV-seropositivity or other immune disorders. (No
             HIV serologic testing is required for the study).

          -  Subjects with positive syphilis serology or signs of other spirochetal diseases.

          -  Subjects with moderate or severe liver disease defined as alkaline phosphatase, ALAT,
             or ASAT greater than 3 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue cisapride, astemizole, terfenadine,
             barbiturates, phenytoin, or carbamazepine (The concentrations of these drugs may
             increase during clarithromycin therapy and/or lead to reduced availability of
             doxycycline).

          -  Subjects who are currently enrolled on other investigational drug trials or receiving
             investigational agents.

          -  Subjects who have been previously randomized into this study.

          -  Severe physical or psychiatric co-morbidity that interferes with participation in the
             study protocol, including previous medical diagnosis of rheumatic conditions, chronic
             fatigue syndrome or chronic pain conditions as well as insufficient command of the
             Dutch language.

          -  Co-morbidity that could (partially) account for the symptoms of the subject (e.g.
             vitamin B12 deficiency, anemia, hypothyroidism).
