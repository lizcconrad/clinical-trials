  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to investigate the impact of two different fractions of inspired oxygen
      (FiO2) on outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high oxygen group is treated during mechanical ventilation with either a fraction of
      inspired oxygen of 0.7 (high oxygen group) or a fraction of inspired oxygen 0.4 (control
      group). The intervention continues until withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, ICU discharge
      or until 14 days from ICU randomisation.

      Primary outcome is worse than expected outcome in the corresponding treatment arms based on
      outcome meas-ured by the probability of bad outcome using the CRASH® risk calculator
      (prognostic model for predicting outcome after traumatic brain injury).

      Secondary outcome is occurence of lung injury during mechanical ventilation.

    <description>The study is powered to have 80% power at 5% significance level to detect a treatment effect that decreases the proportion of poor outcome from 55% to 45%.
Each patient is given an individualized tailored prognosis based on patient's baseline prognosis in a large reference population. Outcome is measured by using functional outcome score, Glasgow outcome score (GOS) and/or GOS extended (GOSE).</description>
