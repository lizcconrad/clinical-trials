  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STA-9090 is drug which inactivates or blocks the work of a protein called Heat Shock Protein
      90 or HSP90. HSP90 is a protein that helps some molecules inside the cells have the right
      shape. By stopping it's activity, these molecules never get to have the right structure to be
      functional and they are destroyed. We believe that if we stop the activity of HSP90, the
      rapidly dividing cells in the tumor(s) will slow down since their proteins will not be
      functional without the help of HSP90.

      -  Participants will receive STA-9090 intravenously over 1 hour once a week for the first
           three weeks of a 4 week cycle (days 1, 8 and 15).

        -  During the first cycle (Cycle 1) participants will have the following tests and
           procedures performed at the time point indicated: Day 1 and Day 15: clinical exam, vital
           signs, ECG and blood tests. Day 2: Biopsy of tumor and blood tests. Day 8: clinical
           exam, vital signs and blood tests. Days 16-18: PET scan.

        -  On Day 1 of all subsequent even cycles (4, 6, 8, etc.) the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: clinical exam, vital signs, ECG, blood tests and urine
           sample. On days 8 and 15 of all subsequent even cycles the following tests and
           procedures will be performed: clinical exam, vital signs and blood tests. On days 22-28
           of all even cycles and assessment of the tumor will also be performed.

        -  On Day 1 of all subsequent odd cycles (3, 5, 7, etc.) the following tests and procedures
           will be performed: clinical exam, vital signs and blood tests.
