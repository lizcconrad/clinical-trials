  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to validate the Stayhealthy BC1 bioelectrical impedance
      analyzer to assess percent body fat in children and adults. The BC1 was compared to
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment of body fat for adults and to hydrostatic
      weighing assessment of body fat for children. We hypothesized that the BC1 would provide
      similar measures of body fat between devices with acceptable limits of agreement.

      The BC1 body composition analyzer is manufactured by Stayhealthy. It is a handheld,
      noninvasive bioelectrical impedance device. When held, the BC1 sends an electrical impulse
      through the body to determine body fat, muscle mass, and body hydration. Bio-impedance
      devices measure the change in electrical resistance in body tissues by using a detectable
      electrical signal that passes through the body. The method is based on the principle that
      lean body mass contains virtually all the water and conducting electrolytes in the body and
      provides a good electrical pathway. In contrast, fat or fat-containing tissues produce a poor
      electrical pathway. By inducing a low-energy, high -frequency signal, a measurement of the
      baseline resistance to flow of electrical current can be assessed. The resistance measurement
      relates directly to the volume of the conductor. Through repeated measurements and
      identifying other parameters (i.e. gender, weight, age and height) proprietary equations were
      developed that determine total body water, fat free body mass, and total body fat.
