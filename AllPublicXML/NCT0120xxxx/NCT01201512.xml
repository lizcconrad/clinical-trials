      The purpose of study was to characterize using an online questionnaire the feasibility of
      recruiting dentists in primary care dental practices in the practice-based research network
      and documenting their current initial care for their TMJD pain patients.

      The overall goal of this project was to collect data to be used in preparing an application
      for a Clinical Trial Planning Grant and then in designing a subsequent Phase III clinical
      trial. The ultimate goal of this series of research projects is to determine the most
      practical approach to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate initial
      intervention for patients with painful temporomandibular muscle and joint disorders (TMJD)
      using NIDCR's Collaboration of Networked Dental and Oral Health Research (CONDOR) group
      consisting of three dental Practice-Based Research Networks: The Dental Practice-Based
      Research Network (DPBNR), Northwest Practice-Based Research Collaborative in Evidence-based
      Dentistry (PRECEDENT), and Practitioners Engaged in Applied Research and Learning (PEARL).
