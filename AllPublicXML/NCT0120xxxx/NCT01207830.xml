    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide initial clinical data to support the feasibility of
      use of the ValenTx Endo Bypass system in enhancing weight loss and co-morbidity resolution in
      morbidly obese subjects

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, feasibility study whose major aim is to determine the
      feasibility (based on safety, efficacy and device performance) of the ValenTx Endo Bypass
      system with the replaceable sleeve. Also, the use of a tag replacement device may be
      developed and implemented should individual attachment tags need replaced following the
      initial implant.
