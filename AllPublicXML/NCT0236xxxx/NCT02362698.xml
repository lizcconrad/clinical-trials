      This research was aimed to discuss the impact of acupuncture treatment on the impulsive
      behavior of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) sufferers, with the detection of magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the assessment of Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT),
      Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and Go/No-go task, hopefully that this research could
      provide basis for the further study as well as the establishment of comprehensive assessment
      and treatment protocol of IAD.

HANS-200A acupoints stimulator, which had two output channels, was connected to some selected points. Dilatational wave was adopted in this research, the frequency of rarefaction wave was 2 hertz and condensation wave was 100 hertz, with a waviness width of 0.3ms. Switched the stimulator on after connected the poles to the needles, adjusted the intensity of output gradually from 0 milliampere to the extent of subject's maximum tolerance. Then needles would be remained on the body for half an hour.</description>
