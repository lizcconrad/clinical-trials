      This study will evaluate the magnitude of individual differences that exist in human response
      to a blinded study medication.

      This study will assess a broad range of potential outcomes related to administration of a
      double-blinded, but FDA-approved study medication. Participants will be required to spend the
      night on a clinical research unit, located on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus, for 4
      consecutive nights (Monday - Friday). Participants will undergo daily sessions Tuesday -
      Friday. Tuesday sessions will consist of taking a study medication in the morning and
      afternoon, and completing a pain testing session after each study drug administration.
      Wednesday through Friday sessions will consist of taking a study drug in the morning and
      providing self-report ratings of drug effects and vital sign measurements (such as blood
      pressure, pulse) several times for a 6-hour period. The investigators will also collect
      saliva samples to assess physiological functioning, and will ask you to complete a
      computerized task to assess levels of functioning.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-report visual analog ratings of drug liking, high, bad effects, good effects, and observer-rated changes in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, pupil diameter).</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected within the 5-day study.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess whether the double-blinded study drug will produce differences in self-report visual analog ratings of drug effects (e.g., liking, high, bad effects, good effects) and observer-ratings of participant response (e.g., change in blood pressure, pulse, pupil diameter) in participants who express the major or minor allele of a gene of interest. As is true with all medications, it is possible that participants may have a negative reaction to the study drug, however the investigators will screen extensively to prevent participants for whom this may happen from participating and have several procedures in place to reduce the risk to the participant. The investigators have several years experience administering this study drug and are confident in their ability to minimize potential problems as a result of the study drug.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected within the 5-day study.</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary samples of the stress hormone cortisol will be collected for several hours following double-blinded study drug administration and investigators will assess whether there are differences in cortisol release among participants who express the major or minor allele of the gene of interest and whether this varies as a function of the double-blinded study drug. This will provide a measure of the natural human pain response system under non-pain conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impulsivity measured with the self-reported Barratt Impulsivity Scale and computerized delay discounting procedures for monetary rewards</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected within the 5-day study.</time_frame>
    <description>First, participants will complete a self-report rating of impulsivity upon entry to the study that will be compared as a function of genetic status. Second, participants will complete a computerize task that will assess impulsivity following double-blind administration of the study drug. The investigators will assess whether response on this well-validated task is associated with expressing the major or minor allele of the gene of interest, and whether this varies as a function of the double-blinded study drug.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain and analgesia measured in a laboratory based quantitative sensory testing battery, consisting of cold pressor threshold and tolerance, pressure pain threshold and tolerance, and conditioned pain modulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected within the 5-day study.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete two standardized pain testing sessions after receiving a dose of the double-blinded study drug. The sessions will assess response to a cold pressor task and a task that activates the natural pain response system in the body. The investigators will assess whether detection of pain (pain threshold) and removal of the painful stimulus (pain tolerance) varies as a function of genetic status (expressing the major or minor allele on the gene of interest), and the degree to which administration of the double-blind study drug changes pain threshold and tolerance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sex subgroup effects on all primary outcomes described</measure>
    <time_frame>All data will be collected within the 5-day study.</time_frame>
    <description>All primary outcomes will be evaluated again in male and female subgroups to assess the role of participant sex on study outcomes.</description>

Order of sessions will be randomized and counter-balanced, but all participants will undergo the same study conditions. Although this is a clinical trial, it does not have an active intervention/treatment component.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a double-blinded study drug as part of their daily sessions and will provide feedback regarding the effects of the drug on various measures. Though the study drug is FDA approved, it is being used here for a non-FDA approved purpose (though the FDA has provided permission to use the drug in this study).</description>
