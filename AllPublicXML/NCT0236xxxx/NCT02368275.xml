      The objective of these cohorts is to detect potential genetic, neurophysiological
      psychological and cognitive risk factors for the development of chronic postsurgical pain
      including neuropathic pain.

      This new study will enroll patients undergoing mastectomy or thoracotomy for cancer. They
      will be three cohorts :

        -  one prospective cohort constituted of women undergoing breast surgery in René Huguenin
           Hospital (Saint Cloud) and followed for up to one year after surgery.

        -  another cross sectional cohort constituted of patient association (Seintinelle)
           including women operated up to 2 years previously from breast surgery.

        -  One prospective cohort constituted of women or men undergoing thoracotomy in Foch
           hospital (Suresnes) and followed for up to one year after surgery.

      The main objectives of these cohorts will be to detect potential genetic, neurophysiological,
      psychological and cognitive risk factors for the development of chronic postsurgical
      neuropathic pain.

      These patients will questioned about demographics, age, sex, body mass index. A large
      neuropsychological and psychological battery of tests will be conducted. Sensory function
      will assessed using quantitative sensory testing. Biological samples will analyse potential
      genetic factors in the development of neuropathic pain after surgery. Conditioned pain
      modulation, threshold tracking and quantitative sensory testing will also be assessed in
      subgroup of patients.

      The prospective cohort will be assessed before surgery then 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
      The cross sectional cohort will be assessed during one to two visits in hospital.

        The first group of patients consists of women recruited from René Huguenin Hospital (Saint
        Cloud, Ile de France) for mastectomy or lumpectomy to treat breast cancer, with axillary
        lymph node dissection in all cases.

        The second cohort will consist of women already operared of breast surgery in the last 2
        years.

        The third cohort will consist of men or women recruited from Foch hospital (Suresnes, Ile
        de France) for thoracotomy for cancer.
