  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Endurance 2 Trial is to determine the need for ongoing intravitreal aflibercept
      injections for patients with diabetic macular edema who have previously completed the VISTA
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Endurance 2 Trial is a phase IV open label clinical study to assess the need for ongoing
      intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3-year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) end-point.
      Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) based on
      the presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant-DME). In addition, subjects who meet re-treatment
      criteria will be eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days
