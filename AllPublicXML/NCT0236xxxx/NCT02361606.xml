      Adolescents are often reluctant to receive psychological help. The investigators developed a
      web-based cognitive behavioral self-help intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
      The investigators aimed to examine the participation rate and outcomes on glycemic control

      Adolescents are often reluctant to receive psychological help. The investigators developed a
      web-based cognitive behavioral self-help intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
      The investigators aimed to examine the participation rate and outcomes on glycemic control
      and quality of life.

      Single center study was conducted to describe participation and efficacy of internet
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with type 1 diabetes. Adolescents with type 1
      diabetes, aged 13-20 years, treated at a Juvenile Diabetes Center, were offered to
      participate in the intervention. Recruitment period lasted for 2 months, during
      January-February, 2011.

      HbA1c measures of adolescents that agreed to participate, were obtained from medical
      records.The adolescents, that logged in, were asked to complete questionnaires before the
      intervention assessing their expectations of the program, quality of life and parental
      support. After completion of questionnaires, the adolescents were encouraged to complete 6
      virtual sessions. Satisfaction was assessed after each session. In the end of the program,
      participants were asked again to complete questionnaires. HbA1c levels were obtained again
      for participants that logged in, and for participants that passively refused, 3 months or
      more after the recruitment.
