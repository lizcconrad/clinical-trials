  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is an acute lower airway infection caused by a viral infection. It is a major
      cause of winter admissions to pediatric wards. Accepted therapies include oxygen support and
      IV fluids, whereas other supportive therapies such as inhalations are of questionable
      benefit. Moderate to severe cases are a source of distress to patient, parents and medical
      staff often necessitating Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admission. Heated Humidified High
      Flow Nasal Cannula (HHHFNC) therapy has been shown lately to improve the work of breathing,
      oxygen saturation, and CO2 pressure (PCO2) values as well as decrease PICU admissions and
      intubation rates. We planned a prospective and retrospective study in order to check the
      feasibility of using HHHFNC in a primary pediatric ward and its effect on clinical well
      being, respiratory status and PICU admission.

      Supportive Care, Single Group Assignment, Open Label, Non-Randomized, Efficacy Study

      The research is devised as follows:

      Prospective section: We will enroll children 0-2 years old, diagnosed with Bronchiolitis in
      our ward (Pediatrics C) during the months of November-March 2014-2016. Children will be
      evaluated according to a Bronchiolitis Severity Score devised by Wang and Co which was
      successfully used in previous research. Children answering criteria for moderate or severe
      Bronchiolitis according to Wang and Co. will be enrolled pending written consent by both
      parents.

      Our prediction is to enroll a total of 200 children during the 2 winter seasons during
      2014-2016.

      Retrospective section: We will examine up to 200 cases of children aged 0-2 years
      hospitalized due to Bronchiolitis in Pediatrics C during 2014-2016 which were not enrolled in
      our research (due to lack of consent/unavailable HHHFNC etc.). We will compare clinical data
      and vital parameters between the groups treated with HHHFNC and those who were not.
