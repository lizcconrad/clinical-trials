      Reporting patterns and results of initial antibiotic treatment in patients with complicated
      urinary tract infection (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and nosocomial
      pneumonia (NP) including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - RECOMMEND Study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational, historical cohort study from medical chart review of adult
      hospitalized patients for each of the three conditions of interest (complicated urinary tract
      infection (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP)
      including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)). For this study, the proposed patient
      selection period extends for 12 months, from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. Patients selected
      during this period will be followed from diagnosis (i.e., diagnosis of cUTI, cIAI or NP)
      until symptom resolution, discharge or 30-days post discharge [based on data availability to
      assess readmission and outpatient visits], death while hospitalized, loss to follow-up or the
      end of study period if not yet discharged from index hospitalization [December 31, 2014]).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To describe antibiotic management and document treatment outcome among hospitalized patients with hospital acquired or healthcare associated cUTI, cIAI and NP</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate failure or success of the initial antibiotic treatment following cUTI, cIAI and NP diagnosis. Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as all antibiotic agents received during the 48 hours post initiation of antibiotic therapy - The primary outcome measure will be assessed from the antibiotic initiation date until end of follow-up defined by in-hospital with symptom resolution, in-hospital without symptom resolution, discharged to home, discharged to other health care facility, readmission within 30 days for same infection, readmission within 30 days post discharge with other diagnosis, death during hospital stay, death post discharge within 30 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To identify potential risk factors related to outcomes of initial antibiotic treatment of hospitalized patients with hospital acquired or healthcare associated cUTI, cIAI and NP</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess risk factors related to the primary outcome measure. Covariates considered in the risk assessment will include: site characteristics, patient characteristics, secondary infections, prior medical history and comorbidity burden, hospitalization characteristics, pathogen characteristics, co-medications - The listed covariates will be assessed at baseline (i.e., at index hospitalization date), during the hospital stay and the 30-day period post discharge date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To describe healthcare utilization and costs associated with hospital acquired or healthcare associated cUTI, cIAI and NP initial antibiotic treatment outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess health care utilization among patients with cUTI, cIAI and NP. Variables assessed to address this will include - hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, number of surgical procedures, number of outpatient visits, days on antibiotic therapy, number of readmission during follow-up - The listed measures will be assessed during the hospital stay and during the 30-day period post discharge date.</description>
