      A deeper understanding of the syncytiotrophoblast development processes and its properties
      may allow a better understanding of the placenta pathological process for the development of
      treatment models for the relevant pregnancy complications.The aim of this study is to compare
      telomere length, aggregate formation, and senescence markers in placentas from complicated
      pregnancy with placentas from normal pregnancy.

      Protocol summary No. 2 for research 0202-14 of date: 22/11/2014. Rationale for the research A
      deeper understanding of the syncytiotrophoblast development processes and its properties may
      allow a better understanding of the placenta pathological process for the development of
      treatment models for the relevant pregnancy complications.

      The aim of this study is to compare telomere length, aggregate formation, and senescence
      markers in the syncytiotrophoblast of placentas from complicated pregnancy with placentas
      from normal pregnancy.

      Telomere lenght and aggregate formation will be assessed by the fluorescent intensity of
      telomere FISH.

      Senescence will be assessed by immunohistochemistry for the markers - SAHF, cyclin dependent
      kinase inhibitors p16/p21, HLAX, ERVWE1, SA-B-gal.

      The study groups

        1. A retrospective arm - paraffin blocks which were collected over the years from placentas
           from complicated pregnancy ( intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia , placenta
           accrete) will be compared to blocks of placentas from normal pregnancies.

        2. The prospective arm - placental from complicated pregnancy ( intrauterine growth
           restriction, preeclampsia , placenta accrete) . Will be compared to placentas of normal
           pregnancies.

        3. A laboratory model based on human placenta cell cultures
