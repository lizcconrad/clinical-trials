  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood products are commonly used before invasive procedures in patients with end-stage liver
      diseases despite cirrhosis being a thrombophylic state. Traditional coagulation tests (namely
      INR and PLTs count) are known to be unreliable in predicting bleeding risk before invasive
      procedures and in representing the real coagulation status of cirrhotic patients.
      Notwithstanding they are still used to guide blood products administration before invasive
      procedures. Thromboelastography (TEG) has been shown to be effective in detecting signs of
      hypo-hypercoagulability possibly being an alternative method to guide blood products
      transfusion. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of TEG
      as a guide for blood products transfusion in cirrhotic patients undergoing invasive
      procedures.
