  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-part study is to assess B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as well as other
      circulating and imaging biomarkers in myocardial function. Part 1 assesses biomarker levels
      in healthy participants and participants with cardiac dysfunction. Part 2 assesses BNP and
      other circulating biomarker levels, and performs imaging in participants with cardiac
      dysfunction who continued from Part 1. The primary hypothesis is that compared to healthy
      participants, biomarker levels are elevated in participants with mild/moderate and severe
      cardiac dysfunction.
