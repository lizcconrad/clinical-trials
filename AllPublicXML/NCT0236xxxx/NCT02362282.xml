    <textblock>
      Recent research in gait training for stroke survivors showed that coordinated gait components
      can be best restored using the following interventions together: coordination exercises, over
      ground gait training, and body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT). These results are
      important because, to the investigators' knowledge, there have been no other reports of the
      restoration of coordinated gait components for those with persistent gait deficits (&gt; 6
      months after stroke). However, a remaining problem was that the restored coordinated gait
      movements measured in the laboratory did not generalize for many subjects to the everyday
      environment. The confluence of several factors can cause lack of generalization. First, dual
      task performance (gait and cognitive attention task) can degrade both gait and attention
      ability, even in healthy adults. Second, stroke can impair attention. Third, during walking
      in the everyday environment, attention is required in order to safely process normally
      occurring stimuli. Therefore, given the success of the new gait training protocol in the lab
      setting, it is important to address the problems remaining for generalization of the
      recovered coordinated gait pattern to the everyday environment. The primary hypothesis of
      this study is that greater gains in gait speed will be produced by combined motor and
      cognitive training versus motor training alone.

      Aim 1, Hypothesis Ia: Comparison of combined motor and cognitive training vs motor training
      alone. For Aim 1, Hypothesis Ia, this will be a randomized, controlled study. For the two
      groups, 38 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to either: A) Motor + Cognitive Training;
      or B) Motor Training alone. Subjects will first be stratified according to coordination and
      gait deficit severity, as described below. After stratification, the subject will be
      randomized to one of the two intervention groups for Hypothesis Ia. All the subjects will
      receive treatment 5 times/week, 3hrs/session, for 12 weeks or for a total of 60 treatment
      sessions. Group A will receive combined motor and cognitive training; Table 2 (below) shows
      the graduated approach to providing combined gait and cognitive training. Data collection
      will be at weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24 (i.e., before, mid-treatment and after treatment, and then
      3 months after the end of the treatment protocol. Comparison will be made between the two
      groups to determine whether there was any additive effectiveness of the cognitive training.

      Aim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group A, receiving combined
      motor and cognitive training. For Aim 2, Hypotheses IIa-d, this will be a single cohort
      pre/post-treatment comparison within Group A receiving combined motor and cognitive training.

      Aim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d: Pre/post-treatment comparisons within Group B, receiving motor
      training alone. For Aim 3, Hypotheses IIIa-d, this will be a single cohort pre/post-treatment
      comparison within Group B, receiving motor training alone.

    <description>Treatment will include coordination exercises and over ground gait training for impaired muscle groups and related gait deficits. The therapy will be provided by a clinical physical therapist specializing in rehabilitation for stroke patients, according to established, conventional guidelines. The protocol was used in the investigators' prior studies, and is designed to restore voluntary control of ankle dorsiflexion during swing phase; hip flexion during swing phase, knee flexion at toe-off, knee flexion during swing phase; knee extension before heel strike; knee control during stance phase; pelvic control during stance phase; and whole body balance control during weight shifting. Newly-learned coordinated movements will be integrated into practice of coordinated gait components. Cognitive rehabilitation will begin with the least difficult aspects of attention control, and progress to the more difficult. Home practice and generalization exercises will be assigned.</description>
