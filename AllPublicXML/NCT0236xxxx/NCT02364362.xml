  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and
      Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

      This study assessed the safety and maximum tolerated dose of continuous daily treatment with
      Famitinib plus docetaxel (60 mg/m^2, every 3 weeks) in patients with Advanced Non-squamous
      and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended dose for the Phase II
      trial.
