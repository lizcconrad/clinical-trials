    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, non-blinded, single center study of children and
      adolescents with multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome to detect differences or
      early changes in diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In children and adolescents with either multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome an
      MRI with special DTI-sequences of the brain is performed at timepoint of first manifestation
      of disease and every 6 months at 3 Tesla MRI according to a specific investigation protocol.

      Besides MRI-DTI several clinical data are recorded every 6 months:

        1. expanded disability status scale (EDSS)

        2. disease activity/ relapse rate

        3. lesion load (number of T2-lesions)

        4. brain atrophy

        5. visual and somatosensoric evoked potentials (VEP, SSEP)

        6. neuropsychological examination

      Furthermore a complete neurological examination is done every 6 months and particular
      medication of each patient is recorded in a specific investigator form (case report form,
      CRF)
