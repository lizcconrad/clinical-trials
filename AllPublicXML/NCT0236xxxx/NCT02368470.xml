    <textblock>
      New generations of fluoroquinolones, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, exhibit a
      broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and have been
      successfully introduced into the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. However, it was
      suggested that resistance to fluoroquinolones has been increasing in the Korean population
      and the resistance is most likely mediated through point mutation in gyrA. Gemifloxacin
      (FACTIVE®) is an enhanced-affinity, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone suitable for once-daily,
      oral dosing. In vitro studies have shown that gemifloxacin displays potent activity against
      Gram-positive organisms, whilst retaining good activity against Gram-negative organisms.
      Gemifloxacin is the most potent member of the quinolone class against S. pneumoniae with
      activities 16-64 times greater than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and 2-8 times
      greater than those of moxifloxacin. Importantly, gemifloxacin displays potent in vitro
      activity against strains of S. pneumoniae with known resistance to β-lactams, macrolides and
      other members of the quinolone class. This potent activity is believed to be due to the
      enhanced affinity of gemifloxacin for topoisomerase IV, the major fluoroquinolone target in
      S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, gemifloxacin displays potent activity against H. influenzae and
      M. catarrhalis and atypical organisms such as L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae and M.
      pneumoniae. It has proven particularly effective in respiratory and urinary tract infection.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and the safety of using standard triple
      therapy and gemifloxacin-containing triple therapy as a first-line treatment for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication in Korea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 19-70 years with H. pylori infection

          -  The presence of H. pylori was defined as positive if the results of one of the
             following two tests were positive:

               1. Rapid urease test (CLO™, Delta West, Bentley, Western Austria)

               2. Histology. Biopsy specimens, obtained by endoscopy, were fixed in formalin and
                  used for determination of H. pylori infection by Giemsa staining.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with previous H. pylori eradication therapy

          2. Patients treated with H2 receptor antagonist, PPI, and antibiotics in the previous 4
             weeks, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the previous 2 weeks

          3. Pregnant or lactating women
