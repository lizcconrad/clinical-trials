  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cell behavior that the investigators regard as &quot;malignant,&quot; including: cell autonomy;
      invasion and digestion of surrounding normal tissues; migration and colonization of distant
      organs; ability to develop resistance to drugs, temperature, or radiation; and ability to
      kill the host, are not only characteristics of cancer cells, but of pathogenic and/or
      opportunistic unicellular organisms (bacteria, fungi and protozoa). Rudolf Virchow
      (1821-1902), the father of modern pathology, first pointed out the resemblance between the
      biological behavior of cancer cells and that of single-celled organisms when causing
      infections. He thought, incorrectly, that cancer cells were cells infected with bacteria and
      had acquired their pathogenic behavior from them. Others later postulated that the behavior
      of cancer cells was likely due to the re-expression of past traits and behaviors (atavism)
      derived from their past evolutionary experience as independent, single-celled organisms from
      which all cells in multicellular organisms originated. In other words, the behavior of
      pathogenic unicellular organisms, including: unlimited replicative potential; capacity for
      invasion, migration, and metastases; abilities to evade the host's immune system, to generate
      multi-drug resistance; and to kill a host, are what the investigators define as &quot;cancer&quot; when
      one of the investigators cells re-express these past ancestral traits. This reversion or
      de-evolution of a differentiated cell to its ancestral undifferentiated, unicellular form has
      been named &quot;Atavistic Metamorphosis.&quot;

      This does not imply that cancer cells are bacteria, protozoa, or yeasts. It means that cancer
      cells express functions and/or behaviors similar to their ancestral parents, the unicellular
      organisms from which our cells originated.

      If this is true, a combination of drugs that are effective to eradicate certain unicellular
      organisms may work in cancer treatment.

      The principal objective of this study is to determine whether there is a benefit for patients
      with advanced, metastatic and terminal cancers to be treated with combinations of selected
      drugs conventionally used in medical practice to kill bacterial, fungal and protozoal cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, randomized, single-blind, response-adaptive trial
      conducted at two sites in patients who have tried conventional therapy and failed or have
      refused conventional therapy. This study is being conducted to determine the efficacy of
      combinations of marketed drugs against unicellular organisms in cancer treatment. The
      products under investigation include FDA- and SSA-approved anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and
      anti-protozoan drugs with documented anti-cancer properties. The drugs under study are
      compatible with each other, and used at pharmacological dosages known to be tolerable and
      safe in humans and/or cancer patients with limited adverse effects. Patients receive
      treatment for 10 to 12 months. The duration of treatment is depended on the drugs
      investigated. It is hypothesized that regression will occur within 6 months and treatment
      will be continued with the assumption that this may prevent recurrences. Outcomes will be
      measured objectively and assessments appropriate for the type of cancer treated. Outcome
      measures may include 1) Changes in signs and symptoms; (2) Visual inspection of tumors using
      weekly photographs and measurements (as appropriate); (3)Monthly chest X-rays to monitor lung
      tumors, lung metastases and/or fluid in the chest; (4) Ultrasound to evaluate abdominal
      tumors (e.g., liver metastases), and breast and armpit lymph nodes; (5) CT, MRI and PET
      scans; (6) Tumor markers in blood such as Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), CA-15.3, CA-19-9,
      etc. and other laboratory studies to monitor response. The overall goal of this study is to
      understand the efficacy of atavistic chemotherapy that may mediate metastatic or terminal
      cancer regression or cure.
