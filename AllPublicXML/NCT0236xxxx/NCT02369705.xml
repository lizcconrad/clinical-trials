  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with cardiac disorders will be tested in the sleep laboratory with a conventional
      full-night PSG recording along with WP 200/WP200U ambulatory sleep diagnostic device in a
      synchronized manner.

      The PSG data will be scored manually by a trained polysomnographic scorer, according to
      standard criteria for this clinical routine.

      The data obtained by the WP200/WP200U will be analyzed automatically for RDI, AHI, sleep
      stages, snoring (optional) and body position (optional), in addition to parameters specific
      to cardiac subjects. The analysis will be performed by the WP200/WP200U software (zzzPAT) and
      will be compared to the PSG's manual scoring which serves as a &quot;Gold Standard&quot;.

      Subjects with cardiac disorders, referred to the sleep lab will be offered to participate in
      the study. Subjects will be asked to sign an informed consent form and will be screened for
      inclusion exclusion criteria.

      Subject demographic and medical information will be acquired from the subject himself and/or
      from the subject's medical chart and will be recorded on the appropriate pre-study electronic
      case report forms.

      The subjects will be admitted to the clinical sleep laboratory for one night, during which
      they will undergo conventional full night PSG recording with the standard PSG channels. The
      WP 200/WP200U wrist device, which includes the PAT and pulse oximeter probes will be worn on
      the wrist.

      The investigator will not have access to the WP200/WP200U data while scoring the PSG data.
      During the study recording, the WP200/WP200U data will be recorded inside the device, without
      being displayed on the PSG monitor. Furthermore, the WP200/WP200U analysis is done
      automatically without knowledge of the PSG scoring results.
