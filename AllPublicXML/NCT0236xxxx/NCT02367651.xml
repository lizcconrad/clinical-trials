  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib monotherapy is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European
      Medicines Agency, and other regulatory authorities worldwide for the treatment of patients
      with advanced renal cell carcinoma and patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who
      received prior chemotherapy. Based on the improved progression-free survival and sustained
      responses observed in a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study, it is
      hypothesized that pazopanib may have a role in a maintenance setting for STS in maintaining
      the initial response to chemotherapy and delaying the need for further treatment at relapse
      and its associated toxicity and impact on health-related quality-of-life. This Phase 2,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate maintenance therapy with
      pazopanib versus placebo in subjects with advanced or metastatic STS who have not progressed
      after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Approximately 188
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with pazopanib 800
      milligrams (mg) daily or placebo. Study completion will be the point at which 70% of
      randomized subjects have died. Once a subject has objective evidence of disease progression,
      the subject will be managed as per standard practice by their physician. Subjects will
      continue to be followed for second progression, health related quality of life, survival
      until study completion, withdrawal of consent, or early termination of the study.
