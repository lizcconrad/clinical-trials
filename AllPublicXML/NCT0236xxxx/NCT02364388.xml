  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imagio breast imaging system, is an opto-acoustic (OA) imaging system designed to
      concurrently collect images in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound ( co-registered OA and
      B-mode imaging). This medical device has CE-marking and is approved for use in Europe and
      other nations.

      This is a post-market, non-randomized multi-center surveillance study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market surveillance study that is prospective, controlled, multi-center, and
      observational, to evaluate if Imagio OA can downgrade BI-RADS ( Breast Imaging-Reporting and
      Data System) classification following CDU (Conventional Diagnostic Ultrasound) for the
      visualization and characterization of suspicious masses prior to core needle biopsy (CNB) or
      excision. Investigators will perform CDU to reach a diagnosis and decision to biopsy. Imagio
      OA will not be used as the reason to perform or to defer a CNB (Core Needle Biopsy) or
      excision.

    <description>The Imagio breast imaging system is indicated for use by a qualified and trained healthcare provider for opto-acoustic (OA) evaluation of breasts in women who are referred for a diagnostic breast ultrasound work-up due to a suspicious mass (including both palpable and non-palpable) or an imaging finding such as mammographic mass, architectural distortion, asymmetry or suspicious calcifications.</description>

        A total of approximately 200 subjects, with a BI-RADS 4a or 4b classification and scheduled
        to undergo gold standard histologic assessment via an un ultrasound-guided large (14 gauge
        or larger) core needle biopsy, ultrasound-guided vacuum assisted needle biopsy, or
        excisional biopsy will be recruited.
