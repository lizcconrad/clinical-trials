  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year in the United States about 1 million people make a suicide attempt and more than
      38,000 die by suicide. The risk of suicide is highest among individuals with mental illness
      who have been hospitalized due to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, yet there are few
      interventions known to reduce suicide risk in this population. This study will develop and
      pilot test a peer mentorship intervention by which trained peer professionals will use their
      own personal experience with recovery from mental illness to instill hope and belongingness
      in high-risk patients and provide additional support to prevent future suicidal thoughts or
      behaviors.

      The specific aims of the study are to: (1) develop a peer mentorship intervention to reduce
      suicide risk among patients psychiatrically hospitalized with suicidal ideation or following
      a suicide attempt; (2) Conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to assess the
      acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the peer mentorship intervention in preparation
      for a larger efficacy trial; and (3) an exploratory aim will be to measure potential
      mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness in terms of belongingness,
      burdensomeness, and hopelessness according to the interpersonal theory of suicide.

    <description>A Peer Specialist will be making weekly follow-up contact with study participants in the community or by telephone for 3 months following hospital discharge. The content of the peer mentorship interactions will be based on the manual developed by the study team and will include components such as hope and belongingness.</description>

    <description>Patients will continue to receive usual care which typically consists of referral to an outpatient psychiatrist. Participants will also receive a phone call within 24-72 hours from a member of the inpatient unit clinical staff to assess barriers to follow-up care and safety. The enhancement to usual care will occur at the 3 and 6 month follow-up assessments, where participants will be assessed to determine whether they require any additional referral information for follow-up care. If referral information is indicated, the patient will be provided a list of mental health treatment providers in their area.</description>
