  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if XofigoÂ® (also called Ra-223
      dichloride) combined with hormone therapy and denosumab can help to control breast cancer
      that has spread to the bones and/or bone marrow. The safety of this study drug combination
      will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Denosumab and the hormone therapies used in this study are
      FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Ra-223
      dichloride is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of bone metastases.
      It is considered investigational to use the combination of Ra-223 dichloride, hormone therapy
      and denosumab to treat patients with bone cancer that has spread to the bones.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive Ra-223
      dichloride by vein over no more than 1 minute on Day 1 of each 28-day study cycle.

      You will also receive denosumab as an injection under the skin on Day 1 of Cycles 1- 6.

      You will also receive hormone therapy while on study. Your doctor will discuss with you what
      type of hormone therapy you will have, how it will be given, and its risks.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-5:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 6:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for CTCs, tumor markers, and genetic
           testing.

        -  You will have a PET-CT scan and a bone scan to check the status of the disease. If the
           doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an MRI.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for CTCs, tumor markers, and genetic
           testing.

        -  You will have a PET-CT scan and either a bone scan or a CT scan to check the status of
           the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an MRI.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to
           check the status of the disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stage IV breast cancer with metastases to the bone and/or bone marrow.

          2. Pathological or radiographically confirmation of metastases to the bone and/or bone
             marrow. (The definition of radiologic diagnosis of bone metastasis is based on typical
             and highly reliable imaging findings in studies such as bone scan (new or multiple
             TC99m positive lesions), PET/CT (new or multiple FRG positive lesions), and MRI
             (typical T1w replacement, T2w positive and T1 plus contrast media positive) for bone
             metastasis with 2 or more lesions. If the bone metastasis is highly suspected or not
             well defined by imaging, bone biopsy is necessary for confirmation.)

          3. Visible uptake in at least one lesion on bone scanning prior to radium therapy.

          4. No limit in number of prior hormonal agents in metastatic breast cancer; only one
             prior chemotherapy is allowed in metastatic setting. Anti-HER2 targeting therapy,
             CDK4/6 inhibitor, other targeted therapy (e.g., mTOR or PI3K inhibitor) in combination
             with hormonal treatment will be counted as one hormonal agent. Any anti-HER2 targeting
             therapy in combination with chemotherapy will not be counted as one additional
             treatment.

          5. Breast tumors with hormone receptor positive disease (ER+/PR+, ER+/PR- regardless of
             HER2 status).

          6. ECOG performance score of 0, 1.

          7. Age =/&gt; 18 years.

          8. All acute toxic effects of any prior treatment have resolved to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1
             or less at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          9. Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception beginning at the signing of the ICF until at least 6 months after the
             last dose of study drug. The definition of adequate contraception will be based on the
             judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

         10. Acceptable hematology and serum biochemistry screening values: White Blood Cell Count
             (WBC) =/&gt; 3,000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) =/&gt; 1,500/mm3 Platelet (PLT) count
             =/&gt; 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin (HGB) =/&gt; 10 g/dl Total bilirubin level &lt;/=2.0 x
             institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 3.0 x ULN Creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN

         11. Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed
             consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to
             the conduct of any trial-specific procedure.
