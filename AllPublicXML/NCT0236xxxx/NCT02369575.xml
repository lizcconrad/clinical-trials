      This research study is being conducted to learn about the progression and cause of lung
      disease. By agreeing to be a part of this study, you will allow the lung tissue which would
      normally have been discarded after your procedure, to be used for research purposes to allow
      us to understand more about your condition which may potentially lead to novel treatments and
      therapeutics. For this study, the investigators will isolate specific cells from the lung
      tissue and measure cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for regulating lung
      disease. No other type of research will be performed on these samples nor will the samples be
      given to other investigators for unrelated research.
