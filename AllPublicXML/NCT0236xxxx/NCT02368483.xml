  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, prospective, intervention study. A total of 30 participants with
      unilateral symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement will be included into the study. The
      intervention consists in neuromuscular training for the lower limb muscles (12 weeks, 2
      times/week supervised training, 2 times/week home training). The training includes physical
      exercises routinely used worldwide in clinical settings. No control intervention group was
      included into the study because nowadays there is no standard conservative treatment for
      patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement. Assessments will be performed at (1)
      baseline, (2) mid-intervention, (3) end-intervention, and (4) follow-up. Clinical,
      functional, neuromuscular and self-reported parameters will be collected during assessments.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Hip Function at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hip Function was assessed using the Hip Outcome Score. The Hip Outcome score is a questionnaire used to evaluate hip function during daily and sport activities. Two independent scores are obtained: one for activities of daily living and one for sport activities.</description>

    <measure>Hip Muscle Strength as measured using dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Hip Muscle Strength at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hip abduction, adduction, internal rotation and external rotation isometric maximal voluntary contraction strength is evaluated with hand-held dynamometry. Hip flexion and extension isometric maximal voluntary contraction strength is evaluated with isokinetic dynamometry.</description>

    <description>Neuromuscular training for the hip and lower limb muscles.The training program is divided into 3 phases, and includes specific exercises for improving the hip range of motion, muscle strength of the hip and lower limb muscles, as well as the trunk stability and coordination. The intervention lasts 12 weeks. Patients will train 2 times/week with a physical therapist and 2 times/weeks alone at home.</description>
