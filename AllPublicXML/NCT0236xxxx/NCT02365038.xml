  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled pilot trial to investigate the feasibility of a
      driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to the ARDS Clinical
      Network strategy (conventional strategy) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury. Driving
      pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. Evidence from observational
      studies suggests that elevated driving pressure is the main independent determinant of
      ventilator-induced lung injury, however clinical trials are needed to establish whether
      targeting low driving pressures can improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, ART2pilot is a multicenter randomized controlled
      trial to assess the feasibility of a driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy
      compared to the ARDS Clinical Network strategy (conventional strategy) in patients with ARDS.
      Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of ARDS
      of less than 72 hours duration. We will exclude patients with less than 18 years old;
      contraindication to hypercapnia such as intracranial hypertension or recent acute coronary
      syndrome; patients in which a high probability of death within 24 hours is anticipated and
      patients under exclusive palliative care. Eligible patients will be randomized to the driving
      pressure limited ventilation strategy or ARDSNet strategy. The primary outcome is driving
      pressure between days 1 and 3.

    <description>We will use volume controlled ventilation or pressure support in the weaning phase. We will adjust tidal volume between 3 and 8 mL/Kg of predicted body weight in order to achieve a driving pressure of 13 cmH2O. The respiratory rate will be titrated to achieve a pH between 7.30 and 7.45 (maximum respiratory rate is 50 breathings per minute). We will not limit plateau pressure in this arm.</description>
