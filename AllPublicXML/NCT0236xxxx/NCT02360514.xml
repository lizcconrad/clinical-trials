      This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, non-comparable, open-label clinical
      trial.This trial was conducted written informed consent form by voluntary agreement, negative
      result of hantaanvirus antubidy by neutralizaing antibody test, test drug was administrated
      0, 1, 13 months according to drug label.

      For antibody test, Sampling was conducted pre-dose(T0), 1 month after vaccination(T1), 1 year
      after vaccination(before booster vaccination, T2) and 1 month after vaccination(T3). Also, 1
      month after vaccination (T3) after completion of booster vaccination for antibody retension
      duration observed for subjects with antibody to conduct a three-year follow-up survey was
      conducted, and the antibody test every year.In conclusion, sampling was conducted 12
      months(T4), 24 months(T5), 36months(T6) after the booster vaccionation.

      However, follow-up survey was terminated when the antibody titer was determined as a negative
      by neutralizing antibody test and fluorescent antibody technique.
