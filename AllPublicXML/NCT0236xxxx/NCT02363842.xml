  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical study evaluating
      the effects of microclimate management using Skin IQ™ MCM coverlet placed over commercially
      available pressure redistribution surfaces compared to standard of care (SOC). The objective
      of this study is to evaluate if a commercially available pressure redistribution surface when
      combined with the Skin IQ™ MCM coverlet will significantly reduce pressure ulcer (PU)
      incidence as compared to use of a commercially available pressure redistribution surface by
      itself by decreasing the effects of excessive moisture and temperature at the skin and
      surface interface.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, controlled study is designed to capture, evaluate and compare
      the effects of Skin IQ™ MCM coverlet placed over commercially available pressure
      redistribution surfaces versus commercially available pressure redistribution surface (SOC)
      used by itself to manage patients at risk for tissue breakdown.

      Anticipation is that 160 Subjects will need to be screened and consented to achieve the
      desired sample size of 136 Subjects at up to 5 centers. Individual Subject, Standard Time of
      Observation: Up to 60 days for incidence of PU development; beyond 60 days, only hospital
      discharge date and disposition will be collected. The safety endpoint is the incidence of
      device-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
