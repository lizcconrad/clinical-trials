  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to address whether terlipressin improves the renal outcome after liver
      surgery. Therefore the investigators are planning to conduct a double-blinded randomized
      control trial. The investigators will randomize patients undergoing any kind of liver surgery
      and being at increased moderate to high risk for post-operative acute renal failure into a
      control group receiving post- operative a placebo or into a group receiving post-operatively
      terlipressin in combination with human albumin.
