  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical study to investigate
      the effects of DLBS1033 in conjunction with standard therapy compared to standard therapy
      alone in acute ischemic stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included into the study will be randomized into two groups and receive either
      standard therapy alone (as control group) or standard therapy plus DLBS1033 at a dose of 490
      mg three times daily (as DLBS1033 group). Standard therapy used in the study will consist of:
      aspirin 80 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, vitamin B complex, and citicholine 250 mg/2 mL twice daily.

      After hospital admission and diagnosis, patient will be handled according to the standard
      management for acute ischemic stroke applicable in the hospital. Right after the patient is
      confirmed eligible to the study, the treatment(s) will be switched immediately into the
      study's regimens. Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's
      efficacy will be performed at baseline, day 4, and day 8 of treatment (end of study); while
      safety examinations will be performed at baseline and end of study.
