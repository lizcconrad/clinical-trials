  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn if computed tomography (CT) scans can help researchers
      predict how patients with pancreatic cancer may respond to chemotherapy.

      This is an investigational study. The CT scans are performed using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods.

      Up to 259 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, 2 CT scans that are part of your regular cancer care
      will be reviewed for biomarkers. Biomarkers can be seen in CT images and may be related to
      the status of the disease. One (1) scan will be performed before you start chemotherapy, and
      the other will be at your first restaging visit with your oncologist. You will also be asked
      to complete 1 questionnaire, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Gastrointestinal cancer
      (MDASI-GI) , to check on your health status. This questionnaire will take about 10 minutes to
      complete. This may be done within one week of your scheduled visits, in person or by
      telephone.

      The study staff will also collect information from your medical record.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation on the study will be over after your last CT scan.

      Follow-Up:

      After your last CT scan, you will have follow-up visits and/or calls. During these visits
      and/or calls, you will be asked to complete 1 questionnaire, the MD Anderson Symptom
      Inventory for Gastrointestinal cancer (MDASI-GI) , to check on your health status. This
      questionnaire will take about 10 minutes to complete.

      If you are planning to have clinic visits at MD Anderson after chemotherapy as part of your
      regular cancer care, a member of the study staff will meet with you briefly during those
      visits to check on your health status.

      If you are not coming to MD Anderson for your follow-up care, a member of the study staff
      will call you every 3-4 months to see how you are doing. These calls should last about 10
      minutes.

    <description>Local tumor progression defined by clinical signs or symptoms of local pancreatic tumor growth (e.g., worsening back/abdominal pain, obstruction, jaundice, etc.) that are documented by the attending clinician and research data coordinator and/or diagnostic imaging evidence of tumor growth. Kaplan-Meier method used to estimate probabilities of LPFS for patients with a normalized AUC ratio &lt;1 and patients with a normalized AUC ratio &gt;/=1, respectively. Log rank test applied to compare the LPFS between these two patient groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models fitted to compare the LPFS between the two comparison groups, adjusting for the effects of patients' characteristics and clinical factors.</description>
