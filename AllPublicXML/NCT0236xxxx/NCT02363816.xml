      Weight gain, hypertension, high cholesterol and sugar abnormalities in childhood are strongly
      linked and predict the risk of further complications and early death in adulthood. The newer
      antipsychotics, called the second generation antipsychotics are commonly used to treat mood
      disorders in adult and pediatric populations. Their use has substantially increased (up to
      5-fold) in the past 15 years in children due to their approved use by the Food and Drug
      Administration and higher acceptance in the general medical community. However, second
      generation antipsychotics are known to have very damaging side effects that cause children to
      gain substantial amounts of weight, have high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high sugar
      levels. Despite the known risks their use is still needed and may be contributing to the high
      rates of obesity-related diseases in childhood and ultimately shorter life-spans in
      adulthood. How second generation antipsychotics cause these side effects is still not well
      known. Preliminary evidence has identified a novel pathway that may be associated with second
      generation antipsychotic side effects. This pathway has not been studied, is involved in
      vitamin A metabolism and is called the beta-carotene pathway. Beta-carotene is an important
      part of our diet because it acts as an anti-oxidant (fights harmful oxidative stress in the
      body) and it produces the active form of vitamin A which is essential for several processes
      in our body. The investigator's work has identified a backup in this pathway which the
      investigators hypothesize is due to genetic variation of the enzymes found within this
      pathway.

      The investigators hypothesize that genetic variation in the beta-carotene pathway is
      responsible for the side effects associated with second generation antipsychotics. The
      investigators want to complete a cross-sectional, pilot study in the pediatric population
      that will be used for future prospective, extramural applications.

      The investigators propose two aims for this study:

      Aim 1: Determine how second generation antipsychotics change beta-carotene metabolism. For
      this aim, the investigators hypothesize that high beta-carotene:retinoic acid ratios will be
      due to genetic varition in the beta-carotene pathway.

      Aim 2: Define the relationship between beta-carotene metabolism, oxidative stress and second
      generation antipsychotic induced insulin resistance. For this aim the investigators
      hypothesize that low beta-carotene levels will be associated with high oxidative stress
      levels and insulin resistance.
