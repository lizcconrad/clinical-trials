  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and activity of once-daily (QD) oral dosing of VT-464, a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17,
      in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of VT-464 in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients who are
      treatment-naive or who have failed prior therapy with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The
      study will examine several parallel QD dosing regimens of VT-464 using a traditional modified
      &quot;3+3&quot; Fibonacci study design. Approximately 3 dose-levels of VT-464 will be examined in each
      dosing regimen that is fully enrolled.

             weeks and demonstrate a continued rise in PSA after withdrawal. Patients on

             (AVODART®) must stop medication at least 3 months from study entry.
