      This study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy and precision of the Probe-based Volumetric
      Laser Endomicroscopy (pVLE) imaging system in detecting dysplasia in BE in both in vivo and
      ex vivo imaging of Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) tissue, as compared to standard
      histopathology
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the ability of pVLE to visualize subsurface architecture of EMR tissue, as compared
      to histology in both in vivo and ex vivo imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females over the age of 18 years.

          2. Patients with either suspected or confirmed Barrett's-associated high grade dysplasia
             (HGD) or intramucosal cancer (IMC) presenting for endoscopy possibly requiring EMR.

          3. Ability to provide written, informed consent.

          4. Females must be willing to take a pregnancy test if still capable of bearing a child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients on anticoagulation undergoing high risk procedures in accordance to ASGE
             guideline for the management of antithrombotic agents for endoscopic procedures
             (2009)*.

          2. Patients with esophageal varices that preclude biopsies.

          3. Presence of an esophageal mass/cancer that precludes full distention of the balloon
             from the Nvision balloon guide sheath.

          4. Patients with esophageal strictures that would prevent adequate expansion of the
             balloon from the Nvision guide sheath.

          5. Patients with known inflammatory disease, esophageal tears or ulcers, which prohibit
             full distention of the balloon from the Nvision balloon guide sheath.

          6. Patients with known eosinophilic esophagitis.

          7. Patients who are pregnant.

          8. Patients with a history of hemostasis disorders*.

               -  Patients on anticoagulation undergoing low risk procedures are not excluded. **
                  Hemostasis disorders will include, but will not be limited to: patients with
                  hemophilia or other congenitally acquired clotting factor deficiencies, patients
                  with cirrhosis with coagulopathy, patients known to have thrombocytopenia
                  (&lt;100,000 plt/ul) and individuals with von Willebrand's disease or other known
                  platelet malfunction disorders.
