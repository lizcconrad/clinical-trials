  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years a novel method for functional lung imaging called Fourier decomposition
      MRI (FD MRI) has been introduced that allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung
      perfusion and ventilation-related information without exposure to ionizing radiation or
      administration of intravenous or inhalational contrast agent. In this project, the
      investigators plan to investigate whether Fourier decomposition (FD) MRI is able to provide
      similar clinical information on regional lung perfusion as the standard methods SPECT/CT and
      DCE MRI in patients with COPD.

      In the recent years a novel method for functional lung imaging called Fourier decomposition
      MRI (FD MRI) has been introduced that allows for simultaneous assessment of regional lung
      perfusion and ventilation-related information without exposure to ionizing radiation or
      administration of intravenous or inhalational contrast agent.

      In this project, the investigators plan to investigate whether Fourier decomposition (FD) MRI
      is able to provide similar clinical information on regional lung perfusion as the standard
      methods SPECT/CT and DCE MRI in patients with COPD. As MRI in patients with COPD is
      particularly challenging due to the rarefication of lung parenchyma, the FD MRI technique
      will be combined with an ultra-fast Steady-State Free Precession (ufSSFP) acquisition method
      for improved signal efficiency. The investigators ultimate goal is to provide a mean to
      predict and monitor the outcome of different therapies, such as medication, valves and
      surgery in COPD patients without requiring ionizing radiation or administration of contrast
      agents.

      In the framework of this study, 30 patients with COPD will be enrolled prospectively. The
      study participants will be recruited by the clinic for thoracic surgery at the University
      Hospital Basel among all patients undergoing lung perfusion scintigraphy with SPECT/CT for
      surgery planning. Each participant will undergo one MRI examination of 30 min containing
      non-contrast-enhanced (FD MRI) and contrast-enhanced (DCE MRI) imaging studies of regional
      lung perfusion.

        The study participants will be recruited by the department of thoracic surgery at the
        University Hospital Basel among all patients who undergo Perfusion scintigraphy and
        SPECT/CT of the lung with 99mTc-MAA for one of the following clinical indications (of note:
        this selection of patients does per se exclude pregnant women):

          1. Preoperative assessment of regional lung perfusion before video-assisted lung volume
             resection (VATS-LVRS) in patients with COPD.

          2. Preoperative assessment of regional lung perfusion before segmentectomy, lobectomy or
             pneumonectomy procedures with curative intention in NSCLC patients with concomitant
             COPD and reduced pulmonary function parameters (FEV1 &lt; 80%).
