  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to study a nutrition education intervention in
      individuals with spinal cord injuries both in the acute rehabilitation setting (n = 100) and
      the community setting (n = 100). Participants in the treatment group will receive six
      interactive nutrition lectures based upon a successful program that has been used in older
      adults titled &quot;Eat Smart, Stay Well&quot;. The goals of intervention are to improve whole-grain,
      fruit and vegetable, and low-fat dairy intake and reduce fat and saturated fat intake.
      Secondary outcomes will include improvements in waist circumference of body mass index and
      some biomarkers such as cholesterol and blood sugar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of SCI is significant. Obesity, diabetes, and CVD are more prevalent in the
      SCI population. Many individuals with SCI are unable or have a limited capacity to exercise.
      This reality makes good nutrition even more urgent. This study will be the first to test
      whether additional nutrition education can improve nutrition behavior and knowledge, diet
      quality, adiposity, and metabolic CVD risk factors in individuals with SCI and to determine
      the best setting to deliver nutrition education to individuals with SCI.

    <description>Nutrition behavior will be recorded from two five point Likert scale questions ranging from 1 = not practicing the behavior to 5 = practicing it regularly. Questions are related to eating fruits and vegetables and to decreasing fat intake. The recorded scores for these questions will be pooled for nutrition behavior and range from 2 = very low to 10 = very high.</description>

    <description>The Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) II will be administered. Each participant will be assessed for fruit, vegetable, dairy, whole-grain, lean protein, fat, and saturated fat intake. Intake for each food group will also be checked for compliance with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.</description>

    <description>Intervention participants will participate in a series of six, 60-minute small group sessions of interactive nutrition education discussions led by a Registered Dietitian delivered over 3 weeks. They will also have one follow-up comprehensive nutrition education session approximately 3 months after receipt of the Eat Smart, Live Better curriculum. In order to help us assess the effectiveness of the nutrition education program, we will assess nutrition behavior and knowledge at this time as well. Community participants in the treatment group will attend the sessions at Carolinas Rehabilitation (CR). The control participants from the community will come to CR for the one standard nutrition lecture. Caregivers and spouses of all of the participants will be encouraged to attend the sessions.</description>
