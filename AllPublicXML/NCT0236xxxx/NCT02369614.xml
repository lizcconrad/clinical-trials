  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo/sham controlled, double-blind study investigating the efficacy
      of high- and low-frequency rTMS applied to the right DLPFC at either 1 Hz, 10 Hz, or sham
      rTMS as compared to an OASIS treatment as usual group for the treatment of PTSD symptoms.

      The study will be carried out within the Overcoming Adversity and Stress Injury Support
      (OASIS) program administered by Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMSD). OASIS is a residential
      treatment program developed for active duty service members diagnosed with combat related
      PTSD. OASIS is a 9 week program in which cohorts of 10 patients undergo a variety of
      therapeutic activities with a focus on cognitive processing therapy (CPT) of combat trauma
      conducted in both group and individual formats.

      Subjects who qualify will be assigned by block randomization to one of four arms:

        1. 1 Hz rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

        2. 10 Hz rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

        3. Sham rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

        4. OASIS treatment as usual

      Treatment will be administered in 10 daily sessions, conducted on weekdays, for 2 consecutive
      weeks. .
