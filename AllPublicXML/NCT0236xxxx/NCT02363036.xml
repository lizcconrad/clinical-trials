      Accumulating evidence suggest that the proliferative, invasive, and immune tolerance
      mechanisms that malignant tumors use to establish a nutrient supply and evade or edit the
      host immune response are similar to those used by the developing placenta during normal
      pregnancy. In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both
      cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of
      both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis.

      CD11b+Gr1+ cells are a heterogeneous population of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) that
      consist of immature myeloid cells (IMCs), and were first described as myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells. In healthy individuals, IMCs that are generated in the bone marrow
      differentiate into mature granulocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs). These cells
      have been shown to play an essential role in mediating immune suppression in animal models of
      human tumors. As a result of tumor-induced alterations in myelopoiesis, IMCs have been found
      in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and the tumor tissue itself. An increased population of
      IMCs was identified in patients with several tumor types. Accordingly, IMCs detected in the
      peripheral blood of such patients bearing express the common myeloid marker CD33 but lack
      markers of mature myeloid cells such as the MHC class II molecule HLADR.

      IMCs have been shown to actively promote tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the
      cytokine environment, and through vascular remodeling by promoting angiogenesis.

      It has been demonstrated in our laboratory that IMCs infiltrate placentas of pregnant mice
      and actively promote angiogenesis. These cells show striking similarity to IMCs that populate
      malignant tumors. Accordingly, human placentas are also infiltrated by a significant
      population of IMCs. Immunostaining of human placentas showed that IMCs comprise around 25% (
      range 10-40%) of total placental CD45+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells and that this
      population is located close to blood capillaries. We also demonstrated that immature DCs,
      cells originally described to regulate the adaptive immune response, also promote
      angiogenesis in models of choroidal neovascularization, endometriosis and tumors.

      This is a retrospective study on patient's blood samples of pregnant women who came to
      delivery in our department during 1.1.2014-31.12.2014, to compare the abundance of monocytes
      and neutrophils in: 1. Term active labor. 2. Elective cesarean section.

      According to our previous findings, we hypothesize that monocytes in active delivery will be
      lower than in women without signs for labor. We also hypothesize that neutrophils will be
      more abundant in active delivery than in women without signs for labor.

      We plan to screen anonymous electronic data of women who delivered in our departement during
      2014 according to the following eligible criteria, stratified into 2 categories: 1. Women who
      were admitted in active labor. 2. Women who were admitted for elective Cesarean Section
      without signs of labor.

      We will compare the abundance of monocytes and neutrophils in blood counts that were taken on
      admission day between the two populations.
