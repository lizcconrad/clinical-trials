      The purpose of this study is to learn more about problems with swallowing that could develop
      in patients who are very sick and need a machine to help them breathe. Patients are asked to
      be in this study because they had problems breathing on their own and therefore needed the
      help of a machine called a ventilator. In order for this ventilator to push air into the
      lungs, patients need a tube placed in the throat called an endotracheal tube. The process of
      placing this endotracheal tube was called intubation. The tube has now been removed, which is
      a process called extubation. Sometimes, people who have had endotracheal tubes can have
      difficulty swallowing food and liquids for a period of time. This disease is called
      post-extubation dysphagia (PED). PED is a serious condition and may result in food or liquid
      going from the mouth into the lungs. This could cause further lung problems. Given this risk,
      doctors sometimes suggest that patients with PED either avoid eating or drinking, or get a
      feeding tube. Currently, nobody knows how often patients develop PED, why they develop it, or
      the best method to detect it. Standard care involves clinicians making educated guesses. This
      study looks to determine if watching the patient swallow, both with and without a small
      camera, is an accurate method for detecting PED.

    <measure>ICU and hospital length of stay, and length of stay after extubation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Collected as ICU and hospital free days at Day 28. ICU and hospital free days are defined as the number of days from day 1 to day 28 that a patient is alive and not in an ICU or hospital. Length of stay after extubation will be calculated similarly, using the date of extubation (as opposed to the date of admission) as the start time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of mechanical ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>This will be quantified as the number of ventilator free days at Day 28 from the time of enrollment in this clinical trial. Ventilator free days is a standard measure of duration of mechanical ventilation defined as the number of days from day 1 to day 28 on which a patient breathed without assistance, if the period of unassisted breathing lasted at least 48 consecutive hours. A difference in ventilator free days reflects a difference in mortality, ventilator days among survivors, or both. This is a standard outcome measure that has been utilized in several large clinical trials</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Place of discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>For those patients who are discharged from the hospital, we will record their location of discharge in a dichotomous manner: home or other facility (skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation center, or long term acute care hospital). We will also have recorded where the patient lived prior to hospital admission.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 and Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect all cause mortality data on days 28 and 60.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Placement of a surgical feeding tube</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>This will be defined as the placement of a feeding tube in the stomach or jejunum by a surgeon, gastroenterologist, or interventional radiologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days of no oral intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 and Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated at Day 28 and Day 60. This will be collected in similar fashion to ventilator-free days, designating a day when the patient's diet order was for nothing by mouth (NPO) a day without oral intake.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days with a temporary feeding tube</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the placement of a temporary naso-gastric feeding tube (including large-bore as well as small bore (dobbhoff) tubes.</description>

    <description>A thin, flexible endoscope designed for assessment of laryngeal structures is passed through the nose to the oropharynx, visualizing the laryngeal structures, and the base of tongue and the pharynx. If needed 4% topical lidocaine and/or oxymetazoline (Afrin) will be administered. Swallowing will then be evaluated directly with six food boluses of 5 ml each. All patients will be allowed to swallow spontaneously without a verbal command to swallow. Video of the examinations will be recorded and presence of dysphagia will be designated independently by 3 different observers (one pulmonary physician and two speech language pathologists (SLPs)). This procedure will take 5-10 minutes. The camera will then be removed.</description>
