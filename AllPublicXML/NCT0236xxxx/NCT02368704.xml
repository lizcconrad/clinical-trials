  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress pathway
      is activated in peripheral tissues (adipose tissue) in insulin resistant diabetic patients
      compared to healthy subjects normoglycemic matched for age and sex an to investigate whether
      ER stress pathway can be activated in response to insulin. Indeed, some preliminar on rates
      studies shows that ER stress pathway is activated by insulin in liver and adipose tissue
      showing that hyperinsulinemia might help trigger stress path ER.

      For this, we propose a case control study of type 2 diabetic patients vs control subjects in
      which markers of ER stress will be evaluated from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue
      obtained before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemic. We chose to consider adipose tissue
      subcutaneous rather than visceral adipose tissue for obvious reasons of lesser invasiveness.

      blood samples. These samples will be anonymized, frozen and stored in the INSERM UMR-S 872 in
      the Cordeliers Research Center (Madame Fabienne Foufelle) under the responsibility of
      Professor Jean-François Gautier for a maximum period of 15 years, beyond which they will be
      destroyed. These samples will be destroyed at any time at the request of the patient. This
      DNA storage will be used to study genes related to the secretion of insulin and to identify
      other genes involved in the onset of diabetes.
