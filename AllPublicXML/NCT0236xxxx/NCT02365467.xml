      The purpose of the Feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit in the identified subject population. This study will
      also evaluate the current instructions for use and may direct changes to the delivery and
      deployment steps.

      The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study is to characterize the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, Type B
      dissections.

             be able to tolerate a surgical revascularization of the LSA.

          -  Subject has a TAA/PAU which will require coverage of the LSA and is:

               -  a fusiform aneurysm with a diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm OR is &gt; 2 times the diameter of
                  the non-aneurysmal thoracic aorta; AND/OR

               -  a saccular aneurysm or PAU (ulcer defined as ≥ 10 mm in depth and 20 mm in
                  diameter);

          -  Subject has a healthy, non-diseased aortic proximal seal zone of at least 20 mm from
             the distal end of the LCC ostium to the beginning of the disease, including at least
             10 mm between the LSA and the LCC.

          -  Subject has a non -diseased aortic proximal neck length of &gt;=5mm distal to the LSA

          -  Subject has a non-diseased aortic diameter between 25 mm and 42 mm

          -  Subject has a non-diseased LSA with a diameter between 8 mm and 13 mm.

          -  Subject has sufficient landing zone within the LSA to accommodate the BSG without
             occlusion of any significant vessels

          -  Brachial, iliac or femoral artery access vessel morphology (diameter, calcification,
             tortuosity) that is compatible with vascular access techniques, the device, or
             accessories.

               -  Introducer sheath is required for all procedures.

               -  An iliac conduit is required for access if the above requirements are not met.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have conditions requiring prospective
             revascularization of the LSA including:
