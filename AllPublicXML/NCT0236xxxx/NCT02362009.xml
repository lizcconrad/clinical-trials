    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Fibroid Registry is to provide a comprehensive database that captures
      patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and pot-treatment quality of life measures for
      patients treated for uterine fibroids. This database will serve as a platform for future
      comparative effectiveness and other health services research studies.

      The proposed research will be a prospective registry study of patients treated for uterine
      fibroids at the Fibroid Center located at South Miami Hospitals Center for Women and Infants.

      Our objective is to establish the Fibroid Registry:

        -  To collect and review short, middle and long term clinical outcomes data that will help
           inform and facilitate the decision making process of clinicians and patients on the
           safest and most effective treatment for symptomatic uterine myomas, leiomyomas, or
           fibromas.

        -  To be able to critically evaluate the quality of procedures being performed and to
           ultimately establish a gold standard of care based upon patient and clinical outcomes
           and characteristics.

        -  To ultimately establish a gold standard of care based upon clinical outcomes and patient
           characteristics.

    <description>Such registry will enable us to address a number of research questions, for instance:
Is uterine artery embolization (UAE) a safe treatment for leiomyomata?
Is UAE an effective treatment for leiomyomata?
What is the likelihood of symptom relief?
How durable is the treatment?
What is the likelihood that a woman who undergoes UAE and plans subsequent pregnancy will be able to conceive and deliver a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy?
Are women choosing this procedure content with their selection?
Are there certain patient subgroups at higher risk or that have an increased likelihood of treatment benefits?</description>
