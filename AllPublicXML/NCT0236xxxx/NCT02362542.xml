      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) on appetite control related brain regions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is emerging tool for brain modulation in a
      variety of clinical conditions. In addition, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that
      modifying the activity of brain circuits involved in eating behavior could provide
      therapeutic benefits in obesity.

      The investigators aim to assess whether modulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLFPC) using tDCS, modifies behavioral response and brain activity while watching visually
      presented food cues in obese subjects.

      Subjects will receive tDCS two times, one is active stimulation and the other is sham
      stimulation. Both stimulations will be separated at least one week and the order of sham and
      active tDCS will be counterbalanced across subjects.

      Subjects will perform functional MRI experiments with visual food cues. Questionnaire with
      behavior measures, body compositions, blood tests will be performed.

    <description>For active tDCS, a 2 mA current will be delivered for 20 minutes with 20 second up and down ramp times. The anodal electrode will be placed on the right DLPFC (F4; 10-20 EEG system), and the cathode electrode will be placed on the left DLPFC (F4;10-20 EEG system), which is known to be related to cognitive function. The electrodes used for tDCS are saline-soaked sponges (25 cm2).</description>
