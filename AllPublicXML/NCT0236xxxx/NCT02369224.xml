      A Cross- Sectional study; To assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of a
      hand-held dynamometer (HHD) in the assessment of lower extremity strength in patients with
      multiple sclerosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be tested at two visits separated by 1-21 days. At each visit, the patients
      would undergo bilateral lower extremity strength assessment by two physical therapists,
      independently and in the same order. Testing would include: hip flexion, knee extension, knee
      flexion, ankle dorsiflexion Testing performed with 1) HHD (three trials recording maximum
      voluntary force) and 2) manual muscle testing (MMT), British Medical Research Council grade
      0-5)

        Subjects who may qualify for this study will be identified in the context of clinical care
        at the participating sites. They may also be contacted through approved research flyers.
        Eligible patients may receive a copy of the informed consent form at the time of their
        clinic visit. Recruitment will also occur through local promotional opportunities (doctor's
        programs, patient education programs).
