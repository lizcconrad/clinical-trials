  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observation clinical trial. We are collecting the patients with glucocorticoid.
      They were divided into the experiment group (with femur head necrosis) and control group
      (without femur head necrosis).Then, we will analyse the patients' genome with genome-wide
      association study (GWAS). Our purpose is to find susceptibility loci for
      glucocorticoid-induced femur head necrosis in the Chinese population.

      We will collect 4ml whole blood samples under the consent of patient and extract the genome
      from the samples. During the process the blood samples will be collected strickly according
