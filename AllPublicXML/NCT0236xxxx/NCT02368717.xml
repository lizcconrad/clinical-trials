      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4-week double-blind
      treatment with PENTASA enema compared with placebo enema in Chinese patients with mild to
      moderate active left-sided ulcerative colitis, followed by a maximal 28-week open-label
      extension phase with PENTASA enema and/or PENTASA tablets.
