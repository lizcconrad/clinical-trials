  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given
      together with afatinib dimaleate in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that
      has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with
      treatment, or has come back and does not respond to erlotinib hydrochloride. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and afatinib dimaleate together may be an
      effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in
      combination with afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations
      who have progressive disease on erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (response rate, disease
      control rate and progression free survival).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in an exploratory manner changes in programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1
      expression in the tumor microenvironment and other immune correlates in blood and in the
      tumor microenvironment induced by afatinib with concurrent MK-3475 versus MK-3475 preceding
      combination afatinib/MK-3475.

      II. To determine in an exploratory manner changes in EGFR-mutant plasma deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) in response to treatment with MK-3475 and afatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I (DOSE DE-ESCALATION COHORT): Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II (EXPANSION COHORT): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 for 2
      courses. Beginning course 3, patients receive afatinib dimaleate PO and pembrolizumab IV as
      in Arm I.

      In both Arms, courses repeat every 21 days (for up to 2 years for pembrolizumab) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
