    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the study is to obtain long-term follow-up information on patients who
      have completed their standard clinical care in the Orthopaedic Hand and Upper Extremity
      Service. The study will help to qualify and quantify long-term recovery and outcomes from
      uncommon upper extremity fractures, as well as non-fracture bone and joint conditions. The
      hypotheses vary, but generally focus on the patterns of injury, the results of treatment and
      the complications encountered.
