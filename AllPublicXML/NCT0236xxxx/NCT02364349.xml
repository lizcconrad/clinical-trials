      This double-blinded randomized clinical trial investigates difference in allergic responses
      elicited by Bee Venom (BV) and Essential Bee Venom (eBV). Twenty healthy volunteers aged
      20-40 years were randomly allocated to the 2 groups and administered eBV and BV on left and
      right forearm, respectively, in accordance with group allocation. Physician, participant, and
      outcome assessor were blinded to group allocation. Local pain, swelling, itching, redness,
      wheals and adverse reactions were recorded by timepoint before and after treatment.

    <description>All subjects are injected with Bee Venom (BV, intervention), randomly assigned to the right or left forearm. Raw BV used dried BV prepared through collection from bee venom sacs and removal of impurities. The BV administration site on each subject was on the palmar side of the designated arm 5 cm below the middle of the elbow crease as it is convenient for observation and has high responsiveness. Pharmacopuncture sessions were also conducted in the morning for higher responsiveness.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All subjects are injected with essential Bee Venom (eBV, intervention), randomly assigned to the right or left forearm. eBV was prepared through the following methods: BV was collected from bee venom sacs and dried. LC/MS was used to analyze subdivisions of dried BV dissolved in purified water and passed through a sephadex G-25 column to collect histamine-free units. Collected units were filtered to eliminate allergenic substances including PLA2 of molecular weight 10 kDa or higher. The eBV administration site on each subject was on the palmar side of the designated arm 5 cm below the middle of the elbow crease as it is convenient for observation and has high responsiveness. Pharmacopuncture sessions were also conducted in the morning for higher responsiveness.</description>
