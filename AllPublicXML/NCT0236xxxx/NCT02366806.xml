  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to investigate the effect of a more in-depth education plan for
      patients with breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either the standard
      education plan during their breast cancer treatment or they will receive in-depth education
      about their breast cancer treatment. In order to see what kind of effect the different
      education plans have, patients will fill out three identical questionnaires during the course
      of treatment.

      This study will be a prospective study of women receiving adjuvant radiation therapy for
      management of breast cancer at the University of California Davis. All patients will be
      staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Seventh edition. Primary disease
      treatment information including surgical approach and utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy
      will be evaluated.

      All patients will have a validated quality of life assessment (FACIT-TS-PS) completed at
      three time points during their radiation therapy process. The patients will be randomized at
      the time of completion of radiation plan approval by the treating radiation oncologist in a
      one to one fashion to either proceed with standard education or more extensive plan review.
      The radiation oncology quality assurance (QA) process will be blinded to the randomization of
      the patient.
