        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical
             history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP), puls rate
             (PR)), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure (BP), puls rate (PR)
             or electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range and considered as
             clinical relevant by investigator

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             medication

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders Further
             exclusion criteria may apply
