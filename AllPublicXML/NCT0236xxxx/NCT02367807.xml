  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week prospective observational study that will allow testing of the hypothesis
      that a program in which pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is administered to young men of color
      who have sex with men (yMSMc) in a community youth drop-in center in conjunction with a
      multifaceted behavioral intervention as well as standard HIV prevention interventions can
      achieve at least 70% retention, as well as a medication adherence rate significantly better
      than that previously reported in the literature. The proposed program evaluation can provide
      critical information for the enhancement and scale-up of successful PrEP programs at FIGHT
      and elsewhere in an effort to make PrEP available to a growing number of persons at risk of
      acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PrEP for HIV prevention with once daily Truvada has been shown to be extremely safe and
      efficacious in multiple populations when taken consistently. Young men who have sex with men
      of color (yMSMc) comprise the group at the highest risk of new HIV infections and the only
      group whose HIV infection rates continue to increase. New data suggest interrupting
      transmission among MSM can reduce HIV acquisition among other risk groups as well. However,
      accessing, linking, and retaining yMSMc in a PrEP program is both critical to successful HIV
      prevention and historically difficult to achieve. Philadelphia FIGHT initiated a PrEP program
      at the youth site, Youth Health Empowerment Project (Y-HEP), for yMSMc approximately 1.5
      years ago that also gives all participants access to general primary care. Y-HEP utilizes a
      unique biomedical/biobehavioral approach to enhance adherence and retention of yMSMc
      receiving PrEP.

      The purpose of this protocol is to increase access to safe and effective PrEP to yMSMc in
      order to reduce incident HIV infections and health disparities in HIV incidence and
      prevalence through the use of a combined biomedical/behavioral intervention in a
      community-based setting servicing high-risk youth in Philadelphia. It is hypothesized this
      unique, combined biomedical/behavioral HIV prevention strategy will lead to high recruitment
      and retention rates in this community setting. All subjects will be offered primary care
      services as well as a package of HIV risk reduction interventions including once daily PrEP
      with tenofovir and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), condoms, risk reduction counseling, HIV testing,
      and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and treatment. A weekly support group will
      aim to maximize medication adherence and retention by engaging subjects in prevention,
      risk-reduction and behavioral counseling, education about HIV, leadership training, and
      social networking.

      Subjects will consist of 50 HIV-negative biological males between the ages of 18 and 30 who
      meet eligibility criteria as defined below.

      All subjects will receive Truvada as PrEP on Monday evenings on an either weekly, biweekly,
      or monthly basis depending on an initial assessment of their need for adherence support, with
      provisions to obtain medication the following day(s) at Y-HEP if they are unable to attend
      the Monday night session. Study subjects will be considered to have picked up their
      medications if they come any time during the week designated as a medication pick-up week. In
      addition, all subjects will receive standard HIV prevention services including condom
      provision, risk reduction counseling, HIV testing, STI screening and treatment, as well as
      basic medical care and linkage to HIV care in the event of PrEP failure. Subjects will
      receive a behavioral intervention consisting of youth-focused men's wellness services
      centered around education about HIV, adherence counseling and knowledge of PrEP efficacy on
      risk behavior, general health services such as smoking cessation support and nutritional
      counseling, job and leadership training, and sexual health and well-being promotion.

      Subjects will be screened for HIV, STIs, and renal function at baseline and every three
      months, and will also have a rapid test for HIV on a monthly basis (Table 1). Treatment will
      be provided for all STIs diagnosed during this study, and non-immune subjects will be offered
      vaccines against hepatitis A and B. Adherence will be assessed by the percentage of
      medication pick-up visits attended as well as urine tenofovir levels every 2-4 weeks and
      plasma tenofovir levels at weeks 24 and 48. Risk behaviors will be assessed by STI rates and
      the adapted Risk Assessment Battery at baseline, and weeks 24 and 48. A qualitative interview
      will be conducted at the end of the study to assess program acceptability.

    <measure>Evaluate program retention</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine whether this community intervention can achieve 70% program retention at the end of 48 weeks, as defined by the proportion of patients initiating Truvada who pick up at least 50% of their medication through 48 weeks and who have a study visit in the 48-week window (subject may have this final study visit within an allowed window of 4 weeks before or after the 48-week visit in accordance with the FDA snapshot algorithm). Intermediate retention assessment will also be conducted at weeks 12, 24, and 36 by assessing the proportion of patients who have picked up at least 50% of their medication prior to those time points and who have a study visit at the end of those periods using +/- 4 week snapshot analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate adherence to PrEP</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the proportion of medication pick-up visits attended (a function of pharmacy refill data), and the proportion of study subjects with detectable urine drug concentrations over the 48 week study period. We will compare the estimates of adherence obtained with these measurements to two plasma tenofovir concentrations (collected at weeks 24 and 48) using the cutoff of 16 fmol/106 cells as the level associated with 90% adherence or greater.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess behavioral change</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed through the change in reported number of risk behaviors at weeks 0, 24 and 48 (as measured by the Risk Assessment Battery, RAB) as well as the change in incidence of STIs over the study period. The RAB provides a brief self-report measure of drug use practices and sexual behaviors associated with HIV transmission. The RAB was developed and validated by the University of Pennsylvania and has been adapted for use in many countries. Study-specific questions in addition to the RAB will focus on attitudes regarding the effect of PrEP on risk behaviors.</description>

    <description>Program acceptability and feasibility will be measured objectively by assessing program retention as well as subjectively through qualitative assessment. A standard acceptability survey adapted from the &quot;HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire&quot; Â© Prof. Clare Bradley: 7/97 English for UK &amp; USA rev.12.2.01A (intro.rev.1.10.04), Health Psychology Research, Dept of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, TW20 0EX.
