  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the MTD to
      subsequently define an RP2D of alisertib in combination with weekly paclitaxel in East Asian
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib in combination with
      paclitaxel is being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose in East Asian patients. The
      study will consist of 2 parts: a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the alisertib plus paclitaxel
      combination in East Asian patients with advanced solid tumors; the second part is an
      expansion cohort at the RP2D of the alisertib plus paclitaxel in East Asian patients with
      either ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer. This study will look at safety (lab results
      and side effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (how the drugs move throughout the body).

      This open label study will enroll 30 participants. Dose Escalation Phase: Alisertib tablets
      at a starting dose of 15 mg, orally, twice daily, 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day
      cycle in combination with paclitaxel, 60 mg/m^2 intravenous in Cohort 1 escalated to a dose
      of 25 mg alisertib, orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in
      Cohort 2. If ≥ 2 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) the dose of alisertib
      will be decreased to 20 mg. Expansion Cohort: alisertib tablets at the determined RP2D dose
      orally, twice daily 3 days on/4 days off for 3 weeks in 28 day cycles in combination with
      paclitaxel, 60 mg/m^2 intravenous. Treatment will continue until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Alisertib 15 mg to 25 mg tablets

        -  Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 intravenous solution

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 24 months.
