  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common and potentially life threatening condition
      arising from a variety of pathological conditions including traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain tumors. Monitoring the ICP is the
      most important aspect of the management of these patients. Recently, transorbital
      ultrasonography has gained popularity as a noninvasive bedside exam that has been shown to be
      useful in the diagnosis of raised ICP by evaluating the change in the optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD). Transorbital ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD appears to be a
      noninvasive, relatively inexpensive bedside examination for the diagnosis of raised ICP. The
      investigators aimed to determine the changes in ONSD with acute controlled changes in ICP in
      healthy volunteers. The controlled changes in ICP will be produced by manipulating the PCO2
      with the use of Respiract and jugular venous compression with the use of custom made neck
      collar.
