      Study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial evaluating whether prophylactic
      laparoscopic placement of a dual-component IPOM mesh around a colostomy may prevent
      parastomal hernia compared with conventional colostomy after abdominoperineal resection.
      Eligible subjects will be recruited prospectively from five Finnish Hospitals (Oulu
      University Hospital,Vaasa Central Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, Lahti Central
      Hospital, Jyv채skyl채 Central Hospital). Patients were considered eligible for this study if
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Patients are
      randomized to prophylactic preperitoneal placement of a dual-component mesh (Dynamesh IPOM)
      around permanent colostomy or to conventional permanent colostomy. Estimating a parastomal
      hernia rate of 50%, a sample size of 26 patients per each study group is projected to provide
      90% power (1-beta) with a alpha 0.05 (2-beta) to detect a 40% reduction in risk for
      parastomal hernia at 1-year. Since we expect a dropout rate of 20%, 37 patients per study
      group will be included in this study.

      All abdominoperineal resections are performed using laparosopic technique. At the and of the
      abdominal laparoscopic phase the straight permanent end colostomy is performed. In the
      intervention group the 10 x 10 cm Dynamesh IPOM mesh is cut in the middle according to volume
      of the bowel. Stapled bowel end is then pulled through the crosswise opened mesh, which is
      pushed to the abdomen and fixed to the peritoneum.

      Follow-up visits are scheduled at 1-, 3- and 12-month after surgery. Patients are evaluated
      for their clinical status and C-reactive protein, leukocytes and hemoglobin are assessed at
      each control visit. Computed tomography (CT) scan with and without Valsalva maneuver is
      performed 12 months after surgery for radiological evaluation of possible parastomal hernia.

      The primary end-point of this study is the incidence of clinically and radiologically
      detected parastomal hernias, and their extent 12 months after surgery. The secondary outcome
      end-points were colostomy-related morbidity such as stomal stenosis, necrosis and/or wound
      infection.The extent of parastomal hernia was graded at CT according to the Hernia Society
      criteria.

      Statistical analysis is performed using a SPSS statistical software. Continuous variables are
      reported as the mean and standard deviation, whereas nominal variables are reported as counts
      and proportions. Univariate analysis is performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's
      exact test. P-values &lt; 0.05 are considered statistically significant.
