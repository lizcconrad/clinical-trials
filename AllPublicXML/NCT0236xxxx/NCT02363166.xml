  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that the Emergency Department (ED) has become the entry way for large populations of
      patients into the health care system, a strategy of sampling MRSA isolates in ED populations
      and merging this information with patient-level data may present a window to hypothesize and
      investigate CA-MRSA transmission within the community and its impact on hospital-acquired
      infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective cross-sectional study involving 500 patients enrolled over a one year period at
      the UFHealth Shands Hospital's Adult and Pediatric Emergency Department. The collected
      information will serve as pilot data for a future large comprehensive multi-site study.

      Patients will have a wound culture and a nasal swab obtained as part of the study, which will
      be assessed for MRSA isolates using next-generation whole genome sequencing. The principal
      investigator or PI designee will also survey participants and review hospital records.

      Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be isolated from pelleted bacteria using the Roche High Pure PCR kit
      following the standard protocol for isolation of nucleic acids from bacteria. The quality of
      the extracted gDNA will be determined through gel electrophoresis and the quantity through
      Nanodrop2000.
