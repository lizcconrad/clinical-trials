    <textblock>
      This study aim is to evaluate the needle positioning precision, compared to the real path
      planned by the physician on healthy voluntaries, by positioning a fictional needle, without
      inserting it.

      Additionally, this study will evaluate:

        -  the robot precision,

        -  the robot detection robustness,

        -  the software and device ergonomics,

        -  the device security.
