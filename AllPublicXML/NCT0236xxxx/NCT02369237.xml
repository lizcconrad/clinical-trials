  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia and inflammation are very common in patients with renal diseases. The most common
      procedure to detect anemia is to determine blood hemoglobin concentrations. The Haemospect®
      is a portable device for non-invasive hemoglobin determination that works with a sensor that
      is applicable in infants and adults alike.

      The objective of this trial is to collect spectra with the non-invasive Haemospect® device in
      children of different age groups with renal failure and different hemoglobin concentrations.
      In parallel, corresponding hemoglobin values shall be obtained invasively to form the basis
      for the development of an algorithm for the device.

      To determine inflammation, the frequencies of vasomotion and oxygenation of the tissue are
      measured non-invasively with the Haemospect®. Various blood parameters for iron and
      inflammation will also be determined, such as ferritin, hepcidin, transferrin, serum iron,
      white blood cell count and CRP.

        The subjects (n ≈ 80) will be enrolled in the Fundación del Niño Enfermo Renal (FUNDANIER)
        in Guatemala-City. Approximately 50% of the patients in this institution are on
        hemodialysis and 50% are on peritoneal dialysis.
