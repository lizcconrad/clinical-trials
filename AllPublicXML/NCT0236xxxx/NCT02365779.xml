    <textblock>
      High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most threatening type of gynaecological cancer with
      an important mortality due to late diagnosis. However the prognosis is excellent in the early
      stages of the disease. Recently it has been described a new serous carcinogenic sequence from
      the fallopian tube with tubal precancerous lesions. Therefore the identification of these
      early preinvasive lesions would be of great interest in the population with hereditary
      predisposition for ovarian cancer (concept of oncofertility) and in the general population
      (to determine whether bilateral salpingectomy has to be performed during a hysterectomy for
      benign disease).

      The optical biopsy has been developed and validated in the detection of early precancerous
      lesions (such as Barrett's oesophagus or in situ cancer of the bladder). The first objective
      of this study is to prospectively assess the efficacy of optical biopsy (Cellvizio®) in the
      study of fallopian tubes during laparoscopy with correlation between the histopathological
      and immunohistochemical analysis and the endomicroscopy image interpretation. The second
      objective is to describe the optical biopsy pictures in order to state a classification.
