  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second most frequent causes of mortality in the word after cardiovascular
      disease and the most frequent cause of disability. The majority of strokes are ischemic
      (87%). Ischemic stroke may benefit from efficient therapy if the delay from stroke onset not
      exceeds 4H30 (intra-venous thrombolysis). In case of irreversible cerebral lesion, the long
      term functional recovery is largely dependent from the ability of the brain to reorganize.
      Conventional magnetic resonance imaging represents the most sensitive tool to diagnose stroke
      at the acute phase. However, up to now, no imaging tool is available to determine the time of
      stroke onset. Moreover, no imaging tool is available to precisely quantify the functional and
      structural plasticity mechanisms occurring after stroke. The main objective of the present
      study is to test the accuracy of sodium MRI to determine the time of stroke onset. The
      secondary objectives of the study are to determine the ability of non-conventional MRI
      techniques to quantify the degree of tissue damage and brain reorganization after stroke.
      Thirty patients will be included during the first 24 hours after stroke onset. Multimodal MRI
      (including perfusion MRI, sodium MRI, resting-state functional MRI, high resolution
      anatomical MRI) and clinical evaluation will be carried on at the inclusion, after 24 hours,
      at 3 months and at 12 months.
