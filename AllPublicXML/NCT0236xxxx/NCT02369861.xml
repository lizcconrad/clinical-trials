  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with moderate-to-severe Dry Eye by symptoms will be screened including history,
      ophthalmic examination to include the status of their ocular structure and function and
      evaluation of tear production. Blood will be blood drawn for complete blood count and
      chemistry panel. They will also have a urinalysis and pregnancy test in women of
      child-bearing potential.

      Subjects will have a two week &quot;run-in&quot; period in which they use artificial tears. If their
      Dry Eye signs and symptoms do not improve significantly, they will be enrolled and will
      receive study drug.

      Safety evaluation includes assessment of the structure and function of the eyes including
      retina examination and corrected visual acuity.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment arms, ACCS or &quot;artificial tears&quot; eye drops. The randomization scheme is 1:1
      ACCS:artificial tears. Subjects will self-administer their eye drops four times each day.

      Subjects will be seen in the office of the ophthalmologist/optometrist at baseline (week
      zero), one week, three weeks, six weeks and ten weeks. Eye examination will be done at each
      visit. The baseline eye tests and lab work will be repeated after the treatment phase of the
      study at the end of week six. Following 6 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be followed
      for 4 additional weeks.

      Subjects with moderate-to-severe Dry Eye judged by symptoms will be screened following
      signing of informed consent. Screening will involve history and physical examination
      including ophthalmic examination with dilated fundus exam to assess the status of their
      ocular structure and function, and evaluation of tear production and damage caused by
      clinically significant Dry Eye. Blood will be blood drawn for complete blood count, chemistry
      panel including serum glucose, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function
      studies including total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase
      (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), albumin, and total protein. They will also have a
      urinalysis. Pregnancy test will be performed in women of child-bearing potential.

      Subjects will have a two week &quot;run-in&quot; period in which they use artificial tears. Those
      subjects in whom corneal staining is 2 or more (on a scale of 0-4), Dry Eye symptom score on
      the OSDI is 25-75 after two weeks of using artificial tears four times per day, and
      laboratory test results within the accepted ranges will be enrolled and will receive study
      drug, Those subjects in whom dry eye symptoms improve sufficiently (OSDI drops below 25)
      and/or corneal staining is reduced from 2 or more to less than 2, or have laboratory test
      results outside the accepted ranges will not be enrolled.

      Safety evaluation includes assessment of the structure and function of the eyes including
      conjunctival and corneal tissues. Corrected visual acuity will be measured at every visit.
      Patient comfort will be assessed after administration of the study drug and at every visit. A
      retina examination will be performed before and after the treatment period. Slit lamp exam
      including the cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, eye lids and lashes will be
      performed at every visit. Special testing will include fluorescein staining of the cornea,
      lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva, endothelial cell analysis, Schirmer tear
      production, and intraocular pressure measured on all subjects.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment arms, ACCS or &quot;artificial tears&quot; eye drops. ACCS and artificial tears eye drops
      will be supplied by Stemnion, and both personnel and subjects will be trained in its use. The
      treatment will be prepared in a coded container such that the subject and physician are
      masked as to the treatment. One treatment arm will receive ACCS eye drops in both eyes and
      the other treatment arm will receive artificial tears eye drops in both eyes. Treatment arms
      will be assigned by random. The randomization scheme is 1:1 ACCS:artificial tears. Subjects
      will self-administer their eye drops four times each day. Subjects will be asked to keep a
      study diary of when they place the study medication in their eyes.

      Subjects will be seen in the office of the ophthalmologist/optometrist at baseline (week
      zero), one week, three weeks, six weeks and ten weeks. Eye examination will be done at each
      visit. Each subject will complete a patient questionnaire on their symptoms of Dry Eye. The
      baseline eye tests and lab work will be repeated after the treatment phase of the study at
      the end of week six. Following 6 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be followed for 4
      additional weeks.
