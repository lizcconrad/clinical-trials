  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no solid treatment guidelines for idiopathic intractable epilepsy in children. The
      investigators propose that vitamin C being an antioxidant will improve seizure frequency and
      EEG in children with idiopathic intractable epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Is vitamin C; being an antioxidant based on the hypothesis of oxidative stress as a
      provocation factor for idiopathic epilepsy low in those with idiopathic epilepsy, and is it
      lower in those with refractory than those with newly diagnosed? Will vitamin C
      supplementation for 1 month be efficient to raise the vitamin C level and will it improve
      seizures and EEG findings in those with idiopathic epilepsy?
