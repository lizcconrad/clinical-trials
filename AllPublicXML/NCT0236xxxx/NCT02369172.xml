  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. So, it is important to assess in vivo the
      effect of ASP2151 on that enzyme to determine any possible drug interactions. The aim of this
      trial is to investigate the potential for interaction of ASP2151 with the CYP2B6 probe
      substrate bupropion.

          -  Blood pressure and heart rate in seated position at the screening examination outside
             the ranges 90-140 mm Hg systolic, 40-90 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 40_100 beats/min.
             However, if the investigator deems the result to be not clinically significant the
             subject may be included.

          -  Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV1 or HIV2.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, eg as a blood
             donor.
