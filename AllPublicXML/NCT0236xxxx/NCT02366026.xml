    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare &amp; evaluate between the treatment groups the changes in
      decline/reduction of HIV viral load changes in the Remune + Amplivax group vs the Amplivax
      placebo groups. Additional objectives include changes in WBC White Blood Cell counts &amp; CD4+ &amp;
      CD8+ T cell counts along with increased HIV immunity.

      This is a 500 subject Multi Center double-blind randomized, Safety &amp; Efficacy, HIV/AIDS Phase
      III study, to primarily to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HIV-1 immunogen &amp; Amplivax
      compared to placebo group Amplivax in viral load, and secondarily to examine changes in CD4+
      &amp; CD8+ T cell counts, determine Remune vaccines effect of multiple inoculations of HIV-1
      immunogen + Amplivax on viral replication in adults with HIV-1 infection &amp; to examine
      immunogenicity of Remune + Amplivax in a Multi-center, randomized , double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two arm parallel design study of Remune + Amplivax.
