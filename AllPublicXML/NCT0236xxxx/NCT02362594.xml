  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether post-resection adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab improves
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) as compared to placebo for high-risk participants with
      melanoma (Stage IIIA [&gt; 1 mm metastasis], IIIB and IIIC). The study will also assess whether
      pembrolizumab improves RFS versus placebo in the subgroup of participants with programmed
      cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumor expression. Participants will be stratified for
      stage of disease and region and then will be randomly assigned to receive either
      pembrolizumab or placebo.

      An interim analysis of efficacy is planned after approximately 330 RFS events have been
      reported and will be based on efficacy in the intention to treat population (primary efficacy
      population). If the superiority of pembrolizumab compared to placebo is confirmed, the final
      analysis will occur immediately after the interim analysis. The study will continue until 409
      RFS events have been reported if superiority is not confirmed.
