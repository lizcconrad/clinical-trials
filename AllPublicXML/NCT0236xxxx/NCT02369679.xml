  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of lymphedema is based on a combined program called complex decongestive therapy.
      The components of the complex decongestive therapy are skin care, kinesiotherapy, manual
      lymphatic drainage and compression. The compression with multilayer bandage has proved to be
      the most effective of these therapies when analyzed separately.The multilayer bandage
      produces a gradient compression on the limb where distal pressure is higher than proximal
      pressure. Several materials are needed for the multilayer bandage, including tubular bandage
      lining, digit bandages, foam under-cast padding and multiple layers of short-stretch bandages
      to cover the entire limb. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap fits each patient through a
      Velcro system.

      The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a precast adjustable compression wrap (Circaid)
      with the multilayer compression bandages in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.

      The gold standard of the treatment of lymphedema is based on a combined program called
      complex decongestive therapy. The components of the complex decongestive therapy are skin
      care, kinesiotherapy, manual lymphatic drainage and compression. The compression with
      multilayer bandage has proved to be the most effective of these therapies when analyzed
      separately. With the multilayer compression bandage the upper limb lymphedema volume
      decreased a 37.2%.

      The multilayer bandage produces a gradient compression on the limb where distal pressure is
      higher than proximal pressure. Several materials are needed for the multilayer bandage,
      including tubular bandage lining, digit bandages, foam under-cast padding and multiple layers
      of short-stretch bandages to cover the entire limb. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap
      fits each patient through a Velcro system.

      Decreasing compression is achieved by controlling the tension applied to each Velcro through
      a visual color guide. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap has proved to be safe and
      effective to treat lower limb lymphedema, but there is little information about its
      effectiveness in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.

      The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a precast adjustable compression wrap (Circaid)
      with the multilayer compression bandages in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.

In order to evaluate tolerability patients will be asked every day about any discomfort or troubles they could feel. On the other hand, it will be daily recorded how many hours the patient had used the precast adjustable compression wrap or the multilayer compression bandages.

    <description>A physiotherapist well trained in lymphedema treatment will apply a lymphatic drainage to the affected upper limb. Then the physiotherapist will apply the precast adjustable compression wrap to the patient. The patient would maintain the precast adjustable compression wrap until the next session of treatment. The first 10 sessions will be daily from Monday to Friday.
After the 10 first sessions, the treatment will be applied on alternate days (3 per week) until the patient receive a tailored compression garment (7-14 days).</description>
