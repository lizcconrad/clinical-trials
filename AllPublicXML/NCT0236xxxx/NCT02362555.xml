  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ossification of nuchal ligament often observed in patient with chronic neck pain, previous
      study showed ossification of nuchal ligament was associated with cervical spondylosis and
      radiculopathy. Patient with chronic neck pain was divided into two groups according to the
      presence of ossification of nuchal ligament on cervical radiographic images.

      This study is to evaluate and compare the neck function including range of motion, neck
      strength and pressure pain threshold, radiography characteristics and functional disability
      between two groups.
