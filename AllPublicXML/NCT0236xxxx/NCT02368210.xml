    <measure>Proportion of subjects rated a &quot;treatment success&quot; based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of severity of a subject's disease, taking into account all of the subject's psoriatic lesions. &quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as a score of 0 or 1 representing &quot;cleared&quot; or &quot;almost cleared&quot; at Day 15 with at least a two grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline. IGA is measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe/very severe).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects rated a &quot;treatment success&quot; for each of the clinical signs of psoriasis (scaling, erythema and plaque elevation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>A static assessment of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of severity of each of three key characteristics present within all of the subject's psoriatic lesions. &quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as a score of 0 or 1 representing &quot;cleared&quot; or &quot;almost cleared&quot; at Day 15 with at least a two grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline. Each clinical sign of psoriasis is measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe/very severe).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in pruritus score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus scale will be used to assess the subjective and multidimensional experience of the subject's pruritus (itching) during the previous two weeks at Baseline and Day 15. Possible scores range from 5 (no pruritus) to 25 (most severe pruritus).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in % body surface area (BSA) with active psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will use the assumption that 1% BSA is approximately equal to the surface area of the subject's palm and fingers, with the fingers extended yet grouped together, creating a flat oval-like surface area.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis involving a minimum of 2%
             and no more than 12% affected body surface area.

          -  Subject has an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least three
             (moderate) at study start.

          -  If subject is a woman of childbearing potential, she must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and agree to use an effective form of birth control for the duration of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis.

          -  Subject has guttate, pustular, erythrodermic or other non-plaque forms of psoriasis.

          -  Subject has a physical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair
             evaluation of plaque psoriasis, or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk
             by study participation.

          -  Subject has used any phototherapy (including laser), photo-chemotherapy or other forms
             of photo based therapy for the treatment of their psoriasis within 30 days prior to
             study start.

          -  Subject has used any systemic methotrexate, retinoids, systemic corticosteroids
             [including intralesional, intra-articular, and intramuscular corticosteroids],
             cyclosporine or analogous products within 90 days prior to study start.

          -  Subject has used any systemic biologic therapy (i.e., FDA-approved or experimental
             therapy) within five half-lives of the biologic prior to study start.

          -  Subject had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet
             radiation within 30 days prior to study start or is intending to have such exposure
             during the study.
