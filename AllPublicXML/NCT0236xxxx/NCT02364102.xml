      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects Brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) function in humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by thyroid
      hormone supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is a frequent endocrine disorder, the prevalence of subclinical disease being
      4.3% and of overt disease being 0.3%. Patients suffering from hypothyroidism frequently
      complain of increased cold sensitivity and involuntary weight gain, indicating changes in
      energy expenditure and response to cold challenge.

      Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has regained attention as an energy expending tissue.
      While it was previously thought to be of no or negligible relevance in human adults, recent
      studies clearly demonstrated the presence and metabolic activity of BAT in human adults. Upon
      activation of BAT by the sympathetic nervous system intracellular lipid stores are rapidly
      depleted. The generated free fatty acids fuel beta-oxidation and the respiratory chain within
      the mitochondria and activate at the same time uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This protein acts
      as a protonophore, allowing the flux of protons along the electrochemical gradient into the
      inner mitochondrial matrix instead of transferring their energy to adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)-synthase. The short circuiting of the oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria
      leads to highly active cellular respiration and generation of heat. Basic research highlights
      the importance of thyroid hormone in the development and function of BAT.

      It has recently been shown that hyperthyroidism exerts activating effects on BAT in adult
      humans.

      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects BAT function in
      humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by thyroid hormone supplementation.
