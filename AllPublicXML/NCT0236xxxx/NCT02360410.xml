  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness of an
      electronic personalized health screening app incorporating motivational feedback (i.e.,
      &quot;Check Yourself&quot;) to usual care. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Check
      Yourself is more effective than usual care in reducing health risk behaviors and improving
      quality of care among adolescents receiving primary health care services.

    <description>Adolescents complete Check Yourself, an electronic health screening app and receive personalized, motivational feedback on their health behaviors prior to their primary care appointment. Key components of Check Yourself include the provision of age normative feedback, goal setting strategies, and strategies to highlight discrepancies. Primary care providers receive a summary report of health risk behaviors from Check Yourself prior to their adolescent patient's primary care appointment.</description>
