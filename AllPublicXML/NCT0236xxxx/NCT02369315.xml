      as &quot;El Sistema&quot;.

    <textblock>
      The randomized control trial was conducted in 16 music centers in Venezuela between May 2012
      and November 2013, with a population of 6-14 year olds seeking entry to the program. During
      an application period (May-July 2012), 2,603 guardians (the experimental cluster) applied on
      behalf of 2,999 6-14 year olds. Approximately half of the guardians were randomly offered
      early admission in September 2012, with the rest offered admission in September 2013.
      Baseline and follow-up data were collected on outcomes which will be explored for full-group
      and specific sub-groups (children with less educated mothers, and boys or girls exposed to
      violence).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Excess demand in 5 geographic areas: 24 music centers across the 5 states were
             identified as the experimental sites based on the likelihood of having excess demand
             by families in the 2012-13 academic year.

          -  Apply protocol: Experimental sites agreed to accept written applications from
             guardians between May 7 and July 8, 2012 (without informing guardians of admission
             decisions until after randomization). Directors consented to participate in the
             experiment and received training in the experimental protocol. Children were eligible
             to apply if they would be 6 to 14 years old on September 1, 2012. Sites received
             applications from 2,603 guardians on behalf of 2,999 children.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Music center level: Two sites were excluded because their directors declined to follow
             the experimental protocol, and six were excluded because of insufficient demand to
             carry out randomized experiment.

          -  Child/guardian level: By prior agreement, each site director could award early
             admission to a small number of applicants (no more than 5% of positions). In eight
             sites, 85 children (of 74 guardians) were excluded from the study because they entered
             through these positions allotted to site directors. Children were also lost from study
             if parental consent and child assent not given.
