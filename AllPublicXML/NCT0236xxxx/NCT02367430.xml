      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a well-established case management model
      called Critical Time Intervention (CTI) can help individuals with hoarding disorder who are
      concerned about the risk of eviction. Each individual with hoarding disorder will be assigned
      to work with a CTI Specialist for 9 months, who will provide referrals for mental health
      treatment, legal consultations, and registration for entitlements. All participants will be
      offered a facilitated group intervention called the Buried in Treasures Workshop. The CTI
      Specialist will also facilitate reconnecting the individual with supportive family/friends
      and will monitor and support the de-cluttering of the patient's home.

      A second comparison group will be offered the same group intervention (Buried in Treasures
      Workshop) without the other parts of the CTI protocol.
