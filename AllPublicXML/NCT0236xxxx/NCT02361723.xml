        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part IA:

          1. Provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.

          2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age.

          3. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which
             no effective standard therapy is available.

          5. BRCA1/2 mutations are not required but enrichment of this subject population is
             permitted.

          6. Small cell lung cancer, high grade serous ovarian cancer, and triple negative breast
             cancer subjects will be preferentially recruited.

          7. Glioblastoma multiforme subjects may be eligible, after discussion between the sponsor
             and investigator.

          8. Archival tumor tissues are strongly recommended to be collected if available.

          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1.

        Phase IB/Part A:

          1. Provided written informed consent prior to screening visit.

          2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic
             ovarian, fallopian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, breast cancer, or CRPC and have
             progressed after receiving at least one prior chemotherapy regimen in the advanced or
             metastatic setting could be recruited L

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1, except:

               1. Subjects with ovarian cancer without measurable disease may be considered if
                  evaluable based on GCIG CA-125 criteria, after discussion with sponsor medical
                  monitor.

               2. Subjects with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) and with only non-measurable bone lesions
                  must have either progression with 2 or more new lesions or have prostate-specific
                  antigen (PSA) progression as specified by the PCWG2 criteria for study
                  eligibility within the 6-week period before study drug administration.

          5. All subjects must agree to provide blood sample for germline BRCA and/or other
             mutation testing.

          6. ECOG performance status of ≤1.

          7. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        Phase IB/Part B:

          1. Provided written informed consent prior to screening visit.

          2. Male or female and at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

             no effective standard therapy is available.

          4. BRCA1/2 mutations are not required but enrichment of this subject population is
             preferable. Subjects with ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, breast cancer or
             CRPC must agree to provide blood sample for germline BRCA and/or other mutation
             testing even if it has been previously tested.

          5. It is highly recommended that subjects provide archival tumor tissues or agree to a
             tumor biopsy for biomarker analysis

          6. Small cell lung cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and triple negative breast
             cancer subjects will be preferentially recruited.

          7. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1. Subjects with
             ovarian cancer without measurable disease may be considered if evaluable based on GCIG
             CA 125 criteria, after discussion with sponsor medical monitor.

          8. ECOG performance status of ≤1.

          9. A life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have been treated with chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or
             other investigational agent within 5 t1/2 or within 4 weeks (whichever is longer)
             prior to starting study drug (or who have not recovered from the side effects of such
             therapy)

          2. Subjects who have undergone major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4
             weeks of screening visit. subjects must have recovered from the treatment and have a
             stable clinical condition before entering this study

          3. Subjects who have received radiotherapy of target lesions

          4. Subjects who have received local radiotherapy of non-target lesions for local symptom
             control within the last 4 weeks must have recovered from any adverse effects of
             radiotherapy before recording baseline symptoms

          5. Lesions treated with locoregional therapies within the last 3 months before study
             inclusions do not qualify as target lesions unless progression was demonstrated
