    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both EGFR and HER-2 receptors. This
      study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Pyrotinib in combination with
      capecitabine in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pyrotinib, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) To
      determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of
      Pyrotinib To assess preliminary antitumor activity To determine preliminary regimen dose for
      phase II study
