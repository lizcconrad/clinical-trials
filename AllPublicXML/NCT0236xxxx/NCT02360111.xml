  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study which will be done in a small number of patients. The purpose of this
      study is to test the safety and benefit of giving a type of chemotherapy - cyclophosphamide -
      after the transplant to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients with abnormal
      kidney function. GVHD is one of the most common complications of a stem cell transplant .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Patients over age 18 who are deemed eligible for transplant by their treating
             physician.

          -  Disease status:

               1. AML in â‰¥ 1st remission - excluding those in 1st remission with 'good risk'
                  cytogenetic features (i.e. t(8;21), t(15;17), inv 16).

               2. Secondary AML

               3. ALL/LL in 1st remission with clinical or molecular features indicating a high
                  risk for relapse; or ALL &gt; 2nd remission

               4. CML failing to respond to, progressing on or not tolerating appropriate TKI
                  therapy in first chronic phase of disease; CML in accelerated phase, second
                  chronic phase, or in CR after accelerated phase or blast crisis.

               5. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma with chemoresponsive disease in any of the following
                  categories:

                    1. high grade lymphomas who have failed to achieve a first CR or have relapsed
                       following a 1st remission who are not candidates for autologous transplants
                       or transplants requiring the use of calcineurin inhibitors.

                    2. any NHL with therapy responsive disease which is considered not curable
                       outside the transplant setting and not eligible/appropriate for autologous
                       transplant or a higher priority protocol.

               6. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): RA/RCMD with high risk cytogenetic features or
                  transfusion dependence, RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 and AML evolved from MDS, who are not
                  eligible for a higher priority protocol.

               7. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: CMML-1 and CMML-2, advanced polycythemia vera,
                  and myelofibrosis.

                       apheresis after G-CSF administration. BM will be the preferred graft source.

                    2. Patients diagnosed with any form of acute leukemia must have received
                       induction and at least one course of consolidation chemotherapy
                       pretransplant

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70%

          -  Patients will have a eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2

               1. Patients must have adequate organ function measured by: Cardiac: asymptomatic or
                  if symptomatic then LVEF at rest must be &gt; 50% and must improve with exercise.

               2. Hepatic: ALT &lt; 3 x ULN and total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, unless there is
                  congenital benign hyperbilirubinemia

               3. Renal: eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2

               4. Pulmonary: asymptomatic or if symptomatic, DLCO &gt; 50% of predicted (corrected for
                  hemoglobin)

          -  Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an
             informed consent form.

          -  Patient must have a fully matched related or unrelated donor willing to donate stem
             cells.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery or irradiation within two weeks.

          -  Active CNS or extramedullary malignant disease.

          -  Active and uncontrolled infection at time of transplantation including active
             infection with Aspergillus or other mold, or HIV infection

             effects of chemotherapy and agents used in the transplant.

          -  Male and female patients of child-bearing potential unwilling to use effective means
             of contraception
