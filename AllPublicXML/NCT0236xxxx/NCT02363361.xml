    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single center, open-label, non randomized clinical study to assess the
      uptake, safety and tolerability of Imatinib in acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury patients.
      The aim is to determine if Imatinib reaches sufficient blood levels when given to patients
      with cervical spinal cord injury, via a gastric feeding tube, and also evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of this drug treatment.
