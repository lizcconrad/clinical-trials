      This study examines the effects of individualized diet and exercise plans on muscle strength,
      quality of life and respiratory function in Pompe disease. Subjects will be given a diet and
      exercise plan based on their individual needs, which will be followed for 16 weeks.
      Participants will also be provided with an activity tracker in order to track their exercise
      activities, access to an app that will allow them to input their daily food intake, and they
      will also come to the University of Florida for exercise tests, respiratory tests and
      questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pompe is a rare disease, which occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 births. It is a
      progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene for
      acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycogen. Common
      symptoms include skeletal and smooth muscle myopathy, resulting in respiratory insufficiency,
      peripheral muscle weakness and generalized fatigue.

      The progressive myopathy in Pompe disease seems to be influenced by increased muscle protein
      breakdown. The increased muscle protein breakdown leads to muscle wasting, weakness,
      increased resting energy expenditure and, consequently, increased fatigue. Our hypothesis is
      that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet associated with regular physical exercise will
      improve respiratory and peripheral muscle functions in Pompe disease.

      In this study, we will investigate the effects of 16 weeks of planned diet and exercise in
      adolescent and young adult (15-40 years old) individuals with Pompe disease using an activity
      tracker.

      The participant will be asked to come to the University of Florida 4 times throughout the
      study (screening, baseline, +/- 15 days of completing the diet and exercise plan and a follow
      up three months later) for exercise testing, quality of life questionnaires, respiratory
      function testing and blood draws.

    <description>Patients will be given an individualized diet and exercise plan by a physical therapist and registered dietician. The diet and exercise plan will be carried out by the participant for 16 weeks. The exercise plan, an aerobic and strength training regimen, will be performed under the supervision of a personal trainer or certified exercise physiologist that is local to the participant. The participant will complete core-stabilizing exercises which can be performed at home or in an approved group class. The participant will wear an activity tracker at all times during this 16 week period, and will be asked to manually enter data into a phone app, such as daily food intake and weight.</description>
