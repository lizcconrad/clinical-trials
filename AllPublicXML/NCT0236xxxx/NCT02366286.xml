  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States
      (US) is relatively low. However, immigrant populations in the US from Asia and sub-Saharan
      Africa have substantially higher prevalence than the general population and are consequently
      at a significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed, the age-adjusted incidence
      rates for HCC in the US have tripled from 1975 to 2005. As the population demographics have
      changed, the 2000 US census estimated the number of Somalis in Minnesota at 25,000 but
      current estimates put the number at around 50,000 due to primary refugee arrivals as well as
      secondary immigration from other states. There is no available data for Somali immigrants in
      the US on HBV and HCV prevalence, HBV and HCV genotypes/subgenotypes, and genetic and
      immunologic risk factors predisposing Somalis to HBV and HCV and the subsequent development
      of HCC. Therefore. this study will fill these gaps in the Somali population to understand the
      relative importance of HBV and HCV infections in causation of HCC.

      Specific Aim 1: To recruit a cohort of Somali immigrants for screening for chronic HBV and
      and HCV infection and education on prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. The investigators
      will specifically:

        1. Establish a community-based program to recruit Somali African immigrant individuals in
           Minnesota for screening for hepatitis B and HCV

        2. Establish partnerships with Somali African community organizations and physicians to
           enhance screening and education about prevention and treatment of hepatitis B and HCV
           and their sequelae, including HCC.

      Specific Aim 2: To characterize viral factors that contribute to chronic inflammation,
      cirrhosis and HCC in Somali immigrants. The investigators will specifically:

        1. Determine the HBV and HCV viral status of participants using serologic tests and viral
           load

        2. Determine the viral genotypes and viral mutations and their correlation to measures of
           liver injury, immune function, liver cirrhosis, and HCC.

      Specific Aim 3: To characterize host factors that contribute to chronic inflammation,
      cirrhosis and HCC in Somali immigrants. The investigators will specifically:

        1. Determine whether variations in host immune phenotypes as measured by a novel multicolor
           flow cytometry assay correlate to clinical measures of inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC

        2. Determine whether variations in host genotypes in genes known to affect the liver
           disease phenotype correlate to measures of liver disease severity.
