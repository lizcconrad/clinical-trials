      Background:

      - The Gigaxonin gene lets the body make a protein chemical called Gigaxonin. Nerves need
      Gigaxonin to work properly. Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) causes a shortage of functional
      Gigaxonin. Nerves stop working normally in people with GAN. This causes problems with walking
      and sometimes with eating, breathing, and many other activities. GAN has no cure. Over time,
      GAN can shorten a person s life. Researchers want to see if a gene transfer treatment may
      help people with GAN.

      Objectives:

      - To see if a gene transfer is safe and shows potential to help people with GAN.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 5 and older with GAN.

      Design:

        -  For 2 months participants must live full-time within 100 miles of the NIH.

        -  Participants will be screened by phone and in person. They will take many tests. Some
           are listed below. Their medical records will be reviewed. Their caregivers may be
           contacted.

        -  Participants will have a total of about 30 visits, weekly, monthly, and then yearly over
           15 years. They will include many of the tests below.

        -  Physical and nervous system exams.

        -  Blood, urine, and stool samples.

        -  Nerve, lung, heart, and eye tests.

        -  Questionnaires.

        -  MRI scans, nerve biopsies, and spinal taps. Participants will be sedated for some tests.

        -  Speech, memory, muscle, and mobility tests.

        -  Skin biopsy (small sample removed).

        -  Participants will take many medicines. Some require intravenous lines.

        -  Participants will get the gene transfer through an injection by spinal tap into their
           cerebrospinal fluid, which flows around the brain and spinal cord. The genes are packed
           in a modified virus that carries the genes to cells in their body. Participants safety
           is not guaranteed.

      This is a non-randomized, phase I, escalating single dose study to assess the safety of the
      gene transfer vector scAAV9/JeT-GAN through intrathecal delivery to the brain and spinal cord
      of patients with Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN, OMIM No.256850). The primary objective of this
      study is to assess the safety of the vector following intrathecal delivery in 10-12 GAN
      patients who are five years of age or older and have mutations which result in positive
      cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) status. This terminology is used in other
      genetic disorders with residual protein expression that would allow for immunotolerance,
      amenable to enzyme or gene replacement such as in Pompe disease. Mutations which could result
      in CRIM-positive status include missense mutations, in-frame deletions or duplications or
      hypomorphic mutations (such as regulatory domain mutations which are leaky such as incomplete
      splice site mutations). This protocol was amended to include a single GAN patient, 5 years or
      older CRIM negative patient ('null mutation patient'). Secondary objectives of this study are
      1) to assess motor and sensory disease symptoms pre- and post-treatment, 2) to examine
      neuropathology in peripheral nerve biopsies in response to treatment, 3) to examine
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to conduct CSF studies to assess response to treatment, and 4)
      to assess vector shedding following vector administration. The first eligible CRIM positive
      patient will have a genetic diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy, will be seven years of age
      or older, and will have a forced vital capacity of greater than or equal to 50 percent
      predicted value on pulmonary function testing. This study will be the first-in-human trial of
      intrathecal delivery of scAAV9/JeT-GAN. The primary endpoint will be safety, based upon
      adverse events and standard laboratory safety evaluations. Secondary endpoints will include
      clinical and physiological assessment of motor and sensory function, possible rescue of
      disease pathology in peripheral nerves, examination of CSF in response to treatment, and
      assessment of vector shedding following administration.

      GAN is a chronic neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease pathologically characterized
      by enlarged axons with disordered microtubules and intermediate filaments. The disease
      pathology is due to loss-of-function mutations in the GAN gene, which encodes the protein
      gigaxonin. Gigaxonin plays a major role in the maintenance of orderly and functional
      intermediate filament (IF) architecture, which is critical for axonal function. Onset of
      symptoms, usually at 3-4 years of age, generally manifests with a slightly awkward gait
      (sensory ataxia). In the peripheral nervous system the disease progressively affects
      predominantly sensory and motor nerves. By the end of the 2nd decade of life, patients
      typically are wheelchair dependent with limited use of the arms and little to no use of their
      legs. During the 2nd decade a tracheostomy or other means of ventilation, as well as a
      feeding tube, are often necessary. Death normally occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life.
      There are no statistics on the incidence of the disease, but it is considered extremely rare
      and there are no effective treatments for the disease. Intrathecal delivery of a gene
      transfer vector carrying a normal copy of the GAN Gene to the spinal cord and brain offers a
      potentially effective treatment for GAN.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to participate in this study, the subject must meet the following criteria:

          1. Age 5 years or older; however, the first patient will be no younger than 7 years of
             age.

          2. Genetic diagnosis of GAN: Identified mutation(s) on both copies of the GAN gene. If
             the mutations found are not previously reported, then predictive software tools will
             be utilized in order to determine the degree of certainty that the mutation is
             predicted to be pathogenic (disease causing). This will also be evaluated in the
             context of the clinical and pathological phenotype (see below).

          3. Onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with GAN, including at least abnormal
             gait, as well as physical examination findings including at least abnormal gait,
             abnormal sensation (proprioceptive and/ or vibration sensation and/or positive
             Romberg), and some quantifiable weakness on manual muscle testing examination (score
             of &lt; 5/5 strength of at least one tested muscle).

          4. Men capable of fathering a child must agree to use barrier contraception (combination
             of a condom and spermicide) or limit activity to post-menopausal, surgically
             sterilized, or contraception-practicing partners, for 6 months after administration of
             investigational product. Women and girls of childbearing potential (and parents/
             guardians for minors &lt; 18) must agree to have urine human chorionic gonadotropin
             testing performed to rule out the possibility of pregnancy at each visit. Those women
             who are sexually active must also agree to use barrier contraception as well or limit
             activity to surgically sterilized or contraception-practicing partners for 3-6 months
             after the administration of the investigational product. This limitation is set
             because of the unknown risk associated with the administration of this vector genome
             to offspring. There is no known risk of sexual transmission of the vector.

          5. Willing and able to give informed consent if &gt;17 years of age and assent if &gt;7 years
             of age. For patients ages 7-17, parents or legal guardians must also consent to the
             child s participation in the study. Adults who lack capacity to consent but who have
             an appropriate surrogate may be included.

          6. Willingness to undergo a nerve biopsy at baseline and at 12 months after treatment.

          7. Agree to reside within 100 miles of the study site for at least 2 months following
             treatment (may include housing on NIH campus).

        EXCLUSION/DEFERRAL CRITERIA:

        In order to participate in this study, a patient MUST NOT have the following
        characteristics:

          1. Pregnant or lactating patients

          2. Forced vital capacity less than or equal to 50% of predicted value

          3. Ventilator dependence to include daytime use of assisted ventilation

          4. Current clinically significant infections including any requiring systemic treatment
             including but not limited to Human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis A, B, or C,
             Varicella zoster virus, or HTLV-1

          5. Prior history of bacterial meningitis

          6. Unwilling to undergo lumbar puncture at baseline and up to 2 to 3 times during follow
             up during the first year after treatment.

          7. Clinically significant echocardiogram abnormality per PI, anesthesiologist, and
             cardiologist

          8. Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality per PI, anesthesiologist,
             and cardiologist

          9. History of brain or spinal cord disease that would interfere with the LP procedures,
             CSF circulation, or safety assessments

         10. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter

         11. Any prior participation in a study in which a gene therapy vector or stem cell
             transplantation was administered to avoid any ambiguity in the safety assessment
             resulting from lingering effects from a previous treatment.

         12. Participation in an IND, IDE, or equivalent clinical study in the past six months.

         13. History of or current chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy
             within the past 30 days. Corticosteroid treatment may be permitted at the discretion
             of the PI.

         14. Immunizations of any kind in the month prior to the study to avoid lingering immune
             effects that could be confusing in the safety assessment of the trial.

         15. Current use of medication (e.g., levothyroxine, vitamin A supplementation, oral
             contraceptive use, tetracycline, Diamox) that could potentially lead to changes in
             intracranial pressure
