  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional pilot study investigating the feasibility of using the hand of hope
      (HOH) device for individuals with decreased hand function after stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HOH will be used to provide hand training for patients with decreased hand ability after
      stroke. The HOH is a light-weight, non-invasive, portable hand robot that provides physical
      assistance when a patient activates the muscles that open and close the hand. The HOH works
      by detecting surface EMG muscle activity and therefore requires active participation from the
      patient throughout the session. Video games linked to the HOH device are specifically
      designed to work on opening and closing the hand facilitating mass practice and high
      repetition needed for improving strength and range of motion of muscles.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks (discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA is a performance based evaluation of upper limb impairment of the affected arm after stroke. Scoring is based on an ordinal scale of 0 (no movement) to 2 (normal movement). Scoring is based on sum of 30 items, ranging from 0-60.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks (discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The AMAT is performance based measure of functional ability of the affected arm and hand in unilateral and bilateral everyday tasks. It is comprised of 10 functional tasks such as cutting meat with a knife and fork, donning a t-shirt, and phone use with a score ranging from 0 to a maximum of 5 for each item. The total score is the mean score for all individual item scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Blocks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks (discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The Box and Blocks is a performance-based functional assessment of hand dexterity ( gross grasp and release). The total score is the number of 2.5cc blocks successfully transferred from one box to another with the affected hand in one minute.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Upper Limb Capacity Scale (SULCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks (discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>The SULCs is a performance based measure of upper limb capacity after stroke. Each of the 10 items are administered in a hierarchical order and assigned a score of 0 (unable to complete) or 1 (able to complete the task) with a maximum score of 10.</description>

    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale is a stroke-specific questionnaire evaluating quality of life in stroke survivors over eight domains. Each domain is scored independently on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (minimum) bto a maximum of 5. Only the Hand sub-score was used in this study. Scores for each domain are transformed and range from 0-100.

    <description>Subjects will receive arm training 3x/week for 6 weeks, each session is anticipated to last approximately 60 minutes. Sessions will be scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday whenever possible to provide a rest period between sessions. Each session will consist of the following:
warm up-passive stretch of hand in flexion and extension (5 minutes);
setting the EMG threshold parameters for the device;
active practicing of opening the hand (Desperate Bee, Hungry Bird, Sun Archer games; 10 min)
active practice of closing then hand (UFO Catcher game; 10 min)
open and closing the hand (Ball and Basket game; 10 min)
open and closing the hand while incorporating reach ( for subjects with adequate ability to reach with shoulder/elbow; 10 min)
cool down-passive stretch of hand in flexion and extension (5 minutes)</description>

For this study, the three reflex items were omitted from the final score because it is considered a separate construct from motor impairment making the maximum score 60.</description>

        <title>Stroke Impact Scale --Hand Sub Scale (SIS-H)</title>
        <description>The Stroke Impact Scale is a stroke-specific questionnaire evaluating quality of life in stroke survivors over eight domains. Each domain is scored independently on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (minimum) bto a maximum of 5. Only the Hand sub-score was used in this study. Scores for each domain are transformed and range from 0-100.
Formula for scoring domains:
