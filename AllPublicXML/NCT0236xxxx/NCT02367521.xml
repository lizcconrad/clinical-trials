  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently complicated by depression and other problems such
      as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits and
      behavioral problems. Untreated depression can lead to reduced productivity and poor global
      outcome. There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of
      TBI-related depression. The overarching goal of this small study is to determine the
      effectiveness of low frequency right (LFR) rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression and
      co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
      brain stimulation technique. It involves generating a brief magnetic field in a coil that is
      placed on the scalp. The magnetic field passes through the skull and induces a weak
      electrical current in the brain that briefly activates neural circuits at the stimulation
      site. Adults aged 18 and older, with a history of head injury of mild or moderate severity ,
      who are currently experiencing symptoms of clinical depression may join the study.
