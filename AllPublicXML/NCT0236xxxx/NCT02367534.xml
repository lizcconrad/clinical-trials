  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation is one of the effective and promising options for type 1 diabetes
      mellitus treatment1-4. The liver is the primary target location for infusion and portal vein
      catheterization is generally used. Percutaneous transjugular, percutaneous transhepatic,
      laparoscopically transmesenteric and laparoscopically transumbilical approaches were often
      utilized to access the portal. Current islet infusion approach via portal vein of liver has
      various defects. Percutaneous trans-hepatic puncture is risk of possible severe hemorrhage
      and portal thrombosis. The laparoscopic entry techniques require longer surgical duration and
      have an increased rate of catheterization failure. Moreover, the catheters were not allowed
      to indwell for subsequent infusions.

      In the current study, the investigators aim to performed open surgery, catheterized the
      umbilical vein and infused islets into the portal vein. The catheter was indwelled for one
      month after surgery. Therapeutic effects, surgical parameters and complications were observed
      to evaluate feasibility and safety.

    <description>A 7 cm incision was made in the middle-right of upper abdominal. The umbilical vein was identified located 4cm beyond umbilicus, which was then half dissected transversely and the atresic venous lumen was recanalized with a common duct probe (3mm-5mm, BAKES). A breakthrough feeling would be sensed after approaching forward for 10-14cm and the umbilical vein was successfully recanalized. The common duct probe was pulled out. A catheter (single lumen central venous catheter, 16-20G, TUOREN, China) was then cannulated for 15cm into left branch of portal vein through umbilical vein. The procedure was observed with Doppler ultrasound (LOGIQ S6, GE).</description>
