          <description>SPP was defined as the number of vaccinated subjects with a pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:40 and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40.
The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/Christchurch/16/2010 (H1N1), Flu A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), Flu B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata) and Flu B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria).</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>
