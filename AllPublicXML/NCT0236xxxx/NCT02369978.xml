      This randomized, blind, parallel-group trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Nifurtimox (NFX) and Benznidazole (BZN), the two usual interventions to treat the parasite
      Trypanosoma cruzi.

      The investigators will test whether NFX is an effective trypanocidal agent (by comparison
      with placebo) and equivalent to BZN (as active comparator) in terms of both parasite-related
      and safety outcomes.

      Individuals found seropositive and without clinical signs of dilated cardiomyopathy will
      receive either of the active treatments or matching placebo. Participants allocated to NFX or
      BZN will receive either a 60-day (full-dose) or a 120-day (half-dose) active treatment,
      whereas the control group will receive placebo for 120 days. There will be thus four arms of
      active treatment (NFX60, NFX120, BZN60 and BZN120), and a fifth control arm receiving placebo
      (1:1:1:1:1 allocation ratio) where every participant in the trial will take 120 days of study
      drug (the groups receiving full-dose will complete a 120-day masked treatment with placebo).

      The study plans to enroll 500 participants from Colombia (in two different geographical
      areas) and Argentina, in order to explore regional differences in the treatment effects.

      The specific aims of this multi-center randomized trial include:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a multinational trial in terms of

             1. the ability to identify and recruit T. cruzi-infected individuals without clinical
                disease in a relatively short period

             2. the standardization of procedures to test the parasitic load using polymerase chain
                reaction (PCR)

        2. To evaluate, in the study population, the efficacy of a treatment with NFX using
           conventional (full) dose (8/mg/Kg/day) or half-dose for a variable duration (full-dose
           for 60 days versus half-dose for 120 days) in terms of the presence of positive PCR
           tests one year after treatment, as compared with placebo.

        3. To evaluate the equivalence (in terms of non-inferiority of its impact over the PCR
           testing) of two treatment schedules with NFX: a full-dose treatment for 60 days and a
           half-dose treatment for 120 days.

        4. To evaluate the equivalence of two treatment schedules with BZN: A conventional (full)
           dose of 5 mg/Kg/day) for 60 days, as compared with half-dose treatment for 120 days.

        5. To evaluate the equivalence of the treatment schedules with NFX as compared with those
           with BZN 5

        6. To evaluate the safety (in terms of reporting of mild symptoms, limitation of daily
           activities or hospitalizations, biochemical or blood abnormalities commonly reported by
           individuals taking these treatments) and adherence to the allocated treatments among
           individuals receiving NFX or BZN for varying duration and dose, as compared with placebo

        7. To explore differences in the impact of active treatments on the PCR among four
           subgroups of interest (geographical origin, T. cruzi discrete type unit found, parasitic
           load at baseline and age of participants).

        8. To explore, among individuals treated with placebo, the level of agreement in the tests
           of parasitic load at baseline and during the follow up.
