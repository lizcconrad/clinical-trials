    <textblock>
      The aim of interferon therapy in HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B was to make patients
      obtain immune control to hepatitis B virus defined as occurred HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg
      loss with sustained viral response after treatment. However this target could not be get if
      patients keep HBV DNA positive during interferon treatment and offend relapse after withdraw
      of treatment. In this trail, Nucleoside(acid) analogues(NA) will add on patients with HBV DNA
      load ≥1000copies/ml after 6 months of interferon treatment, and the efficacies of the combine
      therapy were evaluated by the rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss after 48 weeks of
      combined therapy, compared with control group.

      HBeAg positive patients with HBV DNA load ≥1000copies/ml after 6 months of peginterferon
      alpha 2a treatment will be enrolled randomized into two groups, in intervention group,
      patients will receive entecavir combine with peginterferon alpha 2a(PEG-IFN a-2a) treatment
      for 48 weeks and follow 24 weeks. Patients in control group will be continue treated with
      PEG-IFN a-2a for 48 weeks and followed 24 weeks. Serum HBV DNA load, HBsAg/anti-HBs level,
      HBeAg/anti-HBe will be tested at enrollment and every 3 months during the treatment course.
      Parameters of Liver and kidney function, and liver ultrasound examination will be tested with
      intervals 1-3 months. The efficacies of the combined therapy were evaluated by the rates of
      HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss after 48 weeks of combined therapy, compared with control
      group.
