      The objective of this project is to further explore the role of oxytocin in moral judgment
      and ethical behavior. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced in a variety of hypothalamic
      neurons. It is released into the brain or brought into general circulation through sensory
      stimuli in a pulsatile fashion. In social psychology research, oxytocin is hypothesized to
      coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions in a biofeedback loop.
