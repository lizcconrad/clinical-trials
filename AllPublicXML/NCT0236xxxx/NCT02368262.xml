    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) (Rosenbaum, 2007) gain bladder and bowel control at older
      age compared to typical developing children (Ozturk, 2006). The incidence of urinary
      incontinence during day and night, fecal incontinence and constipation is higher in this
      population.

      Incontinence in children is often treated with urotherapy. This is a nonsurgical,
      nonpharmacological treatment for lower urinary tract dysfunctions. Standard urotherapy is
      noninterventional and it includes giving information, instructions, advice regarding
      life-style, fluid intake and bladder diaries. Additionally specific interventions can be
      used, such as: various forms of pelvic floor training, behavioral modification, biofeedback,
      electrical stimulation and catheterization (Neveus, 2006). Recent research has proven
      urotherapy to be successful for the treatment of children with daytime incontinence (Mulders,
      2010).

      Despite the high prevalence of incontinence in children with CP the possible treatment
      strategies in this population are poorly investigated. Far too often, urinary incontinence in
      children with CP is considered a normal, unavoidable and even a minor problem.

      Aim: Analyze (risk) factors influencing (in)continence in children with and without CP.

      Possible parameters will be registered through questioning, measurement (uroflow combined
      with pelvic floor EMG and postmictional residue) and retrospective analysis of the patient
      files. Parameters will be compared between continent and incontinent children with and
      without CP. This comparison evaluates whether the same therapeutic strategies can be applied
      in incontinent children with and without CP.
