      The purpose of this clinical study is to observe the safety and efficacy of the multi-vector
      LV lead in Chinese patients that are indicated for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT).

      This is a multi-center, non-randomized observational study.

      The total duration of the study is expected to be 2.5 years. The clinical study will be
      conducted in no more than 15 centers in China. Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled in
      this study. Subjects will be followed up at 3, 6, 12months and every 6 months afterwards. All
      subjects need to be followed for at least 6 months.
