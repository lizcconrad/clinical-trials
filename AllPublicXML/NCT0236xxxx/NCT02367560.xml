    <textblock>
      Calcific tendinitis is a common and challenging problem in the orthopedic surgeon's office.
      The chronic and variable course of the condition can lead to dissatisfaction with
      conservative management. Current standard of care at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences
      Centre is referral for treatment by either needle decompression therapy by a radiologist or
      shockwave therapy by a physiotherapist. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      efficacies of these treatment options.

      Calcific tendinitis is a common and challenging problem in the orthopedic surgeon's office.
      The chronic and variable course of the condition can lead to dissatisfaction with
      conservative management. Current guidelines recommend conservative management initially and
      failing this, a variety of minimally invasive options exist. These include subacromial
      steroid injection (SSI), needle decompression (ND), and Shock wave therapy (SWT).

      Few trials of these methods exist, but generally a benefit is seen with all minimally
      invasive methods. Most promising results have occurred with needle decompression and
      shockwave therapy. To date, no direct trials comparing SWT and ND have been published.

      The purpose of this trial is to preliminarily establish the comparative efficacies of NDSSI
      and SWT using a number of outcome measures. Secondarily, the investigators aim to determine
      prognostic factors for success of minimally invasive therapies. The results of this study
      will serve as a foundation for more rigorous trials in this area.
