  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and effect of JNJ-54861911
      on level of amyloid-beta in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and plasma following 4 weeks of
      treatment in Japanese participants asymptomatic at risk for Alzheimer Dementia (ARAD) at the
      intended target dose range.

      This is a multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (the experimental treatment or procedure is
      compared to an inactive substance), randomized (study medication assigned by chance),
      multiple dose, Proof of Mechanism (POM) study in Japanese participants ARAD. All eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (that is, placebo,
      JNJ-54861911 10 milligram [mg] or JNJ-54861911 50 mg once daily regimen). This study will
      consist of Screening Phase (8-week), Double blind Treatment Phase (4-week), and Follow-up
      Phase (2-week). The maximum study duration for a participant will be 14 weeks. Participant's
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

          -  Participant has been diagnosed with dementia due to AD, due to other diseases, or with
