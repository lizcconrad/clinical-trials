      Efficacy Objectives:

      To determine the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as compared to placebo on:

        1. anxiety and mood as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the
           Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). For the HAM-A, total score and sub-scores
           anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia and intellectual will be utilized.

        2. quality of sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

        3. cognitive abilities as measured by the Erikson Flanker Task and computerized cognitive
           tests including Short-Term Memory Test (STM), Working Memory Test (WM), cued name recall
           task and face-name association task.

      To determine the acute effects and the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as
      compared to placebo on magnesium status as measured by the sponsor's protocol for determining
      body magnesium status.

      Safety Objective:

      To determine if supplementation with Magtein™ is safe within the confines of this study as
      denoted by changes from baseline to 12 weeks in blood work (comprehensive metabolic panel,
      uric acid and complete blood count with differential), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR),
      adverse events and subjective remarks.
