  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology and/or fine needle
      biopsy (FNB) for histology may be used in the diagnostic work-up of intrathoracic and
      intrabdominal lesion of unknown origin. Certain lesions (such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma)
      are often well characterized by cytology assessment of FNA-samples while others are not (such
      as GIST-tumors).

      This study is a part observational (early study phase) and part interventional study (late
      study phase) on the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-assisted tissue sampling by FNA or FNB during
      a 10-year period on a tertiary endoscopy centre.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variables affecting the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB in different cases and
      tumor scenarios will be studied in detail such as the influence of medical equipment used
      (i.e the different types and sizes of puncture needles), the experience of the
      endosonographers, cytopathologists and pathologists and the use of rapid on-site evaluation
      of cytology samples.

      Each study case is reviewed post-EUS (according to the schedule precised below) regarding
      further diagnostic work-up, neoadjuvant treatment, surgery result, clinical follow-up,
      (neo)adjuvant treatment, and survival. Non-parametrical tests will be applied as the main
      statistical method.

    <measure>The cellular quality of the EUS-FNA specimens (categorical variable).</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up is by time of surgery (in average 2 months after EUS-FNA)</time_frame>
    <description>Specimens are measured on a standardized 5-grade categorical scale - from 1 (=poor, non-diagnostic yield) to 5 (excellent, completely diagnostic yield). There is no specific unit measured (the variable is not a continuous one). The results from cytology assessment of EUS-derived tissue are compared to the final diagnosis, that is based on the subsequent surgery report. Results from FNA and FNB are regarded equally important. That is why both are treated as Primary Outcomes.</description>
