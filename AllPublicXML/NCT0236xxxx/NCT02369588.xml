    <textblock>
      This study tests the effect of serving larger portions of all foods in a meal on the outcome
      of food and energy intake. Using a crossover design, participants are served the meal once a
      week for four weeks and the portion sizes are varied at each meal. Some of the foods served
      at the meal are low in calorie density (calories per gram) and some are higher in calorie
      density. The aim is to determine whether intake in response to larger portions differs
      depending on characteristics of the subjects or of the foods.
