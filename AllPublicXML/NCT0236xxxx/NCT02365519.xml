  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LME636 compared to vehicle in the
      reduction of ocular symptoms and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LME636, when
      administered topically for up to 42 days, in subjects with severe dry eye disease.

      This study is organized into 2 phases. Following a 2-week identification phase, eligible
      subjects with severe dry eye disease (DED) will be randomized into the treatment phase and
      will be dispensed study treatment for 10 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Global Ocular Discomfort Score at Day 71</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Discomfort frequency and severity (each graded on a separate 100-units scale) were assessed daily using a visual analog scale (VAS) displayed on a handheld digital Pad (electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO)). Frequency score was in response to the question 'how often your eyes felt uncomfortable during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Rarely' to 'All the time.' Severity score was in response to the question 'how uncomfortable your eyes felt during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Very mildly uncomfortable' to 'Very severely uncomfortable.' The Global Ocular Discomfort Score, ranging from 0 to 100, was calculated for any given day, as the square root of the product of the discomfort frequency score multiplied by the discomfort severity score. Improvement results in a reduction of the discomfort frequency or severity, or both, translating into a reduction of the resulting Global Ocular Discomfort score as compared to baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Acuity (VA) with the subject's best spectacles or other visual corrective devices was measured using an ETDRS visual acuity chart at 3 meters (10 feet) and reported in letters read correctly. An increase (gain) in letters read indicates improvement. Both eyes contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tonopen and measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Both eyes contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Increase in Slit-Lamp Parameter From Baseline to Any Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular signs (cornea, lens, and iris/anterior chamber) were assessed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. An increase indicates worsening. Only one eye contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Increase in Dilated Fundus Parameter From Baseline to Any Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>The dilated fundus examination was performed to evaluate the health of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid, and optic nerve. An increase indicates worsening. Only one eye contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With More Than 20 Units Improvement in Global Ocular Discomfort Score From Baseline at Day 71</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 43), Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>Discomfort frequency and severity (each graded on a separate 100-units scale) were assessed daily using a VAS displayed on a handheld ePRO. Frequency score was in response to the question 'how often your eyes felt uncomfortable during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Rarely' to 'All the time.' Severity score was in response to the question 'how uncomfortable your eyes felt during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Very mildly uncomfortable' to 'Very severely uncomfortable.' The Global Ocular Discomfort Score, ranging from 0 to 100, was calculated for any given day, as the square root of the product of the discomfort frequency score multiplied by the discomfort severity score. Improvement results in a reduction of the discomfort frequency or severity, or both, translating into a reduction of the resulting Global Ocular Discomfort score as compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With LME636 Serum Concentrations Below the Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Serum concentrations at each collection time point were quantitated, where possible, using a validated immunoassay method. LLOQ is defined as 0.25 ng/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Anti-LME636 Antibodies by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Samples were collected and assessed for anti-LME636 antibodies.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Global Ocular Discomfort Score at Day 71</title>
        <description>Discomfort frequency and severity (each graded on a separate 100-units scale) were assessed daily using a visual analog scale (VAS) displayed on a handheld digital Pad (electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO)). Frequency score was in response to the question 'how often your eyes felt uncomfortable during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Rarely' to 'All the time.' Severity score was in response to the question 'how uncomfortable your eyes felt during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Very mildly uncomfortable' to 'Very severely uncomfortable.' The Global Ocular Discomfort Score, ranging from 0 to 100, was calculated for any given day, as the square root of the product of the discomfort frequency score multiplied by the discomfort severity score. Improvement results in a reduction of the discomfort frequency or severity, or both, translating into a reduction of the resulting Global Ocular Discomfort score as compared to baseline. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With More Than 20 Units Improvement in Global Ocular Discomfort Score From Baseline at Day 71</title>
        <description>Discomfort frequency and severity (each graded on a separate 100-units scale) were assessed daily using a VAS displayed on a handheld ePRO. Frequency score was in response to the question 'how often your eyes felt uncomfortable during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Rarely' to 'All the time.' Severity score was in response to the question 'how uncomfortable your eyes felt during the past 24 hours' ranging from 'Very mildly uncomfortable' to 'Very severely uncomfortable.' The Global Ocular Discomfort Score, ranging from 0 to 100, was calculated for any given day, as the square root of the product of the discomfort frequency score multiplied by the discomfort severity score. Improvement results in a reduction of the discomfort frequency or severity, or both, translating into a reduction of the resulting Global Ocular Discomfort score as compared to baseline.</description>
