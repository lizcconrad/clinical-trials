      This study is aimed at assessing the safety of candidate Hepatitis C vaccines
      AdCh3NSmut/MVA-NSmut and HIV vaccines ChAdV63.HIVconsv/MVA.HIVconsv when administered
      separately or in combination to healthy volunteers. The study also aims to assess the
      cellular immune response generated by these vaccines when administered as mentioned above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C and HIV are both widespread pathogens. By the end of 2010, there were 2.3 million
      people in Europe living with HIV, over half of whom were coinfected with the Hepatitis C
      virus (HCV). Although vaccination is the optimal method of preventing infection, it has
      proved extremely difficult to develop an effective vaccine against HIV and HCV due to the
      enormous variation in strains around the world. This is caused by the extraordinary ability
      of the viruses to change their genetic material.

      Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed novel candidate vaccines against HIV
      ('HIV.consv') and HCV ('NSmut'). These vaccines have been inserted into the carrier viruses
      Chimpanzee Adenovirus (ChAd or AdCh) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both of which
      have excellent safety records. The aim of this study is to test for the first time the
      response of the immune system when vaccines to both HIV and HCV are given together.

      During this study, 32 healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years will be recruited into one of three
      groups to receive either two or four intramuscular injections over a period of two months.
      All participants will be followed up for a further six months (12 visits in total).

    <description>Immunogenicity determined by analysing changes from baseline in the magnitude or quality of HCV and HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses. These will be detected using several standardised assays. The primary outcome measure for immunogenicity will be the development of T cell responses to HCV and HIV-1 epitopes, as determined by IFN-É£ ELISpot assay. In addition, several exploratory immunology assays (including but not limited to intracellular cytokine staining, phenotype, viral suppression in vitro) will be developed and used.</description>
