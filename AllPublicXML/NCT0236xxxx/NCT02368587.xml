      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary or
      intravenous infusion human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (WJMSC) in
      patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy secondary to myocardial infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart failure (IHF) secondary to myocardial infarction is a common, lethal,
      disabling, and expensive condition. Despite advances over the last 30 years, the prognosis of
      patients with IHF remains poor. At present, there has been increasing interest in attempting
      to repair the failing heart with the use of stem cells, since this approach has the potential
      to regenerate dead myocardium and thus alleviate the underlying cause of IHF.

      A very primitive population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been isolated from a
      continuum from the sub-amnion to perivascular region of umbilical cord, referred to as
      Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). WJMSCs retain a combination of most of their embryonic
      stem cell (ESC) and MSC markers in primary culture and early passages, thus retaining their
      multipotent stem cell characteristics. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that WJMSCs can
      be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and to integrate into
      the vasculature and ischemic cardiac tissue, as well as to improve heart function
      significantly. Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with ischemic heart failure secondary to myocardial
      infarction to receive an intracoronary or intravenous infusion of WJMSCs or placebo, to
      investigate the therapeutic safety and efficacy of WJMSCs in patients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>the incidence of adverse events (AEs) within 12 months, including death, nonfatal MI, stroke, hospitalization for worsening heart function, severe arrhythmias, repeated coronary intervention, stent thrombosis, coronary artery microvascular obstruction, immune system disorders, or ectopic tissue formation, was monitored and quantified. Laboratory assays, including biochemical assays, hematologic, tumor and immune indexes and Holter monitoring, were performed at the different follow-up times at 1 months-1 year. The trial will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the trial will be discontinued in case of safety concerns.</description>

    <measure>The secondary end point was efficacy in absolute change of the global LV ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 12 months by MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary end point was efficacy, which was assessed in terms of the absolute change in the global LV ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 12 months post-treatment, as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). Furthermore, CMRI assessments measured scar mass and viable myocardial mass in the left ventricle, scar size, cardiac volumes, global function, regional function, and 6-min walk tests in all patients from baseline to 12 months post-treatment.</description>
