      Sepsis therapy is a prominent problem of the modern critical care medicine,and improving the
      level of sepsis treatment by immune intervention measures is a hot research topic with close
      attention.Gamma delta T cells is considered as one new T lymphocyte subset in recent
      years,which playing an important role in resistance to infection,anti-tumor and immune
      regulating function in the body.First,we played attention to the status and function of gamma
      delta T cells in peripheral blood of sepsis patients including differentiation marker,subtype
      and production of related cytokine,and then the molecular mechanism of insufficient gamma
      delta T cells.At the same time the responsibility of gamma delta T cells of sepsis patients
      to certain bacteria and viral antigen and the regulation of gamma delta T cells on other
      natural immune cells including NK cells and mononuclear cells were studied to identify the
      status and role gamma delta T cells in sepsis immunosuppression by culture in vitro.Further
      we studied the effect of specific stimulants on proliferation and activation of gamma delta T
      cells in patients with sepsis and also anti-infection acquired by gamma delta T
      cells,expecting as an entry point to explore new treatment strategy to sepsis.
