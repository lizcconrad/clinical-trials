  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas are extremely resistant to treatment, including radiotherapy and/or
      chemotherapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key signaling pathways
      involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation, survival and differentiation.
      Activation of p38 MAPK has been associated with a poor prognosis among patients with
      glioblastoma during the temozolomide (TMZ) era and represents a compensatory response by
      tumor cell to environmental stress such as radiation or chemotherapy.

      LY2228820 is a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and reduces phosphorylation of its
      cellular target, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2) . LY2228820 is a good candidate
      to target malignant glioma resistance to the gold standard treatment combining radiation and
      TMZ by acting on both tumor and stromal cells.

      The primary objectives of this study were to determine the recommended dose of LY2228820 in
      combination with TMZ and radiotherapy during chemoradiotherapy period (phase I) and to
      estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients treated with LY2228820
      when administered at the recommended dose in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant
      TMZ (phase II)

    <description>addition of LY2228820 to standard radiotherapy and concomitant treatment by temozolomide (TMZ).
LY2228820 will be administered orally for two 28 day cycles, from one week before the beginning of radiotherapy, and during standard chemoradiotherapy. Three dose levels of LY2228820 will be tested.
After a 4 week break after concomitant treatment, patient were then received up to 6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule every 28 days .</description>
