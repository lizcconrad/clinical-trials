  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain observational data allowing for the preliminary
      assessment of the utility of a noninvasive physiologic monitor for monitoring of patients
      with congestive heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes to utilize the CoVa™ Monitoring System, a novel body-worn sensor that
      remotely monitors thoracic fluid, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, skin
      temperature, posture, and, using transmitted waveforms, stroke volume and cardiac output to
      evaluate the system's monitoring capabilities in individuals recently hospitalized for
      congestive heart failure. The data acquired through this study will play a critical roll in
      developing future interventional studies that will allow patients with HF to potentially
      receive better and more timely treatment in the home setting, decreasing hospitalizations and
      improving quality of life.

    <description>To track on a daily basis important physiologic parameters among patients with a primary diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) beginning at the time of their hospitalization and then continued for up to 60 days after discharge, in order to better understand their inter- and intra- individual variability and compare this to standard monitoring including daily weights.
To explore the development of predictive algorithms to allow for the early identification of patients at risk of acute decompensation and/or HF hospitalization.</description>
