  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of sublobar resection(Wedge resection or anatomic segmentectomy) for small(≤ 2cm)
      early stage non-small cell lung cancer has been studied by Lung Cancer Study Group and is
      being studied by several ongoing trials. However, elderly patients(aged ≥70 years) in these
      trials is under-represented, as in most of the ongoing clinical trials. This study focuses on
      the elderly population of early stage lung cancer, and aims to investigate the outcome of
      lobectomy versus sublobar resection for peripheral stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      in elderly patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial is to the best of our knowledge the first one designed to compare
      sublobar resection and lobectomy for elderly patients, in order to address these open
      questions:In patients aged 70 years or older and with clinical stage T1N0M0 NSCLC, (1)
      whether sublobar resection can achieve similar disease-free survival compared to lobectomy,
      (2) whether sublobar resection can reduce the postoperative mortality and morbidity,(3)
      whether sublobar resection can reserve better pulmonary function and quality of life for
      elderly patients of NSCLC?
