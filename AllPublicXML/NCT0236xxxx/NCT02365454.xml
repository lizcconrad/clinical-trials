      sponsored by Endospan Ltd. Patients will be followed-up for five years.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Nexus™ Aortic Arch
      Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies requiring
      landing in the Aortic Arch (zone 0, zone 1, zone 2).

      The Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System is indicated for the endovascular treatment of
      thoracic aortic pathologies involving the aortic arch (such as aneurisms and dissections).
      The Nexus™ is intended to exclude the lesion from the blood circulation in patients diagnosed
      with thoracic aortic pathology and who have appropriate anatomy to accommodate the Nexus™
      system in an endovascular procedure.

      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of the Nexus™
      Aortic Arch Aneurysm Stent Graft System.

    <description>The Nexus stent graft is introduced through a groin to the diseased location at the Aortic Arch. Depending on the patients anatomy and other medical considerations the physician may decide that blood flow to the sub-clavian artery and possibly also to the left carotid artery is required to be maintained via &quot;surgical bypass grafting&quot;, either immediately, or a few days, before the implantation. In addition to the incision for introducing the investigational stent graft, two smaller access sites are required, one at the groin on the opposite side and on into the Right Arm to the Brachial Artery.
This endovascular procedure will likely require full anesthesia. The entire procedure is assisted by an angiography imaging system.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female age ≥ 18.

          -  Any Thoracic Aorta pathology requiring landing in the Aortic Arch (zone 0, zone 1,
             zone2), e.g. aneurysm, dissection, false/Pseudo aneurysm.

          -  In patient with a thoracic aneurysm: dilatation of the aortic arch larger than 5.5cm
             in diameter, or symptomatic aneurysm of the aortic arch, or aortic diameter growth
             rate &gt; 5mm per 6 months

          -  Patient is considered an appropriate candidate for an elective surgery, as evaluated
             by Physical Status Classification System I, II or III (American Society of
             Anesthesiologists).

          -  Femoral artery diameter as documented by CTA or MRA that allows endovascular access to
             the diseased site with a 20-22Fr delivery catheter.

          -  Access vessels morphology suitable for endovascular repair in terms of tortuosity,
             calcification and angulation, documented by CTA, MRA.

          -  Access vessel (femoral/iliac) diameter &gt; 7 mm

          -  Ascending Aorta landing zone length &gt; 30 mm

          -  Brachial/Axial Artery diameter &gt; 3 mm

          -  Patient understands and is voluntarily willing to participate as evidenced by
             personally signing the Informed Consent document, and willingness to comply with
             follow-up schedule

             or previous failed puncture)

          -  Patients with severe atherosclerosis or intraluminal thrombus of the aorta or in the

          -  Patient has history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that may limit the use of

          -  Patient has an active systemic infection at the time of the procedure documented by
