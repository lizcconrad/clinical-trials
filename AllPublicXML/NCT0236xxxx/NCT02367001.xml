  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to evaluate, in France, the effectiveness (in terms of participation) of the
      general practitioner involvement (signature) and a more personalized communication in
      invitation letters to organized screening of breast, colorectal and cervical cancers.

      The hypothesis on which this project is based is that communication is probably more
      effective if the &quot;receiver&quot; feels personally targeted by invitation letters (Dear Martin, I
      am writing ...) and if he knows &quot;the issuer &quot;(his general practitioner rather an unknown
      person).

    <time_frame>9 or 12 months after the invitation letters</time_frame>
    <description>The participation / non participation will be measured for each cancer screening (breast, colorectal and cervical) :
9 months after the invitation letters for breast and colorectal cancers
12 months after the invitation letters for cervical cancer
The participation rate is defined as the number of people having participated, divided by the total number of people in the group or subgroup considered.
Analysis by comparing the participation rates between groups (Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3) and sub-groups will be done.</description>
