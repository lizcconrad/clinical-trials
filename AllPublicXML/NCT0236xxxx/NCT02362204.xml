  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients experience significant physical symptoms, psychological distress and
      have many supportive care needs that impact on quality of life. Implementing the role of a
      Lung Cancer Nurse (LCN) is a response to meet the needs of patients and caregivers.

      Primary aim is to assess the feasibility of a LCN intervention and feasibility to collect
      longitudinal patient self-assessment questionnaires at the Thoracic Cancer Centre of the
      University Hospital of Lausanne.

      Secondary aims are: i) to describe self-reported changes in self-efficacy, symptoms and unmet
      supportive care needs across three time points during the first line therapy and ii) to
      explore professional acceptability of the new LCN model evaluating the perceptions of
      barriers and facilitators of the model by the LCN and the other multidisciplinary members of
      the comprehensive lung cancer care team.

      An exact single-stage (no interim analysis) design will be applied to determine feasibility
      for further studies to be undertaken. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed descriptively at
      each data collection (Baseline, Time1, Time2) time point and professional acceptability will
      be explored by focus groups with selected members of the interdisciplinary team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To develop adequate self-care strategies, patients with lung cancer and their families are in
      need of emotional, informational and behavioural supportive care. Supportive care in cancer
      can reduce symptom burden and improve patients and their families self-management skills. As
      lung cancer incidence continues to rise, and increased attention is given to early diagnosis,
      research on early involvement of lung cancer nurse (LCN) in care, the feasibility and impact
      on patient outcomes is needed.

      Primary aim is to assess the feasibility of a LCN intervention and feasibility to collect
      longitudinal (Baseline, Time1, Time2) patient self-assessment questionnaires at the Thoracic
      Cancer Centre of the University Hospital of Lausanne.

      Secondary aims are: i) to describe self-reported changes in self-efficacy, symptoms and unmet
      supportive care needs across three time points during the first line therapy and ii) to
      explore professional acceptability of the new LCN model evaluating the perceptions of
      barriers and facilitators of the model by the LCN and the other multidisciplinary members of
      the comprehensive lung cancer care team.

      An exact single-stage (no interim analysis) design will be applied to determine feasibility
      for further studies to be undertaken. Lung cancer patients with planned systemic therapy with
      or without radiotherapy will be recruited at the thoracic cancer center in a Swiss University
      Hospital. The LCN model of care consists of two face-to-face consultations alternating with
      two telephone consultations during systemic therapy. LCN consultations will comprise focused
      assessment of physical and psychological symptoms, information (printed and oral) about
      disease and its treatment, therapeutic education concerning strategies to manage physical and
      psychosocial symptoms and review of available support resources. Participants will be invited
      to complete the validated patient reported Lung Cancer Symptom Scale, Supportive Care Needs
      Screening Tool 9 and Self-Efficacy Scale for Lung Cancer. Study data will be collected at
      baseline (day 1 of systemic therapy), time 1 (week 3 of systemic therapy) and time 2 (week 11
      of systemic therapy). Participants will be categorized as adherent if they complete all their
      scheduled LCN consultations and questionnaires. For a 5% probability of accepting a poor
      feasibility (alpha) and a 20% probability of rejecting an acceptable feasibility (beta) we
      then need to enroll 71 patients. Feasibility will be considered as acceptable for further
      studies if at least 36 patients will be compliant. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed
      descriptively for each variable (self-efficacy, symptoms and supportive care needs) across
      each time point. At the end of quantitative data collection, a focus group will be conducted
      to explore acceptability of the new role among health professionals working with the LCN in
      order to identify perceived barriers and facilitators for collaborative work with the new
      role.

    <measure>Lung cancer symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 3- Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms will be measured by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale .This inventory consists of 9 items relating to appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain related to lung malignancies and three summary items on symptom distress, interference with activity level, and global health-related quality of life. Each item is scored on a visual scale 0-100 (0=no symptom; 100 symptom as bad as can be).</description>

    <measure>Unmet Supportive Care Need</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 3- Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Unmet Supportive Care Needs will be measured by the the Supportive Care Needs Survey Screening Tool 9 (SCNS ST 9). The 9 items of the scale fall into five analytically derived factor domains: i) psychological, ii) health system and information, iii) physical and daily living, iv) patient care and support, and v) sexuality. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (not applicable=1; satisfied=2; low need=3; moderate need=4; High need=5).</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 3- Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured by the Self-Efficacy Scale for lung cancer. This scale is composed by 16 items regarding patients' perceived ability to manage a variety of symptoms on a scale of 10 (not at all certain) to 100 (completely certain). The instrument includes three subscale concerning: i) self-efficacy for managing pain, ii) self-efficacy for managing other symptoms, and iii) self-efficacy for functions.</description>
