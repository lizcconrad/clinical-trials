  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if translocator protein total distribution volume
      (TSPO VT) is elevated in major depressive disorder that is not responding to medication and
      if adding minocycline can affect TSPO VT. Many remain treatment resistant with common
      antidepressant treatments and the investigators think it may be due to poor targeting of
      brain pathologies.

      There will be three Phases in the study. Only MDE subjects will be invited to continue to
      Phase 2 and 3. Subjects will be invited to continue to the subsequent Phase given they meet
      entry criteria described below:

      Phase 1: The investigators will evaluate whether TSPO is elevated in individuals during a
      current MDE compared to healthy controls. Eligible participants will receive one [18F]FEPPA
      PET scan and one MRI scan. Other measures will include urine sample, blood samples for
      genetic and peripheral biomarker analysis, a neurocognitive battery, mood scales and
      questionnaires.

      Phase 2: Participants who have elevated TSPO VT in Phase 1 and are agreeable to receiving
      minocycline will be invited to participate in Phase 2. Based on our previous results
      participants will be considered candidates for Phase 2 if TSPO VT ≥ 10.5 (HAB) or ≥8.5 (MAB)
      in any of the primary regions of interest (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex or
      insula). Eligible participants will be invited to participate in a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled trial, to receive either minocycline or placebo. After the eight weeks of
      treatment, participants will receive one [18F]FEPPA PET scan. Other measures will include
      urine samples, blood samples, mood scales and questionnaires.

      Phase 3: If, after the initial eight week treatment period with either minocycline or
      placebo, any participant continues to have depressive symptoms (17-item Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale score ≥ 8) they will be invited to participate in an eight week open label trial
      of celecoxib. Participants not eligible for Phase 2 may also be invited to participate in
      Phase 3 directly from Phase 1.

The genetic sample will also be used to study sequences of genes that are believed to affect TSPO expression, inflammation, mood and conditions that may predispose to mood disorders.</description>
