      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial current stimulation as a treatment for
      auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's primary objective is to conduct a pilot clinical trial to establish the
      feasibility and to collect first effectiveness data for the use of transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) to re-normalize pathological alpha oscillations in dorso-lateral
      prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC) of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder by
      comparing Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) scores immediately before the first
      stimulation session and immediately after the last stimulation session. As a secondary
      objective the investigators will assess the differential clinical effects of sham, 10 Hz and
      2 mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of
      alpha oscillations.

    <measure>Proportional Change From Baseline in Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five days post baseline, 2 weeks post baseline, 5 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) measures the severity of auditory hallucinations in the past week. The scale assesses frequency, duration, location, loudness, belief of origin of voices, negative content, distress, disruption to life, and control over voices. All items are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, with a total possible score of 44. Higher scores indicate higher severity of auditory hallucinations. The investigators will compare the AHRS scores from immediately before the first stimulation and immediately after the last stimulation session as the investigator's primary outcomes measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alpha Oscillations Measured With Electroencephalogram (EEG) Resting State From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five days post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at the one week and one month follow up visits. The investigators will use each of the four EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, five days post baseline, five weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the PANSS total scores immediately before first stimulation session and immediately after last stimulation session as secondary outcome measures. Scores range from 30 to 210, with higher scores indicating more severe symptomology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, five days post baseline, five weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) is a battery of cognitive assessments assessing verbal memory and learning, working memory, motor function, verbal fluency, speed of processing, and executive function. Higher scores indicate better cognitive performance. The investigators will compare the BACS total scores immediately before first stimulation session and immediately after last stimulation session as secondary outcome measures.
Verbal Memory: Score out of 75
Digit Sequencing: Score out of 28
Token Motor: Score out of 100
Fluency: No score limit
Symbol Coding: Score out of 110
Tower of London: Score out of 22
Reported score is the mean of these 6 subtests. Healthy controls (Keefe et al., 2006) scored 45.6 as a comparison.</description>

    <measure>Change in Peak Frequency of Functional Connectivity From Baseline Measured With Electroencephalogram (EEG) Resting State</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five days post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare peak frequency of functional connectivity from resting state EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at the one week and one month follow up visits. The investigators will use each of the four EEG recordings as data to analyze the change in peak frequency of functional connectivity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Electroencephalogram (EEG) Auditory Tasks: Oddball Task From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, five days post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare auditory responses during auditory tasks EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at the one week and one month follow up visits. The investigators will use each of the four EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers and look for increase in auditory responses.
Auditory oddball paradigm is an experimental design that has standard (low-pitch) and deviant (high-pitch) stimuli. Differences in ERP from these two stimuli can measure functions of sensory processing. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit abnormal responses to the stimuli thus its discrepancy compared to healthy human participants can be a hallmark of symptoms in schizophrenia.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Electroencephalogram (EEG) Auditory Tasks: Click Train Task From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, five days post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare auditory responses during auditory tasks EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect this data at the one week and one month follow up visits.
Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) from EEG data elicited by auditory click trains is considered as a hallmark of network dysfunction in schizophrenia. To obtain ASSR, auditory tones at a specific frequency (e.g., 40Hz) are presented for multiple trials and EEG data is analyzed to extract brain responses to the stimuli.
One common way to extract the brain responses from this task is phase coherence between trials. When external stimuli (click trains) occur, brain signals are synchronized to these stimuli and its coherence should be the highest at the stimulation frequency. Phase information for calculating the coherence can be obtained by time-frequency analysis. Averaged coherence across the multiple trials can represent the inter-trial phase coherence.</description>

          <description>The Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) measures the severity of auditory hallucinations in the past week. The scale assesses frequency, duration, location, loudness, belief of origin of voices, negative content, distress, disruption to life, and control over voices. All items are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, with a total possible score of 44. Higher scores indicate higher severity of auditory hallucinations.</description>

        <description>The investigators will compare auditory responses during auditory tasks EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect EEG recordings data at the one week and one month follow up visits. The investigators will use each of the four EEG recordings as data to analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers and look for increase in auditory responses.
Auditory oddball paradigm is an experimental design that has standard (low-pitch) and deviant (high-pitch) stimuli. Differences in ERP from these two stimuli can measure functions of sensory processing. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit abnormal responses to the stimuli thus its discrepancy compared to healthy human participants can be a hallmark of symptoms in schizophrenia.</description>

        <description>The investigators will compare auditory responses during auditory tasks EEG recordings on the first and last day of stimulation. The investigators will also collect this data at the one week and one month follow up visits.
Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) from EEG data elicited by auditory click trains is considered as a hallmark of network dysfunction in schizophrenia. To obtain ASSR, auditory tones at a specific frequency (e.g., 40Hz) are presented for multiple trials and EEG data is analyzed to extract brain responses to the stimuli.
One common way to extract the brain responses from this task is phase coherence between trials. When external stimuli (click trains) occur, brain signals are synchronized to these stimuli and its coherence should be the highest at the stimulation frequency. Phase information for calculating the coherence can be obtained by time-frequency analysis. Averaged coherence across the multiple trials can represent the inter-trial phase coherence.</description>
