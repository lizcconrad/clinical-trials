  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on the effect of minimally invasive spine
      tumor decompression on treated patients. This treatment option is less invasive that the
      standard surgical decompression and is expected to result in better wound healing, decreased
      tissue trauma, and decreased pain after surgery.

      This is a prospective study designed to analyze the impact that minimally invasive spine
      tumor decompression has upon quality of life, neurological morbidity, pain, and mortality.
      Prospective findings will be compared with historical controls to determine whether the
      minimally invasive approach offers better outcomes than traditional treatment methods.
