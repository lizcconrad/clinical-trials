  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine
      for treatment of pediatric pneumonia. It is a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The block randomization is used in this trial. Random numbers are generated by statistical
      analysis system(SAS) software. Statistical analysis staff and those who perform the follow-up
      are blinded. Sample size calculation was performed, which was 1164 , and considering drop-out
      or withdrawal, investigators plan to enroll 1500 patients (500 in experimental group 1, 500
      in experimental group 2, 500 in experimental group 3).
