    <description>Dose-escalation phase:
Approximately 30 subjects will participate in the dose-escalation phase The total number of subjects will depend on the number of cohorts necessary to identify the MTD.
MTD expansion phase:
Once the MTD has been determined, two expansion cohorts in FGFR2 expressing indications are planned:
Cohort 1: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This cohort will enroll 80 subjects (N=40 with low to moderate FGFR2 expression and N=40 with high FGFR2 expression) Cohort 2: Other indications expressing FGFR2. This cohort 40 subjects will be enrolled.</description>

    <description>A dose of 0.1 mg BAY 1187982 per kilogram (kg) body weight (BW) was chosen as the starting dose based on toxicology data. The investigational drug will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once every 21 days at the trial site (Day 1 of each 21-day Cycle). The maximum possible dose escalation will be 2-fold and not more than 0.5 mg/kg BW until maximum tolerated dose is selected</description>
