    <textblock>
      Chronic idiopathic constipation is most common cause of Constipation in childhood with
      numerous cases in Egypt. Numerous conservative measures were tried but many fail. Surgical
      options include Longitudinal Myectomy of the muscle or injection of Botulinum toxin.
      Objectives: Comparative study between Botulinum toxin injection and Myectomy in treatment of
      Idiopathic Constipation

    <textblock>
      Functional constipation (chronic idiopathic constipation) is most common cause of
      constipation in pediatric age group. Many cases try conservative treatment but fail to
      respond. These cases are treated by surgical longitudinal myectomy of the anal sphincter.
      Now, there have been many trials of trying injection of botulinum toxin to relax the
      sphincter as a treatment of functional/idiopathic constipation.

      In this study, the investigators will compare the results of botulinum toxin injection versus
      surgical myectomy to treat functional/idiopathic constipation in children.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rome III Diagnostic criteria for chronic idiopathic constipation include two or more of the following in a child with a developmental age of at least 4 years:
Two or fewer defecations in the toilet per week
At least one episode of fecal incontinence per week
History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention
History of painful or hard bowel movements
Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum
History of large diameter stools which may obstruct the toilet
Outcome measure for Curing Chronic idiopathic constipation is denoted by absence of insufficient criteria (0-1 criterion) to diagnose Chronic idiopathic constipation after receiving corresponding arm of the study.</description>

    <description>Rome III Diagnostic criteria for chronic idiopathic constipation include two or more of the following in a child with a developmental age of at least 4 years:
Two or fewer defecations in the toilet per week
At least one episode of fecal incontinence per week
History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention
History of painful or hard bowel movements
Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum
History of large diameter stools which may obstruct the toilet
Outcome measure for improving Chronic idiopathic constipation is denoted by giving each case a 6-point score system based on Chronic idiopathic constipation diagnostic criteria. Improvement is denoted by decrease in diagnostic criteria score after receiving corresponding arm of the study. The decrease is assessed, analyzed and compared between the two groups.</description>
