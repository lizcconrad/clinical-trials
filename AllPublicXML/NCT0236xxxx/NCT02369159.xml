  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of a single dose of
      IV peramivir compared to a standard 5 day course of oral oseltamivir in the treatment of
      pediatric subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza. Two thirds of the participants will
      receive peramivir, while one third will receive oseltamivir.
