      Level I randomized prospective outcomes study comparing two groups of patients. One group
      will receive Dilaudid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. The other will
      receive an ultrasound guided paravertebral block with indwelling paravertebral catheter with
      an infusion of 0.2% Ropivicaine post-operatively and a PCA.

      Design: Level I randomized prospective outcomes study comparing two groups of patients. One
      group will receive Dilaudid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. The other
      will receive an ultrasound guided paravertebral block with indwelling paravertebral catheter
      with an infusion of 0.2% Ropivicaine post-operatively and a PCA.

      Sample Size: 50 patients Study Duration: Approximately 24 months Population:. Patients
      presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center for elective Video Assisted
      Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS), for thoracic, lung, or mediastinal lesions or masses.

      Primary Objective: To determine if post-operative paravertebral catheters in patients with
      elective VATS procedures result in decreased pain compared to patients treated with PCA for
      post-operative pain.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine whether the use of paravertebral catheters impacts the length of ICU and
           hospital stay for patients, compared to a PCA in patients undergoing elective Video
           Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS).

        2. To determine whether the use of paravertebral catheters leads to lower risk of
           complications, compared to use of a PCA in patients undergoing elective Video Assisted
           Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS).

      2. Synopsis and Medical Application:

      Specific Aims:

      Primary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in improved pain control relative to
      PCA for post-operative pain from thoracic surgery.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Paravertebral catheters will result in fewer hospital days and improved
      subjective respiratory function compared to patients in the PCA group.
