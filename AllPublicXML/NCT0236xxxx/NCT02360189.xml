      Aim: To identify psychological and socioeconomic predictors of cardiac-rehabilitation (CR)
      attendance and uncover mechanisms of CR non-attendance.

      Design: Quantitative, observational, prospective study. Hypothesis a: Educational-level,
      comorbidity, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, cohabitation and distance from residence are
      predictors of CR attendance.

      Hypothesis b: The expected social gradient in CR attendance is explained partly by
      differential exposure of comorbidity, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, cohabitation and
      distance to the rehabilitation clinic.
