  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentral clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Receptor Ⅱ IgG Fc fusion protein
      injection (Yisaipu®) in the treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis(SpA). The primary
      purpose is to assess the different maintaining treatment programme in SpA patients with
      controlled inflammation by Yisaipu®. And the second purpose is to assess the eficacy and
      safety of Yisaipu® in axial SpAs. The trial will include 180 patients with stable NSAIDs
      therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the
      second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS&lt;2.1) at 24th week will
      be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu®
      group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 24 weeks. Patients who complete
      the 48-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the
      study.
