  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project expands upon the proof-of-concept work done under the pilot project in order to
      get Interventionaire© poised for more widespread use. Interventionaire© is designed to deploy
      a computerized interactive questionnaire to patients in a physician waiting room. The
      information gathered is intended to be a conversation starter for primary care providers and
      patients (who may feel more at ease with the computer in revealing health risk behaviors,
      like alcohol abuse). Widespread use of Interventionaire© could result in a substantial cost
      savings by delivering a wide reaching and highly acceptable prevention strategy for
      integrating risky health behavior screening and brief intervention into mainstream medical
      practice.The investigators overall hypothesis is that participants receiving the computerized
      intervention will have greater improvement than those receiving the attention control
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse continues to pose a major burden for public health. Screening and brief
      intervention for alcohol misuse in primary care settings has been recommended for decades,
      and the evidence base supporting it in primary care is robust. However, many primary care
      providers do not intervene in alcohol misuse, and those that do often fail to do so
      systematically or in accordance with best-evidence standards. Computerization of screening
      and brief intervention for alcohol misuse holds the promise of alleviating many of the
      barriers that have prevented its adoption into routine care, and also offers new
      opportunities for optimizing the effectiveness of brief interventions. This Phase 2 Small
      Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project follows up on Research Circle Associates' (RCA)
      successful proof-of-concept work done under Phase 1, which led to the development of a
      versatile software platform (Interventionaire©) to support computerized alcohol misuse
      screening and brief intervention using evidence based strategies including motivational
      interviewing and normative feedback. The investigators' computerized alcohol misuse
      intervention includes a normative feedback component that is unique in its micro-targeting of
      alcohol use feedback based on participant demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity,
      gender, and age), drawing population normative data from the National Surveys on Drug Use and
      Health. This represents a novel use of epidemiological data to inform clinical services. The
      Phase 2 project is designed to answer a number of important research questions and prepare
      the product for successful commercialization. Specifically, during Phase 2 the investigators
      intend to implement several refinements into the Interventionaire© platform that will
      increase its usability and streamline the creation of complex content with tailored feedback.
      The investigators will also upgrade the software to make it compatible with a major
      electronic health record system used by the investigators' clinical partner site. This will
      increase the reach of the product and ensure maximum readiness for deployment into the modern
      healthcare marketplace, a dynamic and rapidly evolving industry. The investigators will also
      conduct a study at the investigators' clinical partner site using qualitative key informant,
      focus group, and survey methodologies to investigate barriers to adopting computerized
      alcohol screening and brief intervention systems. A critical question is whether the
      computerized alcohol misuse intervention is effective in changing drinking behavior. To
      answer this question, the investigators will conduct a cross-over randomized controlled trial
      examining the short-term impact of the computerized alcohol misuse intervention with
      micro-targeted normative feedback and motivational messaging compared to an
      &quot;attention-control&quot; (placebo) generic health promotion message. This trial will help to
      establish the short-term efficacy of the intervention and set the stage for larger trials and
      adoption of the product in healthcare settings. Finally, the investigators will conduct a
      projection analysis of the economic and health impacts of the intervention under a variety of
      assumptions regarding intervention effect size, target population, and product penetration.
      Satisfying these Phase 2 objectives will leave RCA well-poised to deploy the product
      commercially, which will leverage the power of the market to improve clinical service
      delivery and promote public health.

    <measure>Change in drinking behavior as measured by self-reported alcohol use after completing the computerized alcohol misuse intervention (CAMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 and Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>At one month, the investigators expect the attention control group (A) to reduce their alcohol use somewhat, but the intervention group (B) is expected to show a much steeper reduction. Thus, the investigators first planned contrast tests A vs. B, and can be considered similar to a parallel group trial examining 1-month outcomes for intervention vs. attention control. After the cross-over at 1 month, the magnitude of the reduction from Month 1 to Month 2 for those receiving the intervention (C) is expected to be similar to that experienced by those who received the intervention initially.</description>

    <description>It is expected that the effect of CAMI will be carried by changes in motivation and changes in perceived norms.The investigators will use advanced modern mediation analysis techniques to investigate the mechanisms that may drive reductions in drinking.</description>

    <description>Arm 1 is a cross-over randomized controlled trial (XRCT) comparing the short-term effects of the computerized alcohol misuse intervention (CAMI) vs. a generic health education attention-control (AC) condition in reducing past 30 day: (a) days of alcohol use, (b) days of heavy episodic drinking, (c) typical number of drinks consumed on a day of drinking, and (d) alcohol use in dangerous situations; (2) investigate changes in (a) patient motivation and (b) perceived norms as mediators of intervention effectiveness.</description>

    <description>Arm 2 is not an active intervention but an attention control condition - it is not expected to exert any real intervention effect. Hence, any observed effects for the AC condition can be attributed to natural change via regression-to-the-mean, assessment reactivity, or a placebo effect. The effect size estimate of the intervention, both from an efficacy standpoint (i.e., above and beyond what change would have normally occurred) and an effectiveness standpoint (i.e., the magnitude of behavior change that can be expected in real-world implementation), can be readily calculated.</description>

    <description>These products are designed for entertainment and educational purposes only. No medical claims are made for them and, the participant's interaction with them should be conceptually unrelated to alcohol use behavior.In order to avoid any carryover effect from comparing two active treatments, we have chosen to use a simple attention control condition that is not expected to exert any real intervention effect. In that way, the effect size estimate of the intervention can be readily calculated. No research data will be collected as part of the AC, beyond the amount of time spent on the program.</description>
