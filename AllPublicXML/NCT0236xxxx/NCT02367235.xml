    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficiency of the Colpassist (Boston
      Scientific, Natick, MA) vaginal positioning device used during robotic-assisted
      sacrocolpopexy. Traditionally, vaginal positioning during robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy is
      done using a device that was not designed specifically for sacrocolpopexy, commonly a
      vaginally placed endo anal sizer. It is possible the Colpassist device will result in shorter
      operative times because Colpassist is flat which makes it easier to sew against. Also, the
      width of the device is designed to be similar to the width of the vagina which should improve
      visibility during surgery.

      Enrolled patients will be randomized to undergo their planned robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy
      using either a vaginally placed endo anal sizer or a vaginally placed Colpassist vaginal
      positioning device. Both surgeon and patient will be blinded to which device was used at the
      time of surgery. Length of time to complete each step of the sacral colpoexy that involves
      use of a vaginal positioning device (dissection of the anterior and posterior vaginal walls,
      attachment of anterior and posterior vaginal mesh, attachment of sacral mesh) will be
      recorded during the surgery to measure operative efficiency. Surgeon and surgical-assistant
      satisfaction will be recorded with each device.
