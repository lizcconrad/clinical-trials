      The overarching goal of the proposed study, named SYNERGY, is to explore relationships among
      balance performance, cognitive function, affective dysregulation, as they relate to the
      community re-integration in Veterans with TBI. The SYNERGY study findings can aid in the
      development of a better outcome models for the clinicians in facilitating effective community
      re-integration in Veterans with TBI

    <textblock>
      Examine if there are associations among balance, cognitive and affective function during
      multitasking activities in Veterans with the diagnosis of TBI.

      To determine if an association exists between balance performance and the degree of community
      re-integration in Veterans with TBI.

      To determine which of the three systems, balance performance, cognitive dysfunction or
      affective dysregulation, is the strongest predictor of community re-integration in Veterans
      with TBI.

        Exclusion-inclusion criteria Inclusion Criteria: Enrolled participants will be Veterans
        with TBI between18 to55 years of age. We identified a wide age range in order to include
        Veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, as well as Veterans of the Vietnam War.
        This feature of the inclusion criteria is important since barriers to community
        re-integration may be affected by impaired balance, cognitive dysfunction, affective
        dysregulation, across the age spectrum. Consequently, the study findings will potentially
        benefit not only young Veterans, but also middle aged Veterans.

        The Military Acute Concussion Evaluation (MACE): We will use MACE scores of 21/30 to ensure
        the participants have the cognitive ability to understand our study protocol, and
        therefore, participate voluntarily in the study. 62 Exclusion Criteria: We will use an
        exclusion criteria of 12/24 on the Dynamic gait index (DGI) to ensure that patients are
        ambulatory either with or without the use of assistive device to be able to measure dynamic
        balance accurately.16 Past Medical History: The following diagnoses will be cause for
        exclusion -- peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson syndromes, multiple sclerosis; bipolar,
        schizophrenia, seizure or psychiatric illnesses.

        Medically stable patients: It is essential to minimize future medical adverse conditions
        and minimize the risk of drop out. Therefore, no patient shall be considered for enrollment
        if they do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria or have not been recommended by the
        polytrauma staff at VA DCMC.

        The result of VHA TBI Comprehensive Evaluation electronic template will be reviewed
        following IRB approved and HIPAA compliant data collection procedures. The TBI diagnosis
        will be obtained from patient's chart review of problem section and physician's notes.
