  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of acupuncture on reducing nerve damage.

      Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the &quot;energy points&quot; on
      the body with the aim to restore health and well-being. It has been used widely to treat
      pain, such as lower back pain and joint pain. In this study the investigators will assess if
      acupuncture can be used to ease the pain, tingling and numbness that may be caused by
      chemotherapy and improve quality of life during chemotherapy.

    <description>Validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire, the Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS) and the vibration sensation test will be assessed at the time of intervention consent and then after the last acupuncture session on the same day of the last chemotherapy. CIPN grade per NCI-CTC 4.0 will be assessed weekly and then once again at 3 months (+/-2 weeks) after chemotherapy completion .</description>

    <description>As part of routine clinical care, a chemotherapy nurse, research nurse, or physician will assess the patient's symptoms including CIPN based on the NCI-CTC 4.0 criteria to determine the grade of CIPN. Once these patients develop National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 2 CIPN, they will be recruited for the intervention phase of the study. Severity of CIPN as defined by NCI-CTC is listed in Appendix A. Patients who consent to the intervention phase of the study will then be treated with weekly acupuncture until the end of chemotherapy. No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication will be permitted.
Subjects will receive acupuncture in bilateral ear points: shen men, point zero, two additional auricular acupuncture point where electrodermal signal is detected and bilateral body acupuncture points: LI4, TE5, LI11, ST40, Ba Feng, Ba xie.</description>

    <description>Each treatment session will be approximately 40 minutes in duration, 10 minutes to insert needles, 30 minutes to leave needles in. Patients will receive one acupuncture treatment each week until the end of chemotherapy. Adverse effects related to the administration of acupuncture will be collected each week before and after each treatment by the acupuncturist or research study assistant. All Integrative Medicine Service acupuncturists are licensed, credentialed employees of MSK.</description>
