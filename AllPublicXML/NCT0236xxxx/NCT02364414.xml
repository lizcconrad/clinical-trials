  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of measurements derived from a
      commercially available direct intra-oral scanning system with those taken from plaster study
      models, and to compare cost implications of both systems.

      The investigators will test the hypotheses:

        -  There is no systematic difference between measurements taken from the Trios scanner and
           study models.

        -  There is no difference in the cost of producing digital models.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaster study models produced from moulds of the teeth are a standard component of
      orthodontic records. They are fundamental to diagnosis and treatment planning, evaluation of
      treatment progress and results as well as record keeping. (Santoro et al., 2003) Plaster
      models must be retained for a minimum of 11 years for a medico legal reasons. This leads to
      problems of storage in terms of space and cost, in addition to the risk of damage because of
      the brittle nature of the models. These problems therefore highlight the need for an
      alternative method for producing and storing study models. This study aims to compare the
      accuracy of measurements derived from a new commercially available direct intra-oral (inside
      of the mouth) scanning system (3Shape TRIOS (R)) with those taken from plaster study models,
      and to compare cost implications of both systems. We will use the results to conclude whether
      direct intra¬oral scanning can replace traditional plaster models produced from moulds of the
      teeth.

    <description>All dental study models, and 3D scans will have all the above measurements carried out. There are 22 patients and each will have had study models made and these will be measured twice on two separate occasions, and all scans measured twice.
The measurements will be compared and analysed to see if the 3D scans accurately represent the tooth sizes and measurements that have been carried out on the dental study models (gold standard).</description>
