    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study , to clarity the characteristics of airway
      inflammation, airway reactivity and airway resistance in rhinitic children with or without
      asthma and to explore the possible predictors in the progression of allergic rhinitis to
      asthma.

      Children 6-15 years old with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma diagnosed by specialist
      physician are enrolled in the department of respiratory and otorhinolaryngology and
      pediatrics in Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease. According to presence of typical
      symptoms and signs, patients are divided into allergic rhinitis without asthma (AR group) ,
      allergic rhinitis concomitant asthma (AS+AR group), asthma without rhinitis (AS group). In
      addition, healthy students in a school are enrolled as normal control group. History of all
      subjects are collected, the following measurements are performed: skin prick test (SPT),
      peripheral blood cells five-classification test, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and
      specific IgE of common inhalant allergens testing, nasal lavage and induced sputum cells
      classification ，pulmonary function test, bronchial provocation test using methacholine，airway
      resistance measured by impulse oscillation technique, the levels of
      eosinophil（ECP），eosinophil peroxidase（EPO）.Meanwhile myeloperoxidase （MPO）and
      eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) are measured in induced sputum ,in nasal lavage and in
      serum.
