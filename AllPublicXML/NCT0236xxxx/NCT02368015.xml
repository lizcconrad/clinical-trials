  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities located in the liver parenchyma. They are usually
      asymptomatic, but can cause mass-related symptoms as abdominal pain, dyspnea and nausea.
      Aspiration sclerotherapy is indicated in patients with a dominant hepatic cyst to alleviate
      symptoms by draining the hepatic cyst to reduce cyst diameter. Spontaneous cyst infection, or
      following aspiration sclerotherapy, presents a severe complication of hepatic cystic disease
      requiring frequent hospitalization, long-term antibiotic treatment, and in some invasive
      therapies. Evidence that antibiotics are able to reach adequate intracystic concentration is
      however lacking. To prevent procedure-related cyst infection in patients receiving aspiration
      sclerotherapy, cefazolin prophylaxis is given as standard of care. In this study we want to
      assess the hepatic cyst penetration capacity of cefazolin by comparing serum and cyst fluid
      concentrations of cefazolin. We hypothesize that cefazolin is able to penetrate hepatic
      cysts, with treatment naïve cyst allowing a better penetration, reducing the risk of
      developing cyst infection following aspiration sclerotherapy.
