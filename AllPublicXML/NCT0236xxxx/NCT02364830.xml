      Colpermin ® (Peppermint oil) is used in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome but
      Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) isn't native in Iran. So in this study the Enteric-Coated of
      Anise-oil will formulate and use in treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with pain and
      bloating.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Enteric-coated Anise-oil capsules
      comparing with placebo and Colpermin® for treatment of IBS patients. 120 patients with
      confirmed IBS with non-response criteria selected. In this double blind pilot study, the
      patients and researchers will be blinded about Receiving Drug, Placebo and Active allocation.
      Patients will be randomized into group A (Anise-oil EC Capsule 187 mg daily, for 4 weeks),
      group B (placebo Capsule once daily, for 4 weeks) and group B (Colpermin® Capsule once daily,
      for 4 weeks). At the end of therapy (4 weeks) and at baseline (first), 2 weeks after
      receiving drug, placebo and Colpermin® IBS load, will be evaluated and compared between
      groups.
