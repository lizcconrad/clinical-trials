      The investigators hypothesize that coronary artery calcium score (CACS), heart-type fatty
      acid binding protein (H-FABP) concentration, high-sensitive troponin t (hs-cTnT)
      concentration and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score positively correlate
      with the rate of the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days and 6 months in patients
      presenting to the ED with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

      The aims of the present study in patients with chest pain of uncertain cardiac cause and a
      non-ischaemic initial electrocardiogram (ECG) presenting to the ED are

        1. To investigate whether there is any correlation between CACS, H-FABP concentration,
           hs-cTnT concentration and modified TIMI score with the MACE rate at 30 days and 6
           months;

        2. To evaluate the predictive values of CACS, H-FABP, hs-cTnT, modified TIMI score and
           various combinations.

      Study design and participants This prospective observational study was conducted in the
      Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong.

      Chest pain adult patients suspected with acute coronary syndrome were recruited.
      Point-of-care H-FABP and hs-cTnT tests, TIMI score and CT scan for coronary calcium score
      were performed on study subjects. Patients were followed-up at 30-day and 6 months for the
      occurrence of major adverse cardiac events.

      In 2014, a modified HEART score incorporating hs-cTnT was included as one of the predictors
      under study alongside with modified TIMI score, FABP and CACS. The HEART score was completed
      retrospectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chest pain commonly present to Emergency Departments (ED), and often have
      underlying ischaemic heart disease. Although more than 40% are of non-cardiac origin,
      clinical assessment places a heavy burden on hospital resources. Conversely, despite
      increased awareness and diagnostic advances, 2-8% of patients with acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) are misdiagnosed by conventional methods and inappropriately discharged home, resulting
      in a double mortality.

      In Hong Kong, 1.4 million people (17% of the total population) will be 65 years old and over
      by 2021. The risk of developing ischaemic heart disease increases with age. Thus an aging
      population may lead to a larger burden on health services. Since 2009, the Hospital Authority
      has identified the improvement of ACS management as a priority area. Current protocols for
      ruling in/out patients suspected of ACS involve symptom monitoring, serial electrocardiograms
      and serial troponin tests over 6 hours. This lengthy assessment is safe but contributes to ED
      overcrowding, and duplication of effort which is associated with increased costs and adverse
      patient outcomes. Even in patients who are protocol negative, and who are discharged, it is
      unclear who should be followed up earlier, and who should be followed up later. An assessment
      process that efficiently and safely improves early risk-stratification in patients with
      suspected ACS would be beneficial.

      Current advances in proteomics have paved the way for more sensitive biomarkers. One of these
      biomarkers - heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) - is detected in blood within one
      hour after myocardial injury, and has recently emerged as a prognostic marker for ACS. It
      predicts mortality and re-infarction in patients with troponin-negative ACS. If both troponin
      and H-FABP are negative, the mortality rate at 6 months is 0%. Adding H-FABP to
      troponin-based protocols could also avoid unnecessary investigations caused by false-positive
      troponins. Although high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) tests may achieve better
      analytical performance than standard troponin tests, there is increasing concern about
      excessive false-positive rates, and about the burden of risk if the result is ignored, and
      the burden of admission if most positive hs-cTn cases are admitted. This poses the question
      of whether there is additional value in measuring novel markers such as H-FABP which may be
      used in conjunction with hs-cTn tests.

      With the rapid development of non-invasive cardiac imaging, a combination of biomarkers with
      cardiac imaging may provide a better solution to the diagnostic challenge of rapid assessment
      and risk-stratification of patients suspected of ACS. Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is
      a non-invasive imaging method for assessing the degree of calcification in coronary artery
      plaques which is related to the degree of underlying atherosclerosis. CACS can be performed
      on conventional CT scanners without iodinated contrast administration, completed within a
      single short breath hold, is inexpensive and with minimal radiation exposure. A CACS of 0 is
      associated with a 5-year cardiac event rate of less than 1%, whereas increased CACS indicates
      increasing risk which correlates positively with the score.

      Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score system is an externally validated and
      widely used structured risk assessment method to predict adverse outcome in patients with
      unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI. It is also helpful to stratify risk for adverse
      outcome in patients with undifferentiated chest pain. Its use in conjunction with biomarker
      tests and cardiac imaging has not been prospectively tested.

      This study is designed to investigate whether CACS, H-FABP test and TIMI score can provide
      additional values in the current assessment process, which in turn will reliably identify
      patients with suspected ACS presenting to ED at low- and high-risk of adverse cardiac events.

      The investigators hypothesize that CACS, H-FABP concentration, hs-cTnT concentration and TIMI
      score positively correlate with the rate of the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30
      days and 6 months in patients presenting to the ED with suspected ACS.

      Aims:

      The aims of the present study in patients with chest pain of uncertain cardiac cause and a
      non-ischaemic initial electrocardiogram (ECG) presenting to the ED are

        1. To investigate whether there is any correlation between CACS, H-FABP concentration,
           hs-cTnT concentration and TIMI score with the MACE rate at 30 days and 6 months;

        2. To evaluate the predictive values of CACS, H-FABP, hs-cTnT, TIMI score and various
           combinations.

      Study design and participants:

      Patients were recruited consecutively on weekdays between 9:00AM - 5:00PM excluding weekends
      and holidays. For each eligible patient, apart from the routine chest pain protocol including
      clinical assessment, ECG and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) test, three
      additional steps were fulfilled: 1. a H-FABP point-of-care test performed on ED arrival and
      repeated 3 hours later; 2. a TIMI score performed on ED arrival; and 3. a CACS performed
      within 24 hours of ED arrival. All the ED physicians and cardiologists responsible for
      patient management were blinded to the CACS results, H-FABP results and TIMI scores of the
      enrolled patients but aware of the clinical record, serial ECG and hs-cTnT results from usual
      care. All recruited patients were treated according to standard practice. Immediate patient
      management were not affected by the CACS results, H-FABP results and TIMI scores. The
      decision to discharge a patient home from the ED or to recommend admission to a chest pain
      unit, a coronary care unit or an intensive care unit were determined by the ED physician
      based on the clinical record, ECG and serial hs-cTnT results as per standard practice.

      After hospital discharge, patients were contacted by an English- and Cantonese-speaking
      research nurse via telephone for a follow-up at 30 days and 6 months after initial
      presentation and asked specific scripted questions about subsequent visits to the ED,
      hospital readmission for evaluation of chest pain, and all cardiac procedures performed. The
      research nurse also accessed to the patients' medical records. All-cause mortality, cardiac
      death, myocardial infarction, all-cause readmission and readmission for ACS or other cardiac
      event, such as arrhythmia or cardiac failure, and all cardiac tests and coronary
      revascularization procedures were retrieved and verified for each patient.

      Data collection and measurable parameters:

      Demographic data, medical history, conventional risk factors including diabetes,
      hypertension, lipid profile, smoking history, family history, current medication and contact
      information to facilitate subsequent follow-up, were collected and recorded in a computerized
      database. ECG results, serial hs-cTnT results, H-FABP results, CACS results and TIMI scores
      were also recorded. In addition, subsequent visits to ED, hospital readmission for evaluation
      of chest pain and all cardiac procedures performed were retrieved from the hospital
      authority's computerised medical system and verified via telephone follow-up at 30 days and 6
      months after initial presentation. Furthermore, death, myocardial infarction, readmission for
      ACS, and all cardiac testing and coronary revascularization procedures were also obtained via
      a dedicated hospital-based computer system.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome is the number of patient that had MACE within 30 days and 6 months after
      initial ED presentation. The time to the first cardiac event or the final contact encounter
      in patients without events will be chosen for assessing patient outcome. The prognostic
      performance of CACS, H-FABP test, hs-cTnT test, TIMI score and various combinations on the
      presence and absence of MACE were assessed. MACE is defined as relating to safety outcome,
      which consists of all-cause mortality (including cardiac death and sudden cardiac death),
      cardiac arrest, readmission with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, or
      effectiveness outcome, which consists of revascularization (e.g. coronary artery bypass
      grafting), ventricular arrhythmia needing intervention and high-degree atrioventricular block
      needing intervention.

      The secondary outcomes include the number of MACE, safety and effectiveness MACE
      respectively, at 30 days and 6 months after initial ED presentation, and the prognostic
      performances (i.e. sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative
      predictive values, positive likelihood ratios and negative likelihood ratios) of CACS, H-FABP
      test, hs-cTnT test, TIMI score and various combinations.

      Protocol amendment:

      Previous study showed that the prognostic value of HEART score is comparable to TIMI score in
      patients presenting to ED with chest pain suspected of acute coronary syndrome. It would be
      beneficial to add HEART score into the study to assess its prognostic value when hs-cTnT is
      used instead of conventional troponin and its possible role in an accelerated diagnositic
      protocol for chest pain patients in ED when used alone and in combination with TIMI score,
      H-FABP and CACS. In October 2014, modified HEART score of the patients recruited were
      determined retrospectively based on information in patients' record. The modified HEART score
      consists of 5 assessment items with a maximum score of 9 points.

    <description>Patients were tested with an H-FABP point-of-care test according to the instructions of the manufacturer. It is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay designed for quantitative determination of H-FABP in blood samples using a reader QuickSens®Ω100 (8sens.biognostic GmbH, Germany). This test has a limit of detection of 2 µg/L, a 99th percentile cut-off value of 7 µg/L, and a coefficient of variation of less than 10% at 5 µg/L. The test requires a 120 µL blood sample and the result was interpreted at 15 minutes after sample application. The test was invalid if no control line is visible. In such a case, the measurement was repeated immediately. The research assistant performed the H-FABP point-of-care tests, was blinded to the CACS results and TIMI scores.</description>

Images were acquired during a single breath hold, using prospective ECG gating with imaging triggered at 70% of the R-R interval (collimation 16x2.5 mm, voltage 120 KeV, current 150 mAs). The computer software automatically defined the presence of calcified lesions as those greater than 130 Hounsfield units. A radiologist blinded to the H-FABP results and TIMI scores then calculated the CACS by selecting only calcified lesions specifically located within the coronary arteries, along with a description of whether the scan result is normal (CACS = 0), or shows minimal (1 to 10), mild (11 to 100), moderate (101 to 400), or severe (&gt;400) calcification.</description>
