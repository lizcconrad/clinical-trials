  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No agent is known to have efficacy in patients with incurable HNSCC that progressed with
      prior platin, 5-FU, cetuximab and taxane. Herein lies the unmet need to be addressed by this
      trial. Based on the preclinical and clinical data presented, the investigators propose that
      mitomycin C will have anti-tumor activity in these patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor response rate (TRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months (due to estimated median PFS of 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TRR will be evaluated separately in p16- (HPV-unrelated) HNSCC patients and in p16+ (HPV positive) OPSCC patients using two optimal two-stage Simon designs. In both cases, the expected TRR is 10%. A TRR of 30% is considered a clinically significant increase.
RECIST 1.1 will be used for this outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months (due to estimated median PFS of 5.6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of first radiologic confirmation of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease per RECIST 1.1
Target lesions - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Non-target lesions:Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grades 3 and 4 adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after completion of treatment (estimated treatment completion of 6 months)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 5 weeks, and end of treatment (estimated at 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment tools include:
EORTC QLQ-C30: this has a total score, one general QOL, and one &quot;within the last week&quot; subscale, as well as a general health item and a single overall QOL item. This study does not use current empirical guidelines for the EORTC-QLQ-30 global score with the understanding that both the magnitude and variance of scores vary considerably from patient to patient, from one time point to another and by such factors as disease condition, age, and comorbidity. The participants can choose from 1-4 with 1 being Not At All and 4 being Very Much.
Cognitive Failures Questions (CFQ) - has 3 subscales describing perception, memory, and motor function. A change in 1 standard deviation will be considered a perceptible difference. The participants can choose a scale from 0-4 with 0 being Never and 4 being Very Often.</description>
