    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of
      switching FK949E (sustained-release quetiapine) 50-mg and 150-mg tablets to the other tablet
      at the equivalent total daily dose in bipolar disorder patients with major depressive
      episodes.

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 of each treatment period (Week 12 and Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale to measure the severity of depressive episodes, where each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6. The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 of each treatment period (Week 12 and Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 is a clinician-rated 17-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 52 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8 of each treatment period (Week 12 and Week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-BP-C is a scale which assesses the degree of change or improvement from baseline for each of overall bipolar illness, depression and mania, by grading it using 8 grades, from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) or 8 (not applicable). Grade 8 (not applicable) was regarded as a missing value for purposes of calculating the mean score.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesirable or unintended sign (including abnonmal laboratory test values), symptom, or disease occurring while the study drug was administered, regardless of whether or not there was a causal relationship with the study drug. A serious AE is defined as a an event resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, was life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization or was considered medically important.</description>
