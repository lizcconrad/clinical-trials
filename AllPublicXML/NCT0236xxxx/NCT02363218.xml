      Study Phase: multi-institutional Phase II study Primary Objective(s): To determine overall
      survival for HCC patients treated with CyberKnife SBRT at 2 years.

      Secondary Objective(s): 1) To determine overall survival for HCC patients treated with
      CyberKnife SBRT at 1 year 2) To determine local control using RECIST and EASL criteria at 1
      and 2 years 3) To assess progression-free survival at 1 and 2 years 4) To assess acute and
      late toxicities following CyberKnife SBRT.

      Hypothesis: Overall survival rate of HCC patients at one year after SBRT treatment is not
      less than 65%.

      Study Design: Single arm study. Patients will undergo a CT scan with and without contrast and
      MRI scan for radiation treatment planning and target delineation.SBRT will be delivered on
      the CyberKnife with Synchrony Respiratory Tracking capabilities. The tumor will be tracked
      with 3 implanted fiducial seeds for targeting. Treatment will be delivered in 3 fractions
      within a 7 day window at the discretion of the investigator.

      Sample size: The sample size required is 93 with a power of 90%, p=0.05, 50% response rate is
      considered not effective (p0) and 65% overall survival rate at 1 year (p1) is considered
      effectiveness of the treatment. The estimated drop-out rate is 20%, so the total sample size
      would be 117.

      Statistical Considerations: The set of Intention-To-Treat (ITT) will be analyzed. All
      patients will be censored at their last visit, including the patients lost to follow-up. All
      patients will be followed and counted in the therapy to which they were assigned, even if
      they decline that therapy. Only those patients who refuse (in writing) to have their outcomes
      count in the study's conclusions will not be included in the analyses from that time forward;
      however, the follow-up data for such patients will be included up until the time they
      withdraw consent. Such patients will be replaced.

      Baseline characteristics of patients will be presented with summary statistics. Time-to-event
      survival rates for OS and DFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and presented
      at one and/or two years. The incidence of acute and late toxicities will be presented in
      tabular form on both a per-patient and per-event basis.

      Indication: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most deadly cancer in the world. It
      is primarily seen in areas where hepatitis is endemic, such as Asia, but other risk factors
      include alcoholic cirrhosis.

      Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain the only curative options. However, more
      than 80% of patients present with unresectable disease. For these patients with unresectable
      tumors, a variety of treatment options are available, including transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radioactive microspheres, microwave
      coagulation, laser-induced thermotherapy, and percutaneous alcohol injection, all of which
      have similar survival rates. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable HCC is a
      relatively new treatment option made available because of significant improvements in
      diagnostic imaging and radiation delivery techniques. Although follow-up is limited, results
      show encouraging local control rates.

      The investigators propose to conduct a Phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      CyberKnife SBRT for the treatment of HCC.
