  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with percutaneous cryoablation yields
      significant differences in the evaluative criteria of Phantom Limb Syndrome (PLS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to treat Phantom Limb Syndrome (PLS) with cryoablation of the remaining nerve
      stumps. The rationale is that because the pain in PLS follows the known distribution of
      nerves, and because the amputated nerves are known to undergo changes after the surgery that
      may lead to excessive &quot;firing,&quot; that interruption of the nerve impulses will reduce patient
      pain.

    <measure>Safety of cryoablation procedure, measured by the number of subjects that had cryoablation procedure events (CPEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is measured by the number of subjects that had cryoablation procedure events (CPEs). CPEs are device- or procedure-related serious adverse events (SAE) or adverse events (AE) categorized as clinical signs or symptoms of infection (fever), hemorrhage (pain, imaging changes), nerve pain worsening, or toxicity of any kind (confusion, seizure).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain scores on visual analogue scale (VAS )</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain score will be calculated by subtracting the day 56 pain score from the baseline pain score.The pain scores are on a continuous visual analogue scale of 0 to 100 mm. 0 mm = no pain and 100 mm = worst possible pain. The VAS is scored simply by measuring the distance, in mm, from the patient's mark to one of the ends of the line.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life, measured using Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ); it is a validated measure of physical disability due to low back pain.The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 24 (maximum disability).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are status post (s/p) amputation of an upper or lower limb. That is, the
             amputation is not congenital.

          -  Refractory pain symptoms, following tissue healing(postoperatively, or post injury)
             are related to amputation as determined by referring physician and investigator, to
             include: stump pain, phantom pain, unpleasant phantom sensations, and/or undesirable
             and/or life-limiting kinesthetic sensations. The character, frequency, location,
             description, and exacerbation or relieving elements will be recorded.

        Patients will be questioned as to the location of their sensation, be it pain, movement,
        burning, tingling, or other. The location of their pain will be correlated with the
        corresponding proximal nerve stump.

          -  Positive anesthetic/steroid block, as performed under CT guidance in an analogous
             fashion to the cryoablation procedure.

          -  Absence of infection

          -  Absence of coagulopathy

          -  Ability and willingness of patient to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection

          -  Underlying congenital segmentation or other spinal anomalies that result in
             differential nerve root pressures

          -  Significant spinal stenosis interpreted as &quot;severe&quot; on any cross sectional imaging
             study

          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant

          -  Immunosuppression

          -  History or laboratory results indicative of any significant cardiac, endocrine,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, infectious, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, neoplastic, or other disorder that
             in the opinion of the Principal Investigator would preclude the safe performance of
             cryoablation.

          -  Uncorrectable coagulopathies

          -  Concurrent participation in another investigational trial involving systemic
             administration of agents or within the previous 30 days.

          -  Have undergone a previous surgical intervention - post amputation - that may have
             altered the target nerve.
