    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to observe patients with Type 2 Diabetes on basal insulin alone or
      basal insulin with oral agents can be efficiently and safely started with meal time insulin
      using U100 rapid acting insulin analog and V-Go® Disposable Insulin Delivery Device (V-Go)
      using one of two dose titration algorithms to achieve improved A1C at 4 months.

      This study addresses the informational needs of Primary Care Physicians with regard to
      providing insulin dosing and titration information utilizing a V-Go disposable insulin
      delivery device. We look to compare two treatment arms of insulin dosing and titration in
      patients with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes - a fixed dose titration arm, and an arm
      where 50% of the insulin dose is given at the largest meal of the day. This study will
      provide practical information on glycemic control, dose requirements and safety in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic agents who are being
      primarily managed in the primary care office.
