  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses of
      SHR3824 compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are receiving
      treatment with metformin monotherapy (ie, treatment with a single drug) and have inadequate
      glycemic (blood sugar) control.
