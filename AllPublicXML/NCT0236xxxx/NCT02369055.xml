      The aim of this study is to analyze and describe rehabilitation pathways of stroke patients
      in northern Norway and Denmark in relation to how patients describe their health-related
      quality of life one year post stroke.

      The study will consist of 1) Translate, cross-cultural adapt and validate a questionnaire 2)
      Describe the level of quality of life and rehabilitation pathway in the two countries 3)
      In-depth interviews of a smaller group of patients for a more complex understanding

      The study is part of a larger prospective observational multicenter-study of two patient
      cohorts with stroke.

      500 patients from Norway and 500 patients from Denmark are included in the national
      stroke-register datasets, and 250 patients from each country in the questionnaire-based
      datasets.

      The questionnaire includes demographic data, SSQoL (-DK and -NO), HADS, EQ-5D, QOLIBRI-OS and
      additional questions about satisfaction on treatment and rehabilitation.

      5-6 patients from each country will be selected for semi-structured interviews with both
      priori questions ans exploratory questions.

      The mixing of methods will balance the goals of generality and complex understanding in how
      patients describe their quality of life and rehabilitation-chain.
