      To compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
      for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with treatment as usual (TAU) in Spanish
      population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common mental disorder with a negative impact on mental well-being, quality
      of life, and social and work-related functioning both in the short and longer term.
      Additionally, depression is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, health care
      utilization and health care costs. On a population level, depression is one of the most
      costly diseases. The economic costs of depression were estimated at €136.3 billion (EU25) in
      2010 in the EU and are still rising. European health care systems face the challenge of
      improving access to cost-effective treatments while simultaneously working to sustain
      budgetary stability in times of economic austerity.

      Internet-based depression treatment appears a very promising alternative to current routine
      depression treatment strategies. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness
      and potential cost-effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression in controlled
      research setting. Internet-based treatment thus has the potential to keep depression
      treatment affordable, as it enables mental health care providers to reach out to large
      populations needing depression treatment at a better cost-effectiveness than those of
      standard treatment as usual (TAU), but with similar levels of clinical efficacy and quality
      of care.

      The trials will be conducted in 8 European countries. In Spain the trial will be carried out
      in routine primary, comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CBT and TAU for adults
      with major depressive disorder (MDD). Respondents will be followed until 12 months after
      baseline (measures will be taken at BL, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months).

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item mood module that can be used to screen and to diagnose patients with depressive disorders. The 9 items are each scored on a 0-3 scale with the total score ranging from 0-27 and higher scores indicating more severe depression. The PHQ-9 has shown to have good psychometric properties (Wittkampf, Naeije, Schene, Huyser, &amp; van Weert, 2007).</description>

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-16-SR) US Translation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS is a questionnaire that screens for depressive symptoms and assesses depression severity. The QIDS is available in both clinician-rated (IDS-C) and patient self-report (IDS-SR) forms. The QIDS consists of 16 items (each item scores 0-3) and includes symptom domains of MDD based on DSM-IV and Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). The QIDS has shown good psychometric properties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) version 5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The M.I.N.I. is a structured diagnostic interview based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. The M.I.N.I has been translated to 65 languages and is used for both clinical and research practice. The interview compares well with Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders (SCID) (Sheehan et al., 1998) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (Lecrubier et al., 1997; Sheehan et al., 1998).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-report questionnaire which measures health related quality of life and enables conversion to utility scores to calculate Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). The EQ-5D-5L consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, ordinary activities, discomfort, and mood state related to anxiety or depression. Each item consists of five categories ranging from no problems to a lot of problems (Van Agt, Essink-Bot, Krabbe, &amp; Bonsel, 1994).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Questionnaires on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P; Hakkaart-van Rooijen, van Straten, Donker, Tiemens, 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TiC-P is a self-report questionnaire and consists of two different parts that can be administrated separately. Part I will be used to assess the participants' healthcare utilization and medication use. Part II (short form health and labor questionnaire [SF-HLQ]) measures lost productivity costs resulting from absenteeism (being absent from work because of illness) and presenteeism (being present at work while ill which may lead to reduced efficiency) and consists of 11 items. Healthcare utilization and productivity losses will be valued using country-specific prices.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI-SF is a 12-item self-report questionnaire with responses on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always) (Hatcher &amp; Gillaspy, 2006). The questionnaire covers three dimensions of working alliance: (1) therapeutic goals, (2) tasks, and (3) bond and the subscales have shown to have good internal consistencies. Both the patient and the 10-item therapist version of the questionnaire will be administered</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the credibility and expectancy questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly and Borkovec, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 6 questions, with answer options rated on a 10 point scale and on a 1-100% scale and evaluates 2 factors : credibility and expectancy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Nguyen, Attkinson, &amp; Stegner, 1983)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is used to measure global patient satisfaction. The questionnaire consists of 8 items that are measured on a 4 points scale with total scores ranging from 8 to 32 and has shown good psychometric properties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the system usability scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SUS is a simple ten item scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability of a technology system. All items are measured on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly disagree until strongly agree. Total SUS scores have a range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>Internet based blended CBT depression treatment combines individual face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with CBT delivered through an Internet based treatment platform with mobile phone components (either integrated in the treatment platform or as a separate system). The core components of the CBT treatment are: (1) psycho-education, (2) cognitive restructuring, (3) behavioural activation, (4) positive psychology, and (5) relapse prevention. These will be delivered over 10 sessions. For this study, the ratio between the number of face-to-face sessions and the number of online module will be 1/3 face-to-face and 2/3 online.</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual (TAU) is defined as the routine care that subjects receive when they are diagnosed with depression in the primary care system. In practice, this means that treatment as usual may vary between patients. We will not interfere with treatment as usual but we will monitor carefully which health care services are utilized by usual care patients using patient records and through self-report</description>
