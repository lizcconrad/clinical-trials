  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no available criteria for determining the optimal flow rate and mean arterial
      pressure level in patients under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Transcutaneous carbon dioxide
      tension (PtCO2) has been proposed for microcirculation monitoring and it could be useful for
      guiding hemodynamic optimization under CPB. The goal of this exploratory study was to
      determine the factors that influence PtCO2 variations during CPB.

      DESIGN: Cutaneous ear lobe CO2 tension was monitored along with hemodynamic parameters every
      10 minutes during CPB, until aortic unclamping. SETTING: French university teaching hospital
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients scheduled for cardiac surgery requiring CPB were prospectively
      included.
