    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different medications used in
      intravaginal trigger point injections (injections into extremely painful areas of a muscle)
      to treat chronic pelvic pain. The study compares onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOXÂ®) (a drug prepared
      from the bacterial toxin botulin which temporarily paralyzes muscles) to Kenalog (a synthetic
      corticosteroid used as an anti-inflammatory agent).

    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating problem among women. The
      musculoskeletal system is an important factor in chronic pelvic pain. Studies have
      demonstrated that women with CPP had more frequent musculoskeletal findings. On physical
      examination, myofascial trigger points have been found. Trigger points are hyperirritable
      bands of muscle that can be felt from the vaginal wall. They are often knot-like or taut and
      are painful when pressure is placed on them. Intravaginal injections of these trigger points
      using steroids including Kenalog (triamcinolone) have been done and produced decreases in
      pelvic pain. Trigger point injections of Onabotulinumtoxin A has also been shown to decrease
      pain in subjects with CPP. This study will compare these two drugs and assess pain (using
      subject questionnaires) at one, three and six months post injection.
