  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine both patient-reported and performance-based
      outcomes, specifically muscle function and kinematic/kinetic outcomes, between four different
      surgical total knee prostheses in individuals following TKA. Change scores will be determined
      based on patient-reported outcomes, kinematic/kinetic data, knee extension strength/power,
      static/dynamic balance control, mobility measures and functional performance testing during
      functional tasks (i.e. walking, ascending/descending stairs, sit-to-stand). After evaluating
      the pattern of change in lower-extremity function, the investigators will be better prepared
      to address residual functional impairments and prognostic factors linked to maximal recovery
      over two years.
