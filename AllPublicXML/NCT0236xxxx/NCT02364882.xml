    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, open-label, within-subject dose-escalation study evaluating
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of SST-6006 in healthy postmenopausal women. Three dose
      levels of SST-6006 and a placebo regimen will be evaluated: 1 g (0 mg of sildenafil), 1 g (50
      mg of sildenafil), 2 g (100 mg of sildenafil), and 4 g (200 mg of sildenafil). Doses will be
      administered sequentially and will be separated by a 14-16 day washout period. All 3 dose
      levels and the placebo will be applied both externally and internally.

      Subject eligibility will be determined through Screening evaluations. Screening evaluations
      will include a review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, medical and Ob-Gyn history; full
      physical and gynecological examinations (including vulvar-vaginal examination); Pap smear;
      vital signs (supine); orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate; laboratory assessments
      (chemistry, hematology, prothrombin time, FSH and urinalysis); concomitant medication use;
      electrocardiogram (ECG); serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) antibodies, sexually transmitted infection (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia), Herpes
      (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies; and urine drug screen. The
      Screening visit will occur up to 28 days before Day 1.

      For each dose level, safety from the first 2 subjects dosed will be evaluated prior to dosing
      the remainder of subjects at that dose level. If results indicate safety issues (defined as a
      known occurrence of an event of orthostatic hypotension (up to 8 hours post dose) and/or any
      score above 0 using the 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale in the first 2 subjects, an
      additional 2 subjects will be dosed and safety data evaluated. If no additional safety
      problems are found, the remaining subjects will be dosed at that level. If safety issues are
      found in the second 2 subjects dosed, no further dosing will occur and the prior dose level
      will be considered the maximum tolerated dose. In addition, any subject who experiences
      orthostatic hypotension at any point in the study or has a vulvar-vaginal irritation score
      above a 0 using the 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale at any dosing level will be
      withdrawn from the study and not proceed to the next level. An additional review of the
      safety data upon completion of dosing at each level will be done to determine if dose
      escalation is warranted. Safety decisions will be made by the Principal Investigator (PI) and
      the Medical Monitor based on their clinical judgment.

      The first day of dosing will be considered Day 1. Subjects will be housed in the clinic for
      the duration of each Treatment Period to allow for collection of the PK samples up to 32
      hours post-dose and the completion of all discharge procedures.

               -  If the subject cannot provide documentation, a Pap smear will be performed at
                  Screening. Subjects with abnormal findings will be excluded from study
                  participation and be referred for follow-up medical care as appropriate.

          6. Subject is in good health for age, as determined by medical and Ob-Gyn history and
             physical and gynecological examinations.

               -  As part of the gynecological exam the subject must have a pain intensity score of
                  0 with the cotton swab test in the lower vagina, labia majora, and labia minora

             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic,
             genitourinary, or psychiatric disease or other unstable medical condition that would
             contraindicate administration of study medication, interfere with study evaluation,
             limit study participation, or confound the interpretation of study results in the
             opinion of the PI.

          3. Subject has a history of sexual or physical abuse.

          6. Subject has retinitis pigmentosa or sickle cell anemia or related anemias, even if the
             subject feels clinically well at the time of Screening. Subjects with retinitis
             pigmentosa will be identified by specifically asking whether they have the condition,
             if there are visual signs and symptoms of the condition (including questioning
             subjects as to whether they have difficulty seeing at night or in low light, and if
             they have any visual field deficits that indicate a loss of peripheral or central
             vision), or if there is a family history.

          7. Subject has a history of orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension which is
             present at the Screening visit, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm
             Hg, a drop in diastolic blood pressure ≥ 10 mm Hg or experiencing lightheadedness or
             dizziness at 1 or 3 minutes after the change in position from supine to standing.

         10. Subject has a history of cancer, other than basal cell carcinoma.

         11. Subject has any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the test article in the opinion of the PI.

         12. Subject has a history of drug abuse within 1 year before Day 1.

         13. Subject has a history of alcoholism within 1 year before Day 1, admitted alcohol
             abuse, average consumption of more than 1 standard unit of alcohol per day (a standard
             unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1½ ounces of 80-proof alcohol, or 6 ounces of wine).

         14. Subjects who have a history of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)

         15. Subject has had treatment currently or within 1 month (28 days) prior to Day 1 with
             any of the following: weak, moderate, and strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and
             CYP2C9 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4: ketoconazole, clarithromycin, verapamil, diltiazem, St.
             John's Wort / CYP2C9: fluconazole, oxandrolone, fluvastatin, and metronidazole). Any
             prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, or herbal products taken recently or
             currently being taken will be screened by study personnel prior to study enrollment to
             confirm such drugs do not inhibit or induce the 2 enzymes listed above. If the subject
             takes any prescription or OTC drugs at the direction of a health care provider that
             are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, that provider should be consulted
             before medications are stopped for the purposes of study participation.

         16. Subject has positive findings from the urine drug screen (e.g., amphetamines,
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and opiates).

         17. Subject has positive serologic findings for sexually transmitted infection (syphilis,
             gonorrhea, chlamydia), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

         18. Subject has had an active genital herpes infection (blisters or vesicles) at any time.

         19. Subject has participated in any clinical research study evaluating another
             investigational drug or therapy within 30 days before Day 1 (or 6 half-lives of the
             investigational agent, whichever is longer).

         20. Subject has any abnormal findings on vulvar-vaginal examination performed during the
             physical and gynecological exams at Screening (e.g., genital skin breaks, irritation,
             dermatoses, or lesions).

         21. Subject is using any intravaginal or vulvar therapies, aside from study medication

         22. Subject has used any topical (e.g. vaginal) hormone replacement therapy in the past
             three months

         23. Subject has genital piercings or plans to get genital piercings during the study
             period.

         24. Subject has a vaginal infection including bacterial vaginosis (see Section 11.1.5) or
             a yeast infection. The diagnosis of yeast infections should be made by the PI based on
             the physical and gynecological exams; the objective is to exclude women that are
             symptomatic. If the woman is not complaining of symptoms but the PI observes
             discharge, than the vaginal wet mount test should also be performed to confirm a
             diagnosis of yeast infection.

         25. Subject has hypersensitivity to any ingredients in the study medication or placebo
             (see Tables 6 and 7).

        Exclusion criteria checked prior to dosing for each dosing session:

          1. Subject has consumed grapefruit, grapefruit-containing products, Seville oranges, or
             products containing Seville oranges (e.g., orange marmalade) within 3 days before
             dosing in each Treatment Period. If so they should be rescheduled.

          2. Subject has had an acute disease state (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea)
             within 7 days before Day 1.

          3. Subject has any abnormal findings on vulvar-vaginal examination (e.g., genital skin
             breaks, irritation, dermatoses or lesions).

          4. Subject must continue to not have clinical evidence of a sexually transmitted disease
             or a vaginal infection and must be asymptomatic of yeast and bacterial vaginosis (BV).
             If a subject presents with a sexually transmitted disease, vaginal, yeast or a BV
             infection during the study period, and the PI decides that treatment is required, the
             subject will be excluded for further participation in the study except if the subject
             has a yeast or BV infection which could be treated with Monistat one day topical
             treatment followed by a minimum of a two day washout for a yeast infection or 2 day
             oral tinidazole (i.e., Tindamax) for a BV infection. Treatment Period visits can be
             rescheduled to allow for treatment of yeast and BV infection.
