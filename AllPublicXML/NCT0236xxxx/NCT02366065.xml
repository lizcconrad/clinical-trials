      - Lowering intraocular pressure is the only proven treatment for glaucoma. Medications,
      almost always in the form of eye drops, are a mainstay for lowering intraocular pressure. Eye
      drops have the disadvantage of being difficult to administer and can have adverse effects on
      the surface of the eye and the surrounding tissues. Lowering intraocular pressure can be
      accomplished with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, but the many systemic side effects of
      these agents relegates them to drugs of last resort. Therefore, an effective, well-tolerated,
      oral agent would be an important addition to the treatment of glaucoma. The hypothesis is
      that oral acetaminophen can lower intraocular pressure to a clinically significant degree in
      a dosing regimen that is both safe and convenient. The research is important because
      acetaminophen is inexpensive, available over-the-counter, and has a well known safety and
      side effect profile.

      -  The study design is prospective case series. Before treatment, study subjects will have
           their intraocular pressure measured at 8 am, 10 am, 12 pm and 4 pm. They will then take
           acetaminophen 650 mg qid for 7 days and the intraocular pressures again measured at 8
           am, 10 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm. Subjects will then stop the acetaminophen and return one
           week later for one more set of intraocular pressure measurements at 8 am, 10 am, 12 pm,
           and 4 pm. The subjects will receive a reminder, by phone or text message, the day before
           each visit. Although measurement of intraocular pressure is part of routine clinical
           care, multiple intraocular pressure measurements over the course of three different days
           is not.

           -- The subjects will not be masked to the intervention. The person measuring the
           intraocular pressure will be unaware of the purpose of the study, and hence there should
           be no bias in the measurement of the main outcome measure, intraocular pressure.

        -  Treatment will occur for 7 days only, and during that time we will not know if the
           treatment has been successful in lowering the intraocular pressure. The only basis upon
           which a participant would be removed would be if he or she reported adverse effects from
           the study medication before the one week.

        -  The rationale for choosing acetaminophen is that there are data that it may be effective
           in lowering intraocular pressure. The dose chosen for this study (650 mg qid), is a
           dosing regimen that is commonly used for the treatment of pain, and is below the maximum
           recommended daily dose of 3 gm/day. If this dosing scheme does NOT lower intraocular
           pressure, further investigations are not planned; if it does lower intraocular pressure,
           further studies will be performed to find the lowest effective dose.

        -  Acetaminophen has a several decades long safety record as an over the counter medication
           for the treatment of pain. The dose and route of administration proposed is standard.
           Many of the participants will likely have used acetaminophen in the past.
