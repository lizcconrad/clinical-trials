  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is therefore to show that associated with cardiac angiography
      echocardiography, in myocardial seen late, would provide the information necessary for the
      decision revascularization, in a timely manner.

      This would allow the patient to avoid duplication of tests including risk related to coronary
      angiography (bleeding complications, stroke ...) and those related to the implantation of
      coronary stent (stent) without expected earnings in case of non-viability . This would also
      reduce the length of hospital stay and costs due to numerous reviews.

      Percutaneous coronary intervention is not recommended in stable patients with late
      presentation myocardial infarction, and myocardial viability needs to be evaluated before the
      procedure. The aim of the study is to evaluate the sensibility and specificity of dual-energy
      CT for the evaluation of myocardial viability in comparison to cardiac MRI.

      The experimental procedure is limited to a second CT acquisition performed 10 minutes in dual
      energy mode.

      Sensitivity and Specificity of delayed enhancement &gt;50% of myocardial thickness provided by
      dual-energy CT will be evaluated in comparison to cardiac MRI.
