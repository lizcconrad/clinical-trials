  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past decades, simulation-based training has become essential for making trainees
      fit for clinical practice. Traditionally, trainees are instructed to practice with as few
      errors as possible during simulation-based training. However, recent evidence from the field
      of psychology suggests that transfer of learning may improve if trainees are encouraged to
      commit errors during training. The aim of this study is to assess on performances with real
      patients the effect of error-management instructions compared to error-avoidance instructions
      during simulation-based virtual reality ultrasound training.

      This study is planned as a randomized controlled trial. Participants include medical students
      with no prior simulation practice at the fifth or sixth year of medical school. All
      participants receive 3 hours simulation-based ultrasound training focusing on fetal weight
      estimation. The participants (N=60) are randomized into two groups: Participants in group 1
      are instructed to follow the simulator program step-by-step to achieve the highest possible
      simulator metric scores by making as few errors as possible. Participants in group 2 are
      instructed to experiment and explore and to deliberately make errors during training. A
      simulation-based pre- and post-test is administered before and after training.

      Participants are scheduled to perform a transfer test seven to ten days after simulation
      training. The transfer test consists of fetal weight estimation on a real patient. The
      primary outcome is weight deviation of participant measurements compared to expert findings.
      Secondary outcomes include performance assessments of pre-, post- and transfer test
      performances by blinded ultrasound experts using the Objective Structured Assessment of
      Ultrasound Skills (OSAUS) scale. Using an alpha level of 0.05, an effect size of 0.80, and a
      power of 0.80, 25 participants are needed in the two study groups. Loss to follow-up of up to
      20% of study participants is anticipated, resulting in 30 participants in each study group.

    <description>. Error-avoidance training: The participants are instructed to follow the simulator program step-by-step, to achieve the highest possible simulator metric scores by making as few errors as possible, and only to follow the task required in the training program.
Study group 2. Error-management training: The participants are required to complete the same training program as study group 1. The participants are instructed to experiment and explore on their own and to deliberately make errors during the task that they are instructed to perform. Participants are instructed to reflect on their errors based on the simulator metrics that they do not pass. Errors are framed as positive events and instructor comments may include statements such as &quot;the more errors you make, the more you learn!&quot; or &quot;you have made an error? Great! Because now you can learn something new!&quot;</description>
