      The purpose of this study is to determine the health impact of a basic sanitation
      intervention in Maputo, Mozambique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have designed a controlled, before-and-after (CBA) effectiveness study to estimate the
      health impacts of an urban sanitation intervention in informal neighborhoods of Maputo,
      Mozambique, including an assessment of whether exposures and health outcomes vary by
      localized population density. The intervention consists of private pour-flush latrines (to
      septic tank) shared by multiple households in compounds or household clusters. We will
      measure objective health outcomes in approximately 1000 children (500 children with household
      access to interventions, 500 controls using existing shared private latrines in poor sanitary
      conditions), at two time points: immediately before the intervention and at follow-up after
      12 months. The primary outcome is combined prevalence of enteric infections among children
      under 5 years of age. Secondary outcome measures include soil transmitted helminth (STH)
      re-infection in children following baseline de-worming and prevalence of reported
      gastrointestinal illness. We will use exposure assessment, fecal source tracking, and
      microbial transmission modeling to examine whether and how routes of exposure for
      diarrheagenic pathogens and STHs vary and transmission impacts of the pathogens following
      introduction of effective sanitation. Our analysis will focus specifically on the impact of
      localized population density as a potential modifier of sanitation-related exposures.
