        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with 5 to 20 clinically typical, visible and discrete, actinic keratosis (AKs)
        non-hyperkeratotic and non-hypertrophic AKs within a selected treatment area of sun-damaged
        skin on either:

          -  The full face

          -  The full balding scalp

          -  A contiguous area of approximately 250 cm2 on the chest

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Location of the treatment area (full face, full balding scalp or chest) within 5 cm of
             an incompletely healed wound or within 5 cm of a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
             or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

          -  Previously assigned treatment in this clinical trial or previously participated in a
             clinical trial in the LEO clinical programme on ingenol mebutate gel for larger
             treatment areas.

          -  Treatment with ingenol mebutate gel in the selected treatment area within the last 12
             months.

          -  Lesions in the treatment area that have: atypical clinical appearance (e.g. cutaneous
             horn) and/or, recalcitrant disease (e.g., did not respond to cryotherapy on two
             previous occasions).
