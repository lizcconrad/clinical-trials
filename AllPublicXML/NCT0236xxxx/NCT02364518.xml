      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of TranQuillTM Sling (a
      suture or thread used in surgery that is knotless) in snoreplasty (surgery procedure) for the
      treatment of snoring and mild OSA in adult subjects. The TranQuill Sling Snoreplasty (QSS) is
      a procedure where the suture will be inserted into the soft palate tissues for the treatment
      of snoring and/or mild obstructive sleep apnea. Soft palate tissues are tissues in the back
      of the roof of the mouth.

      The research results will be used to provide data on feasibility (strengths and weaknesses),
      safety, performance, and effectiveness data for the Surgical Specialties, Inc as a therapy
      for snoring and/or mild obstructive sleep apnea. The TranQuillTM Sling is approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The TranQuillTM Sling is used in all types of
      surgery that involved deep tissues in the body.

      The investigator in charge of the study is Dr. Boyd Gillespie. MUSC and Dr. Gillespie receive
      financial support from Surgical Specialties, Inc. to conduct the study. MUSC is the only
      place that this study will be conducted. For this research study the investigators plan to
      enroll a total of up to 20 subjects at the Medical University of South Carolina.

      Study Methodology:

      Subject Recruitment. Twenty subjects will be recruited from the MUSC Snoring Clinics as well
      as public information seminars held in the greater Charleston area. Attempts will be made to
      recruit both a gender and racially diverse study population.

      Subject Screening. Subjects who are potentially eligible for the trial include patients who
      seek treatment chronic snoring disruptive to their bed-partner. Patients will require a
      pre-treatment assessment with a Watch-PAT home sleep study device to rule-out moderate and
      severe sleep apnea. Patients must have a regular bed-partner to participate in order to
      capture study outcomes.

      Inclusion Criteria. Potential subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria:

        -  Age ≥ 22 years (no upper limit)

        -  Regular bed-partner

        -  Chronic, disruptive snoring according to bed-partner

        -  Snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, or mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI ≤ 15;
           lowest O2 saturation ≥ 85%) on home sleep testing with Watch-PAT

        -  No prior surgical treatment for snoring or OSAS other than nasal surgery

    <description>The procedure will be performed under local anesthesia in the examination chair. The subject's throat will be anesthetized with benzocaine spray followed by infiltration of the soft palate with 4-5 milliliters of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The TranQuill suture will be inserted into the soft palate tissues using a predescribed pattern.</description>
