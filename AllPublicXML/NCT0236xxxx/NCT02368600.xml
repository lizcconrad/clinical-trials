  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) had been increasing. Maternal
      GDM has a great impact on both the health of the mothers and the offspring. Antenatal
      lifestyle interventions, in particular dietary intervention appear to be feasible to improve
      maternal GDM and weight gain. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such trial
      examining the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention in pregnant women in Hong Kong.
      Therefore, we plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing a lifestyle
      modification program (LMP) in early pregnancy and the usual antenatal care in high risk
      Chinese pregnant women in Hong Kong. Intervention group subjects (n=110) will participate in
      a dietitian-led LMP including dietary and exercise component from the first antenatal (AN)
      booking to 24 weeks gestation. 110 women in the control group will receive routine hospital
      antenatal care. The primary endpoint will be the prevalence of GDM measured using a 75 g oral
      glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. The secondary endpoints will be the
      proportion of infant born with large for gestational age (&gt;=95th percentile of the customized
      birth weight) and macrosomia (&gt;=4 kg at birth). The intervention group involves dietary and
      exercise advice and monitoring. No drug or invasive procedure is involved. The control group
      will receive routine antenatal care and will be provided with an educational pamphlet on diet
      and exercise during pregnancy.

    <description>On top of the usual care, subjects in the intervention will receive a lifestyle intervention that will be delivered by experienced registered dietitian and exercise specialist. There will be 5 face-to-face dietitian consultations, 2 telephone dietitian consultations and at least one face-to-face exercise specialist consultation. The exercise consultation will be normally scheduled on the same day of the face-to-face dietitian consultation.</description>

    <description>Women will have their first AN booking visit generally on or before 12 week gestation. For women who are primigravida, their AN visit appointments will be set at every 6 weeks before 24 weeks, every 4 weeks between 24-28 weeks, and every 2 weeks after 28 weeks. For women who are multigravida, the corresponding schedules will be set at every 6 weeks before 24 weeks, every 4 weeks between 24-36 weeks, and every 2 weeks after 36 weeks. Body weight of the pregnant woman will be monitored by nurses and basic nutrition advice will be briefly given by nurses in case she is slightly overweight. They will be provided with an educational pamphlet on diet and exercise during pregnancy. They will also be offered optional antenatal classes which subjected to quotas availability.</description>
