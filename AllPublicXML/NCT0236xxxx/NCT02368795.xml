  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatitis is the most important complication of ERCP. The severity of this condition
      varies from mild to severe and can lead to prolonged hospitalization, surgical interventions,
      and even death. Several patient-related and procedure related factors have been identified
      that are associated with a higher risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. So far, several methods
      have been proposed to avoid pancreatitis in patients at higher risk of this complication.

      Several studies have shown that different drug therapies (indomethacin suppository, a
      sublingual nitrate tablet and the administration of intravenous Ringer's solution) each may
      reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. All these drug therapies are safe, cheap and
      easy to administer.

      Several other studies have shown that pancreatic duct stenting (placement of a plastic tube
      in the pancreatic duct) is an effective intervention in preventing and reducing the severity
      of post-ERCP pancreatitis, especially in high-risk groups. However, there are still a few
      drawbacks to consider with pancreatic duct stenting: there are some difficulties with
      insertion of a PD stent, it is associated with a need for radiological follow-up and/or
      repeat endoscopy for removal, higher cost and a small but important risk of complications
      (e.g. stent migration).

      Most of the clinical trials of pancreatic duct stenting were performed, before the results of
      trials of drug therapies were available. Moreover, no RCT (to the investigators knowledge)
      has compared the efficacy of pancreatic duct stenting in patients who already received a
      combination of drug therapies to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the noninferiority of a combination of drug therapies
      in relation to pancreatic duct stenting to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk
      patients.
