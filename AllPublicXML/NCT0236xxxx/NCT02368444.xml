      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) and yoga program for improving posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
      and sleep quality in people who have experienced a traumatic event and are reporting trauma
      symptoms. The total length of the program will be 8 weeks. The sessions will be held 3 hours
      per week with 1.5 hours of group cognitive behavioral therapy and 1.5 hours of yoga. Changes
      in PTSD symptoms and sleep quality will be measured at baseline, immediately following the
      program, and at 2 month follow-up.
