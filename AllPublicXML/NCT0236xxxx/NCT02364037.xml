  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study is testing models of contraceptive care that were developed as part
      of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. CHOICE is a prospective cohort study of 9,256 women
      designed to: 1) promote the use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods which
      include interuterine devices (IUD) and subdermal implants; 2) remove financial barriers to
      contraception; 3) evaluate continuation of and satisfaction with reversible methods; and 4)
      reduce unintended pregnancies in the St. Louis region. CHOICE demonstrated that interventions
      such as comprehensive contraceptive counseling, increased access, and removal of financial
      barriers increase the uptake of LARC methods and reduce unintended pregnancy. The
      investigators objective is to determine whether the CHOICE model of contraceptive care can be
      equally successful in the real world of community clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project involves comparing two models of contraceptive care; 'enhanced care' which is
      usual care plus the CHOICE contraceptive counseling, and the 'complete CHOICE model' which
      includes the contraceptive counseling as well as provider training and cost support for IUDs
      and implants. Participants will be enrolled at three partner community clinics by a staff
      member (site coordinator) dedicated to the research study. All participants will undergo
      contraceptive counseling as well as a baseline survey with the coordinator. Participants will
      complete telephone surveys at 3, 6, and 12 months post-enrollment and will be asked about
      contraceptive method chosen, satisfaction and continuation of the method, and any pregnancies
      experienced since enrollment.

    <description>For women in both phases of the prospective study, we will provide them with the comprehensive contraceptive counseling developed in the CHOICE project and follow them over time.

    <description>Women in phase two of the prospective study (Complete CHOICE model) will also receive cost support for an IUD or implant if she chooses either as her contraceptive method. Immediately prior to the start of Phase II, clinicians will undergo a training session to discuss eligibility and same-day insertion considerations in an attempt to increase the number of patients who are receiving these methods, if desired.</description>
