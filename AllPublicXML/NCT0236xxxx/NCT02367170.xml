  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess the effect of exercise on markers of inflammation and protein
      catabolism. This research study will further our understanding of how treating Chronic
      Critical illness (CCI) - related respiratory muscle weakness with strength training can not
      only improve muscle function, but also potentially blunt the inflammation and catabolism of
      Peristent Inflammation/Immunosuppression and Catabolism (PICS).

  <detailed_description>

      In this research study, investigators will assign study participants to two groups: high
      intensity inspiratory muscle training and low intensity inspiratory muscle training group.
      This research study will last up to 28 days in 24 mechanically ventilated patients with CCI.
      The goal is to determine if the research participants can respond to a training program by
      improving weaning outcomes from the ventilator. This will be determined by measurement of
      breathing muscle strength with magnetic stimulation, measurement of diaphragm thickness with
      ultrasound, inspiratory muscle training, and blood and urine samples.

    <description>In this randomized, interventional study, 24 CCI patients will be assigned to either a sham group or to receive IMST for up to 28 days. Evaluation of diaphragm/inspiratory muscle strength and muscle thickness will be made with three techniques: 1) non-volitional magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves, 2) noninvasive measurement of diaphragm thickness with ultrasound and 3) the standard, clinical method of measuring maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). Investigators hypothesize that IMST will lead to improvements in all three measures. This study will provide information about possible effective respiratory muscle rehabilitation techniques that are likely to lead to reduced time patients will require mechanical ventilation and improved MIP and weaning outcome in long-term, failure to wean patients</description>

    <description>IMST will be conducted 5 days per week by study staff using a threshold inspiratory muscle training device (Respironics model 735). Prior to training, the tracheal cuff pressure is assessed to ensure no air leakage and appropriate inflation. The IMST training takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. To perform IMST, FiO2 is increased for 2 minutes prior to each training bout to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%.</description>

    <description>SHAM training will also be conducted five days per week with an identical training device that has been modified by removing the valve leaflet, which essentially removes all inspiratory loading by the device. The modified SHAM device makes a whistling sound during inspiration, which enhances the sham effect.

    <intervention_name>Bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation and measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure</intervention_name>
    <description>Pressure changes are recorded. The phrenic nerves are stimulated with bilateral magnetic stimulators over the neck. Measurements will be performed on day 1, every 7 days after and on last day of participation. The FiO2 will be increased (at least 20%) for at least 2 min. prior to measurement to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;92%. Prior to activating the stimulator, the artificial airway will be occluded with a pneumatic valve to create a quasi-isometric diaphragm contraction. The airway will be occluded for 3 seconds or less for each stimulation. The procedure will be repeated up to a maximum of 5 times per testing day.</description>

    <description>MIP is tested on all subjects on day 1, every 7 days after and on the last day of participation. To measure MIP, a subject will be suctioned, disconnected from the ventilator, and instructed to take a few spontaneous breaths. A 1-way exhalation valve connected to a NICO respiratory monitor will be placed on the ET/tracheotomy tube. The subject will be instructed to inhale and exhale as forcefully as possible for 20 seconds, followed by at least 2 minutes of rest on full mechanical ventilation support. MIP trials will be repeated 3 times, and the greatest negative pressure recorded with a NICO respiratory monitor connected to a laptop computer, which will digitize airway pressure, flow and volume signals at 100Hz. This allows for analysis of the individual pressure waves, facilitating pre-post comparisons of MIP at specific time points during inspiration.</description>

    <description>Occurs 5 days/wk using threshold IMST device-Respironics model 735. Prior to training, cuff pressure is assessed, FiO2 increased for 2 min. to keep O2 sats ≥92%. The ventilator circuit is disconnected, IMST device is attached to endotracheal or tracheotomy tube and subject is instructed to exhale then forcefully inhale for 10 breaths. The initial setting of device is set to -5cmH2O, subject must generate a negative inspiratory pressure more negative than -5cmH2O to open spring-loaded valve and receive inspiratory airflow. Pressure setting is made more negative/difficult to open by 2-5cm every few breaths until a setting is found where the patient has difficulty fully opening valve, resulting in valve flutter noise. Training pressure is then made more positive /easier by 2-4cm of H2O, so subject can fully open valve, and 4 sets of 6-10 breaths are completed. Training pressures advanced as rapidly as possible, provided the patient is able to open the valve without&quot;valve flutter&quot;noise.</description>

        <title>A Change in Diaphragm Strength From Baseline as an Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training (IMST) Intervention and Sham Patients</title>
        <description>In this randomized, interventional study, 24 CCI patients will be assigned to either a sham group or to receive IMST for up to 28 days. Evaluation of diaphragm/inspiratory muscle strength and muscle thickness will be made with three techniques: 1) non-volitional magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves, 2) noninvasive measurement of diaphragm thickness with ultrasound and 3) the standard, clinical method of measuring maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). Investigators hypothesize that IMST will lead to improvements in all three measures. This study will provide information about possible effective respiratory muscle rehabilitation techniques that are likely to lead to reduced time patients will require mechanical ventilation and improved MIP and weaning outcome in long-term, failure to wean patients</description>

            <description>IMST will be conducted 5 days per week by study staff using a threshold inspiratory muscle training device (Respironics model 735). Prior to training, the tracheal cuff pressure is assessed to ensure no air leakage and appropriate inflation. The IMST training takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. To perform IMST, FiO2 is increased for 2 minutes prior to each training bout to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%.</description>

            <description>SHAM training will also be conducted five days per week with an identical training device that has been modified by removing the valve leaflet, which essentially removes all inspiratory loading by the device. The modified SHAM device makes a whistling sound during inspiration, which enhances the sham effect. For SHAM treatment, supplemental oxygen FiO2 will be increased for two minute prior to each bout.</description>
