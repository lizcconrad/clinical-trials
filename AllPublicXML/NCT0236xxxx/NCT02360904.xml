      The primary aim of this study is to assess and compare change in QOL during chemotherapy as
      measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-Breast) score between
      patients receiving yoga and those not receiving yoga. Secondary endpoints will include other
      measures of QOL such as sleep quality measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory
      (PSQI), anxiety and depression using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and
      adherence to yoga and to chemotherapy treatment.
