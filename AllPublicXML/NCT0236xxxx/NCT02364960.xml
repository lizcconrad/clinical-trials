  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry to evaluate the use of intra-operative
      radiation therapy (IORT) and to study the efficacy and toxicity of breast radiotherapy given
      intra-operatively as a single fraction after breast conserving surgery,
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A registry trial has been designed and modeled after the original successful TARGIT protocol,
      to continue the use of IORT for a select population of women, and to follow outcomes with
      regards to local and regional control, toxicity and morbidity. Patients selected for breast
      conserving surgery, who are considered to have a low risk of local recurrence, are eligible
      for this registry trial once their informed consent is obtained. This single arm cohort study
      allows entry of patients who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer and whose
      clinical stage is suitable for treating conservatively (small tumor and no gross nodal
      involvement). Tumors should not be more than 3.5 cm in size.

    <description>In-breast local failure is defined as recurrence of cancer in the ipsilateral (same side) breast. Following IORT, patients will be monitored every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually in years 4 and 5 to determine if cancer has returned. In years 6 through 10 medical records will be reviewed to obtain information on participants' breast cancer status.</description>
