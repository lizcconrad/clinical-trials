      The purpose of this prospective study is to gather procedural use and safety data on the
      initial use of the Magellan Robotic System with the Magellan Robotic Catheter 6 Fr, Vascular
      Accessories 6 Fr and Microcatheter Driver This study will focus on, but not be limited to,
      endovascular embolization procedures in the peripheral vascular, for example, embolization of
      the splenic and hepatic arteries, uterine arterial embolization (UAE), prostatic arterial
      embolization (PAE), and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE).

      The data will be analyzed for medical education, societal presentation and/or publication by
      the investigator.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and clinical performance of
      the Magellan Robotic System with the 6 Fr catheter, Vascular Accessories 6 Fr and
      Microcatheter Driver in patients who are indicated for an embolization procedure or other
      endovascular procedure in the peripheral vasculature.
