  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with eligible diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, treated, and followed for
      complete ulcer closure. This is a randomized trial. All patients will receive
      standard-of-care treatment. Additionally, some patients will receive treatment with topical
      Selinexor gel and some will receive topical placebo gel.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Eligible
      patients with diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, randomized, treated, and followed for
      complete ulcer closure.

      After screening, qualified patients will be treated for up to 12 weeks. Patients who achieve
      complete ulcer closure will be followed for an additional 12 weeks.

      All patients will receive standard-of-care treatment. After randomization some patients will
      be treated with topical Selinexor gel twice weekly and some patients will be treated with a
      topical placebo gel twice weekly. Patients receiving Selinexor will be assigned to a
      sequential treatment cohort, either a 10 μM (μmol/L), 30 μM, or 70 μM dose.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to enrollment challenges &amp; improved SOC during run-in phase; no patients received KPT-330.
    Withdrawal is not a consequence of any safety concern.
