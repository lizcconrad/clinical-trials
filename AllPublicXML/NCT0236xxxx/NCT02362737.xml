    <textblock>
      This study will test ways to improve health behaviors using an intervention that has been
      specially designed for African-American men. The program, called Active &amp; Healthy Brotherhood
      (AHB), will provide information on basic health, and healthy eating, physical activity,
      stress management, and how to get medical care when needed.The AHB intervention will be
      compared to a control group that will receive basic health information in videos and
      brochures.

    <description>Participants will attend group sessions led by trained group facilitators. The group sessions will be ~16 weekly meetings of ~90 minutes duration for 4 months. AHB participants will also engage in experiential learning opportunities. Following the intensive intervention phase, during months 5 and 6, participants will receive three structured, individual phone calls with the group facilitator.</description>
