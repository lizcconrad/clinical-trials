      This is a dose escalation study to test the safety and immunogenicity of an oral HIV-1
      vaccine.

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I dose-escalation randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study
      designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of rcAd26.MOS1.HIV-Env, an oral
      replicating adenovirus 26 vector vaccine in healthy HIV-1 uninfected adults. The vaccine will
      be administered orally at a single time point (Day 0) at one of four dose levels depending on
      study group: 1 x 10^8 virus particles (vp), 1 x 10^9 vp, 1 x 10^10 vp and 1 x 10^11 vp.
      Volunteers will be randomized to vaccine: placebo in a 5:1 ratio in each group.

      Volunteers will be screened up to 56 days before vaccination and will be followed for 12
      months after vaccination.

      Because the vaccine is replication competent, volunteers will be housed in an isolation unit
      from day -2 through day 9. Household contacts will also be enrolled and tested for possible
      transmission.
