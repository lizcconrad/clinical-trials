  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to collect information on the current treatment patterns for Hepatitis C in
      participating countries. There is also a focus on patients receiving a daclatasvir-containing
      treatment regimen who will be followed prospectively for 12 months after treatment initiation
      to collect real-world data on effectiveness and safety of the treatment. Additional analysis
      will differentiate between selected subpopulations.
