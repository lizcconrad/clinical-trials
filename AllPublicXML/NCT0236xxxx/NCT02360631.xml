      The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not providing Chantix (varenicline) will
      help African American smokers quit smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers, effective treatment
      for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Varenicline, the leading
      first-line medication for tobacco use treatment, triples the likelihood of long-term
      abstinence relative to placebo in those smoking &gt;10 cpd. To date, efficacy of varenicline has
      not been established in African American smokers or light smokers. The long-term goal of this
      research is to advance treatment for all African American smokers in order to reduce
      tobacco-related disease and death. Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      varenicline for tobacco use treatment among 500 African American smokers, including a full
      range of cpd, within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We will
      randomize participants in a 3:2 ratio to receive varenicline (1 mg bid; n=300) or placebo
      (n=200) for 12 weeks, along with individualized health education counseling for all
      participants. Our specific aims are to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline to promote
      abstinence in African American smokers across the continuum of smoking level, to examine
      efficacy in light smokers and also in moderate to heavy smokers, to characterize nicotine and
      carcinogen exposure, and to describe biopsychosocial characteristics of this group and
      evaluate in relation to abstinence. This innovative study will provide the first
      placebo-controlled evaluation of varenicline in the full spectrum of African American
      smokers, and the first to examine varenicline in light smokers. Findings will contribute to
      advancing effective treatment for African American smokers and for light smokers, and
      enhancing individualized treatment. Increased treatment efficacy will have major impact on
      reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.
