    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective, open-label Phase IV Clinical trial to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of interferon alfa-2b therapy combinated with interleukin 2 and
      hepatitis B therapeutic vaccine versus interferon alfa-2b alone in chronic hepatitis B
      patients with entecavir achieving HBeAg seroclearance. Patients were randomized to one of 3
      groups to receive different antiviral treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been pretreated with entecavir for at least one year, with HBV (Hepatitis B
      Virus) DNA less than 1000 copies/ml and HBeAg seroclearance were randomized to one of 3
      groups, to receive Entecavir 0.5 mg po daily for 72 weeks, or Interferon alfa-2b 600wIU qod
      iH for 48 weeks plus Entecavir 0.5mg qd po for 8 weeks, or Interferon alfa-2b 600wIU qod iH
      for 48 weeks plus Entecavir 0.5mg qd po for 8 weeks plus interleukin 2 25 wIU qod iH for 12
      weeks plus Hepatitis B Vaccine 60ug qm im for 48 weeks.

          6. HBsAg (+);

          7. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of test drug;

             physiologic doses of steroids and radiation) 6 months prior to the first dose of
             randomized treatment (except for 7 days of acyclovir for herpetic lesions more than 1
             month prior to first administration of randomized treatment). Patients who are
             expected to need systemic antiviral therapy other than that provided by the study at
