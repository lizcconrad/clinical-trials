      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm observational registry trial planned to
      enroll 800 subjects. All 800 subjects enrolled will receive CRE8 stents. Clinical follow-up
      will be performed at 1 month, 6 months,12 months and annually up to 5 years after the
      procedure.

    <description>The CRE8 stent system consists of a sirolimus eluting coronary stent firmly held on the distal end of a semicompliant balloon catheter. This stent is made of cobalt chromium alloy and is coated with a thin carbon film.The outer surface of the stent has dedicated grooves for containing the pharmaceutical formulation, which is composed of the drug sirolimus and a mixture of long chain fatty acids.</description>

        reference diameter between 2.25mm and 4.5 mm (by visual estimation) and lesion length not
        more than 60mm (by visual estimation) will be enrolled.
