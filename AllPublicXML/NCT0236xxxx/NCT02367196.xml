    <textblock>
      CC-90002-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion, first in human
      (FIH) clinical study of CC-90002, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, in subjects with
      advanced, refractory solid and hematologic cancers. The study will be conducted in two parts.
      Part A dose escalation phase will explore escalating dose cohorts of the study drug CC-90002.
      Following completion of Part A, CC-90002 in combination with rituximab will be administered
      in subjects with CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in Part B dose escalation and
      expansion phase.
