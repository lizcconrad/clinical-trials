  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects over 125,000 people each year in the UK and leaves at least 50% disabled.
      Treatment of stroke caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (ischaemic stroke), with
      clotbusting drugs improves the chances of good recovery, but must be given within 4.5 hours
      of onset. Currently only a small proportion of patients who arrive in hospital within 4.5
      hours are treated. This is largely due to uncertainty about diagnosis and concerns about risk
      of bleeding associated with clotbusting medication. Patients with mild or improving symptoms
      in particular are often not treated because of uncertainty about relative risks and benefits.
      However, around one third of these patients go on to be significantly disabled. Routine CT
      scanning often does not show abnormalities in acute stroke (which take hours to become easily
      visible), and cannot show the extent or severity of blood flow changes in ischemic stroke.

      We wish to investigate the value of additional CT scanning that gives information on the
      blood vessels (angiography, CTA) and blood flow to the brain (perfusion, CTP) by undertaking
      a randomised trial. Extra scans are done in the same scanner and involve some extra
      radiation, injections of a contrast dye, and some extra time to acquire process and
      interpret. The extra scans may allow better treatment decisions for patients by increasing
      diagnostic certainty and by better assessment of stroke severity. However, we do not know
      whether the potential gains from better selection justify the resources and potential
      treatment delays that are involved. We will investigate whether the proportion of patients
      given clotbusting drugs differs between the two scanning protocols; and whether the outcomes
      differ, using standard measures of disability. We will also investigate whether use of
      different scanner manufacturers' software affect interpretation of scans.
