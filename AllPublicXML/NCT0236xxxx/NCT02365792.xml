  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ProDEms-trial focuses on nurses and ambulance drivers working in prehospital care, taking
      care on the one hand of patients suffering from time-sensitive critical conditions like
      STEMI, acute stroke or severe traumatic brain injury, and on the other hand of patients whose
      lives are not in immediate danger but suffer from acute exacerbation of chronic conditions or
      suffer from acute pain.

      In the current study the investigators will use a multistage approach to test the hypothesis
      whether the use of a CDSS in prehospital emergency care will: 1. Improve protocol adherence,
      2. Reduce emergency department length of stay, 3. Improves diagnostic accuracy; without
      impeding the workflow of the prehospital team or impairing patient safety.
