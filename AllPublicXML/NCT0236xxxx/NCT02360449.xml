  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a social initiation motivation
      intervention (SIMI) focused on training children with ASD to initiate to peers during
      structured play activities will result in more frequent initiations to typically developing
      peers during free play. The SIMI approach under investigation uses behavioral strategies
      based in Applied Behavior Analysis and Pivotal Response Treatment to motivate children with
      ASD to initiate to peers. Children with ASD will be randomly assigned to either the SIMI or a
      waiting list. Treatment will be provided for 8 weeks in the context of a weekly social skills
      group.

    <description>The SIMI approach under investigation uses behavioral strategies based in Applied Behavior Analysis and Pivotal Response Treatment to motivate children with ASD to initiate to peers. The adult arranges the play environment in order to promote cooperation and facilitates frequent prompting and reinforcement from peers, thereby enhancing the reward value of peer interactions.</description>
