  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of four parts:

      Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in
      healthy young male subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      effect on certain hormones and if possible to determine the highest well-tolerated dose of
      ASP1707 in healthy young male subjects under fasted conditions.

      Part 2 is an open label, randomized crossover, single dose study to determine the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of ASP1707and effect on certain hormones in healthy young male
      subjects.

      Part 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP1707 in healthy elderly men
      and healthy premenopausal females, and to determine the effect on certain hormones in males.
      Age and gender is also evaluated.

      Part 4 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multiple dose study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of ASP1707, and its effect on certain hormones in
      healthy pre-menopausal female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 comprises 7 dose groups of 8 healthy young male subjects. ASP1707 or matching placebo
      ( 3 to 1 ratio) is given as a single dose under fasted conditions.

      The first group receives the lowest dose while the last group receives the highest dose.

      Part 2 (Food-Effect) The group consists of 12 healthy young male subjects who receive two
      separate doses of ASP1707 under fasted or fed conditions. Half of the subjects are dosed
      first under fasted condition and half of them had first an FDA high-fat breakfast. Subjects
      receive the alternate treatment on the second occasion. Dosing is separated by at least 7
      days or 7 times t1/2 (terminal elimination half-life) as assessed from Part 1.

      Part 3 Comprises 4 dose groups of 12 healthy elderly men each, and two groups of 12 healthy
      premenopausal women. The latter are dosed ASP1707 or placebo in parallel to the 4 male
      groups. Subjects are fasted or fed depending on observations from Part 2.

      Dose levels are defined after evaluating interim safety, tolerability and PK and PD results
      from Part 1. A lower maximum dose is used in women than in men, based on preclinical data.
      Dose escalation in the men is independent from dose escalation in the women. Women and men
      receive once-daily dosing;

      Part 4 includes 4 groups, 1 placebo and 3 for ASP1707, each with 9 pre-menopausal women.
      Subjects in each dose group receive a fixed daily dose. Subjects are domiciled for various
      intervals during each of 3 menstrual cycles. Dosing occurs for 21 Days during the subjects'
      second menstrual cycle of the study (Day 1 of Period 2); fasted or fed depending on
      observations from Part 2.
