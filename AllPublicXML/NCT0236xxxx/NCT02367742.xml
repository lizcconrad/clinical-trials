  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated the essential role of physical activity in the prevention of
      overweight and obesity. Nevertheless, the effect of a program of physical activity on the
      maintenance of body weight in subjects who have previously followed a dietary intervention is
      still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate this topic by evaluating the effect
      of two different programs of physical activity on subjects who have followed a dietary
      intervention but presented again NAFLD a year after the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who were previously enrolled in the trial NUTRIEP and who still have NAFLD a year
      after the end of the study, were invited to participate in a program of physical activity to
      assess the effect of endurance and resistance training on weight and NAFLD score.
      Participants (100 subjects) were randomized and divided into two groups: the first followed a
      program of endurance activity consisting in a 30 minute walk, 5 times/week; the second
      followed a program combining the just described aerobic exercise with a resistance training
      based on 30 minute of musculation involving all the bigger muscles, 3 times/week. The trial
      lasted six months and subjects underwent liver ultrasonography (to assess NAFLD score),
      indirect calorimetry, bioimpedenziometry, the measurement of anthropometric variables (body
      height and weight) and biological parameters (glucose, insulin, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
      triglycerides, GOT, GPT and GGT) at the baseline and at the third and the sixth month. The
      aim of the study was to estimate the effect of the two different programs of physical
      activity on NAFLD score. Secondary end-points included: the effect on basal metabolism, the
      modification of fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) and muscle mass (MM) and on several biological
      markers associated with NAFLD.
