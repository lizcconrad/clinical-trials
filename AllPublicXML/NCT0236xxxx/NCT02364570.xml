  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is largely a lifestyle-related condition that is the #1 killer
      of adults in the United States. Our work is aimed at understanding how short-term increases
      in blood sugar, like those that accompany eating a meal, affect blood vessel function and the
      risk of CVD. This research is aimed at understanding how meals composed of eggs affect
      short-term increases in blood sugar from eating, which are connected with increased risk of
      CVD. In particular, the investigators are trying to identify a specific meal composed of
      either whole eggs, egg yolks, or egg whites, that best reduces acute increases in blood sugar
      brought on by meals that consist of majority carbohydrate. At the same time, the
      investigators are trying to explore the protective affects that eggs may have on blood vessel
      function and the reduction of CVD risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States [1]. The
      inability of your blood vessels to properly enlarge and shrink, known as vascular endothelial
      dysfunction (VED), is an early event leading to CVD and can be caused by postprandial
      hyperglycemia (PPH) [1] or short-term increases in blood sugar that occur after you have
      eaten. Although we do not know how this occurs, research shows that temporary increases in
      blood sugar impair the blood vessel's ability to properly enlarge and shrink. We also know
      that impaired vessel function is an early event leading to CVD and that research shows that
      short-term increases in blood sugar impair blood vessel function, even in healthy people [2].

      Because high blood levels of cholesterol increase CVD risk, this has triggered flawed
      guidelines to restrict cholesterol in our diet [3], including limiting egg consumption. The
      misguided fear towards eating eggs has been routinely challenged by large-scale studies
      failing to associate eggs with heart disease risk [4-8]. Research shows that eggs improve the
      functioning of insulin to reduce blood sugar [9]. They also contain bioactive peptides that
      may attenuate oxidative stress [10-11]. This provides rationale for their study as a dietary
      strategy to reduce PPH and VED. Thus, the objective of this study is to define the potential
      benefits of eggs and its components (egg yolk and egg whites) on blood vessel health in
      adults with prediabetes.

    <description>We will perform fasting measurements of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) using ultrasound, and draw a blood sample, prior to administration of the test meal. Following these baseline measurements, participants will ingest glucose (100 g). FMD will be performed intermittently post-ingestion at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. Blood samples will be collected at 0 min (immediately prior to eating) and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes following the ingestion of the meal. After each blood sample is obtained, the catheter will be flushed with saline in order to prevent the formation of clots and to minimize the likelihood of having to insert a needle again. Subjects will remain supine in a comfortable position for the entire duration of the test.</description>
