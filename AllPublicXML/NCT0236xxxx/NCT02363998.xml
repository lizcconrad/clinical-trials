  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3 open-label treatment study is to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of lofexidine at a clinically relevant dose to alleviate symptoms of acute
      withdrawal from any opioid, including methadone and buprenorphine. This study will take place
      in a variety of clinical scenarios, both in-clinic and outpatient settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects (person seeking treatment for partial or total opioid withdrawal) enrolled
      in this study are required to take lofexidine for a minimum of 7 days.

    <measure>Occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be followed starting with dosing on Day 1 through Day 14, and will be evaluated as well on a 30-day post-last dose follow-up phone call.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs (sitting/standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) will be measured during in-clinic treatments (30 minutes before dose and 3.5 hours after dose). During outpatient treatment (beginning as early as Day 4 until Day 14) sitting/standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse will be measured at least once daily before dosing and 3.5 hours after dosing. If the subject cannot stay in the clinic for measurement of the 3.5 hour post-dose vital signs, the subject will be given a portable digital blood pressure machine for measurement of their vital signs at this required time point and the values will be recorded in a subject diary</description>

    <time_frame>30 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>A follow-up phone call will be made 30-days post last dose of study drug to attempt and confirm subject's current treatment status (i.e., relapsed, current psychosocial treatment, entry into another treatment program, etc.)</description>

             requires detoxification or dose reduction as part of the pre-defined individual
             subject withdrawal treatment goal

          -  Have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30 days
