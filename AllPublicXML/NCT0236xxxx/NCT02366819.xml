      This pilot clinical trial studies genetic analysis-guided irontecan hydrochloride dosing of
      modified fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin
      (mFOLFIRINOX) in treating patients with gastroesophageal or stomach cancer that has spread
      from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Leucovorin calcium may also help
      fluorouracil work better. Genetic analysis may help doctors determine what dose of irinotecan
      hydrochloride patients can tolerate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the residual tumor (R) 0 resection rate. II. To determine the pathologic
      complete response (pCR) rate of up to 36 patients treated with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant
      mFOLFIRINOX (UGTA1A1 genotype-dosed irinotecan [irinotecan hydrochloride]) regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (radiographic [computed tomography (CT)], and metabolic (positron emission
      tomography [PET] maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) to chemotherapy.

      II. Chemotherapy-related toxicity. III. Surgical morbidity. IV. Overall survival (OS)
      measured from the time of histologic diagnosis. V. Disease-free survival measured from the
      time of histologic diagnosis. VI. Pattern of recurrence (distant, locoregional, both). VII.
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) vs HER2 negative (-) difference in
      clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      PREOPERATIVE THERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours,
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and
      fluorouracil IV over 46 hours continuously on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery.

      POST-OPERATIVE THERAPY: Beginning 5-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours continuously on day 1. Courses repeat every 2
      weeks for 4 more courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
