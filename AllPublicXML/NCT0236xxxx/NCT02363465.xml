    <textblock>
      To optimize a medical device for intradermal injection, knowledge concerning the thickness of
      epidermis and dermis at the proximal forearm is required. Since scientific knowledge is
      lacking, the investigators will examine the skin thickness (epidermis and dermis) of adults
      using imaging technology (High Frequency Ultrasound). The investigators hypothesize that they
      are able to correlate the thickness of the (epi)dermis to a specific combination of
      parameters age, gender, and BMI.

      Based on these results, the investigators can define which needle type and length is needed
      to correctly perform injections into the dermal layer.

    <description>(Epi)Dermal thickness at the proximal forearm and the deltoid region will be measured using imaging technology, more specifically high-frequency ultrasound (20-40 MHz) in B-mode (VEVO 2100®, Visual Sonics). This non-invasive measuring technique has already been proven to be accurate.
The echographic measurement will be performed on the left and right deltoid region and on two sides of the proximal forearm. Both the dorsal part and the volar/palmar part of the proximal forearm will be investigated. Ultrasound will be executed using gel (Aquasonic®) to optimize imaging.</description>
