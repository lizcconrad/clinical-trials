      Purpose: Using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), the investigators will
      study and attempt to treat mood dysregulation in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder
      (PMDD).

      Participants: Women between ages 18-45 with a diagnosis of PMDD confirmed by participation in
      a PMDD diagnostic study (IRB# 05-3000).

      Procedures (methods): After a re-screening and consent appointment, eligible participants
      will begin daily ratings and have baseline EEG performed during the follicular and luteal
      phases. Following the luteal phase EEG, the patient will receive, in a double blind
      cross-over fashion, 5 days of tACS, 40 minutes/session, performed in two successive months.
      On the first and fifth days of each treatment, EEG will be performed. Patients' symptoms will
      be assessed at the end of each session and with the daily mood ratings.

      Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) describes the cyclic appearance of affective symptoms
      and resultant impairment during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The objective of
      this application is to determine if transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation
      (tACS) will reverse the dysphoric mood state experienced by women with this disorder. The
      central hypothesis of this application is that, in a subgroup of susceptible women,
      reproductive steroid-induced alterations in cortical dynamics result in the sustained
      appearance of a dysphoric mood state. The cause of PMDD is unknown, the morbidity
      substantial, and the identified treatments limited in their effectiveness, since 40% of PMDD
      women are non-responders to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and many
      additional women are intolerant of antidepressant induced side effects. The importance of
      understanding the basis of affective dysregulation in PMDD is twofold: 1) The disorder is
      prevalent (6-8% of women of reproductive age), attended by substantial morbidity, and hence a
      significant public health problem. Indeed, by World Health Calculations, PMDD is associated
      with 4.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years in the US alone; 2) PMDD can serve as a model
      for illuminating the pathophysiology of affective state change and thereby inform the
      understanding of other affective disorders. The rationale for testing the efficacy of tACS in
      PMDD is as follows: 1) Role of Hormones: While there is little evidence for ovarian
      dysfunction in PMDD, a role for the reproductive hormones is clearly implicated, since many
      trials have shown that suppression of ovarian function results in a complete remission of
      symptoms in a majority of women with PMDD, while adding back gonadal hormones results in the
      return of symptoms in women with PMDD, with no symptoms seen in controls. Both estradiol and
      progesterone appear capable of precipitating mood destabilization in this paradigm. Recently
      completed studies further demonstrate that continuous administration of hormones for longer
      than one month results in a sustained symptom remission subsequent to the initial
      precipitated episode. Thus, dysphoric mood states in PMDD appear to be induced by normal
      changes in gonadal hormones rather than by exposure to elevated hormone levels (i.e., women
      with PMDD are differentially sensitive to the mood dysregulatory effects of reproductive
      steroids).

      Differential Effects on Cortical Activity: Although there is substantial literature
      demonstrating the effects of reproductive steroids and, by extension, the menstrual cycle on
      cortical activity, the usually described effects are disturbed in women with PMDD. Examples
      include the following: 1) in normal women, activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex is
      diminished during the luteal phase and the affective valence of the stimulus to which it
      responds is reversed (i.e., it responds only to negative stimuli rather than to positive
      stimuli, as occurs during the follicular phase). These changes are absent in women with PMDD.
      2) in normal women during the luteal phase, there is an increase in cortical inhibition - a
      presumed effect of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activating effects of the
      progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone. This effect is absent in women with PMDD. Both
      animal and human data further suggest the role of a disturbed cortical response to
      progesterone-derived neurosteroids in PMDD. Thus, sudden changes in the levels of
      allopregnanolone (as occurs at the start of the luteal phase with increasing levels of
      progesterone) result in subcortical excitability and irritability in rodents, while
      elimination of changes in progesterone-derived neurosteroids (with neurosteroid synthesis
      inhibition) successfully prevents the emergence of the dysphoric state in PMDD.

      Differential Network Activation: Psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation of
      affective state -depression and PMDD - are increasingly recognized as are &quot;network disorders&quot;
      in which aberrant electric signaling in large-scale neuronal networks mediates the clinical
      symptoms. Recent studies have documented impaired balance in activation between left and
      right prefrontal cortex in patients with PMDD. In particular, similar to major depressive
      disorder, the balance between alpha oscillation power in the left and the right hemisphere is
      shifted towards the left in patients with PMDD. The presence of alpha oscillations
      corresponds to a relative decrease in neuronal activity (inverse relationship). Therefore,
      such a left-shifted alpha asymmetry is indicative of hypoactivation of the left hemisphere -
      a common finding in imaging studies of patients with MDD. Since this asymmetry is exacerbated
      during the luteal but not the follicular phase (corresponding to the time course of symptom
      presentation in PMDD), the investigators hypothesize that normalization of alpha oscillations
      across the hemispheres would reduce symptom presentation in patients with PMDD. This network
      level intervention can be accomplished with brain stimulation by application of weak electric
      currents, a non-invasive approach to modulating intrinsic cortical network dynamics. The
      advantage of this approach is twofold: it is non-pharmacologic and thus avoids the otherwise
      attendant side effects; and it will provide systems level insights into the pathophysiology
      underlying mood state dysregulation. Brain stimulation by constant electric currents applied
      to the scalp (tDCs) modulates neuronal excitability in humans. Transcranial current
      stimulation with sine-wave stimulation waveforms (transcranial alternating current
      stimulation, tACS) likely enhances cortical oscillations in a frequency specific manner. The
      mechanisms of weak electric fields generated by tDCS and tACS previously have been
      demonstrated to interact with cortical network activity by altering the temporal activity
      structure of electric signaling in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that enhancing
      bilateral alpha synchronization (8-12 Hz) reduces the severity of the primary symptoms of
      PMDD: irritability, depression, mood swings, and anxiety. The rationale for this stimulation
      is the known deficits in the overall structure of cortical activity in this frequency band in
      patients with mood disorders and the previously demonstrate clinical benefits of tDCS in the
      treatment of mood disorders. Renormalization of this activity pattern may therefore provide
      therapeutic modulation with measurable clinical improvement. This study will use more
      targeted stimulation waveforms by employing bilateral tACS instead of tDCS. The investigators
      hypothesize that this choice of a more sophisticated waveform that directly enhances
      synchronization between the two hemispheres may decrease symptoms. tDCS modulates overall
      activity levels of the targeted cortical area in a non-specific manner. Here, however, it is
      proposed to evaluate a more specific stimulation modality, tACS, (10 Hz stimulation
      frequency) that has been shown to selectively enhance cortical alpha rhythms. Since the
      targeted patient population exhibits specific deficits in the alpha frequency band, this
      stimulation approach will provide a more targeted and therefore possibly a more effective
      manipulation. Furthermore, the investigators expect to be able to correlate treatment
      outcomes with EEG signals measured before and after stimulation.

      Please note that the investigators have several ongoing and completed IRB-approved studies
      (12-0022, 12-1607,13-2995, 13-3385) that employ tDCS and/or tACS, including a clinical trial
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01963676).
