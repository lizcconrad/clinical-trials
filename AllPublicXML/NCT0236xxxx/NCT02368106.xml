  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will create a patient data registry to collect and analyze information on
      technology usage and outcomes among patients receiving a broad range of relatively new
      radiation treatments that have become standards of care in our practice. Review of this
      information will serve as a basis for development of better patient management plans, to
      inform decisions about acquisition of new technologies, to provide information about quality
      in our care delivery, and to create a database that will securely warehouse ongoing
      information about what treatments the patients we serve need most and the challenges they
      face in the treatment process. The information gathered is likely to not only improve our
      services at the University of Maryland and its community sites but to advance medical science
      and enhance the quality of care for cancer patients.

      The purpose of this study is to create a robust and long-term patient data registry
      containing limited demographic, diagnostic, treatment, and follow-up data on patients at the
      study sites undergoing one or more of the following radiation treatments/technologies:

      Brachytherapy, including High-Dose-Rate and Low-Dose-Rate Techniques/ GammaPod Therapy/ GRID
      Treatment/ Image-Guided Radiation Therapy/ Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and
      Intensity-Modulated Arc Therapy/ MammoSite and SAVI Applicator/ Photodynamic Therapy/ Proton
      Therapy/ SIR Spheres and Radiolabeled Microsphere Therapy/ Stereotactic Radiosurgery and
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy/ Thermal Therapy (Hyperthermia)
