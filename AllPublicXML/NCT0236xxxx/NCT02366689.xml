    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical research study is to assess the efficacy of a commercially
      available triclosan/copolymer toothpaste compared to a commercially available oral hygiene
      multi-component regimen encompassing the use of a manual toothbrush, a toothpaste containing
      stannous fluoride / sodium hexametaphosphate and a mouthwash containing cetylpyridinium
      chloride relative to a negative control regimen in reducing established dental plaque and
      gingivitis over three and six months of assigned product use.
