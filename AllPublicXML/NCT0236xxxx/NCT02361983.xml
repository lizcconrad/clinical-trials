      The aim of this study is to compare the success rate of lung isolation and time to accomplish
      a correct placement of the device between anesthetists with experience in thoracic anesthesia
      (defined as at least 4 years clinical practice experience as attending anesthetists in
      thoracic) and residents in training in thoracic anesthesia.

      The aim of this study is to compare the success rate of lung isolation and time to accomplish
      a correct placement of the device between anesthetists with experience in thoracic anesthesia
      (defined as at least 4 years clinical practice experience as attending anesthetists in
      thoracic) and residents in training in thoracic anesthesia.

      A prospective randomized trial was designed. To check the optimal DLT (Broncho-Cath Covidien,
      Ireland, Dublin, Teleflex Medical, Athlone, Irelanad) and/or BB (Uniblocker, Phycon, Fuji,
      Japan Arndt Cohen Cook, Australia), placement a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used. The
      lung collapse was assessed by surgeons.

      Time from laringoscopy to the correct placement of the device, confirmed with FOB, was
      checked.

      Data were analyzed with Student't Test and Chi-square test; p value &lt; 0.05 was considered to
      be significant.

    <description>Safety and efficacy of the double-lumen tubes (DLT) and bronchial blockers (BB) for lung isolation in patients undergoing thoracic surgery have been extensively studied and most of the results show similar rates of successful placement and lung collapse. DLT and BB are more frequently inserted by anesthetists who are expert in thoracic anesthesia, with dedicated but different training.</description>
