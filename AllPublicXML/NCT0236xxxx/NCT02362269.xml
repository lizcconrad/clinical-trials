  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multi-center clinical trial of
      six months of daily oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). This study will randomize 334
      community-dwelling post-menopausal women of European and African descent (~167 from each
      ancestry) in a 1:1 ratio between the control arm and the dosing algorithm arm using
      stratified block randomization with a block size of six and stratification by site
      (ancestry). The sample size of 334 includes 10% over-recruitment to allow for loss to
      follow-up. The European ancestry women will be seen in the Madison clinic and the African
      ancestry women will be seen in the Milwaukee clinic. The proposed study will focus on
      post-menopausal women because this is the subset of the population that both Dr. Engelman's
      and Dr. Binkley's preliminary data are drawn from. Moreover, 25(OH)D concentrations are
      typically lower in women and in older individuals, since production of vitamin D in the skin
      following sun exposure decreases with age. Therefore, this group of individuals is likely to
      benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation, especially when personalized based on
      biology using the proposed dosing algorithm.

      Potential volunteers will be screened by telephone. Those meeting all inclusion and no
      exclusion criteria will be invited to a screening study visit. At screening, informed consent
      will be obtained. The study team will then collect the following to determine study
      eligibility: basic demographic information (age, ancestry, and education); medical history;
      medication and supplement use; and blood for screening 25(OH)D and calcium tests. At
      baseline, participants will be randomly assigned to the control or dosing algorithm group.
      Both participants and study staff who have contact with the participants will be blinded to
      group assignment. Follow-up visits will occur at three and six months. At baseline and
      follow-up visits, height and weight will be measured and blood will be drawn for the vitamin
      D panel, calcium, and PTH. Blood for DNA and body composition will only be obtained at the
      baseline visit. Participants will be asked to return all unused study supplements and
      compliance will be assessed at each follow-up visit by pill count. The control group will
      receive 2500 IU of vitamin D3 daily while the dosing algorithm group will initially receive
      1000, 2500, or 4000 IU daily, with the initial dosing based on the 25(OH)D at baseline, and
      the dosing may be adjusted at the 3-month visit.
