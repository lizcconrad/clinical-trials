      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of anti-emetic drug Aprepitant upon the
      combination chemotherapy of nedaplatin and docetaxel for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      The incidence and grade of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomit (CINV) will be assessed in
      patients receiving Aprepitant for the prevention of CINV upon the combination chemotherapy of
      nedaplatin and docetaxel for NSCLC. These data will be compared with those surveyed
      retrospectively in patients who had received the combination chemotherapy with anti-emetic
      agents except Aprepitant.
