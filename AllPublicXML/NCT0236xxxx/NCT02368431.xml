      zonisamide for the treatment of heavy drinking alcoholic Veterans.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine
      the effectiveness of zonisamide treatment for reducing heavy drinking and overall drinking in
      160 treatment-seeking, regularly heavy drinking, alcohol-dependent Veterans who want to quit
      drinking or reduce consumption to non-hazardous levels. The investigators will use
      state-of-the-art methodology and outcome assessments, including medical management (MM)
      therapy (a minimal behavioral intervention aimed at reinforcing treatment goals and adherence
      to medication), which is simple and easily implemented in primary care settings. The use of
      MM in the study will increase the generalizability of results, allowing a more accurate
      assessment of zonisamide's effectiveness than if a more intensive behavioral intervention
      were to be used. To demonstrate zonisamide's effectiveness in a representative Veteran
      sample, the investigators will include Veterans with co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders.

      The investigators also plan to explore the interaction between genotype and medication on
      drinking outcomes.
