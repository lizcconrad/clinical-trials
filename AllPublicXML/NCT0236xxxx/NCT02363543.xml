      The purpose of this randomized, comparative study is to determine whether Hyalomatrix is as
      effective as IntegraTM Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix when used in subjects who receive
      concurrent treatments with both products on their first and/or second degree burns located on
      both hands.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written consent must be obtained

          -  First and/or second degree burns on both hands

          -  Subject must be enrolled within 48 hours of the injury occurrence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is breastfeeding, pregnant, or has intentions of becoming pregnant during the
             course of their study participation.

          -  Subject has a prognosis that indicates unlikely survival past the study period.

          -  Subject's diagnosis indicates third degree burns.

          -  Subject suffers from burns sustained as a result of an electrical/chemical injury or
             by frostbite.

          -  Subject suffers from any inhalation-related burn trauma.

          -  Subject suffers from ongoing bone fractures.

          -  Subject has a known sensitivity to materials containing silicone, hyaluronan, bovine
             collagen, or chondroitin and/or derivatives of these products.

          -  Subject has received any treatment prior to study enrollment that may, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, affect the outcome of the study.

          -  Subject suffers from a medical condition that may impede wound healing, above any
             beyond that which would typically be expected.
