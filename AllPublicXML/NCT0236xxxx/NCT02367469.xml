  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential clinical utility of PET imaging
      using the radiotracer [C-11]alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan in the diagnosis, differentiation and
      monitoring of various brain tumors, both before and after initial treatment. We will also
      study mechanisms and clinical significance of abnormal brain tumor tryptophan metabolism
      using resected tumor tissues.

      If you agree to take part in this research study, you will be asked to have:

      1. a PET scan, 2. brief clinical questionnaires, and 3. biochemical studies of blood and
      tumor tissue. You may also have a second PET scan later, if you undergo therapy (such as
      surgery and/or brain radiation), to determine if there are PET signs of tumor. Your ability
      to participate in the study will be based, in part, on the results of the magnetic resonance
      images (MRI) in your medical chart from earlier clinical procedures. Once we receive the
      results of the PET scan, these will be compared to the MRI in order to help us analyze
      whether the tryptophan uptake tells us anything about the type of tumor in your brain. It
      will take about 3 hours to complete the PET scan; this includes the completion of the
      questionnaires, preparation and scanning. The actual scanning time will be 70 minutes. If you
      are a female of child-bearing age, we will need a small urine sample from you before starting
      the PET scanning procedure to make absolutely sure that you do not have unknown pregnancy for
      which radiation exposure might be harmful.

        1. The PET scan will be used to measure the accumulation of the injected radioactive tracer
           AMT in your brain. To make this measurement more accurate, we will use your clinically
           obtained MRI scan(s), which was used to diagnose the tumor, to identify the exact
           location and extent of the tumor. For the PET scan, an intravenous catheter (a small
           tube placed in your vein) will be inserted for the injection of the AMT for this PET
           scan. It is the tracer that the PET scanner &quot;sees&quot; when performing the scan. The amount
           of the tracer, which will be given is very small (5 ml, the volume of a teaspoon), and
           therefore no side effects are expected from the tracer itself. A second intravenous
           catheter will be inserted to collect blood samples during the scan; a total of less than
           2 teaspoons of blood will be collected. Participants may be sedated (put into sleep with
           some medicine) if they are unable to remain still for the scanning period.

        2. On the day of the PET scan, we will ask you to fill out a brief clinical questionnaire,
           and also an additional multiple-choice questionnaire to screen for potential mood
           problems (which often coincide with brain tumors). Participants with a potential speech
           (comprehension) problem will also be administered a brief speech test. The goal of these
           tests is to identify various clinical problems that can be associated with brain tumors
           and affected by abnormal tryptophan metabolism that we measure with the PET scan.

        3. If you have surgery to remove the tumor, a portion of the removed tissue will be used
           for biochemical studies. The doctor will not remove more tissue than needed for your
           care. The blood (obtained during the PET scanning) and tumor tissue (obtained during
           surgery) will be processed for analysis and stored in a locked container or freezer in a
           laboratory. In addition, we will review the clinical pathology report, so that we can
           correlate your PET results to type and grade of the tumor.

      We will collect and analyze tumor specimens obtained after AMT-PET during tumor resection (if
      not used for routine histopathology). Various histopathologic features will be studied, e.g.,
      tumor proliferative activity, expression of amino acid transporter as well as enzymes and
      metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, and these will also be correlated with neuroimaging
      findings.

             including primary and metastatic tumors, or a possible residual or recurrent brain
             tumor (based on clinical imaging); or history of glioma treatment with chemoradiation,
             even if no definite progression is found on clinical MRI.

          2. Age â‰¥13 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe increased intracranial pressure, status epilepticus, or other symptoms
             requiring emergency or urgent intervention.

          2. Resective surgery within 2 months prior to the PET scan (acute/subacute post-surgical
             inflammatory changes may cause false positive increases on AMT PET).
