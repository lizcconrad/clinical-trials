  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized double-blind controled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of
      L-arginine to prevent preeclampsia.

      applied to pregnant women with risk factors for preeclampsia. the main result was the
      development of preeclampsia as well as side effects to taking l arginine besides perinatal
      outcomes

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups were formed. one received L arginine 3 grams orally at day from the 20th week of
      pregnancy. the other group received placebo.

      Each three weeks were evaluated in search of high blood pressure and proteinuria.

      The follow-up was until the end of pregnancy and two weeks after this
