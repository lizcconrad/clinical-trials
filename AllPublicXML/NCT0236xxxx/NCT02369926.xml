    <textblock>
      This study aims to calibrate the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) for home
      implementation in a phase 2 trial of lisinopril in multiple sclerosis. In this initial stage,
      participants are required to travel to the study site one day a week for three weeks to
      complete the MSFC. They are also required to complete the MSFC at home once weekly for three
      weeks using remote sensing technology and video conferencing.
