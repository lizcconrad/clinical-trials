      This study protocol will provide guidance to investigators wanting to perform a
      non-randomized, consecutive enrollment, 10-year follow-up study of patients who are treated
      with the Ascension® HRA. Its purpose is to measure and document the outcomes associated with
      implanting the Ascension HRA prosthesis. Patients will be periodically assessed to collect
      data related to safety and effectiveness endpoints at the following intervals: preoperative,
      surgery/immediate post-op, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 5 year, and 10 years.
