  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ineffective treatment of postoperative pain may cause organic damage and chronic pain.
      Nevertheless, opioids, the leading drugs used for this purpose, present side effects that
      sometimes restrict their usability. In a multimodal context, new postoperative analgesia
      techniques have been developed focusing in the reduction of opioid use and their adverse
      effects, as well as postoperative chronic pain prevention. In this background, continuous
      intravenous infusion of lidocaine during perioperative period has shown to be promising. This
      trial aimed to compare postoperative analgesia, opioid consumption, duration of ileus and
      length of hospital stay and IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, α TNF and γ IFN levels in patients undergoing
      to laparoscopic cholecystectomies who received intravenous lidocaine in comparison to a
      control group. Intravenous lidocaine in the perioperative period of laparoscopic
      cholecystectomies was not able to reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and duration
      of ileus or length of hospital stay. However, its anti-inflammatory effect was evidenced by
      the significant changes in the studied cytokines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-four patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, under general anesthesia, were
      randomly allocated in two groups. The first group received intravenous lidocaine infusion
      during the procedure until one hour postoperatively; meanwhile the second group received
      intravenous saline for the same period of time. The intervention was double-blind. In the
      postoperative period, both groups received dipyrone and morphine PCA. Pain was assessed by
      Visual Numeric Scale (VNS) at rest and when coughing at 1st, 2nd, 4th, 12th e 24th hour after
      the end of the surgery. Blood samples for cytokines measurement were taken at the end of
      procedure and 24 hours later. The total morphine PCA demand, the time for the first flatus
      and the length of hospital stay were also recorded and compared.

    <description>A blood sample was collected by the author or by the anesthetist of the procedure to measure IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF α and IFN γ levels immediately at the end of the surgery and 24 hours after. The difference of these markers between the two groups also featured secondary outcome. The samples were centrifuged and the serum was separated in Eppendorfs and then frozen at - 70 Celsius degrees, for posterior simultaneous analysis. The biochemical responsible for this analysis also did not have contact with the group to which participants belonged.</description>
