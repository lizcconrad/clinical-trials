  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus is a small DNA virus that affects 400 million people worldwide. The virus
      infects the liver and previous studies, done in tissue culture and in animals, have shown
      that viral replication is affected by metabolic changes occurring in the liver. Specifically,
      starvation induces HBV gene expression and replication, in parallel to the activation of the
      gluconeogenesis response, and feeding attenuates viral activity. In this study we are going
      to recruit HBV patients with detectable viremia and analyze their viral load after an over
      night starvation versus after a morning meal. Our hypothesis is that following an over-night
      starvation viral load will be higher than that in the fed state.
