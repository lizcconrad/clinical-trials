    <textblock>
      In this study predictors of fitness to drive a car in cardiologic patients after acute
      intervention and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation are determined in addition
      to possible automotive monitoring of vital signs via contact less sensors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and the wish to drive a car
      need recommendations corresponding to fitness of driving after their discharge from hospital
      to home or rehabilitation. A policy paper of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) of 2010
      discusses the aptitude of driving a car of cardiovascular patients on experience but only
      little trial data.Therefore predictors of reduced fitness to drive a car are determined via
      medical data in comparison to data elevated while &quot;driving&quot; in a simulator and evaluated via
      Lane Change Test (LCT). Also monitoring of the fitness of driving in the car, automotive
      monitoring via contactless sensors, could be helpful for judgement.Therefore possible
      evaluation of heart and breathing rate will be examined with contactless measurements via
      video camera.

    <description>During a driving simulation medical data are elevated such as electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate breathing rate and oxygen saturation and compared to data of the performed Lane Change Test as a measurement for the quality of driving. Hereby the deviation of the lane from baseline during driving and ordered lane change via signs are determined also when performing cognitive and visual tasks. Also the simulation is simultaneously accompanied by monitoring via contactless camera usage in regard to possible determination of heart and breathing rate according to Eulerian Magnification Method</description>
