      The main purpose of the trial is to investigate the effect of locally delivered ciclosporin
      as an adjunct to non-surgical mechanical debridement in the treatment of chronic
      periodontitis and to compare it to mechanical debridement alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in good general health

          -  2 pairs of contralateral interproximal periodontal sites with probing depths of ≥7mm
             in single-rooted teeth not associated with furcations or root furrows.The test sites
             should have a distance of at least two teeth to the control sites.

          -  Teeth selected should have a vital pulp as determined by thermal or electric
             stimulation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients already included in other clinical trials involving therapeutic intervention
             (either medical or dental)

          -  Periodontal treatment during the last 6 months

          -  Antibiotic treatment 6 months prior to the start of the trial

          -  Antibiotic prophylaxis required for dental treatment

          -  Patients with acute infectious lesions in the areas of intended treatment

          -  Regular anti-inflammatory medication

          -  Known history of ciclosporin allergy

          -  Ongoing medication that may affect the clinical features of periodontitis
