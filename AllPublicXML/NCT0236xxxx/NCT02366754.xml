  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address the need for targeted treatments that induce
      functional and structural changes in the brain, ultimately improving neurobehavioral
      functioning, the investigators propose examining the therapeutic effectiveness of repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The objective is to improve functional recovery for
      persons remaining in vegetative (VS) and minimally conscious (MCS) states 3 to 12 months
      after severe TBI. The approach is to determine the neurobehavioral effect of rTMS, the
      relationship between neurobehavioral changes and net neural effects, and to identify and
      define the neural mechanisms related to neurobehavioral improvements by providing 30 active
      or placebo rTMS sessions.

      The specific aims (SA) of the CDMRP study are:

      SA-1: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS induced neurobehavioral
      effects using the DRS (lower scores indicate more function).

      SA-2: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS-induced changes in
      functional neural activation and whether these changes correlate with improving
      neurobehavioral function.

      SA-3: To determine the rTMS effect on white fiber tracts and whether rTMS-related effects
      correlate with neurobehavioral gains. White fiber tracts will be examined according to
      changes in Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and
      Axial Diffusivity (AD).

      SA-4: To confirm rTMS safety for severe TBI. The investigators hypothesize that there will be
      no difference between active and placebo groups according to average number of research
      related adverse events (AE) during treatment.

      To accomplish these aims, the investigators will conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo
      controlled clinical trial where 58 persons remaining in states of disordered consciousness
      for 3 to 12 months after TBI are randomized to the active rTMS group or the placebo rTMS
      group.

      The primary outcome is neurobehavioral recovery slope as measured by the total Disability
      Rating Scale (DRS), which will be collected weekly at bedside between Endpoints 1 (15th rTMS
      Session) and 2 (30th rTMS Session). The DRS will be collected weekly via telephone interview
      for the three weeks between Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3 (3 weeks after 30th rTMS session).
      Secondary outcomes include four measures of functional neural activation: task related
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), EEG-Rest
      and EEG-Task. The functional neural activation measures will be collected at baseline,
      Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3. Motor Threshold Testing and Neurobehavioral measures in addition
      to the DRS and physical measures will also be collected as secondary outcomes. Motor
      Threshold testing, neurobehavioral and physical measures will be collected at baseline,
      Endpoint 1, Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 3. The additional Neurobehavioral and physical measures
      are the Disorders of Consciousness Scale-25 (DOCS-25), Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R),
      Coma Near Coma Scale (CNC), Modified Tardieu Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Spaulding Limb
      Movement Protocol and the Consciousness Screening Algorithm.

    <description>The intervention consists of 30 active rTMS sessions. Each session is comprised of 300 trains of paired pulses with the following parameters: 100µs paired pulses separated by 100ms inter-pulse-intervals and a five second inter-train-interval. Pulse intensity will be set at 110% of each participant's motor threshold. Active rTMS sessions will be provided two times per day with a 70mm figure-of-eight coil over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Two Magstim-2002 units and a Bistim2 module will be used to administer active rTMS. Participants assigned to the active rTMS group will receive a total of 1.8 seconds of stimulation. Active rTMS will be administered 2 times daily with the following weekly schedule: 2 days of rTMS, 1 day of rest, 2 days of rTMS, 2 days of rest.</description>

Placebo rTMS sessions will be provided two times per day with a 70mm figure-of-eight coil over the left DLPFC. Two Magstim-2002 units and a Bistim2 module will be used to administer placebo rTMS. The placebo coil simulates magnetic stimulation, but does not actually emit a pulse. Participants assigned to the placebo rTMS group will receive 0 seconds of stimulation. Placebo rTMS will be administered with the following weekly schedule: 2 days of rTMS, 1 day of rest, 2 days of rTMS, 2 days of rest.</description>

    <description>Repetitive TMS is a non-invasive neural stimulation technique achieved via electromagnetic induction. An insulated metal coil is placed on the scalp and short discharges of electric current are directed through the coil producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is accompanied by an electric field that passes through the skull inducing currents in the tissue beneath the coil. If a cell beneath the coil is viable, then rTMS initiates or inhibits an action potential affecting ongoing neural activity. 30 sessions of active rTMS are provided.</description>

    <description>The placebo coil simulates magnetic stimulation, but does not actually emit a pulse. The placebo coil looks, sounds and feels like an active rTMS coil. The placebo coil, visually identical to the active coil, provides a slight sensory sensation and discharge noise (i.e., clicking) nearly identical to that of the active coil.</description>
