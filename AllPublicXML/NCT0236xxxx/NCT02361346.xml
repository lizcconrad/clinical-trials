      This Phase I, multiple ascending dose study will seek to enroll subjects with progressive B
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with measurable disease (lesion &gt; 1.5 cm) (including SLL) OR
      relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL who have received standard treatment with at least one
      anti-CD20 antibody (e.g.; rituximab, ofatumumab)) containing front-line regimen that resulted
      in initial response, followed by relapse/recurrence and who are not eligible for any further
      approved biologic therapy, chemotherapy and/or autologous stem transplantation and/or refuse
      alternative approved therapies and/or are unlikely to achieve clinical benefit from any
      therapy of higher priority by Investigator assessment.

      This is a two-part study intended to provide investigators and sponsor with the following
      information regarding the investigational new drug MT-3724:

      Part 1[COMPLETED]: in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma
      (including SLL) OR relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL

        1. The maximum dose of a single course of MT-3724 given as intravenous (IV) infusions on
           Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 at which there are negligible side effects and/or at which
           maximum serum levels and/or at which maximum effect on blood lymphocytes are observed.
           Six dose levels will be investigated.

        2. The changes in MT-3724 serum levels and blood lymphocytes over time following IV doses
           at different points in the study.

        3. The changes and kinds of clinical and laboratory effects and side effects that may occur
           over repeated courses of MT-3724.

        4. The changes in each subject's immune status and their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following
           one or more cycles of 6 infusions.

      Part 2: An expansion of the maximum tolerated dose cohort in patients with
      relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

        1. Identify the frequency of nature of clinical and laboratory adverse events that may
           occur over repeated courses of MT-3724 at the maximum tolerated dose.

        2. Define the PK and PD profiles of MT-3724 at the maximum tolerated dose.

          -  Presence of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly with histopathological evaluation of a
             lymph node biopsy consistent with CLL. Clonality of the circulating B-lymphocytes
             should be confirmed at screening. Previously confirmed immunohistological diagnosis
             with a characteristic CD5+/CD20+ B--cell immunophenotype according to WHO criteria.
             CLL diagnosis requires an absolute peripheral blood monoclonal CD20+/CD5+ B-lymphocyte
             count ≥ 5000 cells/μL for the duration of at least 3 months.

        Part 2:

          -  Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Histology based upon bone marrow biopsies
             and/or fine needle aspirates as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable.

                       anticipated doubling time &lt; 6 months.

               2. NHL (Part 1 and 2): Intermediate or high risk by Ann Arbor Staging with Cotswald
                  Modifications that meets criteria for active disease requiring therapy.

             patient is not eligible for HD-ASCT, or that the patient has refused HD-ASCT.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system metastases may be enrolled if they have
             received radiotherapy, do not require chronic steroid therapy, have had computed
             tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain within 1 month of study entry
             that shows stable disease and they have no neurological symptoms other than low grade
             neuropathy.

             dose day 1 must have a serum rituximab level of &lt;500 ng/mg documented by the study's
             reference laboratory prior to the initiation of dosing. Potential subjects who have
             received any other anti CD20 MAb therapy (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, or ibritumomab
             tiuxetan) must be at least 8 half-lives past their last dose prior to initiation of
             study drug dosing. Washout periods for these drugs are as follows:

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 3 days prior to initiating dosing. Male and female subjects with
             reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods while on
