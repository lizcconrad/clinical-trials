      100 patients aged 21-40 years old, diagnosed as primary or secondary infertility . These
      patients are then assigned to receive fertility treatment (ovulation induction, ICSI,
      intrauterine insemination and IVF). They undergo a 3D vaginal ultrasound before treatment to
      measure the junctional zone thickness and followed up after treatment to determine the rate
      of implantation.
