      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of PRC-4016 at steady state on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrates (midazolam, simvastatin), a
      CYP2C9 substrate (omeprazole) and a CYP2C19 substrate (flurbiprofen) in healthy male/female
      subjects.

      Day 1: Subject will receive single oral doses of 2.5 mg midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 50 mg
      flurbiprofen morning Day 2: Subject will receive a single oral dose of 40 mg simvastatin on
      the morning of Day 2. Day 4: Subjects will commence the multiple-dose regimen for PRC-4016
      (600 mg once daily) for 11 days. Day 12: Subjects will be given single oral doses of 2.5 mg
      midazolam, 20 mg omeprazole and 50 mg flurbiprofen co-administered with 600 mg PRC-4016.

      Day 13, subjects will be given a single oral dose of 40 mg simvastatin co-administered with
      600 mg PRC-4016.

      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 7 to 10 days after their final dose.
