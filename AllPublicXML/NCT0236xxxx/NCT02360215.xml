  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial compares memantine hydrochloride and whole-brain radiotherapy
      with or without hippocampal avoidance in reducing neurocognitive decline in patients with
      cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to the brain. Whole
      brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the most common treatment for brain metastasis. Unfortunately,
      the majority of patients with brain metastases experience cognitive (such as learning and
      memory) deterioration after WBRT. Memantine hydrochloride may enhance cognitive function by
      binding to and inhibiting channels of receptors located in the central nervous system.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Using
      radiation techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy to avoid the hippocampal
      region during WBRT, may reduce the radiation dose to the hippocampus and help limit the
      radiation-induced cognitive decline. It is not yet known whether giving memantine
      hydrochloride and WBRT with or without hippocampal avoidance works better in reducing
      neurocognitive decline in patients with brain metastases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance
      (HA-WBRT) increases time to neurocognitive failure at months 2, 4, 6, and 12 as measured by
      neurocognitive decline on a battery of tests: the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised
      (HVLT-R) for Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition, Controlled Oral Word
      Association (COWA), and the Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of HA-WBRT preserves neurocognitive function at months 2,
      4, 6, and 12 as separately measured by each test, the HVLT-R for Total Recall, Delayed
      Recall, and Delayed Recognition; COWA; and TMT Parts A and B.

      II. Evaluate the potential benefit of HA-WBRT in symptom burden, as measured by the M. D.
      Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT).

      III. Assessment of quality adjusted survival and cost analysis using the five-level version
      of the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L).

      IV. Compare cumulative incidence of progression and overall survival after WBRT versus
      HA-WBRT.

      V. Compare adverse events between the treatment arms according to the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0 criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect serum, plasma, and imaging studies for future translational research analyses.

      II. Evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and
      hippocampal volumetry at baseline and 6 months as potential predictors of neurocognitive
      decline and differential benefit from HA-WBRT as compared to WBRT.

      III. Association of symptom burden and anxiety/depression with neurocognitive function.

      IV. Evaluate the potential correlation between the prognostic scoring systems Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the
      diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) and neurocognitive function at
      baseline and overtime.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks.
      Patients undergo WBRT daily over approximately 2 weeks (10 fractions).

      ARM II: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride as in Arm I. Patients undergo HA-WBRT using
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) daily over approximately 2 weeks (10 fractions).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.

    <measure>Time to neurocognitive failure, as measured by neurocognitive decline on HVLT-R, COWA, and TMT Parts A and B</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence approach will be used to estimate the median time to neurocognitive failure to account for the competing risk of death. Gray's test will be used to test for statistically significant difference in the distribution of neurocognitive failure times. The cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to evaluate the effect of stratification variables (RPA class and prior therapy) and other baseline characteristics, such as Karnofsky performance score, DS-GPA grade, FLAIR volume change, and hippocampal volume, on time to neurocognitive decline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health outcomes, as measured by the EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item utility score in EQ-5D-5L will be used for the cost-utility analysis. The Z-test will be used to test the hypothesis that the cost-utility in the 2 treatment arms is the same at 6 months after initiation of treatment with a significance level of 0.05 and a 2-sided test. The remaining time points in which the EQ-5D-5L is collected also will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intracranial progression defined as progression in the brain or death</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>MRI scans at baseline and 6 months will be reviewed to determine intracranial progression centrally. The 6 month comparison in intracranial progression rates between the treatment arms will be compared using a test of proportions. It is expected that the rates will be similar in both treatment arms.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compared between treatment arms at each follow-up time point using Fisher's exact test. A mixed effects model will be used to assess changes of standardized neurocognitive scores across time using all available data while adjusting for stratification variables and other baseline characteristics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom burden, as measured by the MDASI-BT</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Four subscales (symptom severity, symptom interference, neurologic factor, and cognitive factor score) as well as certain individual items (fatigue, neurologic factor items, and cognitive factor items) of the MDASI-BT will be analyzed. For discrete time point analyses, the change from baseline to each follow-up time point (2, 4, 6, and 12 months from the start of treatment) will be calculated and compared between treatment arms using a t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, depending on the normality of the data. Mixed effects models will be used to assess changes of the four subscale scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety/depression measured using the EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An exploratory analysis, beginning with correlation coefficients, will be used to assess the association of symptom burden and anxiety/depression with neurocognitive function at each time point. The symptom burden items of interest are the &quot;distressed (upset)&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, and &quot;mood&quot; items. From the EQ-5D-5L, the depression/anxiety item will be of interest.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive function, as measured by the HVLT-R, COWA, and TMT, will be correlated with both the RTOG RPA and the DS-GPA classification systems. Baseline neurocognitive function for each test will be compared between both RPA classes using either a t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, depending on the normality of the data.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of white matter injury and hippocampal volume on neurocognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated through MRI scans using physician-contoured and auto-contoured scores. Concordance rates will be assessed using Kappa statistics. The auto-contoured scores will be used for the remaining analyses due to the number of physicians reviewing the scans. White matter injury is measured by FLAIR volume change and is a continuous variable. Hippocampal volume is measured as a continuous variable also and both will be covariates considered in the Cox proportional hazards model to assess the impact on time to neurocognitive failure and the longitudinal modeling of neurocognitive function.</description>

             would be that patients who had undergone radiosurgery or surgical resection and are
             planning adjuvant WBRT do not have to have visible disease but do need a pre-surgery
