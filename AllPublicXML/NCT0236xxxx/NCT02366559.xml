    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and risk of adverse events of
      electrocautery versus 532 nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG)
      laser for the treatment of flat seborrheic keratoses.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects are Caucasian or Asian.

          2. Subjects who are between 18-65 year olds.

          3. Subjects have flat or macular seborrheic keratosis on dorsum of the hands and wrists,
             extensor surfaces of the forearms. The diagnosis of flat seborrheic keratosis is
             confirmed by two clinical dermatologists using routine clinical examination and
             dermoscopy.

          4. Subjects have Fitzpatrick skin type I-III.

          5. Subjects are in good health.

          6. Subjects have the willingness and the ability to understand and provide informed
             consent and communicate with the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of keloids or hypertrophic scars.

          2. Pregnant or lactating or intends to become pregnant in the next 3 months.

          3. Active skin disease or skin infection in the treatment area.

          4. Previous history of lidocaine allergy.

          5. History of methemoglobinemia

          6. Unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent.

          7. Any other condition that would, in the professional opinion of the investigator,
             potentially affect response or participation in the clinical study or would pose as an
             unacceptable risk to subject.
