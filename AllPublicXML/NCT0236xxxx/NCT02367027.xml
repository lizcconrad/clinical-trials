  <brief_title>Relative Bioavailability Study in Healthy Subjects Comparing 2 Dry Powder Oral Suspensions of Rivaroxaban Under Fasting and 20 mg of an Oral Suspension of Rivaroxaban Under Fed Conditions to 10 mg of an Immediate Release Tablet Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
  <official_title>Single-dose, Open-label, Randomized, 4-way Crossover Study to Compare a Dry Powder Oral Suspension (10 mg and 20 mg Dose of Rivaroxaban) With an Oral Suspension (10 mg of Rivaroxaban) and 10 mg of an Immediate Release Tablet Under Fasting Conditions (10 mg Doses) and Under Fed Conditions (20 mg Dose) in Healthy Male Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is a substance developed for use in the treatment of blood coagulation
      disorders.Thrombosis (blood clots) can occur as a result of excessive coagulation activity in
      the blood vessels. Excessive coagulation activity can occur in children as well, and
      rivaroxaban is therefore being developed for the treatment of thromboembolic events in
      children and adolescents. As small children are often unable to swallow tablets, an oral
      suspension (mixture of a liquid containing finely distributed solids) has been developed
      which allows dosing according to body weight.The objective of this trial is to compare the
      bioavailability (proportion of a substance that remains available unchanged in the blood
      circulation) of a new oral suspension of rivaroxaban with a previously used oral suspension
      and with a rivaroxaban tablet approved for treatment. In order to evaluate the potential
      influence of food, the new oral suspension containing 20 mg rivaroxaban will be taken after
      consuming food. In addition, the pharmacokinetics (concentrations of the drug and breakdown
      products (metabolites) in blood), safety and tolerability will be assessed.
