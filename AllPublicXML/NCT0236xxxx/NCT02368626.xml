  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for cosmetic facial enhancement procedures with minimal down time and low risk has
      led to the development of methods for non-surgical skin rejuvenation. Various ablative lasers
      were developed, which remove the full skin surface in a controlled manner. However, the
      prolonged recovery and the significant risks prompted the development of fractional lasers
      which ablate the skin in a fractional manner, leaving untreated areas to improve healing
      process. In the past few years, fractional RF systems have been introduced that enable
      controlled skin resurfacing accompanied with dermal collagen remodeling. System using focused
      ultrasound , coagulating small volume of tissue in the dermis , have shown a lifting effect.8
      Similar to these devices the EndyMed Pro™ System with RF Micro-Needles handpiece (INTENSIF)
      enables fractional skin coagulation with dermal heating for the reduction of wrinkles
      together with a lifting effect.
