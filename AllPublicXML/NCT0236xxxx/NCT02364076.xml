  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized clinical trial in patients with thymic carcinomas who failed prior
      systemic therapy. All subjects will receive pembrolizumab and epacadostat treatment in three
      week cycles until unacceptable toxicity, death, progressive disease or withdrawal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The amended phase II study of pembrolizumab and epacadostat is for thymic carcinoma patients
      who recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The primary endpoint is response
      rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival and treatment
      tolerability. Responses will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1; progression-free survival
      is defined as time between start of treatment and tumor progression or death; survival is the
      time between start of treatment and death. Furthermore exploratory studies will be performed
      on archival tumor material (PDL-1 expression, next-generation sequencing), and fresh biopsies
      (culturing; next-generation sequencing).

         12. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If

             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          5. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

          6. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          7. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

         11. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or its formulation.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

         20. Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper gastrointestinal tract that
             precludes administration of oral medications.

         21. Screening ECG with QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds (corrected by Fridericia). In the
             event that a single QTc is &gt;480 msec, the subject may enroll if the average QTc for 3
             ECGs is &lt; 480 msec.

         22. Prior receipt of an IDO inhibitor.

         23. Receipt of MAOIs within 21 days before first dose of study treatment.
