    <textblock>
      Detecting scarred heart muscle is important to diagnose and treat of a wide variety of heart
      conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assess scarred heart muscle but it is time
      consuming, contraindicated for some patients and not tolerated by others. Computed tomography
      (CT) imaging has the potential to provide a rapid comprehensive assessment of the heart. This
      study will assess CT imaging of the heart muscle of patients who have previously undergone
      MRI of their heart. Using a state of the art CT scanner the investigators will develop a low
      radiation dose protocol to identify scarred heart muscle. The investigators will use and
      develop software techniques to analyse these images. This will enable us to develop a new way
      to identify and measure scarred heart muscle that will benefit patients with heart disease.
