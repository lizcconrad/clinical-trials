  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, remains unknown.
      Neuropathological studies suggest that a small area in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus,
      might be the site of the onset of the disease. This area is the sole source of noradrenalin
      to the brain, a neurotransmitter involved in arousal, but also cognitive functions. Animal
      and pharmacological studies have hinted towards an important role of this area in memory
      functioning. However, these studies were hampered by the limited spatial resolution, making
      it hard to clearly localize the locus coeruleus in the brain. New developments in brain
      imaging allow now to visualize the brain with stunning precision. Furthermore, a non-invasive
      new stimulation method, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, is believed to excite the
      locus coeruleus and thereby influencing neuronal networks and memory functioning.

      There are three aims in this project:

        1. To investigate how the functional interaction between the locus coeruleus and other
           brain areas, in particular the medial temporal lobe areas, during memory processes
           (encoding, consolidation and retrieval) change with development of Alzheimer's disease.

        2. To investigate associations between noradrenaline, memory performance and brain
           functioning. The investigators aim to investigate how acute noradrenalin levels change
           during the different memory processes and whether or not this is beneficial for
           performance. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate whether this interaction
           between noradrenalin, memory performance and brain functioning is different healthy
           older individuals (n =35) or patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (n =35).

        3. To investigate the underlying neural network changes during transcutaneous vagus nerve
           stimulation. The investigators will focus on differences in functional connectivity
           between the locus coeruleus and the medial temporal lobe areas in healthy older
           individuals and prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients. An experimental condition will
           be compared with a sham condition in a pseudo-randomized cross-over design.

    <measure>Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response during a memory task</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD response contrasts during encoding and retrieval. For encoding: comparing neutral versus emotional, comparing old versus prodromal AD and the interaction emotional level by group. For retrieval: correctly remembered versus those incorrectly remembered; neutral versus emotional faces; lures, mistakes and hits. These contrasts will be investigated comparing both groups.
BOLD responses during the memory task will also be compared across sessions (sham versus stimulation) for both groups.
Consolidation: task-free, so the BOLD response in the locus coeruleus will be correlated with the BOLD response in any other voxel of the grey matter of the brain over time (seed-based resting-state analyses).</description>
