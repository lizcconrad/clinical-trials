  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness
      meditation-based intervention designed to provide a synergistic solution to the avoidant
      coping that often inhibits advance care planning discussions that are crucial to quality
      end-of-life care.

    <description>Mindfully Optimizing Delivery of End-of-Life Care (MODEL Care) is a mindfulness meditation-based intervention to facilitate timely advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life conversations with greater ease. Participants are taught a variety of mindfulness practices (e.g., breath awareness, sitting meditation, mindful movement through gentle yoga, and mindful communication) that can be used to enhance end-of-life coping.</description>

    <description>The Mindfully Optimizing Delivery of End-of-Life Care (MODEL Care) intervention is two-pronged and mutually interactive with: (1) a patient and family caregiver group, and (2) an oncology provider group. Patients and family caregivers meet as a group for 6 weekly sessions of 2 hours each, for a total of 12 hours of class time. Oncology providers will have 5 class sessions for a total of 16 hours of class time. One class is held conjointly with patients, family caregivers, and providers to practice newly-learned skills. The course curriculum is generally based on mindfulness practices, group discussion, and didactic teaching with an emphasis on embodying interpersonal mindfulness in dialogue in daily life.</description>
