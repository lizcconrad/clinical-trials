  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent progress in parenteral nutrition has contributed to improve vital prognosis and to
      reduce morbidity in patients with severe intestinal failure.

      Currently, home parenteral nutrition is the only alternative to prolonged hospitalization for
      those patients. However, long-term parenteral nutrition can result in complications
      especially in bone, such as osteopenia or osteomalacia, then increasing the risk of
      fractures. Children are especially at risk because of bone growth and peak mineralization
      acquisition during puberty.

      Moreover, frequency and risk factors of those complications are not well documented for
      children.

      Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is considered as the golden standard for bone
      mineralization measurement. In pediatrics, this technique has some limits such as the
      underestimation of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in short stature, the overestimation of the BMD
      in tall children, and the inability to distinguish cortical from trabecular bone or to
      evaluate the bone microarchitecture.

      HR-pQCT, High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography enables noninvasive
      assessment of bone microarchitecture (virtual bone biopsy) using a radiation similar to DXA.
      However this technique has never been validated in patients with long-term parenteral
      nutrition.

      During the usual follow-up of the patients, HR-pQCT will be the only exam which will come in
      addition to the routine medical tests.
