  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigative product, developed by Remedor, is a unique gel formulation that optimizes
      the administration of EPO to the wound bed. This novel formulation has been shown to
      stabilize EPO in the gel and to maintain its activity over long periods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to play a major role in wound healing. EPO is a safe
      molecule, and commercially available biomolecule which is the basis of an FDA approved drug
      for treating anemia. EPO has a known mechanism of action on chronic wounds that affects all
      phases of the wound healing process and has shown promising results in experimental animal
      wound models [Hamed et al., 2010, 2011]. In humans, topically applied EPO considerably
      enhanced wound healing and improved wound conditions of acute and chronic wounds [Bader et
      al., 2011]. Our study seeks to extend these findings, to investigate the efficacy of EPO for
      treatment of diabetic chronic wounds in humans.

      The investigative product, developed by Remedor, is a unique gel formulation that optimizes
      the administration of EPO to the wound bed. This novel formulation has been shown to
      stabilize EPO in the gel and to maintain its activity over long periods.

      The Remedor formulation used in the clinical trials will be prepared either by a compounding
      pharmacy which is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health, or by an Israeli GMP certified
      pharmaceutical plant.

    <description>The wound will be treated either with the investigational formulation or the conventional treatment daily for 3 months.. After 15 minutes, the wound will be dressed with a fresh TegadermTM dressing. Monitoring of any adverse events will be performed on a daily basis.
Once a week, the wound will be monitored by a physician: wound size will be determined and documented by photograph. Patients will be evaluated for pain sensation at the wound area and satisfaction by completing a QoL questionnaire Once a month during the experiment and one month after the end of treatment patients will undergo blood profile, blood glucose, and urine samples testing: at the initial and terminating visits. ECG and Ulcer culture will be also carried out. HbA1c, will be monitored once in 4 months</description>
