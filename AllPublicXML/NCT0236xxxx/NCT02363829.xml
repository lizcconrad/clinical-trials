        Inclusion Criteria:

             invasive cancer is required.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function:

        Laboratory work must be performed within 30 days prior to start of study treatment.

        ANC ≥ 1,500/μL; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL; Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL; Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5
        times normal; SGOT ≤ 3 times normal.

          -  Patients with a ECOG/GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients with ureteral obstruction must be treated with stent or nephrostomy tube.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective form of birth
             control.&quot;Patients receiving oral contraceptives should be instructed that alternate or
             additional contraceptive measures should be used during therapy with VIRACEPT. &quot;

             release of personal health information.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients with Stage IA, IB or IVB disease.

          -  Patients who have known metastases to other organs outside the radiation field at the
             time of the original clinical and surgical staging.

          -  Patients who have received previous pelvic or abdominal radiation, cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, or previous therapy of any kind for this malignancy.

          -  Patients with septicemia or severe infection.

          -  Patients who have circumstances that will not permit completion of this study or the
             required follow-up.

          -  Patients who are pregnant at the time of diagnosis and do not wish pregnancy
             termination prior to initiation of treatment.

          -  Patients with renal abnormalities, such as pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, or renal
             transplantation, that would require modification of radiation fields.

          -  Patients with other concomitant malignancies (with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer), who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5
             years.

          -  Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis).

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus despite medication.

          -  Patients taking anti-arythmic agents such as amiodarone, quinidine, rifampin, ergot
             derivatives such as ergotamine, St John's Wort, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as
             lovastatin, neuroleptic such as pimozide, sedatives such as midazolam and triazolam
             among other CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 substrates.
