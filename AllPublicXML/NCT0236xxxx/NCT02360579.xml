      Prospective, interventional multicenter study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with
      autologous TIL infusion (LN-144) followed by interleukin 2 (IL-2) after a nonmyeloablative
      lymphodepletion (NMA-LD) preparative regimen.

    <textblock>
      LN-144 is an autologous adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL
      manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with
      metastatic melanoma. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients
      receiving a lymphocyte depleting preconditioning regimen, prior to infusion of autologous
      TIL, followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
