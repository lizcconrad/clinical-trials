  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of the detection of early inflammatory arthritis is recognised as being
      essential to the prevention of permanent joint damage. Furthermore, drug development in
      inflammatory arthritis is in increasing need of imaging that is able to sensitively and
      accurately detect and quantify inflammation in a reproducible and objective manner. There is
      an increasing body of evidence to support the role of PET-CT for these indications. The PET
      tracer 11CPBR28 is specific to the translocator protein (TSPO) highly expressed on activated
      macrophages. In this proof of principle study, the investigators aim to ascertain whether or
      not the PET tracer 11CPBR28 is taken up in inflamed joints. The investigators also aim to
      explore the significance of TSPO to inflammatory arthritis, through blood and joint lining
      samples.

      The investigators aim to recruit a minimum of 12 patients with known, active rheumatoid or
      psoriatic arthritis in the feet and ankles. Patients will first undergo a screening
      genotyping test; low affinity binders for PBR28 PET will be excluded from this pilot study.
      Those patients meeting inclusion criteria, will then undergo a PET-CT localised to feet and
      ankles that have been identified to be clinically inflamed (on examination and ultrasound at
      the screening visit). After PET-CT, patients will undergo synovial biopsy of one joint
      imaged. After 6 patients have undergone PET-CT, an interim analysis will be undertaken, to
      optimise PET scan duration and to alter the group of joints being imaged with CT.

      A single blood sample will be taken for a genotyping test, to ascertain whether or not
      individuals are suitable to undergo PET-CT with the PBR28 PET tracer. Further, blood samples
      will be taken for serum and RNA, and synovial biopsy will be done.
