    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized study.The study staff will use the InSpectraTM tissue
      oxygen saturation (StO2) monitor manufactured by Hutchinson Technology to measure baseline
      StO2 levels after applying the noninvasive probe to the thenar eminence. After a stable
      reading is obtained, a blood pressure cuff will be inflated 40 mmHg above the obtained
      systolic pressure and the rate of desaturation (Rdes; % × sec-1) will be recorded. After 3
      minutes or once the StO2 level comes to zero (whichever is earlier), the cuff pressure will
      be released and the rate of reperfusion (Rres; % × sec-1) will be measured. The investigators
      hypothesize that heart failure in children causes a baseline lower thenar tissue oxygen
      saturation (StO2), a faster rate of desaturation (Rdes) and a prolonged rate of reperfusion
      (Rres). The investigators also hypothesize that these changes will correlate with the
      severity of heart failure. The results of this study will provide groundwork for studies
      looking at correlation of therapy modification based on the combination thenar StO2 and
      clinical presentation.

      Heart failure patients seen in the Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center will be
      enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent on the day of their evaluation. The
      primary pediatric cardiologist following the patient will evaluate the need for regular
      investigations like blood work, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. The study staff will
      use the InSpectraTM tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) monitor manufactured by Hutchinson
      Technology to measure the baseline StO2 level after applying the noninvasive probe to the
      thenar eminence. After a stable reading is obtained a blood pressure cuff will be inflated 40
      mmHg above the obtained systolic pressure and the rate of desaturation (Rdes; % × sec-1) will
      be recorded. After 3 minutes or once the StO2 level comes to zero (whichever is earlier), the
      cuff pressure will be released and the rate of reperfusion (Rres; % × sec-1) will be
      measured. Similar measurements will be obtained from an otherwise healthy cohort of children
      who present to the Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center for evaluation of a heart
      murmur or chest pain. The patient's treating physician and care providers will be blinded to
      the study test results. All clinical care will be at the discretion of the patient's treating
      physicians. Only StO2 levels will be obtained using the non-invasive probe placed on the
      thenar eminence for the purpose of the study.
