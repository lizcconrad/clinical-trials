  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some recent studies have found that adult attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      was frequent among patients with alcohol-dependence. However, no investigation has ever
      addressed whether ADHD may impact the drinking outcome.

      Moreover, most of the different aforementioned studies assessed ADHD using the ADHD
      self-report scale (ASRS). The ASRS is a screening questionnaire that is of limited diagnostic
      value, and the overrepresentation of high-score ASRS among patients with alcohol-dependence
      could be in part due to differential diagnoses such as antisocial or borderline personality
      disorders, executive function impairments, or isolated impulsiveness.

      The study aims to evaluate &quot;ADHD: Gaps between patients with Alcohol Dependence and Impact on
      early Relapse&quot; (AGADIR). In AGADIR, subjects with alcohol-dependence are recruited at the end
      of a residential detoxification program. They are assessed for ADHD using the ASRS, but also
      with a standardized diagnostic tool, i.e., the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA
      2.0). Potential differential diagnoses are screened during the baseline visit. The patients
      are followed-up during the 12 first post-detox weeks, through a standardized psychosocial
      treatment. ASRS is re-performed at the end of the follow-up.

    <description>All the patients included should meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th edition revised (DSM-IV-Tr) criteria for Alcohol Dependance. They are all recruited at the end of an inpatient alcohol detoxification process (see inclusion criteria).
The initial screening is performed just before the end of hospitalization. The subsequent follow-up is 12 weeks-long. There is no drug for abstinence maintenance during the study. The psychosocial intervention is based on the BRENDA model.</description>
