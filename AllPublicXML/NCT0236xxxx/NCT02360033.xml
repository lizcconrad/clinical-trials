    <textblock>
      Goals of the study:

      Systemic Therapy was approved in 2008 by the Scientific Advisory Board on Psychotherapy
      (Wissenschaftlicher Beirat Psychotherapie: WBP) for a variety of disorders which, at the
      time, did not include anxiety disorders. According to the 2007 joint methods paper of the WBP
      and the Mutual Federal Committee (Gemeinsamen Bundesausschuss: G-Ba), there must be three
      randomized-controlled trials (RCT) for anxiety disorders. These studies are available now but
      lack explicit details about the clinical significance of the reductions they show in social
      anxiety symptoms. This project is funded by the German Association for Systemic Therapy,
      Counseling and Family Therapy (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Systemische Therapie, Beratung und
      Familientherapie: DGSF).

      Study design:

      The study is planned as a mono-centric, balanced pilot RCT. It investigates the feasibility
      of an RCT comparing Systemic Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Social Anxiety
      Disorders (SAD) in 32 patients.
