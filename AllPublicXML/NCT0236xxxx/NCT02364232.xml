    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effects of home-based or clinic-based
      bilateral training with and without mirror feedback programon on physiological markers,
      sensorimotor, cognition, daily functions, and participation among patients with chronic
      stroke.

    <description>Participants in home-based training graoup will receive 1.5 hours/ day, 3 days a week, for 4 contious weeks at home. Participants will receive 2 training stages, including bilateral training with mirror feedback for 30-45 minutes and functional training for 45-60 minutes. Each training stage hase to include above 2 activities.After the end of the home-based training, a four-week wash-out period followed. Then, patients will receive the clinic-based training for 4 continuous weeks.
Before and after the treatment, a total of 4 evaluations were conducted, including clinical assessments and blood test (each 9c.c.). One month after the end of the course of treatment will be assessed.</description>
