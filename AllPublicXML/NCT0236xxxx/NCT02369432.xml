      This proof of concept study aims to assess in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis if
      polymeric microparticles reach the pilosebaceous follicles of inflamed skin.

      Current treatments of inflammatory skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis or atopic
      dermatitis are primarily topical. They have the advantage of allowing the administration of
      active substances directly to the skin lesions.

      However local treatments may have drawbacks (complex application, local and/or systemic side
      effects...) and cause poor compliance.

      The use of drug carriers is viewed as one of the most promising strategies to target and
      control the release of active substances to various skin sites. Polymeric microparticles have
      shown to have a better stability and a more sustained release pattern than other types of
      drug vehicles such as liposomes.

      Based on the results obtained in our preclinical experiments, this proof of concept study
      aims to assess, in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, if biodegradable polymeric
      microparticles reach the pilosebaceous follicles of inflamed skin which would in turn serve
      as a reservoir of active substance.
