  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed integrated project will evaluate the effects of an evidence-based extension
      education program, Family Fitness Program (FFP) grounded in Stages of Change Learning Theory
      and guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), with and without a peer-education mode of
      delivery on balancing calories to manage body weight (BW), reducing certain foods and food
      components, increasing selected foods and nutrients, building healthy eating patterns [i.e.,
      fundamental principles of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs), 2010] and SCT
      variables. Briefly, the 12-week program will target early adolescent children, ages 11-14
      years, test a peer-education approach to behavioral change and will be delivered as an
      after-school program in local middle schools in support of childhood obesity prevention. Data
      will be collected at baseline (preintervention), after the 12-week program
      (post-intervention) and 6 months after completion of the program (maintenance).

      The 12-week intervention, either Family Fitness Program, FFP (adult-led control group) or
      Peer-education Family Fitness Program, PE-FFP (peer-led experimental group) will be delivered
      four times in each of the three schools participating in the study from May, 2015 to May 2017
      as an after-school program to early adolescent children, ages 11-14 years, to partially meet
      the stated objectives in research. The proposed integrated project will follow a
      group-randomized controlled trial design. The intervention will be offered as an after-school
      programs in each of 3 schools (Urbana Middle School, Franklin Middle School and Mahomet
      Seymour-Junior High School). Programs will be conducted on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesday, and
      Thursdays for 12 weeks. After children are enrolled in the program, weekday by school will be
      randomly assigned to the adult-led FFP (control group) or to the peer-led PE-FFP
      (experimental group). This process will allow children the convenience of participating in
      the program on the day that is most compatible with their schedules, offer the control and
      experimental conditions at each of 2 schools and maintain randomization to treatment. Thus,
      each school will have 1 control group and 1 experimental group each time the program is
      conducted. Group randomization will occur during the fall-winter 2016 term and spring-summer
      2017 term again. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention), after the 12-week FFP
      or PE-FFP (post-intervention) and 6 months after completion of the program (maintenance). The
      FFP addresses all major elements of the Dietary guidelines for Americans (DGAs), 2010. Each
      weekly lesson will include: 1) 20-30 minutes of moderate physical activity; 2) nutrition
      activities; 3) discussions; 4) self-reflections; 5) goal setting activities for healthier
      eating and physical activity; 6) food and beverage tasting experiences; and 7) parent-child
      reflections. Lesson details are provided below. Incentive items will be distributed
      throughout the 12-week intervention. Adult educators will lead FFP lessons, while
      peer-educators will lead PE-FFP lessons. Study personnel will be present at each lesson,
      along with Illinois-Trans-disciplinary Obesity Prevention Program (I-TOPP) trainees to
      monitor each session and to conduct extension measures.
