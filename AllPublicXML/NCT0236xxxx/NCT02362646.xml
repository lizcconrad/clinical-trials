  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research is to determine whether injecting mesenchymal precursor
      cells (MPC) into the heart during surgery to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
      is safe. MPCs are normally present in human bone marrow and have been shown to increase the
      development of blood vessels and new heart muscle cells in the heart. In addition, this
      research is being done to test whether injecting the MPCs into the heart is effective in
      improving heart function.

    <textblock>
      Intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal precursor cells (MPC) in patients with advanced
      heart failure who are treated with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation may
      result in a renewable source of proliferating functional cardiomyocytes; induce development
      of capillaries and larger-size blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to endogenous
      myocardium and newly-implanted cardiomyocytes; and release factors capable of paracrine
      signaling.

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>functional status, defined by the number of temporary weans from LVAD support tolerated over the 6 months post-randomization. A successful wean is the ability to tolerate temporary weaning from LVAD support for 30 minutes without sustained symptoms of worsening heart failure. Wean failures are defined as inability to tolerate the temporary wean for 30 minutes; death; or patient too unstable, in the judgment of the primary heart failure cardiologist, to tolerate the wean attempt.</description>
