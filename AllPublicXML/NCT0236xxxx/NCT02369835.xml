  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well modified Dakin's solution works in reducing
      radiation-induced dermatitis, a common skin reaction to radiation therapy, in patients with
      head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Modified Dakin's solution may reduce
      inflammation in the body, which may prevent or reduce dermatitis after radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients who develop grade 3 radiation dermatitis (as
      defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) as an adverse effect of
      radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy for a head and neck cancer when initiating the
      use of prophylactic hypochlorite (HOCl) (modified Dakin's solution) at the start of therapy
      (experimental arm) compared to placebo (control arm).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to development of grade 3 radiation dermatitis. II. Quality-of-life and pain levels
      (as assessed by the Modified Brief Pain Inventory) in the control arm versus the experimental
      arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EXPERIMENTAL): Patients apply modified Dakin's solution topically to skin that will be
      irradiated for 10 minutes within 3 hours before each radiation treatment.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Patients apply placebo solution topically to skin that will be irradiated
      for 10 minutes within 3 hours before each radiation treatment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6-10 weeks.

    <description>Will be assessed and graded in each arm by the treating physician, a radiation oncologist, who will give an individual score of the irradiated area at baseline, once weekly during radiation treatment course, at the end of the radiation treatment course +/- 10 days, and at the patient's follow up visit 6-10 weeks after completion of the radiation treatment course. The final grading for each time point will be subjected to inter-rater reliability processes. A multiple logistic regression model will be used controlling for type of chemotherapy (cisplatin, cetuximab, none).</description>
