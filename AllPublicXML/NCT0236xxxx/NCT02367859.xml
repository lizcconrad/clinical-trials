  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with
      ameloblastoma and a specific mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. Dabrafenib and trametinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the response rate of ameloblastoma to dabrafenib and trametinib at 6 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility and safety in this patient population. II. Response will be assessed
      pathologically. III. Two main histologic assays for treatment response will be used: tumor
      necrosis and phosphorylated-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK),
      phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Ki-67 levels as measured by
      immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) every 12 hours and trametinib 2 mg
      daily PO for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      whose disease is judged to be not amenable to resection will continue dabrafenib and
      trametinib indefinitely as long as there has not been tumor progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.

    <description>Routine Hematoxylin and Eosin slide review will measure extent of tumor necrosis. Percentage of tumor necrosis by volume assessed. The biopsy slide of the resection specimen examined and the volume of the necrosis compared to the volume of the total tumor determined by the centrally reviewing pathologists and percentage readouts of tumor necrosis, in increments of 10%, will be determined. In addition to measuring tumor necrosis the slide review will estimate therapy effect on intact cells by estimating the percent cells with therapy-associated nuclear atypia.</description>

    <description>Proliferation index evaluation will be performed in the laboratory on the initial pre-treatment biopsy and either the endpoint biopsy or the resection specimen. Ki-67 immunohistochemistry will be scored by at least two pathologists using percentage positive cells as the primary metric. The results of the immunohistochemical analysis will be expressed as both raw data in addition to a ratio between pre- and post- treatment.</description>
