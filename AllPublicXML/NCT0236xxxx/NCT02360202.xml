  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical observation frequently shows a paradoxical effect of topical corticosteroids in
      charge of a sudden melting of edema in the first days of treatment, which could be due to
      mobilization of extracellular. No study has shown the value of this measure in patients
      treated with topical steroids. This uncertainty, coupled with the observation of the
      paradoxical effects of topical steroids on edema are some patients that despite the systemic
      absorption of clobetasol propionate, a salt-free diet is not currently recommended practice.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate whether there is fluid retention after
      introduction of clobetasol propionate treatment from 10 g/day dosage to 40 g / day in
      patients with bullous pemphigoid. Bio-impedance is a noninvasive device for measuring with an
      electric current of low intensity the different volumes of the human body. A preliminary
      experiment of impedance measurements in some patients with bullous pemphigoid (examination
      requested as part of a nutritional assessment) showed that these patients had mostly a total
      water loss without dehydration, corresponding to a significant undernutrition during 1 month
      of treatment, possibly related to muscle wasting and protein loss by skin erosions without
      obvious argument for fluid retention, justifying reproduce these measures on a larger number
      of patients and the other to accurately assess the evolution of nutritional parameters during
      the first month of treatment.
