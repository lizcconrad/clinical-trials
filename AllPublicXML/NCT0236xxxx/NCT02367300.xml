      A prospective, non-randomized trial to validate the database of brain electrical activity
      recordings and clinical information collected from patients who present to the ED following
      closed head injury.

      The objective of this study is to validate the clinical utility of the BrainScope technology
      for the acute identification of structural brain injuries in a TBI population presenting to
      the ED with mild symptoms, following closed head injury.

        Subjects who are suspected of a traumatic, closed head injury within 72 hours will be
        recruited from patients who enter the Emergency Department at hospitals that are
        participating as clinical sites for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are admitted to the ED and are suspected of a traumatic, closed head
             injury within 72 hours. The patient will have a GCS 12-15 upon arrival to the ED even
             if GCS was lower prior to arrival to the ED (e.g., at the time of injury).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded who have forehead, scalp, or skull abnormalities or other
             conditions that would prevent correct application of the electrode headset on the
             skin.

          -  In addition,

               -  subjects with dementia,

               -  Parkinson's Disease,

               -  seizure disorder,

               -  brain tumors,

               -  history of brain surgery,

               -  evidence of acute psychosis,

               -  substance dependence,

               -  history of TIA or stroke within the last year,

               -  currently receiving dialysis or in end-stage renal disease,

               -  active fever defined as greater than 100 degrees F or 37.7 degrees C,

               -  current condition is &quot;critical&quot; in the opinion of the investigator,

               -  subject is suffering from an open head injury,

               -  subject requires advanced airway management (i.e. mechanical ventilation),

               -  currently receiving procedural sedation medications.

          -  Subjects below the age of 18 years, and prisoners will not be eligible for study.
