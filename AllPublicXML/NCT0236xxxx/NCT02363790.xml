      Introduction: While randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that laparoscopic ventral
      hernia repair (LVHR) as compared to open repair is associated with decreased rates of
      surgical site infection (SSI) and shorter lengths of hospital stay, the adoption of LVHR has
      been limited. Less than one-fourth of ventral hernias are repaired with a laparoscopic
      approach in the United States. One of the main reasons cited for the lack of widespread
      adoption of LVHR is failure to improve patient symptoms. Following LVHR, up to 70% of
      patients continue to complain of an abdominal bulge and one-third of patients complain of
      poor function. The investigators have previously reported that primary fascial closure (PFC)
      with LVHR is feasible and when compared to case-matched controls, PFC improved outcomes of
      recurrence, bulging, and patient function.

      Hypotheses: Primary Hypothesis: In patients undergoing LVHR, PFC as opposed to a bridged
      repair will improve patient reported satisfaction and function at 6 months of follow-up.
      Secondary Hypotheses: (1) PFC is safe and feasible to perform by general surgeons facile at
      LVHR. Compared to bridged LVHR, (2) PFC will decrease recurrence rates and (3) PFC will
      decrease the rate of clinician-diagnosed eventration following LVHR.

      Methods: A randomized controlled trial to compare the outcomes of two methods of LVHR:
      bridged repair with mesh or PFC with mesh will be performed. PFC is estimated to improve
      patient satisfaction and patient function from composite scores on the validated and
      hernia-specific Modified Activities Assessment Scale (best score of 100) of 72 ± 14 to 79 ±
      11. Assuming 20% attenuation in treatment effect, a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20,
      and 20% dropout rate, 176 patients will need to be randomized (n=88/group). The
      investigators' healthcare system performed 300 LVHRs last year. The investigators anticipate
      being able to accrue the sample size in 12 months. Randomization and Allocation: In the
      operating room, prior to mesh placement, the patient will be randomized using a
      computer-generated sequence in variable permuted blocks. Allocation will be through a phone
      call to the study office. Data Collection and Outcomes: A surgeon blinded to the treatment
      allocation will perform post-operative assessment at 14 days, 30 days, and 6 months
      post-operative. The primary outcome of patient-reported satisfaction and function will be
      assessed through the validated, hernia-specific survey, modified Activities Assessment Scale.
      Secondary outcomes will include all intra-operative complications related to PFC, hernia
      recurrence, clinician-assessed eventration, and any Dindo-Clavien 2-5 complication. Other
      patient reported outcomes assessed include likelihood to undergo the surgery again,
      likelihood to recommend surgery to their family or friends, and levels of pain.

      Analysis: The primary outcome will be compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. A Bayesian
      analysis will be performed to determine the posterior point estimates, credible intervals,
      and probability to decrease hernia recurrence with PFC will be calculated.

      Anticipated Results: This study will provide patients and providers with high-quality
      information on the risks and benefits of PFC versus bridging repair in LVHR. If efficacious,
      a multi-center effectiveness trial to assess long-term outcomes such as hernia recurrence can
      be performed.

    <description>Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair without closure of central defect (bridging repair)
Upon completion of the lysis of adhesions, the margins of the hernia defect will be measured and marked. The hernia defect size will be measured with the abdomen completely desufflated and insufflated at 15 mm Hg externally (on the skin).
A coated mesh with at least four cm of overlap on all sides will be placed. Mesh will be secured with at least four but no more than eight trans-fascial sutures. Titanium tacks will be placed in a double crown technique where tacks are placed every 1 cm on the periphery and every 3 cm along the fascial edge (bridged or closed).</description>

    <description>Ventral hernia repairs in the primary fascial group will be performed similarly except prior to placement of the mesh, the defect will be closed. After the defect size is measured, the mesh will be chosen based upon the unclosed defect size and size will not be adjusted. The hernia defect will be closed as described previously 9,10 with 0-prolene transfascial sutures placed every 1-2 cm. The two caudal-most and cranial-most sutures will be placed. The abdomen will be desufflated and these sutures will be secured. The abdomen will be reinsufflated to 15 mm Hg and the defect progressively closed. Upon completion of fascial closure, the mesh will be placed in the standard fashion as describe above. The lateral overlap will be increased due to the fascial closure.</description>
