      This study is a phase I, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the
      effects of renal or hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 with a single oral
      administration of TAK-272 in participants with renal or hepatic impairment as compared with
      participants with normal renal and hepatic function.

The Child-Pugh classification assesses the severity of 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, PT or INR, ascites and encephalopathy grade) on a scale of 1 (none) to 3 (moderate). Total hepatic impairment score ranges from 5 (mild) to 15 (severe) where higher score indicates more severity.</description>

            <description>Participants with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A score of 5-6) received TAK-272 40 mg, tablets, orally in fasted state, once on Day 1 of a 6-day treatment period with 2-day follow-up period. The Child-Pugh classification assesses the severity of 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, PT or INR, ascites and encephalopathy grade) on a scale of 1 (none) to 3 (moderate). Total hepatic impairment score ranges from 5 (mild) to 15 (severe) where higher score indicates more severity.</description>
