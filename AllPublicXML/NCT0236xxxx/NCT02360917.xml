  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, we have developed a novel curriculum for a 6-week
      psycho-educationally-based, cognitive behavioral program to help patients with subjective
      cognitive complaints after cancer treatment, titled Emerging from the Haze™ (Haze). Each
      series meets once a week for 2 hours for 6 weeks. The leading neuropsychologist covers
      material such as guided relaxation, behavioral strategies for automatic/negative thoughts,
      compensatory strategies for attention and memory, executive functioning, pacing, and balance.
      Each Haze series will be electronically delivered in a live format to our satellite site, The
      University of Kansas.

    <description>Participants assigned to the control group will be placed on a wait list for the Haze program. While they are waiting for admittance to the program, they will receive the same surveys as the participants who are taking the Haze class. Additionally, participants assigned to the control group will receive the surveys again when taking the class in order to allow comparison of the effects of the program on the control group. Participants assigned to the wait list will be enrolled in the following Haze series.</description>
