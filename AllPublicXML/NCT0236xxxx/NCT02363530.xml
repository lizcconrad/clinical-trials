      This randomized controlled subject- and examiner-masked study comprised patients scheduled
      for cataract surgery.The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either balanced salt
      solution（BSS）or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose（HPMC）2% gel （Cornea Protect）.Each subject
      should undertake examination including - rupture time (TBUT), height of the river of tears,
      fluorescence staining, Schirmer Ⅰ test, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and
      self-conscious symptom assessment questionnaire for assessment.

      This randomized controlled subject- and examiner-masked study comprised patients scheduled
      for cataract surgery.Over 100 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either balanced
      salt solution（BSS）or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose（HPMC）2% gel （Cornea Protect）.Each subject
      will accept 5 times assessments:the day before surgery, surgery day , the day after surgery,a
      week after surgery and a month after surgery.Each time a subject should undertake examination
      including - rupture time (TBUT), height of the river of tears, fluorescence staining,
      Schirmer Ⅰ test, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and self-conscious symptom assessment
      questionnaire et.al.The purpose is to evaluate the effect of Cornea Protect to maintain
      intraoperative clarity and to prevent the postoperative xerophthalmia.
