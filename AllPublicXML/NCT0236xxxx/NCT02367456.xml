    <textblock>
      This multi center open label Phase 1b study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of glasdegib (PF-04449913) when combined
      with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
      (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). This clinical
      study includes two components: (a) a safety lead in cohort (LIC) and (b) an expansion phase
      with an AML cohort and an MDS cohort.
