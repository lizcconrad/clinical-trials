      Background:

      - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of abnormal liver tests. It is
      closely linked to health problems like obesity and diabetes. Researchers want to use a breath
      test to measure the metabolism of fatty acids and learn more about the causes of disease.
      They will compare the results between people who do and do not have NAFLD. They will also
      repeat the test in people with NAFLD after treatment to see improvement.

      Objectives:

      - To measure the metabolism of fatty acids and compare them between people who do and do not
      have NAFLD, and people with NAFLD before and after treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  People age 21 and older with NAFLD

        -  Healthy volunteers

        -  non-NAFLD metabolic syndrome

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and fasting blood
           tests.

        -  Participants will fast overnight.

        -  Participants will sit in a comfortable chair. They will relax for 15 minutes. Then a
           narrow plastic tube will be put under their nostrils. It will be connected to a breath
           test device.

        -  Participants will drink palmitate or acetate in a heated liquid meal (Ensure). Palmitate
           is a fatty acid and acetate is a small molecule that is a building block for fatty
           acids. Both palmitate and acetate are natural compounds that are in our body and our
           food.

        -  Participants will sit for 6 hours. They can read, watch television, work on a computer,
           or other relaxed activity. The air they breathe out from their nose will be collected
           and analyzed. They may take a bathroom break after 3 hours. They may drink water after 3
           hours.

        -  Participants will get a meal after the test.

        -  Participants will have another visit at least 1 week later. They will repeat the test
           with the other compound (acetate of palmitate).

        -  Participants may be asked to repeat a test to study the result of a change like weight
           loss or medicine. Thus, participation can last from 1 week to several years.

      NAFLD is the most common cause for liver enzyme abnormalities in the western world. It is
      estimated to affect approximately 30% of the US population and is closely associated with the
      metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and
      abnormal function of the adipose tissue is thought to be a major feature of insulin
      resistance and NAFLD. Whether fatty acid oxidation is also dysregulated in patients with
      NAFLD is unclear. In this study we aim to measure total-body fatty acid oxidation of an oral
      fat load using the BreathID breath test device and a meal containing 13C-labeled palmitate.
      Results will be compared between patients with NAFLD, healthy controls and patients with
      metabolic syndrome but not NAFLD, as well as within NAFLD patients before and after
      therapeutic interventions.

        B. Inclusion Criteria for NAFLD:

          1. Clinical suspicion of NAFLD, defined by a liver biopsy result consistent with NAFLD or
             the presence of at least two of the following criteria:

               1. Suggestion of liver fat by an imaging study (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI or MR
                  spectroscopy) performed in the 6 months prior to enrollment.

               2. Elevated aminotransferase levels (ALT &gt; 31 U/L for men or &gt; 19 U/L for women, or
