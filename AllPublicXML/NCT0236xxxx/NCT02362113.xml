  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 300 adults would be included in the present cross-sectional study. glycemic index
      (GI) and glycemic load (GL) would be assessed by using a validated self-administered
      dish-based semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Validated Iranian versions of
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General Health Questionnaire-12 would be used to
      assess anxiety, depression and psychological distress.

      Frequency of 5 food groups will be asked in dish-based semi-quantitative food frequency
      questionnaire and they would be converted to grams. GI and GL will be estimated by using
      international table of GI and GL.

      Validated Iranian versions of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and General Health
      Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 were used to assess anxiety, depression and psychological distress.

      Possible score range for anxiety and depression is from 0 to 21. Scores of 8 or higher on
      either section were considered as the presence of anxiety or depression and scores of 7 or
      less were considered as normal status. In the present study, participants who got scores of 4
      or more from GHQ were considered to have psychological distress.
