    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a prospective randomized study to investigate the efficacy of
      intravenous (IV) preemptive paracetamol on postoperative pain scores, patient satisfaction,
      total morfin consumption and the incidence of morfinâ€‘related side effects in patients
      undergoing cesarean section.
