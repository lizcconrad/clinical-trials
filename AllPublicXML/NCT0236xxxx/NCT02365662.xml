  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2
      dose, maximum tolerated dose, and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ABBV-221
      in participants with advanced solid tumors likely to exhibit elevated levels of Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).

    <description>If a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABBV-221 will not be a dose higher than the defined MTD, and will be selected based on the type(s) and occurrence(s) of dose limiting toxicities which occur in addition to the MTD. If a MTD is not reached, then the RPTD will be defined based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data.</description>
