  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Few studies or literature are available about the long-term safety of repeated peptide
      vaccinations in people over a period of time. Long-term vaccination may be needed to control
      tumors. Researchers gave a group of men a series of vaccine injections over 2 years. Now they
      want to give those same men the new version of the vaccine. They want to see if it produces
      different types of immune responses and also ensure that repeated vaccinations are safe.

      Objectives:

      - To find out the long-term safety of repeated TARP peptide vaccinations.

      Eligibility:

      - Men who took part in NCI protocol 09-C-0139.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests, scans, physical exam, medical history,
           and an evaluation of how well they perform everyday activities.

        -  Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A
           machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood, minus the white cells, will be
           returned through a needle in the other arm.

        -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit, they will have a physical exam and
           blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.

        -  Participants will get vaccine injections at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24. The vaccine
           will be made from the participants own cells.

        -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to complete after receiving vaccine.

        -  The study lasts 96 weeks.

      TARP

        -  T-cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is an amino acid protein
           expressed by both normal and malignant prostate cancer tissue; 95% of prostate cancer
           specimens are positive for TARP expression. TARP is highly expressed in prostate cancers
           of all Gleason types, in primary as well as metastatic disease, and in hormone sensitive
           and castrate resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, TARP is an ideal tumor antigen target
           for a vaccine.

        -  A prospective, randomized pilot study of 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination (NCI
           09-C- 0139) utilizing TARP WT 27-35 and EE29-37-9V peptides was conducted in HLAA*
           0201positive men with stage D0 prostate cancer (PSA biochemical recurrence) and a PSA
           doubling time (PSADT) of greater than or equal to 3 months and less than or equal to 15
           months. TARP vaccination was found to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated, with
           adverse events limited to injection site reactions less than or equal to Grade 2. TARP
           vaccination was also associated with a decreased slope log PSA compared to
           pre-vaccination baseline in 72% of subjects reaching 24 weeks and 74% reaching 48 weeks
           (p=0.0012 and p=0.0004 for overall changes in slope log PSA, respectively); TARP
           vaccination also resulted in a 50% decrease in calculated tumor growth rate constant:
           prevaccine g = 0.0042/day, post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day (p=0.003); TARP-specific IFN- &gt;=
           ELISPOT responses were detected in the majority of subjects but did not correlate with
           decreases in slope log (PSA).

      Multi-Epitope (ME) TARP Vaccine

        -  The vaccine platform includes the original two 9-mer HLA-A*0201 binding TARP peptide
           epitopes (WT27-35 and EE29-37-9V) utilized in NCI 09-C-0139 as well as an additional
           five 20-mer TARP peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids for a total of 7 peptides that
           span the amino acid sequence of the entire TARP protein.

        -  The advantage of this multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform is that the
           overlapping epitopes cover the entire TARP protein, resulting in potential for induction
           of a multi-valent anti-TARP response. In addition, these longer synthetic peptides
           include TARP-specific MHC class II CD4+ T cell helper epitopes that will allow
           generation of better CD8+ T cell responses with improved functional avidity and
           longevity as well as humoral anti-TARP antibody responses.

      Study Objectives

      Primary Objective:

      -To assess the long-term safety of repeated TARP peptide vaccination following the use of a
