  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well a daily dose of 150 mg of Erivedge
      (vismodegib) reduces Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) size, and to evaluate the safety
      of this dose. Erivedge is FDA-approved for use in adults with a specific type of skin cancer.
      However, the drug is experimental for patients with KCOT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, interventional, single-arm, open-label, two-cohort clinical trial. A
      total of 20 patients will be enrolled (10 with NBCCS-associated KCOT and 10 with sporadic
      KCOT) over a period of 2 years. This is a 3 year study where each patient will undergo up to
      1 year of treatment and up to 2 years of post-treatment follow-up.

      All patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy of the study drug GDC-0449
      (Vismodegib).
