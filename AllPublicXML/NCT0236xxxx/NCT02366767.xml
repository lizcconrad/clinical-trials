      This study will be completed in two parts.

      The initial part of this study will be an inpatient evaluation of the system with the primary
      goal of assessing safety and feasibility. This will involve 8 subjects with type 1 diabetes,
      aged 14 - 40 years, admitted for up to 60 hour. Plasma glucose levels will be collected
      hourly and tested by YSI (YSI 2300, Yellow Springs Instrument). These studies will be
      performed at Stanford University and will include group sporting activities to mimic the
      diabetes camp environment. Capillary blood glucose testing will be performed every 2-3 hours
      before meals, snacks, exercise, and prebed by subjects with research staff supervision during
      the day and at 00:00, 03:00 and 07:00 by research staff. These data will be reviewed by the
      DSMB before proceeding to camp studies.

      The second part of this study will be to test the efficacy of the system during diabetes
      summer camps. We will test the system in subjects with type 1 diabetes, aged 14-40 years,
      attending diabetes camp. There will be 20 subjects recruited, with 10 subjects randomized to
      the control arm Medtronic 530G system with threshold suspend (control group) and 10 subjects
      randomized to the automatic closed-loop insulin delivery (intervention group). Capillary
      blood glucose testing will be performed every 2-3 hours before meals, snacks, exercise and
      prebed by subjects with research staff supervision and at 00:00, 03:00 and 07:00 by research
      staff. The primary aim of this study is to generate preliminary data of system safety and
      efficacy in a closely supervised environment that challenges glucose control.
