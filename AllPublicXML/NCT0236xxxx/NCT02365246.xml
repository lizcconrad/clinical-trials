  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of IgE through adsorption of IgE on a specially designed column after apheresis of
      blood has the potential to improve the severity of atopic dermatitis.

      In this study the investigators will treat patients with a severe form of Atopic dermatitis
      not responding or having to much side effects to systemic imunosuppressive treatment with
      this modality.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with immunoadsorption on 4 consecutive days week 1 and three
      consecutive days week 5 and week 9.

      The clinical improvement and histological and serological tests will be evaluated.
