  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether baseline DOC screening can add to
      clinical and demographic data to predict the occurrence of a composite negative outcome (any
      of: recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, death, or admission to a long-term care (LTC) /
      complex continuing care (CCC) facility) within one year of screening, in stroke prevention
      clinic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DOC screen will be routinely applied to all patients presenting to three high volume
      Regional Stroke Prevention Clinics (combined first visits &gt;2,800 patients per year). Data
      will be abstracted from the patient chart using methodologies developed and validated in the
      Registry of the Ontario Stroke Network. The investigators have REB approval to collect this
      data and to link with administrative datasets through the Institute for Clinical and
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The investigators will use regression models to determine whether
      DOC screen scores add to baseline clinical and demographic data to predict the main negative
      outcomes. The investigators hope to identify which patients presenting to TIA/stroke
      prevention clinics are at highest risk of adverse long-term events so focused interventions
      can be developed to improve survival, outcomes and function of stroke prevention clinic
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive patients referred to regional stroke prevention clinics.

          -  This includes those discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of stroke or TIA, as
             well as emergency department referrals.

          -  The DOC CRF will also be completed for patients who are unable to complete the screen
             due to severe aphasia, severe motor dysfunction and language barriers (those who are
             not fluent in English without translation available).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose reason for referral to the clinic is neither Stroke nor TIA, as well as
             those who have been admitted to LTC/CCC facilities at the time of clinic visit.
