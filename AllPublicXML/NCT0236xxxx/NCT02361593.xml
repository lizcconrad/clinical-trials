      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of transparent cap-assisted
      endoscopic sclerotherapyI(lauromacrogol injection) in management of esophageal varices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic procedures now play a great role in management of esophagogastric varices.
      Endoscopic variceal ligation(EVL) was recommended as first line therapy for primary and
      secondary prophylaxis in patients with esophageal varices. Previous studies have showed a
      superiority of EVL over endoscopic injection of sclerotherapy(EIS), mainly because of lower
      occurrence rate of complications. Procedure related complications were related to total
      amount of lauromacrogol, number of treatment and expertise of the endoscopists. Transparent
      cap has already been reported to assist in other endoscopic procedures, such as biopsy of
      Barret esophagus or endoscopic submucosal dissection. Accuracy and vision were improved with
      the help of transparent cap in the front of endoscopy. We have tried transparent cap-assisted
      sclerotherapy in some patients with in our hospital. Now a randomized controlled trial was
      conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of transparent cap-assisted endoscopic
      sclerotherapy in management of esophageal varices.
