      The primary objective of this trial is to measure changes in hepatic lipid content using
      three common alternative therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control in patients with
      type 2 diabetes who are not controlled with metformin alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control is not accomplished with Metformin
      alone, there are several options for additional hypoglycemic agent. As per recent National
      guidelines at least three &quot;second line&quot; agents can be added to metformin: thiazolidinediones,
      Lantus insulin, and DPP4 inhibitors. All three approaches have been proven to help
      accomplishing goals of therapy for glycemic control (HbA1c&lt;7%) in clinical trials. Whether
      one approach is superior to the other in improving associated non-glycemic metabolic
      abnormalities and risk for future morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes
      remains a matter of intense debate. Among these abnormalities, excessive triglyceride content
      in the liver (fatty liver or liver steatosis) is a major predictor of risk for non-alcoholic
      steato-hepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis. Fatty liver is highly prevalent in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. There are no clinical studies done to determine if any of these three
      therapeutic options is superior at reducing the liver triglyceride content in patients with
      type 2 diabetes and fatty Liver. Therefore, in this study we propose to measure and compare
      the effects on liver triglyceride content when either pioglitazone, lantus insulin, or DPP4
      inhibitors are added to metformin in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes
      (HbA1c&gt;7.6%) and fatty liver (presence of &quot;bright&quot; liver in abdominal ultrasound). The
      primary objective of this trial is to measure changes in hepatic lipid content using three
      common alternative therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2
      diabetes who are not controlled with metformin alone.
