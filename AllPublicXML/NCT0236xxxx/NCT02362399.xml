      To detect the effect of sildenafil citrate on Doppler parameters in fetuses suffering from
      growth restriction to support its use later as prolonged therapy in those pregnancies at
      higher risk for such complication.

      Participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio into one of the following drug regime:

      Group (I): &quot;sildenafil citrate group&quot; This group consisted of 22 women who received single
      oral dose of 50 mg sildenafil citrate.

      Group (II): &quot;placebo group&quot; This group consisted of 22 women who received single oral dose of
      placebo. All participants were evaluated by ultrasound once they admitted and again after
      2-hours following administration of either of the treatment tablets. One sonographer was
      allocated to evaluate all mothers included in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients were admitted to the study based on the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Any age and any party.

          2. Body mass index between 25 and 35.

          3. Singleton pregnancy.

          4. Gestational age of 24 weeks or more. Gestational age was established on the basis of
             menstrual dates and confirmed by first or second trimester ultrasound for booked
             patients, however, if a difference of &gt; 7 days or &gt; 10 days during first or second
             trimester respectively, then ultrasound value was used. For unbooked patients they
             still have the chance to be included in our study if they can bring a scan that showed
             gestational age during the same period mentioned before.

          5. Idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction.

          6. Intrauterine growth restriction due to maternal malnutrition, maternal medical
             disorder as anemia, pregnancy induced hypertension, or chronic renal disease.

          7. Intrauterine growth restriction due to substance abuse (including smoking).

          8. With or without past history of intrauterine growth restriction .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intrauterine growth restriction due to fetal causes as congenital abnormalities, fetal
             infection, or multiple gestation.

          2. Any drug therapy that can affect fetal growth or fetal blood supply.

          3. Maternal diseases that contraindicates the use of sildenafil citrate
