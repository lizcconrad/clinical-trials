    <textblock>
      This randomized, pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of berberine chloride in
      treating patients with ulcerative colitis and who are in remission (a decrease in or
      disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer) to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
      Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. Chemoprevention
      is the use of drugs, such as berberine chloride, to keep a disease/condition from forming or
      coming back. The use of berberine chloride may keep colorectal cancer from forming in
      patients with ulcerative colitis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of berberine (berberine chloride) administered to participants
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission while receiving maintenance therapy with
      mesalamine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the molecular efficacy of berberine by examining the following biomarkers:

        -  Plasma-based measures of inflammation, including the blood C-reaction protein (CRP)
           level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and cytokines such as TNFa, IL-4, IL-6,
           IL-8 and IL-10 measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

        -  Tissue-based measures of inflammation, including TNFα, COX-2, and NF-kappa (κ)B by
           immunohistochemistry (IHC), and anti-cancer action, including antigen Ki-67 (Ki67) and
           activated caspase-3 by IHC, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation on SFRP1,
           TCERG1L FBN2, TFPI2 using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP)
           strategy.

      II. Clinical efficacy: UC related symptoms will be measured using the Ulcerative Colitis
      Disease Activity Index (i.e. the Mayo score) (UCDAI).

      III. Histological analysis for inflammation: severity of histologic inflammation will be
      evaluated using the Geboes grading system.

      IV. Determine plasma concentration of berberine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive berberine chloride orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for 90 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo PO TID for 90 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow-up for 30 days.
