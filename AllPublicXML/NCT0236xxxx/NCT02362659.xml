  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational registry is to compare the safety and efficacy of an
      antithrombotic regimen comprising one single antiplatelet agent plus an oral anti-thrombotic
      versus those consisting of DAPT alone or DAPT plus oral antithrombotic therapy. This registry
      will assess whether the antithrombotic therapy intensity will vary positively with physician
      perceived ischemic risk at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and whether
      an inverse association will be observed with perceived bleeding risk.

      This study will also evaluate the physician use of objective benefit-risk assessment scores
      and their influence on prescription of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF)
      patients undergoing PCI. Additionally the study will investigate whether patient perceived
      relevance and accessibility of anti-platelet and anticoagulant treatment regiments will
      predict treatment adherence and whether non-adherence will independently influence outcome.

      Approximately 2500 subjects with non-valvular AF undergoing all-comer PCI with stenting will
      be enrolled in North America and Europe, sites to be determined. Follow-up will be done via
      telephone by trained research coordinators at each participating site at 30 days, 6 months
      and 12 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current AHA guidelines on AF for patients undergoing PCI are non-specific as they
      recommend &quot;low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d), which
      may be given concurrently with anticoagulation to prevent myocardial ischemic events, but
      these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk
      of bleeding.

      Finding the right balance that minimizes bleeding risk and maintains anti-ischemic efficacy
      remains a complex and controversial clinical dilemma in these unique patients. The arrival of
      novel antiplatelet agents and antithrombotics on the scene has led to an exponential increase
      in the combinations that may be employed by clinicians in real-life situations. The sheer
      number of combinations means that the best APT and OAC combination based on RCT data will not
      be known for many years. It has therefore become imperative that the investigators strive to
      create better methods to gauge the comparative safety and efficacy for various antiplatelet
      and antithrombotic combination strategies in AF patients undergoing PCI. To the best of the
      investigators knowledge, no contemporary prospective registry of real-life patients with AF
      undergoing PCI exists or has been initiated to date. Additionally, the factors influencing
      physician choice of treatment strategy as well as factors predicting patient adherence in
      this population is largely unknown.

      This is a multi-center, multinational, observational prospective registry prospective
      analysis of 2500 patients with non-valvular AF undergoing all-comer PCI with stenting at up
      to 50 Northern American and European centers. Patients will be followed for 12 months
      following implantation of stent. Data will be collected prospectively. All-antiplatelet and
      anti-thrombotic treatment regimen will be at the physicians' discretion. The investigators
      will study various combinations of antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies, characterize
      the bleeding and ischemic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI and to
      determine physician and patient centered factors influencing prescription patterns and
      patient adherence.

      Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone successful PCI will be
      enrolled as soon as possible post procedure and no later than before discharge of the index
      admission. The treating physician (interventional or non-interventional cardiologist) that
      prescribes the anti-platelet or/and anticoagulant therapy must complete the physician
      questionnaire. A different, patient centered questionnaire will be completed by the patient.
      The Principal Investigator or designee will provide instructions to enrolled subjects and
      physicians on how to use the hand held electronic device or how to complete the paper
      questionnaire and clarify any questions about the questionnaires. The enrolled subjects and
      physicians will themselves enter the responses to the questionnaire on the electronic hand
      held device or the paper questionnaire. Only patients with completed questionnaires will be
      considered enrolled.

      Treatment will be according to physician.
