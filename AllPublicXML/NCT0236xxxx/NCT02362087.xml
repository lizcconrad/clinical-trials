    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document what course of action physicians choose for their
      patients when they develop taxane acute pain syndrome (TAPS) and to identify patients at the
      greatest risk of TAPS by examining specific human genome markers such as single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) that may explain the genetic
      (hereditary) component.
