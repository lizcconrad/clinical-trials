  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of canine-assisted activity visits on
      patients and staff in a hospital setting. The Caring Canines program uses dogs who have been
      trained to be obedient, calm and comforting. It involves a visit by a volunteer (called the
      dog's handler) and the volunteer's dog that has been trained and tested to have a good
      personality and to follow commands. A visit typically lasts about 10-15 minutes with the
      patient interacting with the dog while the dog is supervised by the handler. Memorial Sloan
      Kettering currently has Caring Canine dogs visit patients but the investigators don't yet
      know the impact of these visits on patients and staff. The investigators would like to see
      how the Caring Canine visits impact a patients' mood, including anxiety, stress, and sense of
      well-being. Two groups of patients will take part in this study - the first group will
      receive standard post surgery care and will not receive a visit from the Caring Canines
      program and the second group will receive daily visits (Tuesday -Friday) from the Caring
      Canines program while they are on M15. The purpose of this study is to look at differences in
      well-being between patients who have the visits with the dogs and patients who do not.

    <description>For the staff portion of this study a longitudinal pre and post intervention design will be used. Baseline staff assessments will occur prior to the Caring Canine program being implemented on the unit. The assessments include questions about compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue as well as some open ended questions about your thoughts on the Caring Canines program. Post assessment will occur after the program has been active on the unit for at least 6 weeks. Only staff who work at least one Monday - Friday day shift each week will be eligible to participate.</description>
