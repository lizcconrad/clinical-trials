  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposes that addition of high protein plant based diet will improve serum albumin
      as well serum phosphate for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Dialysis. Patient
      will be provided additional food items to help improve their nutritional status.

      The purpose of this study is to improve the albumin and nutritional status of patient with
      ESRD on dialysis. Serum albumin is a marker to show how well the patient's overall nutrition
      is. When albumin level drops it signifies poor outcome in dialysis patients both in terms of
      complications as well as mortality. Our goal on dialysis is to improve serum albumin level as
      close to normal as possible. This study intends to also improve phosphorus level by adding
      high protein sources which are plant based. In this study we intend to add certain plant
      based food items which are high in protein content. Studies have shown that these particular
      food items considerably increase serum albumin level but at the same time they are safe as
      they do not increase the phosphorous levels in kidney patients. Patients will be provided the
      additional food items and all their nutritional parameters will be monitored at baseline and
      during the study period of one month
