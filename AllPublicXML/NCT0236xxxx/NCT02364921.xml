    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilayer compression
      bandage (two layers), compared with the crepe bandage, on healing of venous leg ulcers, in
      patients attended in nursing Primary Care Health Centres, at 12 weeks follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This study also compares the effectiveness of the multilayer and the crepe bandage, on
      healing of venous leg ulcers measured by the Resvech 2.0 scale and evaluates improvement in
      quality of life, measured by the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire (CCVUQ-e) and
      analyze the sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment factors associated with complete
      healing of venous ulcers.

      Design: Multicentre, controlled, parallel group, randomized clinical trial, with blind
      evaluation of the response variable.

      Setting: Primary Care Health Centres (Madrid). Subjects: Patients with venous leg ulcers,
      treated by nurses at the participating centres.

      Intervention: Experimental group: multilayer compression bandage (two layers). Control group:
      crepe bandage.

      Sample size: 216 patients (108 in each group) Variables:Main: Complete healing after 12 weeks
      follow-up. Secondary: Degree of healing (Resvech 2.0). Quality of life (CCVUQ-e). Adverse
      reactions. Related to the healing process: comorbidities, topical and systematic treatments,
      exercise, BMI. Prognostic factors: location, number and duration of ulcer. Sociodemographic
      factors Data analysis: By intention to treat. Comparative analysis of the two groups
      (chi-squared or t-test). Effectiveness analysis sing Kaplan-Meier, log rank test and cox
      regression analysis
