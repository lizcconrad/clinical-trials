      This study plans to learn more about transfusion of a human blood component called plasma in
      patients who have liver problems. Patients are asked to be in this study because they have
      liver disease and therefore may require the transfusion of plasma.

      The dose of plasma required to reach certain blood clotting laboratory targets is usually
      determined by clinicians. Due to the complexity of the patient's blood clotting disorder,
      determining the appropriate dose of plasma is very difficult. The investigators have
      developed a dosing table based on information from other patients with liver disease and the
      investigators are testing it to see if it is a more accurate dosing tool then clinician
      chosen dosing of plasma in patients with liver disease who need one or more plasma
      transfusions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians currently transfuse plasma to International Normalized Ratio (INR) targets without
      an understanding of the dose response characteristics of plasma in bleeding patients with
      liver disease. Epidemiologic studies show that INR is infrequently corrected to target INR
      values after clinician chosen plasma transfusion doses in patients with liver disease. Plasma
      transfusion is frequently given to patients prior to procedures and during active bleeding in
      this patient population though there are no dosing guidelines to aid clinicians in reaching
      INR targets in patients with liver disease. Previous studies suggest that patients with liver
      disease may need more plasma then patients without liver disease to correct any given
      pre-transfusion INR to the same post-INR target.

      Current physician dosing of plasma is variable and rarely successful at reaching stated INR
      targets. The INR thresholds commonly used triggers for plasma transfusion by
      Gastro-Intestinal (GI), Hepatology and critical care physicians at our institution range from
      1.5-3.0 in bleeding or pre-procedural patients with liver disease representing tremendous
      variability. When we evaluated plasma transfusion dosing practices in bleeding patients with
      liver disease over 8 years, we demonstrated that these same physicians rarely met stated
      theoretical targets. Over or under dosing plasma in these patient may lead to serious
      clinical complications.

    <description>Admitted University of Colorado Hospital or Denver Health bleeding patients with chronic liver disease determined to receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical indications as determined by hospital clinician. The total dose will be determined by the physician's judgment which is the current standard of care. The physician chosen dose will be utilized but physician will be unaware of which dosing strategy has been utilized.
An INR measurement will be performed within 1 hour after the entire transfusion of plasma has been administered. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be collected. No other transfused blood component, crystalloid or colloidal fluid will be infused between the first and second INR studies except plasma</description>

    <description>Admitted University of Colorado Hospital or Denver Health bleeding patients with chronic liver disease determined to receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical indications as determined by hospital clinician. This group will receive plasma doses based on the study dosing algorithm table.
A pre-transfusion INR and a target post-transfusion INR will be used to determine dose of FFP. The study table will reveal the dose in (ml/kg) of FFP to be transfused. An INR measurement will be performed within 1 hour after the entire transfusion of plasma has been administered. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be collected. No other transfused blood component,crystalloid or colloidal fluid will be infused between the first and second INR studies except plasma.</description>
