  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-centre dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial of ONX-0801.

      The study will evaluate two schedules of ONX-0801 concurrently: once weekly and alternate
      week dosing, of repeated 28-day treatment cycles.

      The study will consist of two stages: the dose escalation phase, in which the recommended
      phase II dose will be determined; and the expansion phase, in which up to 30 patients will be
      treated at the recommended phase II dose and schedule to further support the design of
      subsequent trials of ONX-0801.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the dose escalation phase, patients will be enrolled alternately to either:

        -  a q1wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days
           1, 8, 15 and 22 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 1 mg/m2
           for the first cohort; OR

        -  a q2wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days
           1 and 15 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 2 mg/m2 for the
           first cohort;

      Cohorts of 3 patients will receive ONX-0801 at escalating doses on each schedule until a Dose
      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occur and an Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined for each
      schedule.

      Once the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule has been established, additional
      patients may be recruited in a dose expansion phase to a maximum total of 30 patients to
      further characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics. This subgroup of patients
      will be limited to those expected to have high rates of over expression of α-FR, such as
      patients with ovarian or endometrial, cancer.

      Approximately 66 patients with solid tumours will be entered into this study.

      Dose escalation: Approximately 18 patients in each schedule in the dose escalation phase. The
      final number for the dose escalation phase will depend on the number of dose escalations
      required to reach DLT.

      Dose expansion: Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase, and this
      cohort will be enriched with patients with tumour types expected to have high rates of over
      expression of α-folate receptor, including ovarian and endometrial cancer. A minimum of 20
      patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will be enrolled.

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the DDU
             should not exclude the patient

          -  Patients with new brain metastases. Patients with treated (surgically excised or
             irradiated) and stable brain metastases are eligible as long as the treatment was at
             least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study drug and brain MRI within 2 weeks of
             initiation of study drug is negative for new metastases.

          -  Patients with pulmonary metastases

          -  History of thoracic radiation or other history likely to create pre-existing lung
             disease

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.

          -  Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

          -  Patients with sub-acute bowel obstruction

          -  Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of ONX-0801. Participation in an
             observational trial would be acceptable.

          -  Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
