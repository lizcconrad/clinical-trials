      Aim of this study is to evaluate the decrease of plantar pain of forefeet due to restoration
      of plantar pad tissue density and of cushioning function with an hyaluronic acid dermal
      filler as mechanical-supplementation in subjects with metatarsalgia further use of high heel
      shoes
