    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 29 (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. Trough FEV1 was obtained from spirometry, performed before study treatment administration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sputum Cell Counts Over 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum cell counts included total neutrophils counts and differential (percent [%]), total cell count, total macrophage count and differential (%). Change over 4 weeks was to be presented.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FVC is the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FEV1 Baseline and Change at Week 4 are already reported under Primary Outcome Measure 1.</description>

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 29 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Day 29 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.
