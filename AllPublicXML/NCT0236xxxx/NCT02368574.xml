    <textblock>
      Based on the value-based medicine, a randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the
      role of class II and class III hysterectomy in patients with low risk early staged cervical
      cancer (defined as tumor lesions less than 2cm with less than 50% stromal invasion).

      This is a 1:1 multi-center randomized trial with class II hysterectomy plus node dissection
      as the experimental arm, and class III hysterectomy plus pelvic node dissection as the
      control arm. Primary endpoints are: (1). 3-year diseases-free survival (DFS) rate; (2) the
      rates of treatment-related toxicity; (3) post-operation QoL (including sexual function) and
      (4) treatment costs. Secondary endpoints areï¼š(1) the rates of pelvic and/or extra-pelvic
      relapse; (2) overall survival(OS) rate; (3) the numbers of retroperitoneal node dissection,
      and (4) the rates of parametrial, margins and pelvic/para-aortic nodes involvement.

    <description>Class III hysterectomy (radical hysterectomy): This procedure may be performed through laparotomy or laparoscope. Perivesical space and perirectal space should be opened, and the ureteral tunnel is completely separated and pushed down to the junction of ureter and urinary bladder. The uterine arteries are ligated at the level of internal iliac artery, and all the supporting ligaments and connective tissues around the uterus should be separated and abscised. The uterosacral ligament is removed near the sacrum, the cardinal ligament is removed near the pelvic wall, and the vagina is removed after the excision of peivaginal connective tissues, about 3-4cm from the cervical lesion. The pelvic lymph nodes are usually dissected at the same time.</description>

    <description>Class II hysterectomy (modified radical hysterectomy): This procedure may be performed through laparotomy or laparoscope. The scope of surgery is more extensive than Class I epifascial panhysterectomy, demanding the excision of more parametrium but reservation of the blood supply for distal ureter and urinary bladder. The ureter is separated from the ureteral tunnel, the vesicouterine ligament should be intact, and 1/2 uterosacral ligament and 1cm vagina are excised. The pelvic lymph nodes are usually dissected at the same time.</description>
