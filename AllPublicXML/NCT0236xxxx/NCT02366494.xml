      Identify exosomal micro RNA that predict responses to ADT

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Identify novel exosomal RNA signatures at pretreatment that predict response to ADT.

           We will collect blood samples from patients with systemic disease pretreatment (at
           enrollment), 3 months post treatment and at the time of progression of disease (or at
           two years post ADT for patients still in remission at that time point) and then perform
           next generation sequencing using serum exosomal RNAs derived from these patients.

           We plan to identify exosomal RNAs signatures that change between pre-treatment (at
           enrollment) and during treatment (at 3 month) and further explore the effect of these
           changes on disease response. We also plan to compare exosomal RNA levels between
           patients relapse within the first 2 years versus those in remission at 2 years. Among
           patients with progression, we plan to compare exosomal RNA signatures at progression of
           disease to signatures at pretreatment and during treatment.

        2. Validate exosomal RNA markers that predict response to ADT by real-time RT-PCR.

      Secondary objectives:Selected RNAs, identified through the above process will be validated
      using real-time RT-PCR assay to test reproducibility of RNA sequencing results. We expect to
      select and validate approximate 5 RNA markers that predict duration of response to ADT.

    <description>We will first identify two cohorts of patients, patients with intermediate/high risk features at diagnosis status post definitive treatment , now with biochemical relapse and clinical metastatic PC patients with high volume disease
Subsequently we will collect blood samples from these patients pretreatment (at enrollment), 3 months post treatment and at the time of progression of disease (or at two years post ADT for patients still in remission at that time point) and then perform next generation sequencing using serum exosomal RNAs derived from these patients.</description>
