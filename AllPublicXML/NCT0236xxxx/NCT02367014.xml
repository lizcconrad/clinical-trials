  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 1/2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, multiple ascending
      dose, placebo-controlled study, enrolling an anticipated 36 subjects with mitochondrial
      myopathy associated with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of MTP-131 in this patient
      population.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of mitochondrial disease believed to impair the mitochondrial respiratory
             chain.

          -  Eligibility requires prior genetic confirmation of mitochondrial disease.

          -  Diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy judged by the Investigators to be due to existing
             mitochondrial disease.

          -  Subject must be able to complete a Screening Visit 6MWT.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use birth control as specified in the
             protocol from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the last dose of study
             drug.

          -  Eligible subjects may be required to stay overnight in the clinical research center
             for the duration of their study participation lasting up to 7 consecutive days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior or current medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             would prevent the subject from safely participating in and/or completing all study
             requirements.

          -  Hospitalized (admitted as in-patient) within 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  A history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

          -  Uncontrolled Type 1 (T1DM) or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  A creatinine clearance &lt;45 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft Gault equation.

          -  Requires pacemaker, defibrillator, or has undergone cardiac surgery within 2 years of
             the Screening Visit.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic) at the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Subject has participated in another interventional clinical trial within 3 months of
             the screening visit or is currently enrolled in a non-interventional clinical trial
             judged by the Investigator to be incompatible with the current trial.

               -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
