  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postdural puncture headaches (PDPH) are a consequence of spinal and epidural anesthesia in
      approximately 1% of cases when performed in obstetric patients. The gold standard treatment
      for a PDPH is currently an epidural blood patch (EBP), which involves placing a needle back
      into the epidural space of the neuraxium and then injecting 20 ml of the patient's own blood
      through the needle and into the epidural space to form a clot over the insult in the tissue
      layer that causes the headaches. The investigators want to test the efficacy of using a less
      invasive procedure, called a sphenopalatine block (SPGB), for treatment of PDPH. SPGB has
      been used for many years in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches, and there are
      several case reports of its use to successfully treat PDPH as well. SPGB simply involves
      applying a local anesthetic to the mucosa in the back of each nostril to numb the nerves that
      cause the headache. The investigators hope that the SPGB will reduce the number of PDPH
      patients that require and EBP.
