      The primary objective is to determine if a difference exists in functional outcomes, as
      measured by the Constant score, when comparing nonoperative management and locking plate
      surgical fixation of low-energy displaced proximal humerus fractures in the elderly
      population over a 2-year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of
      the ASES score, the SF-36 quality of life score, complication rates, re-operation rates,
      radiographic time to union, radiographic malunion, hardware position and evidence of
      avascular necrosis or posttraumatic osteoarthritis .

    <description>Treatment will consist of sling immobilization for a period of 6 weeks. Details and treatment timeline as follows:
0 - 3 weeks: immobilization with a shoulder sling, range of motion of elbow, hand and wrist
3 - 6 weeks: same as 0-3 weeks, with addition of pendulum exercises every two hours
After 6 weeks: Active mobilization and removal of sling. Light activity permitted and physiotherapy for range of motion permitted as tolerated.
After 6 months: no further restriction will be placed. Full home and work activity permitted.</description>

Provision of pre-operative intravenous (IV) antibiotic prophylaxis:
Administration of general anesthetic.
Patient positioning and preparation:
Patient is carefully placed in the beach-chair position,
Deltopectoral approach Fracture reduction and fixation with confirmation with intraoperative fluoroscopy images.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Displaced 2- or 3-part proximal humerus fractures by the Neer classification.

          2. Displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures by the Neer classification that are deemed
             amenable to surgical fixation.

          3. &gt; 60 years of age

          4. Low energy mechanism of injury

          5. Acute fracture (&lt;3 weeks)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. 4-part proximal humerus fractures that are not deemed amenable to surgical fixation
             (eg. due to osteopenic bone, thin head or tuberosity fragments); fractures that are
             better suited to treatment with arthroplasty

          2. Isolated greater tuberosity fractures

          3. Ipsilateral upper extremity significant injury, concomitant fracture or polytrauma

          4. Open fracture

          5. Previous ipsilateral shoulder surgery

          6. Patients with active worker's compensation claims (due to the expectation of lower
             rates of success in this patient population)

          7. Active joint or systemic infection

          8. Patients with convulsive disorders, collagen diseases, and any other conditions that
             might affect the mobility of the shoulder joint

          9. Major medical illness (life expectancy less than 2 years, unacceptably high operative
             risk, or not medically cleared by preoperative anesthesia consult)

         10. Unable to speak or read English/French

         11. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent

         12. Unwilling to be followed for 2 years
