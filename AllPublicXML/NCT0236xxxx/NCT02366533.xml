      The goal of ATN 093 is to determine program-level factors associated with the effectiveness
      of SMILE in Caring for Youth Linkage-to-Care (LTC) program network at the 15 Adolescent
      Medicine Trial Units (AMTU). This will be accomplished by evaluating and categorizing the
      various LTC programs at the AMTUs and then examining the association between the LTC program
      characteristics (providers, practices, and systems) and the proportion of Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected youth, ages 12-24 years old, inclusive, linked to care
      and maintained in care. As such, this study focuses on LTC programs at the AMTUs as the unit
      of analysis and not the youth themselves.

    <description>This study will be conducted at the 15 ATN-funded clinical sites, known as the Adolescent Medicine Trial Units (AMTU). Each enrolling site must have the capability to input field data that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Strategic Multisite Initiative for the Identification, Linkage, and Engagement in Care of Youth with Undiagnosed HIV Infection (SMILE in CARING for YOUTH) Project.</description>

        Research will be performed on 15 AMTU sites' ability to implement the CDC/NICHD linkage to
        care project. The &quot;study population&quot; is the 15 AMTU research sites. The 15 AMTUs are
        located in 12 U.S. cities (there are 2 sites located in New York City and 2 sites in
        Chicago) and 1 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
