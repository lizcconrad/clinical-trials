  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common and potentially life threatening condition
      arising from a variety of pathological conditions. The ability to monitor ICP is a crucial
      aspect in the management of these patients. Currently, the diagnosis of whether ICP is
      elevated or not is determined either with clinical signs (headache, nausea and vomiting or
      visual disturbances) or from the changes in the preoperative neuroimaging modalities such as
      computerized tomography (CT scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Recently, transorbital ultrasonography has gained popularity as a noninvasive bedside exam
      that has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of raised ICP by evaluating the change in
      the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD).

      The aim of our study is to use transorbital ultrasound to evaluate ONSD changes in patients
      with intracranial pathology and to compare the changes in the ONSD before and after surgical
      intervention as well as between patients with and without clinical or radiological signs of
      increased ICP.
