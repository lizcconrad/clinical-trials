      The intention of this study is to determine wether coffee added milk change gastric volume in
      comparison with gastric volume after drinking black coffee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty participants - divided in tree groups - drink coffee with or without milk after six
      hours fast for solid food. Each group drinks both coffee with or without milk in different
      order. Two hours after drinking coffee gastric volume is measured by Magnetic Resonance
      Imagining.

    <description>Intervention :30 participants were randomized to 3 Groups, 10 persons in each group. All participants fasted 6 hours for solid food before gastric volume was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imagining ( MRI). 2 hours before MRI examination, each participant ingested either 175 ml black coffee, 175 ml coffee with 20% milk or 175 ml coffee with 50% milk in the order defined for the group (arm).</description>
