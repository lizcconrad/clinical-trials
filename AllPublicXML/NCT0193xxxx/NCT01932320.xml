  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a single dose of
      two solid dose formulations relative to a nanosuspension formulation of JNJ-40411813 (Part
      1); to evaluate the effect of a high-fat/high-calorie breakfast on the rate and extent of
      absorption of the selected JNJ-40411813 solid dose formulation from Part 1 (Part 2); and to
      explore the influence of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole, on the rate and extent
      of absorption of the selected JNJ-40411813 solid dose formulation from Part 1 (Part 3).

      This is an open-label (both physician and participants know the identity of the intervention)
      and single centre study. This study will be conducted in 3 parts (Part 1, Part 2, and Part
      3). The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within 21 days prior to
      the start of study medication), treatment phase (Part 1: 20 days; Part 2: 12 days; Part 3: 16
      days), and the follow-up phase (Part 1 and Part 2: approximately 14 days after the last
      administration of study medication and Part 3: 14 days after the last administration of
      ketaconazole). Approximately 36 participants will be enrolled in the study (12 participants
      in each part). Part 1 is randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) and 3-way
      cross-over (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a
      clinical study) part of the study. Participants in Part 1 will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment sequences (Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3) to receive single dose of 3
      formulations of JNJ-40411813 (Formulation A: hard gelatin capsule filled with beads;
      Formulation B: immediate release tablet; and Formulation C: nanosuspension formulation)
      without food. Each period will be separated by a wash out period (no treatment) of at least 1
      week. Part 2 is randomized and 2-way cross-over part of the study. Participants in Part 2
      will be randomly assigned 1 of 2 treatment sequences (Period 1 and Period 2) to receive
      single dose of the selected solid dose formulation of JNJ-40411813 from Part 1 without food
      and with food separated by a wash out period of at least 1 week. Part 3 is single-arm
      sequential (carried out in a staged approach) part of the study. Participants in Part 3 will
      receive single dose of the selected solid dose formulation of JNJ-40411813 from Part 1 on two
      occasions (Day 1 and Day 10) without food along with ketoconazole from Day 6 to Day 14 with
      food. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be 8
      weeks.
