  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholesterol screening is an important prerequisite for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      assessment. Cholesterol screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services
      Task Force (USPSTF). Since reminder systems have been shown to modestly improve the rates of
      preventive services, including in safety net settings, we will implement patient-directed
      reminders to health center patients who meet our eligibility criteria.

      The aim of this study is to determine if a mailed outreach message and facilitated ordering
      of screening lipid tests increases cholesterol screening test completion within 3 months
      among federally qualified community health center patients who are eligible for screening
      compared to usual care.
