  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of local
      injections of botulinum toxin A (XeominÂ®) to an inactive test substance (placebo) in a
      medical condition called Restless Leg Syndrome. This study has a double blind cross over
      design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. The first set of
      injections can be either Xeomin or placebo. The order of injection will be reversed at the
      three month point following the first injection. Double blind means neither the investigators
      nor you know which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) you received.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Total Restless Leg Syndrome Rating Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale uses 10 questions, each scored 0-4, with higher scores representing more severe symptoms. Score ranges from 1-40. Scoring criteria are: Mild (score 1-10); Moderate (score 11-20); Severe (score 21-30); Very severe (score 31-40)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Whose Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Moderately or Much Improved</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's pain has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as:
No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)improved
This outcome is number of patients who chose a 5 or above on the PGIC 6 weeks after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Pain on Visual Analog Scale &lt;4</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) consists of a line which represents the level of pain in 10 cms. The subject is required to make this line to show where your pain level is on this line (for example, at the 7cm mark). A higher score is associated with a higher level of pain. Number of patients showing a pain score of &lt;4.</description>

        <description>The Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale uses 10 questions, each scored 0-4, with higher scores representing more severe symptoms. Score ranges from 1-40. Scoring criteria are: Mild (score 1-10); Moderate (score 11-20); Severe (score 21-30); Very severe (score 31-40)</description>

        <description>The PGIC is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's pain has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as:
No change (or condition has gotten worse) (1) Almost the same, hardly any change at all (2) A little better, but no noticeable change (3) Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference (4) Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change (5) Better and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference (6) A great deal better and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference (7)improved
