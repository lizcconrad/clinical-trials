  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to better define the relative contributions of AIDSVAX®
      B/E alone, ALVAC-HIV alone, or ALVAC-HIV plus AIDSVAX® B/E combination to the observed immune
      profile in the weeks and months after receiving the original prime and boost vaccine regimen
      from study protocol RV 144, and their booster effects in both the systemic and mucosal
      compartments. In addition, this study will provide more intensive and comprehensive
      characterization of the innate, cell-mediated and humoral immune responses than possible
      within the RV 144 study.

                  equivalent for periods exceeding 10 days). The following exceptions are permitted
                  and will not exclude study participation: use of corticosteroid nasal spray for

               -  Blood products within 120 days prior to HIV screening.

               -  Immunoglobulins within 30 days prior to HIV screening.

               -  Any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to initial study vaccine administration
                  in the present study.

               -  Receipt of any investigational HIV vaccine.

               -  Investigational research agents or vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment in
                  the present study.

               -  Anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis or therapy during the past 90 days prior to
                  enrollment.

          7. Active sexually transmitted infection confirmed by clinical exam and diagnostic test.

          8. Any medical, psychiatric, social condition, occupational reason, or other
             responsibility that, in the judgment of the investigator, is a contradiction to
             protocol compliance or impairs a subject's ability to give informed consent.

          9. Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol; past or present
             psychoses; past or present bipolar disorder; disorder requiring lithium; or within 5
             years prior to enrollment, a history of suicide ideation or attempt.
