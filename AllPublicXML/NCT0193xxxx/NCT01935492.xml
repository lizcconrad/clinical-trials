      An open randomized phase III study to compare 8 continuous cycles of chemotherapy with 8
      cycles of intermittent (2 times 4 cycles) chemotherapy in first line treatment, in
      combination with bevacizumab, and second line treatment of patients with HER2/neu negative,
      incurable, metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this non-inferiority trial is to determine if the results obtained with a
      intermittent chemotherapy regimen (2 x 4 cycles of paclitaxel) are not inferior to the
      results of a continuous chemotherapy regimen (8 cycles of paclitaxel), both combined with
      bevacizumab in first line treatment of patients with HER2/neu negative, incurable, metastatic
      or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer.
