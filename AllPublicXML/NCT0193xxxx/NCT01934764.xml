      Working hypothesis and aims: Biotin is conjugated covalently to several proteins and use as a
      co-factor. Conjugation of biotin to non-targeted, unspecific proteins (e.g. immunoglobulins)
      leads to the breakage of the immune tolerance and to the formation of anti-biotin antibodies.
      Anti-biotin antibodies will be found in correlation with the progression and the present of
      autoimmune disease. In this research the correlation between immune response against biotin
      and the formations of autoimmune disease, will be studied:

      A. Assessment of the possibility that biotin elicit immune response involved in the
      developmental stage of the autoimmune disease.

      B. Assessment of the possibility that anti-biotin antibodies indicate the developmental stage
      of the autoimmune disease and therefore can serve as an disease early stage marker.

      Methods: A. Patient recruitment. Gathering participant's medical record and blood samples. B.
      Records of clinical and biochemical measures. C. Serum of all patient will be tested for the
      correlation between biotin level, biotin bound to antibodies and anti-biotin antibodies to
      liver functions tests. D. Controlled test for repeatedly injected mice with biotinilated
      self-antibodies. Level of anti-biotin will be tested and their influence on the mouse. E.
      Determination of the correlation between biotinilated antibodies or anti-biotin antibodies to
      disease eruption or severance and autoimmune disease.

      Expected results :Serum biotin-protein levels and Anti biotin antibodies levels are increased
      in patients with active autoimmune liver diseases.

      Importance: The proof of connection between biotin-carrying immunoglobulins, anti biotin
      antibodies and autoimmune diseases will open new research direction of possible factors that
      cause to autoimmune disease.

      Probable implications to Medicine: Identification of correlations between reaction to biotine
      and autoimmune diseases will enable their usage as biomarkers for autoimmune diseases,
      severity of the disease and personalization of treatment.
