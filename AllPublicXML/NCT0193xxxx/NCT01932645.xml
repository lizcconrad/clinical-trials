  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostatitis is so widespread a disease that affects people from youths to seniors, with
      approximately a third experiencing a remission of symptoms over a year follow-up. Although
      the etiology of prostatitis is still not clear, it is mainly thought to be due to infection
      of bacteria or other microorganisms. Up to now, there is still no research being done on the
      microbiome (bacterial species) of the prostate. The objective of this study is to look at the
      etiology of chronic prostatitis(bacteria or non-bacteria prostatitis), mainly focusing on the
      effect of bacteria in the prostate.

      Prostatitis is so widespread a disease that affects people from youths to seniors, with
      approximately a third experiencing a remission of symptoms over a year follow-up. Although
      the etiology of prostatitis is still not clear, it is mainly thought to be due to infection
      of bacteria or other microorganisms. Traditional techniques to identify bacteria (e.g. on
      agar petri plates) are limited in what they can identify. Although HMP (Human Microbiome
      Project) has turned many mysteries into common sense, little is done on the relationship of
      bacteria in the prostate for prostatitis. Up to now, there is still no research being done on
      the microbiome (bacterial species) of the prostate. The objective of this study is to look at
      the etiology of chronic prostatitis (bacteria or non-bacteria prostatitis), mainly focusing
      on the effect of bacteria in the prostate. Modern sequencing methods, such as 16s rRNA
      amplification, cloning and sequencing will be used to evaluate the role of bacteria in
      prostatitis. The basic idea is to survey the microbes present in expressed prostatic fluid
      using 16s sequencing to compare healthy men and prostatitis patients in a small cohort to see
      if there are correlations between microbes found and symptoms.

    <description>Expressed Prostatic Secretions (EPS) will be collected post Digital Rectal Exam (DRE). These biological samples will be tested for bacterial DNA rather than the traditional microbiological culturing techniques. Identification of these bacterial DNA will then be assessed between the groups to determine if prostatitis patients, in fact, do have more bacteria than normal controls.</description>

    <description>We will enroll patients from the outpatient clinic who are suffering from pelvic pain (perineal, suprapubic, testicular, penile etc), have urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction (primarily pain associated with ejaculation). Patients with these symptoms and identified as having prostatitis will be approached to enroll.</description>

    <description>Male patients seen in the outpatient clinic who do not have prostatitis (not suffering from pelvic pain (perineal, suprapubic, testicular, penile etc), and do not have urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction (primarily pain associated with ejaculation)) will be approached to enrol as controls.</description>

      Patients will have a digital rectal exam (DRE) performed and have their Expressed Prostatic
      Secretions (EPS) sampled as well as the first void after the DRE (other wise called the VB3
      sample). Patients will also have their maximum urinary flow rate tested by voiding into a
      special machine. This will be done at the urology clinic, 6th floor Diamond Building.

      These biological samples will be tested for bacterial DNA rather than the traditional
      microbiological culturing techniques. Identification of these bacterial DNA will then be
      assessed between the groups to determine if prostatitis patients, in fact, do have more
      bacteria than normal controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic prostatitis (bacteria or non-bacterial prostatitis) with pelvic pain and LUTS
             (low urinary tract symptom); diagnosed mainly by NIH-CPSI score. We use NIH-CPSI score
             15 as a base line for identifying prostatitis patients:those scored more than 15 will
             be grouped as prostatitis patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inadequate follow-up data

          -  Other types of prostatits patients

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigators would not be suitable for study

          -  UTI patients (within 6 months before enrolment)

          -  Antibiotics (within 6 months before enrolment)

          -  Urinary tract surgery (within 6 months before enrolment)
