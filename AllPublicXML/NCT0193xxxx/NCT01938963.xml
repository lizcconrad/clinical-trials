      This study will see if education of village doctors and aging workers in identification and
      management of hypertension and depression, using standardized procedures,consultation with a
      psychiatrist as needed, and collaborations between the village doctor and aging worker in
      care elderly patients in the village better achieve better outcomes for their depression and
      high blood pressure than usual care.

      The Depression/Hypertension in Chinese Older Adults - Collaborations in Health (COACH) Study
      is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the COACH intervention to care as usual
      (CAU) for the treatment of comorbid depression and hypertension (HTN) in Chinese older adult
      rural village residents. COACH integrates the care provided by the older person's primary
      care provider (PCP) with that delivered by an Aging Worker (AW; a lay member of the village's
      Aging Association), supervised by a psychiatrist consultant. Based on chronic disease
      management principles, the PCP is trained to use evidence based practice guidelines for
      treatment of both HTN and depression, and provided with access to mental health consultation
      regarding optimal management of the patient's depression. The AW is trained to conduct a
      systematic assessment of the older person's social context to identify and reduce social and
      environmental barriers to treatment adherence and response. AWs participate with the PCP in
      developing multidisciplinary care plans for their shared patients, reinforce treatment
      adherence and adoption of healthy behaviors, and emphasize activation and engagement of the
      older person in activities designed to improve their connectedness to others and to the
      community. Finally, PCP, AW, and Psychiatrist Consultant are trained to collaborate in their
      shared clients' care.

      One hundred and sixty villages will be randomized to deliver COACH or CAU to eligible
      subjects who reside there (approximately 15 per village will meet criteria), or a total of
      about 2400 subjects. Treatment will continue for one year, with research evaluations at
      baseline, 3 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Specific aims of the study are to determine whether COACH is more effective than CAU in
      treating depression (Aim 1) and HTN (Aim 2); whether improvements in treatment adherence
      precede reductions in depression and improvement in BP control (Aim 3a), and whether
      improvements in depression symptoms precede improvements in BP control (Aim 3b); if COACH is
      associated with greater improvements in health related quality of life than CAU (Aim 4); and
      to compare the costs associated with each approach (Aim 5).
