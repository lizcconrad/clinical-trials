    <textblock>
      This study was an open, 5-treatment, 5-sequence, 5-day cross-over randomized design clinical
      trial. The present study was carried out to compare the effects of white rice, brown rice,
      and black rice on postprandial glucose and lipid profiles in healthy human subjects, using a
      white bread as a positive control.

    <textblock>
      After a 12-hour fast, oral glucose and meal tolerance was measured with blood samples drawn
      at times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes and TG was at time 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
      and 6 hours.

        1. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and TG were analyzed by biochemical autoanalyzer. The
           area under the curve (AUC) changes in blood glucose, TG were computed by the trapezoidal
           method.

        2. Glycemic index(GI): the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a
           test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food
           containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the
           reference.

Glycemic index (GI) was defined as the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the reference. Plasma glucose will be measured at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post ingestion of each test solution.
