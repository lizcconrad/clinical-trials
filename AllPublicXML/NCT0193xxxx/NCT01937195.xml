    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will have a higher rate of
      successful first attempt peripheral intravenous (PIV) placement, higher completion of
      therapy, fewer complications, longer dwell times, and higher user satisfaction compared to
      Conventional IV Catheters.

      Phase One is designed as a one-arm prospective study to compare patients using the AccuCath™
      Intravenous Catheter System to the results found in literature. Phase Two is designed as a
      two-arm prospective randomized controlled study comparing the AccuCath™ Intravenous Catheter
      System to conventional PIV catheters. This study site will be completing Phase One only.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Successfully Inserted Peripheral IV Catheter Placement on First Attempt</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/at catheter placement, usually 3-15 minutes initial during insertion procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to observe the rate of first attempt success (where the inserter only pierces the skin once and successfully places the PIV catheter in the vein) in patients requiring PIV access.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Complications of Peripheral IV Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Study exit/at catheter removal expected to be up to 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure the percentage of patients with (anticipated) complications of IV therapy - infection, occlusion, infiltration, extravasation, phlebitis, dislodgement, leaking/bleeding at site, patient complaints of pain without other identifiable cause, and other (up to 7 days).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion of IV Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Study exit/at catheter removal expected to be up to 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of IV therapy will measure whether the catheter remained in place for the duration of required intravenous treatment during the inpatient stay (generally up to 7 days).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter Dwell Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Study exit/at catheter removal expected to be up to 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure total catheter dwell time to the nearest hour (total time in hours for functioning catheter) up to 7 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Identified as &quot;Satisfied&quot; With Catheter Performance at Catheter Insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at catheter insertion in the first 3-15 minutes after procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were surveyed regarding satisfaction with catheter insertion with a 5-point Likert scale (1 the lowest, 5 the highest). Satisfaction was defined as a score of 3 to 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, and up to catheter removal expected to be no more than 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure the number and severity of adverse events associated with peripheral IV initiation and indwelling catheter time up to 7 days. Adverse events are anticipated complications of IV therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Identified as &quot;Satisfied&quot; With Catheter Performance at Catheter Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>At catheter removal, which is expected to be up to 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were surveyed regarding satisfaction with catheter performance with a 5-point Likert scale (1 the lowest, 5 the highest). Satisfaction was defined as a score of 3 to 5.</description>
