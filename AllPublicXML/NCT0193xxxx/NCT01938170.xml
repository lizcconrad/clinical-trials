    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of having parents and caregivers administer FluMist
      live intranasal vaccine to their children at home outside the traditional medical environment
      and without the involvement of medical personnel.

      The study will recruit patients and families that are already eligible to receive the FluMist
      vaccine. After consent is obtained and vaccine is given to the family, they will go home to
      administer vaccine to other members within 24 hours. Telephone follow up within 48 hours will
      confirm that vaccine was given successfully and within 9-12 days to assess patient
      preferences for giving vaccine at home and if there were any adverse events.

    <description>This study will also assess the feasibility of having parents/caregivers administer Flumist vaccine outside a traditional medical environment and without the direct participation of medical personnel. We will ask parents by telephone survey at both 24-48 hours and at 9-12 days after study visit and enrollment about any difficulties in giving FluMist at home, about maintaining temperature and conditions proper for vaccine storage until administration. We will also ask about ease of vaccine disposal and about child preferences for receiving vaccine at home compared to at a dedicated medical visit.</description>
