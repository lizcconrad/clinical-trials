  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate an instrumented wheel such as a new biomedical
      device. The physicians will compare this instrumented wheel with another instrumentation
      &quot;Ergometer roller&quot;, each patient will try the both instrumentations, physical and
      physiological parameters will be measured.

      The increase rate of radial power during the cardiac stress test may be more important when
      the physicians use the instrumented wheel.

      * The manual wheelchair is used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to
      spinal cord lesions, neurological and muscular diseases, lower limb trauma, age …etc.

      Although the wheelchair help to regain mobility, this made of displacement is nor natural nor
      well-to-do.

        -  The CIC-IT and TSR (Transmissions Services Roulements, Mérignac, France) improved the
           instrumented wheel, adaptable with all wheelchairs, with information wireless
           transmission.

        -  The primary objective of study is to validate the instrumented wheel of manual
           wheelchair such as a new device of evaluation of capacities of displacement in ecologic
           situation.

        -  The primary criteria is to compare the mechanical power calculated using instrumented
           wheel versus the power calculated using ergometer roller during protocol of standard
           cardio-respiratory stress test.

      This study is interventional, mono-centric, controlled and crossover. The population
      concerned is patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and users of manual wheelchair.

      Number of subjects projected for the entire study: 62 patients The total duration of
      participation of each patient: 7 days ±2days
