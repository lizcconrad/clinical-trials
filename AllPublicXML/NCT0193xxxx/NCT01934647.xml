    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of single doses
      of MK-8892 in participants with PAH. The primary objective is to estimate the measured peak
      effect of the highest acutely tolerated (HAT) single oral dose of MK-8892 on pulmonary
      vascular resistance (PVR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  postmenopausal female or if female of reproductive potential, remains abstinent or
             uses two acceptable methods of birth control during 14 days after dosing with MK-8892

          -  has suspected PAH classified in one of the following sub-groups: idiopathic,
             heritable, drug- or toxin-induced, or associated with connective tissue disease, as

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has a medical history indicating a secondary cause of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) or a
             non-included etiology of PAH including the following tests within 6 months of Visit 1:
             Echo indicating significant left heart disease, valvular disease, or structural
             defects; function test indicating significant pulmonary disease; imaging test
             indicating veno-occlusive disease; perfusion scan indicating thromboembolic disease;
             abdominal ultrasound indicating cirrhosis; positive test for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV)
