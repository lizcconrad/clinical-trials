  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the proportion of participants with
      relapsing multiple sclerosis who experience new and/or increased flu-like symptoms (FLS)
      after transitioning from nonpegylated IFN-β therapies to peginterferon beta-1a (BIIB017).

      Secondary objectives are: to determine the severity and frequency (measured by flu-like
      symptom score [FLS-S]) of FLS in these participants; to determine the duration (measured in
      number of hours) of FLS in these participants; to determine the effect of BIIB017 on other
      participant-reported outcomes, including treatment satisfaction (measured with the Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication [TSQM]) and disability status (measured with the
      Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]) over a 56-week period; to determine whether
      interferon-related FLS result in missed days of work/daily activities (e.g., absenteeism); to
      assess the use of additional medications (in addition to current medications used to treat
      FLS) to relieve BIIB017-related FLS; to determine the incidence of adverse events throughout
      the study period; to characterize the immunogenicity profiles of participants switching from
      prior IFN-β therapy to BIIB017.

New or increased FLS is defined as an FLS overall score of 2 points or greater over Screening. Pre-dose data were not used; up to 48-hour data after dosing were used.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), as
             defined by McDonald criteria #1-4 [Polman 2005]

          -  Must have neurological findings consistent with an Expanded Disability Status Scale
             (EDSS) score of 0.0 - 5.0

          -  Must be treated with IFN-β and must be receiving a stable dose of IFN-β for at least 4
             months immediately prior to screening

          -  All male patients and female patients of childbearing potential must practice
             effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue
             contraception for 3 months after their last dose of study treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS [Lublin and
             Reingold 1996]. These conditions require the presence of continuous clinical disease
             worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Patients with these conditions may also
             have superimposed relapse but are distinguished from patients with relapsing MS by the
             lack of clinically stable periods or clinical improvement

        <title>Summary of Average Duration of FLS in the 48 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Duration of FLS for a treatment was defined as the sum of hours from the time of treatment to 48 hours with a FLS-S score &gt; 0. The total FLS-S is the sum of all 4 symptom scores (muscle aches, chills, fatigue and fever), each rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe), with a range of 0-12 with 0 indicating no FLS and 12 indicating severe FLS. If a FLS is &gt; 0 at an evaluation time, 6 hours were counted as the duration assuming the event started from previous evaluation time. Average duration of FLS for the first 8 weeks was defined as the mean duration from Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. 4WRI=4-week run-in period; 48W=48 weeks.</description>

An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; in the view of the Investigator, placed the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could jeopardize the subject or could require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

        <title>Summary of Average Duration of FLS Within the Last 4 Weeks of the BIIB017 Treatment Period Compared With the Duration of FLS in the 4-Week Run-In Period</title>
        <description>Average duration of FLS for the last 4 weeks (L4W) is defined as the mean duration of last 4 weeks. Duration of FLS for a treatment is defined as the sum of hours from the treatment to 48 hours with a FLS-S score &gt; 0. The total FLS-S is the sum of all 4 symptom scores (muscle aches, chills, fatigue and fever), each rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe), with a range of 0-12 with 0 indicating no FLS and 12 indicating severe FLS. If a FLS is &gt; 0 at an evaluation time, 6 hours were counted as the duration assuming the event started from previous evaluation time. 4WRI=4-week run-in.</description>
