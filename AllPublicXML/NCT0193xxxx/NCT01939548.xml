  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether PF-02545920 is safe and effective in the treatment of
      sub-optimally controlled symptoms of schizophrenia during a 12-week outpatient treatment
      period. The study will use the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to measure change
      in symptoms for PF-02545920 from baseline compared to placebo.

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS Total Score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) is a validated clinician-related scale that measured personal and social functioning in the domains of: socially useful activities (eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Information from the participant and the informant were utilized in determining the rating. A PSP total score was determined from the 4 domains (score range 0-100). A score between 71 and 100 indicates a mild degree of difficulty; a score between 31 and 70 indicates a moderate degree of dysfunction, and a participant with a score of 30 or less has functioning so poor he or she requires intensive supervision.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in PANSS Positive, Negative, and General Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS includes 3 scales and 30 items: 7 items that make up the Positive Scale (eg, delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior); 7 items that make up the Negative Scale (eg, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal); and 16 items that make up the General Psychopathology Scale (eg, somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, disorientation, poor impulse control, preoccupation). Individual items are scored with values ranging from 1 to 7. Total Negative and Positive Subscale scores each range from 7 to 49; higher score indicates greater severity. Total General Psychopathology Subscale score range from 16 to 112; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Concentration of PF-02545920 and Its Metabolite, PF-01001252</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84/Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected at varying times relative to drug dosing whenever participants could be scheduled for study visits (sparse PK sampling). Thus, because of the variable time between the last dose and the collection of the PK samples, typical summary PK analyses were not planned or described in the study protocol and are not available. The study protocol analysis section specified that the sparse sampled PK data might be pooled with PK data from previous PF-02545920 clinical studies, however the study results did not support conducting those analyses.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Total Score</title>
        <description>The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) is a validated clinician-related scale that measured personal and social functioning in the domains of: socially useful activities (eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Information from the participant and the informant were utilized in determining the rating. A PSP total score was determined from the 4 domains (score range 0-100). A score between 71 and 100 indicates a mild degree of difficulty; a score between 31 and 70 indicates a moderate degree of dysfunction, and a participant with a score of 30 or less has functioning so poor he or she requires intensive supervision.</description>

A score between 71 and 100 indicates a mild degree of difficulty; a score between 31 and 70 indicates a moderate degree of dysfunction, and a participant with a score of 30 or less has functioning so poor he or she requires intensive supervision.</description>
          <population>All participants who received study treatment were included in the baseline evaluation. The number of evaluable participants at Week 12 were those in the FAS with available data at Week 12 (n=number of evaluable participants at the specified time point)</population>

        <description>The PANSS includes 3 scales and 30 items: 7 items that make up the Positive Scale (eg, delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior); 7 items that make up the Negative Scale (eg, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal); and 16 items that make up the General Psychopathology Scale (eg, somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, disorientation, poor impulse control, preoccupation). Individual items are scored with values ranging from 1 to 7. Total Negative and Positive Subscale scores each range from 7 to 49; higher score indicates greater severity. Total General Psychopathology Subscale score range from 16 to 112; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <description>The ESRS-A is a 28-item instrument designed to facilitate standardized observations of parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia. Ratings were determined through a combination of clinical interview and a motor examination. Scores were divided into individual domain scores and clinical global impression scores (CGI-S). Scores started from 0 (normal) to 6 (0 to 8 for CGI-S), with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale‑Abbreviated (ESRS‑A)</title>
          <description>The ESRS-A is a 28-item instrument designed to facilitate standardized observations of parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia. Ratings were determined through a combination of clinical interview and a motor examination. Scores were divided into individual domain scores and clinical global impression scores (CGI-S). Scores started from 0 (normal) to 6 (0 to 8 for CGI-S), with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>
          <population>All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. n=number of evaluable participants for each parameter at the specified time points.</population>
