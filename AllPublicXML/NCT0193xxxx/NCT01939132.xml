  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disorder involving joints, tendon
      sheaths, entheses, and the axial skeleton as well as skin and nails. This is an open-label
      trial with H.P. Acthar Gel (80 units/1mL) Subcutaneous injection administered twice weekly.
      To evaluate the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis after 12 weeks, including American
      College of Rheumatology 20,Clinical Disease Activity Index, Disease Activity Index 28,
      Dactylitis and adverse events.

      The subjects in this study will be adult men and women ages 18-75 years of age at the time of
      screening with chronic, moderately-to-severely active PsA and meeting ACR criteria.
