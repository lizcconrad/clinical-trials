      The present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of colloid compared with crystalloids for
      fluid resuscitation in critical burn patients with total burn surface area ≥50%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive burn patients are some of the most challenging critically ill patients who may have
      multiple-system organ failure with life-threatening complications.Over time, several
      resuscitation formulae have been proposed to guide burn resuscitation and the best known ones
      are Parkland and Evans formulae. The main controversy between the two formulae also focuses
      on whether to infuse the colloid in the first 24 h.Controversy continues and the conflicting
      results left many clinicians unsure about the effect of colloids on fluid resuscitation in
      extensive burn patients who suffer higher risk of hypovolaemia, abdominal compartment
      syndrome (ACS), multiple organs dysfunction and mortality. To address this uncertainty, we
      conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare fluid resuscitation
      in extensive burns guided by Parkland formulae with TMMU formulae as a modified Evans formula
      routinely used in China.
