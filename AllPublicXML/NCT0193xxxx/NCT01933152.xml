    <textblock>
      Retrospective, non-interventional, observational multi-center field study. Patients diagnosed
      with wet Age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and having started treatment with
      ranibizumab between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 must be consecutively screened and,
      if eligible, enrolled. Patients will be followed up at maximum until December 31, 2011.
      Switch to any other Anti vascular endothelial growth factor (anti VEGF) treatment will be
      documented. For each patient, demographics, medical history, administered treatments, results
      of ocular and visual assessments and other tests (where available) will be documented.
