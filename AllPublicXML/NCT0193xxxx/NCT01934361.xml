  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that had recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme. The first part (phase Ib) was to investigate the maximum tolerated
      dose/Recommended phase ll dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with
      every-three-week carboplatin or buparlisib once daily in combination with every-six-week
      lomustine (CCNU) using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established in either of the 2
      arms, the corresponding phase II portion of the study was to start. Phase II was to assess
      the treatment effect of buparlisib in combination with carboplatin in terms of Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) and was to compare the treatment effect of buparlisib with lomustine
      versus lomustine plus placebo in terms of PFS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A preliminary assessment for both combinations (buparlisib plus carboplatin or lomustine)
      demonstrated that there was not enough antitumor activity compared to historical data with
      single agent carboplatin or lomustine. Based on the overall safety profile, and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity observed in this study, Novartis decided that no additional patients
      would be enrolled into this study. As a consequence, the Phase II part of the study was not
      conducted.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (21 days carboplatin combination or 42 days lomustine combination )</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the highest BKM120 dosage that does not cause medically unacceptable Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in more than 35% of the treated patients during the first cycle of treatment. DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity occurring during the phase Ib cycle 1 and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria. The information will be integrated in a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control to estimate the MTD.</description>
