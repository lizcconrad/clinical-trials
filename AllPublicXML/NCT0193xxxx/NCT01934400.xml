      Objective: The study is to increasing osteoporosis awareness with fracture risk assessments
      and management as well as fall prevention among elderly in northern region of Taiwan.

      Method: Six community osteoporosis and fall prevention educational programme will be held at
      northern region of Taiwan. A questionnaires design including demographic variables , FRAX
      variables, nutritional variables and osteoporosis and fall knowledge variables as well.The
      pretest-posttest method was used to analyse the effect on education.

      Expected outcomes : (1)Fall prevention educational programme will hold in northern region of
      Taiwan at different communities in order to increasing osteoporosis awareness with fracture
      risk assessment tool, establishing fall knowledges among elderly and some fall prevention
      skills.(2)Elderly with 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture risk who more than
      20% and 10-year probability of hip fracture risk who more than 3% will identify as high risk
      of osteoporosis. (3) To estimate number of cases who identified as high risk will recommend
      for BMD measurement.
