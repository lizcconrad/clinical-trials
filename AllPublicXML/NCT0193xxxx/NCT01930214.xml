      The objective of this study is to assess the current standard of care treatment outcome in
      none/mild, moderate and severely calcified coronary lesions using:

        -  A composite of MACE at 30-day and one (1) year post procedure, and

        -  Procedural and lesion success

      This prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study includes subjects who meet all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and sign the ICF. This study may treat up to
      approximately 500 subjects at up to 50 active sites in the U.S. Subjects may be followed up
      to three (3) years. Subjects will be stratified into one (1) of three (3) arms based on the
      degree of calcification in the coronary lesion as defined by this protocol. The duration of
      the study is expected to be approximately four (4) years.

    <description>To assess the safety of the current standard of care treatment when used to facilitate stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions. This will be measured by a composite of MACE at 30-days post treatment procedure.
MACE is composed of:
Cardiac Death
MI - defined as CK-MB level &gt; three (3) times the ULN value with or without new pathologic Q wave.
TVR - defined as revascularization at the target vessel (inclusive of the target lesion) after the completion of the treatment procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subjects must be scheduled for percutaneous coronary revascularization involving stent
             deployment in de novo coronary lesions. Percutaneous coronary revascularization is
             defined as treatment with commercially available devices that may include but not
             limited to balloon angioplasty, cutting balloon, rotablation, etc. followed by the
             stent placement.

          3. Subjects CK-MB must be less than or equal to the upper limit of lab normal value
             within eight (8) hours prior to procedure. If CK-MB results are not yet available
             prior to initiating procedure, subjects Troponin I or Troponin T must be less than or
             equal to the upper limit of lab normal value within eight (8) hours prior to the
             procedure.

          4. The target lesion must be a de novo coronary lesion that has not been previously
             treated with any interventional procedure.

          5. The target vessel must be a native coronary artery with:

               1. A stenosis ≥ 70% and &lt; 100%, or

               2. A stenosis ≥ 50% &lt; 70% with evidence of clinical ischemia

          6. The target vessel reference diameter must be ≥ 2.5mm and ≤ 4.0 mm.

          7. The lesion length must not exceed 40 mm.
