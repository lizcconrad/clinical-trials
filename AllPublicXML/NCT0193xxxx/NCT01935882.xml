  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primaquine (PQ) is currently the only available drug that can clear mature transmission
      stages of P. falciparum parasites. PQ was previously shown to clear gametocytes that persist
      after artemisinin-combination therapy. However, there are safety concerns about the use of PQ
      at the currently recommended dose of 0.75mg/kg in individuals who are glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient. PQ causes transient but significant haemolysis in G6PD
      deficient individuals; this side-effect is dose dependent. There are indications that a lower
      dosing of PQ may effectively reduce gametocyte carriage but the lowest efficacious dose for
      gametocyte clearance is currently unknown. Recently, the World Health Organization changed
      their recommendation to a low dose of primaquine, 0.25mg/kg. However, there is no direct
      evidence on the extent to which (low dose) PQ prevents malaria transmission to mosquitoes and
      what the lowest efficacious dose is.

      In the current study we aim to identify the lowest efficacious dose of PQ in individuals with
      normal G6PD function. Children with asymptomatic malaria and normal G6PD enzyme function will
      be randomized to treatment with artemether-lumefantrine alone or in combination with low
      doses of PQ. All enrolled individuals will receive a full three-day course of AL, and will be
      randomized to receive a dose of primaquine or placebo with their fifth dose of AL. Efficacy
      will be determined based on gametocyte carriage during follow-up, measured by molecular
      methods. For a subset of participants with patent gametocytes, primaquine effect on
      infectivity to mosquitoes will be assessed by membrane feeding assays

    <description>The pharmacokinetic sampling will measure primaquine, lumefantrine and metabolites. Sampling involves 7 venous blood samples during the first 72 hours after treatment and a single later time point at day 7 post initiation of treatment. Drug plasma levels will be related to treatment arm and to the participant's Cytochrome P450 2D6 metabolizer status. CYP2D6 is an enzyme involved in primaquine metabolism.</description>
