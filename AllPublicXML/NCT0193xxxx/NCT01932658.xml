      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential clinical benefit of
      lymphoablation followed by autologous HSCT rescue in therapy refractory Crohn's disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of Crohn's disease has proven to be quite efficacious in the majority of
      patients with the timely use of combination therapies for remission induction
      (corticosteroids and/or biologics) and maintenance of disease control (immunosuppressives
      and/or biologics). However, a proportion of patients fail to achieve complete and long term
      disease control and often require multiple intestinal surgeries with a risk of developing
      short bowel syndrome. Lymphoablation followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to
      rescue the immune system has been proposed as an alternative strategy to induce long term
      disease control in this high risk population. It has been demonstrated that despite the
      potential toxicity and morbidity associated with the procedure, the benefit-risk ratio is
      favorable. Hence, we propose to offer HSCT to selected CD patients, and to study mechanisms
      of reducing T cell autoreactivity which will hopefully lead to more focused therapeutic
      approaches in the future.

    <description>Second, to determine clinical benefit, the percentage of patients in sustained disease remission at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months post HSCT will be determined. Sustained disease remission is defined as a CDAI &lt; 150 (Appendix 1) without the use of corticosteroids. In addition, mucosal healing will be assessed during ileocolonoscopy at 6 and 12 months following HSCT using the SES endoscopic index (see under secondary endpoints</description>
