  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      combination therapy of trametinib and docetaxel with growth factor support in Japanese
      subjects with Stage IV or a postoperative recurrence non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This
      study data will be used for making decision for further Japanese development plan for NSCLC.
      Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled in a dose level to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the combination treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity will be assessed during the
      first 21 days of combination therapy.
