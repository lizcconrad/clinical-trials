  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ponatinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with
      stage III-IV lung cancer. Ponatinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      This study will look at the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug ponatinib in
      lung cancer. The investigators hope that ponatinib will work against tumors that have certain
      biomarkers. Therefore, the study will pre-screen patients for these certain biomarkers before
      enrolling them into the main treatment study. Different doses of ponatinib may be tested in
      this study.

             completed more than 4 weeks prior to treatment within the study and that there has
             been documented progression at these sites; radiotherapy to non-target lesions is
             permitted within 2 weeks of study entry provided all acute effects of the radiotherapy

                  requirements

               -  Congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction
                  within the 3 months prior to enrollment in part B of the study

                  [MD]) cardiac arrhythmia (atrial or ventricular)
