  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about infection by Clostridium difficile (also
      known as C. difficile). C. difficile is a common bacterium (a germ that may cause disease)
      that can live in the human gut. Some people have it without having any symptoms. In other
      people it can cause illness ranging from mild diarrhea to severe colitis (infection of the
      colon).

      C. difficile makes toxins that damage the cells that line the colon. The study doctors want
      to find out how these toxins cause damage to the cells in the colon.

      The purpose of this study is to examine pathogenic mechanisms of Clostridium difficile
      toxin-mediated intestinal injury and inflammation. Two primary mechanisms will be examined.

        -  To examine the hypothesis is that microRNA expression profiles are dysregulated by
           Clostridium difficile toxin exposure and that dysregulation of miRNA expression plays a
           role in the pathogenesis of C. difficile associated diseases.

        -  To examine the hypothesis is that the TLR9 receptor mediates key inflammatory events in
           response to Clostridium difficile toxin exposure.
