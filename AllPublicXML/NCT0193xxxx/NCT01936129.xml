  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial to assess the neuroprotective effect of Cop-1
      (Copaxone) in patients with acute primary angle closure (APAC). The standardized management
      of APAC will include medical therapy to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), followed by laser
      peripheral iridotomy. Cop-1 will be administered in addition to standard therapy as a
      subcutaneous dose once within 24 hours of presentation, and then one week later (total 2
      injections). The control group will have placebo in addition to standard regimen. Subjects in
      the study will have visual field test performed with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer II,
      retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness measured with the Stratus optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) and Optic nerve head evaluated with the Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT).
      At least 2 baseline visual field tests will also be performed in the first week. Subsequent
      visits will be at week 4, 8, 12 and 16. The outcome criteria will be difference in visual
      field, RNFL thickness, and optic nerve head structural changes.

      Aim To assess the neuroprotective effect of Cop-1 (Copaxone) in reducing functional and
      structural damage after acute primary angle closure (APAC)

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures will be the point-wise linear regression in the visual fields.

      The secondary outcome measure will be the evaluation of structural changes, namely, RNFL
      thickness and Optic disc changes as measured by stratus OCT and HRT respectively.

      Study population

      The study population (n=196; 1:1 randomisation) will be patients with APAC attending the
      Singapore National Eye Centre who fulfil the inclusion criteria and are willing to take part
      in the study.

      Study design:

      The study design is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded trial where patients
      with APAC will be randomized to receive either Cop-1 (Copaxone) or placebo in addition to the
      standard medical therapy.

      An interim analysis will be conducted after 40 patients complete the trial. Routine
      examination will be done at all visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • patients with APAC who present to the centre not later than 7 days from the
             initiation of the attack.

               -  the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: ocular or periocular
                  pain, nausea or vomiting or both, and an antecedent history of blurring of vision
                  with haloes;

               -  a presenting intraocular pressure of at least 28 mm Hg on Goldmann applanation
                  tonometry;

               -  the presence of at least three of the following signs: conjunctival injection,
                  corneal epithelial oedema, middilated unreactive pupil, and shallow anterior
                  chamber;

               -  the presence of an occludable angle in the affected eye on gonioscopy;

               -  Age more than 21 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • evidence of a prior acute angle closure attack (the presence of iris whorling, focal
             iris atrophy, or glaucomflecken with a history of an acute red eye and decreased
             vision). This will not include senile iris and sphincter atrophy);

               -  Pre-existing chronic angle closure glaucoma in the eye with APAC

               -  secondary causes of angle closure like subluxed lens, uveitis, trauma and
                  neovascular glaucoma;

               -  cataract that is deemed significant enough to require surgery during the course
                  of the trial or that makes field testing or optic disc imaging not technically
                  possible- visual acuity less than 6/36 due to any type of cataract;

               -  corneal abnormalities, media opacities, or retinal abnormalities that would
                  affect scanning laser polarimetry;

               -  previous intraocular surgery;

               -  currently pregnant or nursing women, or women considering pregnancy;

               -  Severe health problems precluding follow-up such as end-stage heart disease,
                  kidney disease, respiratory disease, or cancer and life expectancy less than one
                  year.
