    <textblock>
      The objective of the first phase of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fluvoxamine
      compared to placebo on change in total score of Japanese version of the Children's Yale-Brown
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale (JCY-BOCS) 10-item from baseline to the last observation visit (10
      weeks) in pediatric/adolescent participants with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

      The objective of the second phase of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and
      efficacy of fluvoxamine in pediatric/adolescent patients with OCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase will be conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind manner to
      evaluate the efficacy of fluvoxamine on change from baseline to the last observation visit in
      the JCY-BOCS 10-item total score. Eligible patients will be allocated to the fluvoxamine
      group or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio using the experience of fluvoxamine treatment and age
      as stratification factors (dynamic allocation). The first phase consists of a screening
      period of 1-2 weeks, a forced titration dose period of 2 weeks, a dose adjustment period of 4
      weeks, a maintained dose period of 4 weeks, and a tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks.

      The 2nd phase will be conducted in an open-label manner in participants who completed the
      first phase to evaluate the long-term safety of fluvoxamine. The 2nd phase consists of 3
      periods; a forced titration dose period of 2 weeks, a flexible dose period of 50 weeks, and a
      tapering dose period of 0-4 weeks. After the last dose of study drug (including tapering dose
      period) or the early termination visit, participants will be followed for up to 30 days.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Japanese Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 10-item Total Score at the End of Treatment in the First Phase</title>
          <description>The Japanese version of the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (JCY-BOCS) is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the severity of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in the past 7 days. Severity of compulsions and obsessions are rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The total score is calculated by summing the 10 individual scores and ranges from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate more extreme symptoms.</description>

        <title>JCY-BOCS 10-item Total Score at Each Visit During the First Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese version of the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (JCY-BOCS) is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the severity of OCD in the past 7 days. Severity of compulsions and obsessions are rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The total score is calculated by summing the 10 individual scores and ranges from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate more extreme symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Japanese version of the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (JCY-BOCS) is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the severity of OCD in the past 7 days. Severity of compulsions and obsessions were rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The total score was calculated by summing the 10 individual scores and ranges from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate more extreme symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events During the First Phase</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was assessed as treatment-related by the investigator if there was evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
The investigator used the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Mild: The adverse event was transient and easily tolerated by the participant;
Moderate: The adverse event caused the participant discomfort and interrupted usual activities.
Severe: The adverse event caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and may have been incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>From the first dose of the study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug, approximately 18 weeks in the first phase.</time_frame>

            <title>Fluvoxamine</title>
            <description>In the double-blind placebo-controlled phase participants received 25 mg fluvoxamine once a day in week 1, 25 mg twice a day (BID) in week 2 followed by a dose adjustment period from weeks 3 to 6 where the dose could be escalated by 25 mg/day/week up to a maximum of 150 mg (three tablets BID). From weeks 7 to 10 participants received the same dose that was given in week 6. At the end of the 10-week treatment period there was a dose-tapering period of up to 4 weeks where the dose of decreased by up to 50 mg/day each week.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was assessed as treatment-related by the investigator if there was evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
The investigator used the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Mild: The adverse event was transient and easily tolerated by the participant;
Moderate: The adverse event caused the participant discomfort and interrupted usual activities.
Severe: The adverse event caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and may have been incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome.</description>
