  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the usefulness of a contrast agent to help image tumors in the eye. In
      this study, patients with eye melanoma who are going to have their eye removed, will have
      their eye imaged by ultrasound (sound waves) before and after intravenous injection of
      microbubbles. The pathology characteristics of the tumor in the removed eye will be compared
      with the images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to enroll and image 10 patients with intraocular tumors who are going
      to undergo enucleation of their eye for the tumor. Definity®, a perflutren containing
      microsphere manufactured by Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc., is commercially available and FDA
      approved for cardiac imaging. It is contraindicated for use in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension, unstable cardiopulmonary conditions, and cardiac shunts (right-to-left,
      bi-directional, or transient right-to left). After informed consent is obtained, a
      cardiologist will examine the patient's history, perform lung and heart auscultation, and
      obtain a blood pressure in order to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using
      Definity®. If there are no contraindications, routine ocular ultrasonography, both A and B
      scans, will be performed using an Ellex Eye Cubed ultrasound machine. Definity® will be
      prepared per package instructions and the appropriate dose will be calculated. If necessary,
      a second 10 microliter/kg dose may be give 30 minutes after the first IV injection. A bubble
      test (intravenous small amount of Definity injected with cardiac echo) will be performed in
      the cardiology imaging suite, clinical building A, in order to ensure that the patient does
      not have a right to left shunt. After that, Definity® will be administered as a slow IV bolus
      followed by a normal saline 10cc flush. The ultrasonographer will continue the ocular B scan
      during administration of Definity®. Vital signs will be obtained and documented at 30 minutes
      after administration of the last dose of Definity® and longer if needed.

    <description>Ultrasound will be used to acoustically identify microbubbles in vascular channels in the intraocular tumors, including uveal melanoma, metastases and retinal tumors.

    <description>There is only 1 arm in this study. The ocular tumors will be imaged using ultrasound and the contrast agent. The patient's history will be noted, lung and heart auscultation will be performed, and blood pressure readings will be obtained to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using Definity®. If there are no contraindications, routine ocular ultrasonography, both A and B scans, will be performed using an Ellex Eye Cubed ultrasound machine. Definity® (the microbubble contrast agent) will be prepared per package instruction and the dose calculated according to the following formula: Patient weight (kg) X 10 microliters = Definity® dose. If necessary, a second 10 microliter/kg dose may be given 30 minutes after the first IV injection.</description>
