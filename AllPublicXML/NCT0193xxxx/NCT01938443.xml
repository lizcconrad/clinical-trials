  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of combination treatment of GSK2256098 and
      trametinib in mesothelioma subjects and subjects with other selected tumor types. Also, the
      study will identify a maximum tolerated combination dose of GSK2256098 and trametinib. This
      study is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine maximal tolerated dose
      (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimens for oral MEK inhibitor trametinib
      (once daily [OD]dosing) and the oral FAK inhibitor GSK2256098 (twice daily [BID] dosing). The
      synergy of the combination was observed over a wide range of concentrations and results in
      several-fold reduction in compound concentration to achieve equivalent biological responses
      compared to either single agent. The dose and schedule of dosing may be modified based on
      emerging safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data. The study will be
      conducted in two parts; Part 1 Dose Escalation to determine the MTD and RP2D and Part 2
      Expansion Cohort to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of trametinib and GSK2256098
      at the RP2D and determine clinical activity. Additionally, in Part 1 Dose Escalation,
      additional subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) will be recruited at doses that
      are considered tolerable in order to assess PD in MPM subjects at each dose (the
      Pharmacodynamic Cohort). The Expansion Cohort will be limited to subjects with MPM who have
      progressed or are intolerant to first-line therapy.
