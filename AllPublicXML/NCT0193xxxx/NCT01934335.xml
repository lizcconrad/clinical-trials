  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether vandetanib has an effect on tumor
      growth markers. Vandetanib is not approved by the FDA for use in treating breast cancer. This
      study will compare vandetanib to a placebo.

      The proposed study is designed to determine the change in Ki-67 expression on paired breast
      cancer samples obtained before and after treatment with vandetanib. Other tumor markers
      including RET, TUNEL and phosphorylation specific levels of ERK1/2, AKT and mTOR will also be
      assessed on the paired samples.

      Subjects who have a core biopsy of the breast which demonstrates invasive breast cancer and
      requires surgical excision of the lesion will be eligible for inclusion in the study. The
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib 300 mg, will be given once a day for 7-14 days prior to
      surgery. Following surgery, tissue markers would be analyzed on each of the paired samples,
      allowing for rapid assessment of in vivo response to TKI treatment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with core breast biopsy that, on pathology review, demonstrates invasive
             breast cancer and are determined to need surgical excision of the lesion. All subtypes
             of invasive breast cancer will be enrolled. Core biopsy specimens of enrolled patients
             will be stained for RET by immunohistochemistry and scored, however, patients will not
             be excluded according to RET expression.

          -  Female gender

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years of age

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent to participate in study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prolonged QT interval (QTc &gt; 480 milliseconds) on screening EKG or congenital long QT
             syndrome

          -  Any concomitant medications that are known to be associated with Torsades de Pointes
             or QT elongation (see appendix 2).
