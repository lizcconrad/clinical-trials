      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending oral doses of
      CHR-5154 in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of CHR-5154 and its metabolite CHR-5426.

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of CHR-5154 and CHR-5426 after a single dose of
           CHR-5154 in the fed and fasted state.
