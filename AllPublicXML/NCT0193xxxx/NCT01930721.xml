    <textblock>
      The angle at which an episiotomy can be made is a continuous variable. If the investigators
      consider midline to be 0 degrees and a lateral episiotomy (never used today) to be 90
      degrees, then it is theoretically possible to choose any angle from 0 to 90 degrees.

    <textblock>
      Episiotomy is a surgical incision to the perineum in order to enlarge the vaginal orifice
      during the second stage of labor. Although seven types of episiotomy have been described in
      the literature , the most frequently performed types are the mediolateral and median
      episiotomies, with the former being the most common one. Despite being a common obstetric
      practice, the exact definition of a &quot;mediolateral&quot; episiotomy is often unclear. Several
      studies and reports, however, stated that a significant proportion of the so-claimed
      mediolateral episiotomy were not actually mediolateral. The current trial compares two angles
      of mediolateral episiotomy , regarding the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tearing,
      episiotomy-related pain and dyspareunia in primiparous women at a large tertiary maternity
      center, namely Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.
