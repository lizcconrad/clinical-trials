  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke sustain significant disability in their
      daily tasks, and account for a significant proportion of stroke-related healthcare costs. The
      proposed study examines a novel intervention, strategy training, that shows promise for
      helping individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments reduce disability in daily
      tasks, which may lead to reductions in healthcare costs. We predict that strategy training
      will result in significantly greater independence 6 months after stroke compared to an
      attention control intervention, and that strategy training may reduce cognitive impairments.

    <description>Strategy training is a form of meta-cognitive instruction that trains individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments to identify and prioritize problematic daily activities, identify the barriers impeding performance, generate and evaluate their own strategies to address barriers, and apply these skills through iterative practice. Participants use printed workbooks to learn and apply this method.</description>

    <description>The attention control intervention will control for the non-specific effects of strategy training. The therapists will administer the standardized and dose-matched protocol, using scripted open-ended questions to facilitate participants' reflections on their rehabilitation activities and experiences. In lieu of the strategy training workbook materials, participants will complete a daily journal, and discuss their entries during attention control sessions.</description>
