    <textblock>
      With the far infrared ray applied to the 'phantom limbs' in amputees and the corresponding
      normal legs in healthy subjects, the sensation of (phantom) limb will be assessed for each
      subject using the techniques of fMRI and meridian response.

      This project will investigate two main hypotheses based on our previous studies on phantom
      limb sensation and phantom limb pain. The first hypothesis states that phantom limb sensation
      and phantom limb pain both correlate with the 'phantom limb', while the second one maintains
      that the phantom limb can interact with the patient's body by means of the meridian system.
      With the far infrared ray applied to the 'phantom limbs' in amputees and the corresponding
      normal legs in healthy subjects, the sensation of (phantom) limb will be assessed for each
      subject using the techniques of fMRI and meridian response. By analyzing the data collected
      from both groups, the investigators expect both hypotheses will be supported by the results
      of experiments in this project.

    <description>The resting fMRI images will be obtained before and after the far infrared exposed to the phantom limb site. The default mode of the brain will be analyzed. If the default mode was changed, it was one of the evidence that the neural signal was transmitted from the phantom limb site into the brain and caused the change.</description>
