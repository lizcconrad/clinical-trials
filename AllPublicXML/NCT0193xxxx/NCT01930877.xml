  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute postoperative pain is an unpleasant, unwanted sensory and emotional experience for the
      patient. The investigators seek to determine if the addition of systemic lidocaine can
      improve the quality of recovery after spine surgery and reduce the requirement for opiate
      therapy.

      Consented patients will be randomized to either saline group or lidocaine group. General
      anesthesia will be induced as it would normally be done in any patient undergoing spine
      surgery. Once the patient is positioned for the surgery bolus followed by the infusion of
      either the study drug or the placebo will be administered. The infusion will be stopped at
      the end of surgery and the patient will be transferred to the post anesthesia care unit. Post
      operative pain score will be evaluated for the first 24 hrs and also the amount of pain
      medications used will be recorded. At the end of 24 hours quality of recovery will be
      assessed using a qor-40 questionnaire.
