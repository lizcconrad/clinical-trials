  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is commonly associated with moderate to severe early
      post-operative pain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of either a
      single-shot femoral nerve block (FNB) or intrathecal diamorphine (ID) on post-operative pain
      after TKA

      The Null Hypothesis is that there is no difference in the post operative pain relief provided
      for TKA by a single-shot femoral nerve block (FNB) as compared to intrathecal diamorphine
      (ID).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2008, the Prospect Working Group, a multidisciplinary expert panel, published their
      consensus guidelines on the relative merits of different anaesthetic and analgesic techniques
      for TKA based on a review of the available published literature up to 2005. These guidelines
      supported the use of general anaesthesia combined with a femoral nerve block for surgery and
      postoperative analgesia, or alternatively spinal anaesthesia with local anaesthetic combined
      with spinal morphine. The preference for femoral nerve block in favour of intrathecal opiates
      was as a consequence of the greater potential for side effects with the latter technique. The
      authors conceded that there were a lack of well-conducted studies on this subject, graded
      their recommendations as level D (expert opinion), and concluded further research was needed.
      Consequently there has been debate around the conclusions drawn and clinicians have not
      universally accepted the recommendations.

      Most researchers to date have focused on short-term outcomes such as static pain scores
      and/or opiate consumption. It is also important however to investigate dynamic pain scores,
      patient reported outcomes, the attainment of rehabilitation goals, length of stay and longer
      term functional outcomes. In addition, the use of the total pain relief score (TOTPAR) as
      described by Cooper and Beaver, assesses the cumulative response to treatment. This is a well
      validated area under the time-analgesic effect curve (AUC) derivation for pain relief which
      is commonly used by meta-analyses of analgesic interventions. The aim of this study is to
      investigate all these endpoints in patients receiving a single-shot femoral nerve block (FNB)
      for TKA as compared to intrathecal diamorphine (ID), a more commonly used spinal opiate in
      United Kingdom anaesthetic practice.

    <description>Quality of recovery score is a 40 point patient reported outcome measure devised by Paul Myles and reported in the British Journal of Anaesthesia 84 (1): 11-15 (2000). This psychometric tool assess emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence and pain grading each out of 5 (0= lowest score and 5 = highest score). We ranked total score as extremely poor (0-40), poor (41-80), satisfactory (81-120), good (121-160) or excellent (161-200).</description>

    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12-item patient-reported questionnaire specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after total knee arthroplasty. It is short, reproducible, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes.
The OKS was designed to be completed by the patient thus minimising potential bias unwittingly introduced by surgeons when assessing the results themselves.
The PRO was designed and developed by researchers within Public Health and Primary Health Care at the University of Oxford in association with surgical colleagues at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.
The OKS at 6 weeks was compared to the preoperative OKS to describe the change in functional outcome.</description>

    <description>EuroQol 5 Dimensions Score/Visual Analogue Score (EQ-5D™/VAS). This is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It uses a patient self reporting 5 point (3 level) questionnaire and visual analogue scale to measure health. Health improvement at 6 weeks was assessed by comparing with pre-operative scores.</description>
