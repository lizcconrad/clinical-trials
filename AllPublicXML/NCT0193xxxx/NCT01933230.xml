  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cooling the neck of patients with ICH decreases
      brain temperature. In addition, the investigators will determine if the device improves the
      delivery of oxygen to the brain. A third goal is to determine if cooling the neck lowers
      intracranial pressure (which is often times high in patients after ICH).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized device efficacy trial. Patients with &gt;20cc Supratentorial ICH and an
      invasive brain temperature monitor (either Licox or Temperature sensing intracranial pressure
      device) will be enrolled after consent. The Excel Cryo Cooling System collar will be placed
      around neck in up to 20 patients for two hours. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of
      this device in cooling the brain. The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients
      after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the
      collar that delivers the cold. During the study and for two hours after, the investigators
      will collect data concerning the brain temperature, body temperature, brain oxygen level and
      pressure both in the head and in the blood (blood pressure). The investigators will also
      collect demographic information about you (i.e. age, gender, medical risk factors) and
      information regarding your current disease process.

    <description>An Excel Cryo Cooling System collar will be placed around the neck for a 2 hour neck cooling period. This will cool the blood in the neck that goes to the brain causing the brain to become cool. The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the collar. The cooling pack is similar to the cooling packs used for sports injuries. The cooling packs will be changed every 20 minutes for the two-hour duration. During the study and for two hours after, we will collect data concerning the brain temperature, body temperature, brain oxygen level and pressure both in the head and in the blood.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with brain injury in the Neurological ICU.

          2. Consent from the patient or surrogate decision maker.

          3. Warfarin induced intracerebral hemorrhages only after correction of INR to &lt;1.4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cerebellar hemorrhages.

          2. Moribund state where the physician team doesn't believe the patient will survive.

          3. Patients who are being cared for with the intent of making them comfortable. DNR-CC
             (by Ohio law).

          4. Known history of a blood dyscrasia such as CLL or essential thrombocytosis that could
             affect inflammation.

          5. Known significant carotid artery stenosis (known &gt;50% stenosis by history or
             incidental hospital imaging). This will not be specifically tested. Patients found to
             have significant stenosis later in the hospital stay will have their data interpreted
             separately as well as in the total group.

          <description>We will place an Excel Cryo Cooling System collar around your neck for two hours. This will cool the blood in the neck that goes to the brain causing the brain to become cool as well. The collar is a standard neck collar used for patients after neck surgery with a modification that allows for the placement of a cooling pack in the collar that delivers the cold. The cooling pack is similar to, but not the same as, the cooling packs used for sports injuries. The cooling packs will be changed every 20 minutes for the two-hour duration of the study. During the study and for two hours after, we will collect data concerning the brain temperature (if applicable), body temperature, brain oxygen level (if applicable) and pressure both in the head (if applicable) and in the blood (blood pressure).
