  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stimulation frequency has been found to affect the axial symptoms of freezing of gait
      (FOG) and speech in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep
      brain stimulation (STN DBS), with the traditionally high stimulation frequency of 130 Hz
      worsening while low frequency of 60 Hz improving these symptoms. The effect of stimulation
      frequency on another important axial symptom, swallowing dysfunction, has not been studied.
      The investigators hypothesize that stimulation frequency could have similar effect on
      swallowing function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study on the effect of the stimulation frequency on swallowing function in
      PD patients with STN DBS. Swallowing dysfunction is often difficult to treat
      pharmacologically and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study hence
      would have significant clinical implications in the management of swallowing dysfunction in
      these PD patients with STN DBS and could potentially decrease their morbidity and mortality.

      The investigators expect that the traditionally high frequency stimulation of 130 Hz would
      worsen while the low frequency stimulation of 60 Hz would improve the swallowing function in

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Eight PD patients with STN DBS and FOG responsive to stimulation frequency changes will be enrolled. Information on the oropharyngeal motility study (OPMS) of the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase function will be collected, under &quot;Med on/DBS off&quot;, &quot;Med on/DBS 130 Hz&quot;, or &quot;Med on/DBS 60 Hz&quot;. Each patient will be randomly assigned to these three conditions in a double blinded manner of 30 minutes apart. The patients will be reassessed under the single best condition (likely Med on/DBS 60 Hz) after being on for 6-8 weeks. ANOVA will be used for group comparison of the scores. A regression model will be further used to assess the predicting value (s) of the other scores and demographics for the swallowing function.</description>
