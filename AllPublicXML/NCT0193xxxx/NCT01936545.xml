    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications are not uncommon after liver transplantation. They can
      not only prolong the stay in intensive care unit and in hospital but also increase the
      morbidity and mortality rate. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, however,
      oxidative stress following hepatic ischemia reperfusion and the ensuing pulmonary leukocyte
      infiltration play an important part in the pulmonary complications. Various drugs and methods
      such as ischemic preconditioning have been used to lessen the production of oxidative free
      radicals following hepatic ischemia reperfusion. The choice of different anesthetic agents
      could aslo change the degree of production of oxygen species and antioxidant capacity during
      the operation.

      Volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents can decrease oxidative injuries through different
      mechanisms, however, which is better in preventing the pulmonary leukocyte infiltration is
      still unknown.

      We attempt the compare the oxidative stress and cytokine level in liver transplant recipients
      under desflurane or propofol anesthesia to evaluate which kind of anesthetic agent is better
      in this kind of surgery.

    <textblock>
      The occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications after hepatic reperfusion, such as in
      patients undergoing liver transplantation, is a major concern in the intensive care unit. Not
      only neutrophil infiltration, but also oxidative injuries, have been demonstrated after
      intra-operative hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) management. Previous studies have shown
      that reactive oxygen species (ROS) paly a major role in the ensuing damage, although
      I/R-induced remote organ injury is a complex and multifactorial process. Methods to reduce
      ROS generation, such as ischemic preconditioning, attenuate both liver and lung damage after
      hepatic I/R. Considering the intra-operative ROS production occurs after hepatic reperfusion
      , the choice of anesthetics may alter the magnitude of ROS production and the antioxidant
      capacity.

      Volatile and non-volatile anesthetics can exert their antioxidant capacity through different
      mechanisms. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has been reported to provide antioxidant
      capacity by scavenging free radicals. However, volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane,
      desflurane or sevoflurane can reduce the oxidative damage through anesthetic preconditioning.
      Several animal studies demonstrate that volatile anesthetics offer more protection against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury than intravenous anesthetics. On the contrary, intravenous
      anesthetics may be more protective against sepsis-induced hepatic injury than volatile
      anesthetics. However, there are few investigations concerning the effects of different
      anesthetics on remote pulmonary injuries in clinical settings.

      In this study, propofol and desflurane will be used for the maintenance of anesthesia during
      liver transplantation. The heart function, respiratory function, liver function, kidney
      function, the oxidative injuries and inflammatory mediators will be compared between the two
      groups.
