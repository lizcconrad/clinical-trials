        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of a primary adenocarcinoma of the colon and / or rectum

          -  Have a history of Stage IV Colorectal Cancer (CRC) with metastases to the liver only

          -  Have received at least 3 months ,of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or perioperative
             chemotherapy, including a fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan or
             both for subjects with initial Stage IV CRC which were treated with surgery with
             curative intent for both primary and metastatic lesions. The total chemotherapy
             administered, including that administered prior to and after liver resection, should
             not exceed 9 months. OR Have received surgery with curative intent for primary CRC and
             at least 3 months ,of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or perioperative chemotherapy for the
             primary tumor, including a fluoropyrimidine or a fluoropyrimidine and either
             oxaliplatin or irinotecan or both

               -  For subjects with liver metastases developing &gt; 6 months after completing
                  treatment for primary CRC and having undergone surgery with curative intent for
                  liver metastases, a second course of chemotherapy lasting at least 3 months needs
                  to be administered, including a fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or
                  irinotecan or both. The second course of chemotherapy should not exceed 9 months.

          -  For subjects who developed liver metastases &gt;/=6 months after completing treatment for
             primary CRC and having undergone surgery with curative intent for liver metastases, a
             second course of chemotherapy is not permitted unless initial adjuvant therapy
             consisted of fluoropyrimidine monotherapy. Subjects who received fluoropyrimidine
             alone must have received a second course of chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and
             either oxaliplatin or irinotecan or both, which should not exceed 9 months.For
             subjects with initial Stage I or II disease, no chemotherapy is required for a primary
             CRC lesion treated with surgery with curative intent. These subjects must receive
             chemotherapy for the treatment of liver metastases (which were also treated with
             surgery with curative intent), which must last at least 3 months, including a
             fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan or both. The total course of
             chemotherapy should not exceed 9 months.
