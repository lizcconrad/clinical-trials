    <measure>Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of VAY736 in reducing the clinical disease activity in pemphigus vulgaris patinets.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of VAY736 on clinical disease activity will be measured by the change in Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) between baseline and week 12. PDAI is an assessment of skin and mucosal disease activity by the Investigator. The score incorporates the number and size of lesions across multiple skin locations and the mucous membranes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to an average of 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Summarized statistics on adverse events will be reported under categories such as total adverse events, serious adverse events and death</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autoimmune Skin disease Intensity Score (ABSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of VAY736 on the ABSIS score will be compared betwen baseline and Week 12. ABSIS is a quality and quantity-based score of skin and oral mucosal lesions, combining the extent of the affected body surface area, the quality of the lesion and the extent of oral mucosal involvement, including food-related pain and discomfort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of VAY736 on the IGA of a patient's disease activity will compared between baseline and Week 12. The IGA score ranges from 0 (no sign of active disease) to 4 (Severe active disease)</description>

    <time_frame>0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24 and approximately 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of VAY736 will be measured in the serum. Descriptive statistics will include area under the concentration curve, half-life and time to maximum concentration.</description>
