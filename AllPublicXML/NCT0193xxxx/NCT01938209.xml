    <textblock>
      Thirty-nine patients with cervical spine pain were randomly assigned to either a seated
      thoracic manipulation or targeted supine thoracic manipulation group. Pain and flexion range
      of motion measures were taken before and after the intervention.

      DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of seated
      thoracic manipulation versus targeted supine thoracic manipulation on cervical spine pain and
      flexion range of motion. There is evidence that thoracic spine manipulation is an effective
      treatment for patients with cervical spine pain. This evidence includes a variety of
      techniques to manipulate the thoracic spine. While each of them is effective, no research has
      compared techniques to determine which produces the best outcomes.

      METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with cervical spine pain were randomly assigned to either a
      seated thoracic manipulation or targeted supine thoracic manipulation group. Pain and flexion
      range of motion measures were taken before and after the intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria required patients to be between 18-60 years old with a primary
             complaint of neck pain

        Exclusion Criteria:
