      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of specialised and sustained intervention with or
      without parent groups during the initial phase of schizophrenia or related disorders on
      relapse prevention

      Methods: A three conditions randomized trial with a duration of five years

      Participants: 200 consecutively referred patients aged 15-28 years with a first psychotic
      episode of schizophrenia or related disorder

      Treatment-conditions: Specialized Treatment of early schizophrenia (ST), ST including Parent
      groups (ST+P) and Treatment As Usual (TAU).

      Outcome-measures: cumulative relapse rates and time to first relapse after first remission.
      Secondary outcome measure: social functioning.

      Statistical analysis: cumulative relapse rates using life-table methods. The effect of the
      three interventions on time to first relapse after remission will be compared using Cox
      regression analysing intention to treat (ITT) grouping.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence for optimal duration and necessary ingredients of early and sustained specialized
      treatment from first episode psychosis till the end of the initial phase schizophrenia is
      still insufficient. Randomized trials with a treatment duration of six months to two years
      with favorable symptomatic and psychosocial results disappeared at five year follow-up. Other
      studies suggest that specialized treatment should last 5 years in order to be able to prevent
      instead of only delaying clinical and psychosocial deteriorating.

      In this study we examine both the symptomatic (relapse) and psychosocial outcome of a three
      armed five year randomized trial in the initial phase of schizophrenia.

    <description>Participants will be followed for the duration of the 5 year outpatient treatment of the trial. During the trial the timing and number of psychotic relapses of each participant will be assessed using the Life Chart Schedule (LCS) at year 1, year 3 and year 5 after the start of the trial.
Trained interviewers not involved in clinical treatment of patients will elicit with the LCS detailed information of symptoms, signs and treatment from respondents (patients and/or parents) and from clinical records. Respondents will be asked to indicate any changes in symptomatology since the last interview. All details will be fitted in a schedule with 6 months intervals.</description>

    <description>During the duration of the 5 year outpatient treatment of the trial social functioning of each participant will be assessed using the Life Chart Schedule (LCS) at year 1, year 3 and year 5 after the start of the trial.
Detailed information of social functioning in work, study, school and relations will be elicited from respondents (patients and/or parents) and from clinical records. Respondents will be asked to indicate any changes in functioning since the last interview.All details will be fitted in a schedule with 6 months.</description>

    <description>Continuity of care in treatment and professional caregiver was given during 5 year. Treatment targets included relapse prevention through recognition of prodromal symptoms, coping with negative symptoms and stress, increasing medication adherence, decrease of substance use, prevention of drop-out and stimulating and supporting participation in structural activities (work and/or education).</description>

    <description>Standard Treatment as usual (TU) was provided during 5 years by local mental health care professionals situated nearby the domicile of patients. TU had comparable treatment targets as ST but was not provided by treatment staff specialized in early intervention in schizophrenia or related disorders. However, TU was (like ST) sustained and dedicated to prevent psychotic relapse and improve social functioning.</description>
