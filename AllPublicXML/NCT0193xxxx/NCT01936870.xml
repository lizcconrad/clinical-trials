  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fesoterodine fumarate in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate was assessed by the investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical efficacy rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved clinical effectiveness over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Overall effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate was determined by the investigator based on clinical symptoms and examinations. Clinical effectiveness was assessed according to the following categories: (1) effective, (2) ineffective, or (3) unassessable at week 12 of the treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fesoterodine fumarate in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate. A treatment-related serious adverse event was a treatment-related adverse event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; lifethreatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate was assessed by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events Unexpected From Japanese Package Insert</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fesoterodine fumarate in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate. Expectedness of the adverse event was determined according to the Japanese package insert. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate was assessed by the investigator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events Related to Cognitive Function Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Adverse events related to cognitive function disorder were identified by broad searches on the Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQ).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) measured general cognitive functioning: orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two intersecting polygons. Total score derived from sub-scores; total ranged from 0 to 30, higher score indicates better cognitive state. Mean change from baseline in the MMSE score at 12 weeks was presented along with the corresponding standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors included atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors included quinidine and paroxetine. A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fesoterodine fumarate in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate was assessed by the investigator.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to fesoterodine fumarate in a participant who received fesoterodine fumarate. Relatedness to fesoterodine fumarate was assessed by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who were satisfied by fesoterodine fumarate treatment over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Satisfaction scale was assessed by the participants according to the following categories: (1) satisfied, (2) unsatisfied, (3) uncertain, or (4) unconfirmed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) was defined as the sum score (0 to 15) of the following four OAB symptoms: daytime frequency (2 at maximum), nighttime frequency (3 at maximum), urgency (5 at maximum), and urgency incontinence (5 at maximum). Higher score indicates worse symptoms. Mean change from baseline in the OABSS at 12 weeks was presented along with the corresponding standard deviation.</description>

        <description>Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) was defined as the sum score (0 to 15) of the following four OAB symptoms: daytime frequency (2 at maximum), nighttime frequency (3 at maximum), urgency (5 at maximum), and urgency incontinence (5 at maximum). Higher score indicates worse symptoms. Mean change from baseline in the OABSS at 12 weeks was presented along with the corresponding standard deviation.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The effectiveness analysis set comprised of participants from the safety analysis set who had effectiveness evaluation at least once after treatment with fesoterodine fumarate, excluding those with off-label use. Participants with observed change in OABSS were included in table.</population>
