    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop and test a technology-enhanced transitional
      palliative care (TPC) intervention for patients and caregivers living in rural locations. The
      investigators hypothesize that access to palliative care will be improved, thereby improving
      patient and caregiver reported outcomes and decreasing the use of costly health services.

      The purpose of the proposed research is to design and evaluate a technology enhanced
      transitional palliative care (TPC) intervention for patients living in rural locations. The
      contributions of the proposed research are expected to address the gap in palliative care
      services and transitions of care for rural patients. This research is significant because it
      addresses the challenges of three independently important health care foci - needs of rural
      patients, care transitions, and the evolving field of palliative care. The study will not
      simply address the critical barrier imposed by distance, but also extend PC practice by
      improving transition management for the impending dramatic increase in seriously ill and
      dying patients in rural areas through evolving demographic shifts. The goal of the proposed
      research is to advance the development of transitional care strategies for rural PC patients
      and caregivers, and provide evidence of new ways to support continuity of care for patients
      with life-limiting conditions.

      The study is guided by the &quot;Transitional Care Model&quot; or &quot;TCM&quot; as developed by Naylor which
      combines quality, cost, and satisfaction. The TCM has a solid evidence base from more than 15
      years of multidisciplinary research. Unique features of the model include care that is
      delivered and coordinated by the same nurse across hospital and home settings 7 days per week
      for an average of 2 to 3 months using evidence-based protocols with a focus on long term
      outcomes. Core components of the model include a holistic, person/family centered approach
      and protocol guided care. The nurse functions as part of an interdisciplinary team with
      shared accountability, however, the nurse is the single &quot;point person&quot; across an episode of
      care providing the vital link from hospital to home. Inherent within the model is shared
      communication systems that span care settings.

      A randomized control trial design will be used. Community dwelling adult patients and their
      caregivers who receive a palliative care consult while hospitalized in the hospital will be
      enrolled in the study, then randomized to group membership and followed for a total of 8
      weeks after hospital discharge. Following a detailed protocol for TPC, the intervention group
      will receive weekly video session visits (using computer software that allows audio/visual
      contact through the computer screen) by the study nurse. The investigators will determine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the TPC intervention and study methods and procedures when
      engaging palliative care patients and their caregivers. The investigators will compare
      patient and caregiver reported outcomes and determine effect size for patients receiving
      technology-enhanced TPC (intervention group) to patients in the control group, and they will
      explore the impact of the technology-enhanced TPC intervention on health care service
      utilization.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post-enrollment, 2 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's quality of life will be determined by the change in mean scores from baseline to 1 month and 2 months post enrollment, using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care Scale (FACIT-Pal). The FACIT-Pal palliative subscale contains 19 questions specific to persons with life-limiting illness. Each item is rated on a 5 point numeric rating scale from 9 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores range from 0-76. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean scores on ESAS-r Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month post-enrollment, 2 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's symptom intensity will be determined by the change in mean scores from baseline to 1 month and 2 months post enrollment, as measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (revised) ESAS-r scale, The ESAS-r captures the patient's perspective on 9 symptoms that are common in palliative care (pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, wellbeing). An optional 10th symptom can be reported. Each symptom is rated on an 11 point numeric rating scale from 0 (symptom absent or best) to 10 (worst possible). Scores range from 0-100, with lower scores indicating patient perceives fewer or no symptoms and higher scores indicating patient perceives worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>Health Services information will be summarized by review of medical records and administrative databases for number of unplanned hospitalizations, number of intensive care unit days, total length of hospital stay (days), number of emergency department visits, number of clinic office visits, number of home healthcare visits, time (in days) to hospice admission, and time (days) receiving hospice.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving usual palliative care service in the hospital setting, Technology-Enhanced Transitional Palliative Care patients will receive Transitional Care from the Palliative Care consulting team beginning in the hospital within 24 hours of study enrollment and continuing post discharge for eight weeks in their homes in rural locations by means of video visits with the Palliative Care consulting team.</description>

    <description>The Transitional Care intervention will be initiated within 24 hours after enrollment, and will include initial transitional care planning, daily hospital visits, crisis prevention planning by an experienced Palliative Care nurse. The intervention will continue after the patient is discharged to home or short term skilled nursing facility, and it will involve an in-person visit between 24-48 hours post discharge, weekly virtual visits via iPad and video conference technology, and additional home visits as needed. Care plans established during initial planning will be implemented and adjusted under the guidance of the palliative care nurse delivering the intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Usual Standard of Care</intervention_name>
    <description>Usual care includes routine hospital discharge planning and usual physician care in primary and specialty outpatient clinics post hospital discharge. The PC consulting service provides consulting services in the inpatient setting. There are no standardized, intentional services provided to outpatients by the PC consulting team. Services provided to outpatients may occur sporadically as initiated by the patient. The majority of PC follow-up if any is a single phone call to the patient/caregiver. To account for the time spent and number of contacts made with the intervention group, the control group will be contacted by phone weekly by a non-nurse member of the study team not involved with the intervention, asked to relate what, if any, medically-related events occurred.</description>
