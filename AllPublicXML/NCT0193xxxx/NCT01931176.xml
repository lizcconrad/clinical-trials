      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other more serious illnesses. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to a dengue virus vaccine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and the more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic
      fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of
      hospitalization and death in children in at least 8 tropical Asian countries. There are 4
      types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which can cause dengue
      illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study will evaluate the
      experimental rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine for the prevention of illness due to DENV-2. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in healthy adults
      with no history of previous flavivirus infection.

      At study entry, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the dengue virus
      vaccine or placebo. They will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the
      injection for monitoring. Study visits will occur at Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28,
      56, and 180. All study visits will include a blood collection, and most study visits will
      include a physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at select
      visits. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day for the first 16
      days; study researchers will review these readings during the study visits.
