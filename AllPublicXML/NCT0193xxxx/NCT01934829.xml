  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although sorafenib is effective and safe in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC), it increases dermatologic toxicities, including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), which
      may have a negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL). Urea-based creams may have a
      prophylactic effect on sorafenib-induced HFSR in HCC patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild hyperkeratosis is an early sign of HFSR and may sometimes be the only manifestation of
      sorafenib-associated HFSR. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions and
      has been recommended for the treatment of multitargeted kinase inhibitor-related HFSR . To
      our knowledge, no randomized, controlled trials to date have evaluated treatments to
      prevent/palliate sorafenib-associated HFSR. We therefore tested the prophylactic effects of a
      urea-based cream on the incidence of HFSR associated with sorafenib treatment of patients
      with advanced HCC.
