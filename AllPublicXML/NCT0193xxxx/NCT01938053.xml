  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to improve the process for contacting patients that test
      positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the emergency department by using text
      messaging. We believe patients that are contacted by both a phone call and a text message
      will be reached more often and they will be reached sooner than those that only receive a
      phone call or only a text message. In addition, patients will be given reminder cards at the
      time of testing to remind them that they will be contacted within 7 days if they test
      positive. Half of the reminder cards will have a number to call for test results. We believe
      patients that receive a card with a number are more likely to be contacted within 7 days.
