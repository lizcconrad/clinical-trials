      The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) is an opportunity
      to conduct methodology research relevant to many features of a large prospective study.
      NICOLA will begin in earnest in Northern Ireland in 2013 and is being conducted by a
      multidisciplinary team in the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University Belfast. It is
      an omnibus programme of research on ageing that will continue for at least 10 years and will
      recruit 8500 middle-aged people in Northern Ireland and follow them into old age, providing a
      comprehensive assessment of their physical and mental health, their lifestyles, and their
      social and economic decision making. NICOLA will look at how they perceive disability and
      health, and how this differs between well-off and disadvantaged groups. NICOLA will also
      study various genetic, biological and psychological factors, including how participants
      perceive risk and value their time, and the effect of this on their retirement behaviour
      (including how they manage their money and their health). People over the age of 50 will be
      invited to take part and asked to complete detailed interviews and questionnaires every 2
      years and health assessments every 4 years.

      The overall aim of this research is to examine the impact of differing invitation letters
      offered to participants on study recruitment rates.

      Recruiting, retaining and gathering complete data on participants in research projects, be
      they patients or health professionals, can be extremely difficult. These problems increase
      the risk that research will be abandoned before its true value is appreciated, or lead to
      delays in resolving uncertainty for decision makers, while further studies are done. Poor
      recruitment, retention and outcome collection frequently lead to many prospective studies
      being extended, increasing costs. Researchers need to use strategies that are themselves
      evidence-based. This study links with an existing longitudinal ageing study called NICOLA to
      provide evidence on what research participants prefer in relation to providing personal
      information through a self-completed questionnaire. NICOLA is a large study of people over
      the age of 50 that is being conducted in Northern Ireland. NICOLA is aiming to recruit 8500
      people and will ask them questions about participation in social activities, including
      organised structured and informal activities; relationship quality; loneliness; stress;
      resilience; quality of life; alcohol intake; food poverty and assess their health and
      wellbeing. Participants in NICOLA agree to having an interviewer visit them at home to ask
      questions about their lives, complete questionnaires in their own time and attend a health
      assessment appointment. They also agree to being followed up over a course of at least 10
      years.

      The research described here will examine the impact of differing invitation letters offered
      to participants on study recruitment rates, with the following specific objectives:

        -  Understanding if the gender of the person signing the invitation letter has an effect on
           recruitment

        -  Exploring the potential impact of the use of describing the research as a 'study' or as
           a 'project'

        -  Understanding if discussing and guaranteeing confidentiality for the participants in the
           invitation letter has an impact on recruitment.

      We will do this by randomly allocating each of the 13000 participants contacted by NICOLA to
      receive invitation letter by one of the following three choices using a 3x2x2 factorial
      design:

        1. Gender of the signatory (male versus female versus neutral team signature)

        2. Description of NICOLA (study versus project)

        3. Guarantee of confidentiality (inserted versus removed)

      We will then analyse the numbers of participants agreeing to join NICOLA and use this to
      determine which invitation letter is the most acceptable to the participants. This research
      will occur within the first 18 months of NICOLA, when all participants are being recruited.

    <description>There are 12 versions of the invitation letter. Three aspects of the letter will be adapted: (1) Gender of the signatory i.e. male, female or gender neutral (signed from the NICOLA team) (2) Description of NICOLA as a 'study' or 'project' and (3) Inserting a sentence guaranteeing the participants confidentially or not having this in the letter (but will still appear in the Patient Information Sheet). The twelve versions are as follows:
Male &amp; Study &amp; Confidentiality
Male &amp; Study
Male &amp; Project &amp; Confidentiality

Female &amp; Project &amp; Confidentiality
