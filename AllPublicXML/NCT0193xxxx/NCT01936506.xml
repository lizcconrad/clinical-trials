      This study is evaluating the effects of two brain training exercises on: memory, cognitive
      processing and depression symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent public health need to develop more effective and well tolerated treatments
      for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); cognitive training interventions aiming to
      modify cognitive and affective processing abnormalities underlying MDD represent a promising
      new strategy. This research project translates a well established cognitive bias in major
      depressive disorder (MDD), working memory bias, into a novel intervention target. In a
      double-blind, randomized, controlled study, MDD participants undergo 4 weeks of cognitive
      training sessions, with two sessions per week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary, current Axis I diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV
             criteria and Ham-D-17 score between 16-27

          -  Age 18-55

          -  Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (DSM-IV criteria) within 6 months

          -  Visual impairment that would affect the ability to observe the computerized
             presentation of faces.

          -  Motor impairment that would affect the ability to provide a response by quickly
             pressing a button.

          -  Lifetime history of Bipolar spectrum disorders or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

          -  Primary, current Axis I diagnosis other than Major Depressive Disorder

          -  Primary, current Axis II personality disorder.

          -  Currently attending a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy regimen

          -  Acute suicidal or homicidal risk (evidenced by suicidal or homicidal attempt within 6
             months of screening)

          -  Pregnancy in women.

        Subjects must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use. Subjects with current excessive use
        of alcohol (&gt; 8 ounces/day for men and &gt; 6 ounces/day for women) are ineligible for
        participation, as such drug use could confound the results.
