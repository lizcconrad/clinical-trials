  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate the hypothesis that children with ADHD have difficulty with the allocation of
      visio-spatial attention related to an inability to control posterior alpha brain
      oscillations. A paradigm will be used in which the aim is to address covert attention as
      similar recent studies did in adults with ADHD.
