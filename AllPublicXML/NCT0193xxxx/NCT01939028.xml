      This clinical trial studies lymph node mapping in patients with newly diagnosed endometrial
      cancer undergoing surgery. Lymph node mapping may help in planning surgery to remove
      endometrial cancer and affected lymph nodes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the detection rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value of sentinel
      lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare different surgical modalities (open procedures, minimally invasive procedures,
      and single-site technology) and different injectants (isosulfan blue and indocyanine green)
      for SLN biopsy.

      II. To determine total operating room time (from the time the patient enters the room to the
      time the patient leaves the room) as well as console time (robotic)/operating time for
      minimally invasive procedures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SLN mapping using isosulfan blue and/or indocyanine green solution injected
      directly into the cervix. Following SLN identification and biopsy, patients undergo
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and/or complete pelvic lymphadenectomy.
      Patients expressing SLN positive for metastasis undergo para-aortic lymphadenectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks.

    <description>Sensitivity estimated as the proportion of true positives among patients with lymph node metastases. Sensitivity Calculation= the number of patients with a positive SLN over those patients with a positive SLN plus those patients with a false negative lymph node.
Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of SLN biopsy for detecting metastasis will be estimated and appropriate 95% confidence intervals for each value will be provided.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of surgical modalities (open procedures, minimally invasive procedures, and single-site technology)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of true positive sentinel lymph nodes identified will be compared between the surgical modalities using pairwise comparisons for each surgical modality. Comparisons will be performed using two sample tests of proportions based on a normal approximation.</description>

    <description>Total operating room time will be estimated as a mean with 95% confidence interval if the data have an approximately normal distribution. Otherwise, the median and a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for the median will be reported. Similar summaries will be provided for the console time (robotic)/ operating time.</description>
