      To demonstrate point accuracy of the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System (System)
      interstitial glucose results against venous glucose reference and capillary fingerstick using
      the Consensus Error Grid over the wear duration. During the course of the wear duration, the
      subject is required to be testing fingerstick glucose measurement at least 8 times a day for
      capillary reference glucose measurements and three in-clinic visits of maximum 10 hours each
      for venous reference glucose measurements. With every reference measurement, the subject or
      study staff will perform a measurement on the System.

        Subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes requiring multiple daily insulin injections (MDI)
        or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). No more than 10 subjects (5 per site)
        will have HbA1c &gt; 8.5%, and no more than 10 subjects (5 per site) will have HbA1c &lt; 7%

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes for at least 2 years prior to enrollment.

          3. Subject must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or multiple daily
             insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily) for at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          5. In the Investigator's opinion, the Subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          6. Subject must be available to participate in all study visits up to a period of 14
             days.

          7. Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has known allergy to medical grade adhesive or isopropyl alcohol used to
             disinfect skin.

          2. Subject is pregnant, attempting to conceive or not willing and able to practice birth
             control during the study duration.

          3. Subject has skin lesions, scarring, redness, infection or edema at the application
             sites that could interfere with device placement or the accuracy of interstitial
             glucose measurements.

          4. Subject currently is participating in another clinical trial.

          5. Subject has donated blood within 112 days prior to the beginning of the study
             activities.

          6. Subject has concomitant medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could interfere with the study or present a risk to the safety or welfare of the
             Subject or study staff. Such conditions include but are not limited to:

               -  History of HIV, Hepatitis B or C, or other blood-borne pathogen;

               -  Subject has an increased risk of bleeding.

               -  Subject has X-ray, MRI or CT appointment scheduled during the period of study
                  participation, and the appointment cannot be rescheduled for a time before study
                  participation starts or after study participation ends.

               -  Subject is unsuitable for participation due to any other cause as determined by
                  the Investigator.
