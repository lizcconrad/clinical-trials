    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of how stroke changes both the
      structure and function of the brain. The investigators will determine which is the key driver
      of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or changes in
      how brain regions interact with one another.

      The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of how stroke changes both the
      structure and function of the brain. Further, the investigators will determine which is the
      key driver of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or
      changes in how brain regions interact with one another. Together, these data will advance the
      investigators understanding of how neural systems support recovery from stroke. The
      investigators will use a MRI technique that allows us to assess the health of a brain
      structure called myelin. This structure is important as it allows information to travel down
      nerves faster; the more myelin the quicker the signal can be conducted. The investigators aim
      is to test whether or not movement training can restore myelin in the brain. If movement
      training does restore myelin in the brain, the investigators will have identified an
      important new target for rehabilitation interventions.

    <description>Increased paretic arm will be manipulated through the performance of a semi-immersive virtual reality-based intercept and release task called TRAIT (TRack And Intercept Task), which is performed in an interactive environment. TRAIT employs an open source Kinect sensor, which tracks 3-D joint movement. Participants are asked to control an on-screen icon using movements of their paretic arm to intercept a moving object as it emerges from the side of a computer screen. Once intercepted, they must accurately throw the object to hit a target. Participants move up through 10 levels of the game as their skill improves. Participants will complete 10 TRAIT training sessions in 4 weeks for a total of 10,000 experimental movements.</description>
