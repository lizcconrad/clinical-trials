    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the additive effect of brinzolamide
      1%/brimonidine 0.2% (SIMBRINZA® suspension) in subjects with either open angle glaucoma or
      ocular hypertension who are currently on a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy (TRAVATAN
      Z®).

      This study was divided into 2 sequential phases. The Screening/Eligibility Phase included one
      Screening Visit and two Eligibility Visits, during which subjects washed out of all other
      intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications and dosed with TRAVATAN Z®, 1 drop instilled
      in each eye once daily for 28 days. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria were
      randomized at the second Eligibility Visit. The Treatment Phase consisted of two on-therapy
      visits (Week 2 and Week 6).

    <measure>Mean Diurnal Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the four timepoints measured (8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Diurnal IOP Change From Baseline to Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline IOP was defined as the average of the timepoint-matched IOP measurements at Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2 Visits. Diurnal IOP change was defined as the average of the four changes from baseline (timepoints 8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A more negative change from baseline indicates a greater improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP.</description>

    <description>Baseline IOP was defined as the average of the timepoint-matched IOP measurements at Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2 Visits. Diurnal IOP Percentage Change was defined as the average of the four percent changes from baseline (timepoints 8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A more negative percent change from baseline indicates a greater amount of improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP.</description>

        <title>Mean Diurnal Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Week 6</title>
        <description>Diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the four timepoints measured (8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

        <population>This analysis population includes all subjects who received study medication and completed at least 1 scheduled on-therapy study visit. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was not utilized; therefore results report subjects present at Week 6 with no imputation for missingness.</population>

          <description>Diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the four timepoints measured (8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

        <description>Baseline IOP was defined as the average of the timepoint-matched IOP measurements at Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2 Visits. Diurnal IOP change was defined as the average of the four changes from baseline (timepoints 8 AM, 10 AM, 3 PM, and 5 PM). IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters mercury (mmHg). One eye was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the analyses. A more negative change from baseline indicates a greater improvement, i.e., a reduction of IOP.</description>
