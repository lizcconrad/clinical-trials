  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), self-controlled, long-term post-marketing study in
      participants with ADHD. The study consists of 3 periods: screening period, wash-out
      period/run-in period (3 days), and open-label treatment period (12 weeks) which is divided
      into 2 periods that is dosage adjustment period and dose-optimization period. The total
      duration of the study is 12 weeks. During the dosage adjustment period, the dose of
      methylphenidate hydrochloride was adjusted to the optimal dose within 1-3 weeks starting with
      initial dosage of 18 milligram per day (mg/d) which can be increased to 36 mg/d up to a
      maximum dosage of 54 mg/d according to the therapeutic effect and tolerance or maintained at
      36 mg or re-adjusted to 18 mg due to intolerance. Participants will receive the optimal dose
      determined during dose adjustment period for 9 weeks during the dose-optimization period. In
      the study, 2 types of participants will be enrolled in 2 groups (according to condition):
      OROS-MPH group (participants with ADHD) and the normal children group (healthy participants).
      The efficacy will be assessed primarily by Digit Span Test and Inattention /Over activity
      With Aggression (IOWA) Conners evaluation scale. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Digit Span Test Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The digit span test is mainly used to measure the ability of short-term memory and attention. The participant will be given a string of digits and asked to repeat them forward, and then a second string of digits to repeat backward. The score is the number of correct responses, where the digits were repeated correctly. One point will be given for each correctly repeated string of digits. The maximum subscore in the Digits Forward is 16, and the maximum subscore in the Digits Backward is 14, summed for a total score of 30. A higher score is indicative of better recall and attention.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Digit Span Test Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The digit span test is mainly used to measure the ability of short-term memory and attention. The participant will be given a string of digits and asked to repeat them forward, and then a second string of digits to repeat backward. The score is the number of correct responses, where the digits were repeated correctly. One point will be given for each correctly repeated string of digits. The maximum subscore in the Digits Forward is 16, and the maximum subscore in the Digits Backward is 14, summed for a total score of 30. A higher score is indicative of better recall and attention.</description>

        <description>IOWA Conners Behavior Rating Scale evaluated by parents provides accurate measurement standards for behavioral change and therapeutic response. It includes 2 sub-scales: Inattention/Overactivity (I/O) subscale and Attacks (A), also known as Opposition/Defiant (O/D) sub-scale. IO (primary measurement ) will be assessed using 5-items and all Items will be scored on a 4-point scale (from 0=not at all to 3=very much). Total score range is from 0 to 15. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in IOWA Conners Behavior Rating Scale - I/O Score at Week 12</title>
          <description>IOWA Conners Behavior Rating Scale evaluated by parents provides accurate measurement standards for behavioral change and therapeutic response. It includes 2 sub-scales: Inattention/Overactivity (I/O) subscale and Attacks (A), also known as Opposition/Defiant (O/D) sub-scale. IO (primary measurement ) will be assessed using 5-items and all Items will be scored on a 4-point scale (from 0=not at all to 3=very much). Total score range is from 0 to 15. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>This is a psychological test to observe the interference in which disparity between the meaning and color affects reading speed. A participant will be given 3 tasks of recognition: reading the printed colored ink (Color Test), reading color words in black ink (Word Test), and interference, reading color words printed in different colored ink (Word-Color Test). The test is scored on the number of correct answers. There are 100 items for each of the three categories and if they made it through the 100 words with time remaining, they would repeat the list. Median naming time in the Stroop color word naming test will be assessed. Stroop color word naming test 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 stand for gradually increased difficulty and each test has a corresponding baseline and endpoint.</description>

WCST consists of 13 test indicators and all indicators will be analyzed separately. The 13 indicators are as follows: number of trials administered; number of categories completed; response corrects; percent corrects; total number of errors; trials to complete first category; percent conceptual level responses; perseverative responses; perseverative errors; percent perseverative errors; nonperseverative errors; failure to maintain set; learning to learn. During number of trials administered or administered responses, participants were administered 128 cards and asked to sort the cards until all the 6 sorting categories was completed. Response number used to complete all 6 categories ranges from 50 to 128, lesser the better.</description>

The 13 indicators are as follows: number of trials administered; number of categories completed; response corrects; percent corrects; total number of errors; trials to complete first category; percent conceptual level responses; perseverative responses; perseverative errors; percent perseverative errors; nonperseverative errors; failure to maintain set; learning to learn. During number of trials administered or administered responses, participants were administered 128 cards and asked to sort the cards until all the 6 sorting categories was completed. Response number used to complete all 6 categories ranges from 50 to 128, lesser the better.</description>
          <population>FAS population for OROS-MPH Group included participants who received at least 1 study drug and had at least one efficacy evaluation. FAS for normal group included all participants who had baseline scale evaluation and had at least one endpoint scale evaluation. &quot;n&quot; signifies participants who were evaluable at each time point for each specific arm.</population>

        <title>WCST: First Response (Rf)</title>
        <description>WCST is used to evaluate participants’ abilities of abstract generalization, working memory, and distraction-cognitive clinically, which reflects participants’ cognitive function objectively and comprehensively. WCST consists of 13 test indicators and all indicators will be analyzed separately. The 13 indicators are as follows: number of trials administered; number of categories completed; response corrects; percent corrects; total number of errors; trials to complete first category; percent conceptual level responses; perseverative responses; perseverative errors; percent perseverative errors; nonperseverative errors; failure to maintain set; learning to learn. Number of responses needed to complete the first color classification was evaluated. Ranges from 9 to 128, the lesser the better.</description>

        <description>IOWA conners behavior rating scale score in different dosage groups will be accessed to evaluate relationship between therapeutic effect and dosage. IOWA Conners Behavior Rating Scale evaluated by parents provides accurate measurement standards for behavioral change and therapeutic response. It includes 2 sub-scales: Inattention/Overactivity (I/O) subscale and Attacks (A), also known as Opposition/Defiant (O/D) sub-scale. IO (primary measurement ) will be assessed using 5-items and all Items will be scored on a 4-point scale (from 0=not at all to 3=very much). Total score range is from 0 to 15. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>The digit span test total score will be accessed in different dosage groups to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic effect and dosage. The digit span test is mainly used to measure the ability of short-term memory and attention. The participant will be given a string of digits and asked to repeat them forward, and then a second string of digits to repeat backward. The score is the number of correct responses, where the digits were repeated correctly. One point will be given for each correctly repeated string of digits. The maximum subscore in the Digits Forward is16, and the maximum subscore in the Digits Backward is 14, for a total score of 30. A higher score was indicative of better recall and attention.</description>

        <description>Completion time of stroop color-word test in different dosage groups will be accessed to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic effect and dosage. This is a psychological test to observe the interference in which disparity between the meaning and color affects reading speed. A participant will be given 3 tasks of recognition: reading the printed colored ink (Color Test), reading color words in black ink (Word Test), and interference, reading color words printed in different colored ink (Word-Color Test). The test will be scored on the number of correct answers. There are 100 items for each of the three categories and if they made it through the 100 words with time remaining, they would repeat the list. Median time of the naming time in the Stroop color word naming test will be accessed. Stroop color word naming test 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 stand for gradually increased difficulty and each test has a corresponding baseline and endpoint.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Completion Time of Stroop Color-word Test at Week 12</title>
          <description>Completion time of stroop color-word test in different dosage groups will be accessed to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic effect and dosage. This is a psychological test to observe the interference in which disparity between the meaning and color affects reading speed. A participant will be given 3 tasks of recognition: reading the printed colored ink (Color Test), reading color words in black ink (Word Test), and interference, reading color words printed in different colored ink (Word-Color Test). The test will be scored on the number of correct answers. There are 100 items for each of the three categories and if they made it through the 100 words with time remaining, they would repeat the list. Median time of the naming time in the Stroop color word naming test will be accessed. Stroop color word naming test 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 stand for gradually increased difficulty and each test has a corresponding baseline and endpoint.</description>
