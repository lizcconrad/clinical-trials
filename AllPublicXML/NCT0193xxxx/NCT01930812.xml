    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare, in patients with prostate or breast cancer, the
      accuracy of 18F-NaF PET imaging to 99mTc whole body bone scans with single-photon emission
      computed tomography (SPECT).

    <textblock>
      Technetium-99m (99mTc) is the most widely used radionuclide in diagnostic nuclear medicine
      studies. It is used in 20 million diagnostic procedures worldwide annually. It became popular
      as a radioisotope because of its easy availability from a 99Molybdenum (99Mo)/99mTc
      generator, historic low costs, and previous high availability.

      The National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River Laboratories (Ontario, Canada)
      was shut down unexpectedly in May 2009 following a leak of heavy water. The NRU reactor
      supplied approximately a third of the world's demand of 99Mo for 99Mo/99mTc generators used
      diagnostic nuclear medicine tests. Given the fragility of 99Mo supply, alternative
      radiopharmaceuticals, such as 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), are attractive options to
      replace 99mTc bone scans. Several studies suggest that 18F-NaF may be more accurate and more
      sensitive in the detection of bone metastases than 99mTc bone scans.

    <measure>Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF) Positron Emission Tomography compared to 99mTc-Methylene Diphosphonate (MDP) bone SPECT imaging for detection of bone metastasis.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 24 month post PET/CT follow-up physical examination.</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 18F-NaF imaging and 99mTc-MDP bone SPECT imaging for bone metastasis detection in patients with breast and prostate cancer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome is to monitor the short-term side-effects following 18F-NaF PET/CT to assess for adverse drug reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Short-term side effects will be monitored for 24 hours following the injection of 18F-NaF (investigational product), and 72 hours following administration of 99mTc-MDP (standard treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Given that 18F-NaF is the investigational agent in this study, the collection of adverse events will focus on identifying potential events related to the administration of this radiopharmaceutical. Adverse events will also be collected for bone scanning with 99mTc-medronate.</description>

          -  All subjects must have a WHO performance status 0-2.

          -  Subjects ≥ 18/19 years of age (depending on the age of majority in the province where
             the trial is conducted)
