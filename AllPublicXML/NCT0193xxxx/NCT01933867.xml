  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water-aided insertion of the colonoscope has been repeatedly proven to beneficial in terms of
      lower discomfort and need for sedation during colonoscopy. Patients with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) undergo repeated colonoscopy in course of their disease. According to our
      preliminary experience, water immersion could be beneficial while scoping these patients. As
      far as the investigators know, water-aided colonoscopy has never been studied in this
      indication. Results of our trial might support use of water-aided colonoscopy in common
      practice and decrease associated discomfort in IBD patients.
