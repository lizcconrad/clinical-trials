      RATIONALE: Everolimus plus Cisplatin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test how effective combing a Cisplatin chemotherapy
      with Everolimus is in treating subjects with residual triple negative breast cancer, who have
      already received chemotherapy prior to surgery.

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository;

               4. Total abstinence or;

               5. Male/female sterilization. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of
                  child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
                  amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                  vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to treatment. In the
                  case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                  child-bearing potential.

         14. Chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Topical or
             inhaled corticosteroids are allowed;
