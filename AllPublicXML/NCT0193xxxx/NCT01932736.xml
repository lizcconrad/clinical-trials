    <textblock>
      This study is looking at whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can see if and
      when the brain responds to pressure stimulations of the eardrum. The study requires 2 visits,
      1 for screening to determine eligibility and 1 for the fMRI. This study will help to
      understand how the middle ear system is controlled, which may have an impact on how people
      with middle ear disease are treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media is a ubiquitous disease in young children which can persist through adolescence,
      and arise or recur in adults. A consequence of an infection and/or Eustachian tube
      dysfunction, it manifests as an effusion that disrupts the normal impedance matching function
      of tympanic membrane-ossicular chain system. Eustachian tube dysfunction prevents the
      equilibration of middle ear pressures and drainage of the accumulated effusion. It is thought
      that middle ear status modulates the function of the Eustachian tube via afferent signals
      processed centrally resulting in changes in its tonus or muscular function. This pilot study
      of right-handed 21-35 year olds of either sex will validate a published fMRI method for
      visualizing cortical brain activation in response to external ear canal pressure changes
      (N=5). The outcome measure is intensity changes of the cortex associated with applied
      stimuli.
