  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial hyperresponsiveness consists in excessive response to bronchial stimuli.Bronchial
      challenge test is used to confirm/exclude asthma (metacholine or histamine).Protection are
      used to avoid passive exposure of the technicians performing the test, despite the absence of
      evidence that they could develop a bronchoconstriction even if they suffer from BHR.The
      purpose of the study is to determine if patients with a high level of bronchial
      hyperreactivity and exposed passively to histamine during a bronchial challenge, are
      developing a bronchoconstriction, when placed in the same conditions that the technicians
      performing these tests.

    <textblock>
      Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) consists in excessive response to bronchial
      stimuli.Bronchial challenge test is used to confirm/exclude asthma.BHR is also present in
      other diseases such as allergic rhinitis, Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease,heart
      failure..

      Thes test is performed with metacholine or histamine with spirometric documented response to
      incremental doses.Protection are used to avoid passive exposure of the technicians performing
      the test, despite the absence of evidence that they could develop a bronchoconstriction if
      they suffer from BHR.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if patients, newly diagnosed with a high level of
      bronchial hyperreactivity and exposed passively to histamine during a bronchial challenge,
      are reacting to histamine when placed in the same conditions that the technicians performing
      these tests.
