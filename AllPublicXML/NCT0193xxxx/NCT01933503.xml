  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, randomized, parallel design, single and multiple dose
      trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics(PK), safety and tolerability of obeticholic acid
      (OCA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (5
      mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg) in a treatment ratio of 1:1:1 and no less than a ratio of 1:1 for
      female: male subjects. The study comprises single dose and multiple dose phases. The
      randomized dose administered in the single dose phase will be the subject's dose level for
      the multiple dose phase. A single dose of OCA (5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg) will be administered on
      Day 1. PK, safety, and tolerability will then be assessed for 3 days. On Day 4, the multiple
      dose phase will begin at the same dose level (5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg), with subjects receiving
      OCA once daily for 14 days. PK, safety, and tolerability will be assessed for 2 weeks at the
      clinical site following the last investigational product (IP) dose on Day 17. Subjects will
      be confined at the inpatient trial site from Day 0 until the morning of Day 30. They will
      return to the study site on Day 37 for follow up.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects are required to meet the following criteria in order to be included in the trial.

          1. Males or females age 18 to 55 years

          2. Contraception: Oral contraceptives are not allowed to be used for 2 weeks prior to
             trial start, during the trial, and for 30 days after the last dose of OCA. Therefore,
             female subjects must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or if premenopausal, be
             prepared to use more than 1 effective (≤ 1% failure rate) method of contraception
             during the trial and until at least 30 days after the last dose of OCA. Effective
             methods of contraception for males and females are considered to be the following:

               1. Double barrier method, ie, (i) condom, with spermicide (male or female) or (ii)
                  diaphragm with spermicide

               2. Intrauterine device (IUD)

               3. Vasectomy (partner)

          3. Good general health as determined by medical history and by results of physical exam,
             vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests obtained within 14 days prior to IP
             administration

          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2; BMI is determined by the following
             equation: BMI = weight/height2 (kg/m2).

          5. Willing to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and xanthine containing food and beverages
             for 72 hours prior check in and during participation of the inpatient period of the
             trial

          6. Willing and able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the trial:

             its components

          3. History or presence of any disease or condition known to interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs including bile salt

          6. History of known or suspected clinically significant hypersensitivity to any drug,
             aside from penicillin

          7. Ingestion of a prescription medication, including oral contraceptives and bile acid
             sequestrants, within 14 days prior to IP dosing or ingestion of an over the counter
             medication within 7 days prior to IP dosing

          8. Participation in radiologic examinations involving parenteral administration of
