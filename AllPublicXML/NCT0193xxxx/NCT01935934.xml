    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib s-malate works in treating patients with
      endometrial cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic). Cabozantinib s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine efficacy of single agent cabozantinib s-malate (cabozantinib) in women
      previously receiving one line of chemotherapy for metastatic endometrial cancer or with
      progression within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy, with co-primary endpoints of
      objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and
      progression-free-survival at 12 weeks (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of clinical response with baseline molecular status of archival tumor
      (hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-met] amplification &amp; mutation status) and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks or every 6
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic endometrial
             cancer; eligible histologies for the experimental cohort are: endometrioid or serous;
             eligible histologies for the exploratory cohort are: carcinosarcoma, clear cell,
             mixed, adenosquamous and any other rare sub-type of endometrial cancer

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 10 mm with computed
             tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam
             and &gt;= 15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions; patients must have radiographic evidence
             of disease progression following the most recent line of treatment

          -  Prior therapy: Eligible subjects must have had 1 line of systemic cytotoxic treatment;
             this may be adjuvant therapy with documented progression within 12 months of
             completion, or 1 line of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease; NOTE: eligible
             patients are allowed up to 2 lines of systemic cytotoxic treatment, of which only 1
             line is allowed for metastatic disease; the acceptance of progression within 12 months
             of adjuvant is part inclusion to not require patient to re-challenge with chemotherapy
             (chemo) if they progressed soon after adjuvant therapy; prior hormonal therapy for
             metastatic/recurrent disease is also allowed; prior targeted therapy not directed
             against cMET or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways is allowed

             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal; postmenopausal is
             defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; note: women who have been amenorrheic
             for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the
             amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression

             study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become

             should inform her treating physician immediately; sexually active subjects must agree
             to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female
             condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study
             drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used; all subjects of reproductive
             potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control
