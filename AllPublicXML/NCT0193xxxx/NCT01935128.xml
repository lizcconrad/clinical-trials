  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether conversion to everolimus (Zortress®),
      allowing the elimination or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors, will reduce nephrotoxicity
      (measured by increased creatinine clearance) and lengthen overall graft (kidney transplant)
      survival (measured by 2-3 year graft survival).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether conversion to everolimus (Zortress®),
      allowing the elimination or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors, will reduce nephrotoxicity
      (measured by increased creatinine clearance) and lengthen overall graft (kidney transplant)
      survival (measured by 2-3 year graft survival). Among the worst of the long-term effects of
      chronic immunosuppression are the nephrotoxicity (toxic to kidney cells) of the calcineurin
      inhibitors and the myriad complications of steroids. This protocol evaluates the elimination
      or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors in a protocol that has already successfully eliminated
      the long-term use of steroids. A considerable need remains for safer therapeutic agents that
      inhibit T-cell activation (a white blood cell that attacks foreign cells as part of the
      immune response) via a calcineurin independent or reduced-dose mechanism of action.
