    <textblock>
      To assess the interchangeability and agreement between measurements from three blood gas
      syringes for the collection of blood for the analysis of multiple analytes as measured by
      differing manufacturers' multi-parameter analyzers.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, post-market study using fresh blood for analysis that is
      obtained from healthy subject volunteers. Trained phlebotomists will collect blood samples
      from subjects after confirmation of eligibility criteria. Blood samples will be drawn to fill
      all study syringe types in a randomized order. Each syringe type will be drawn per subject to
      analyze each of the available blood parameters in duplicate using three different
      multi-parameter analyzers. The analytes tested will vary per analyzer capabilities. All blood
      draws and analyte testing will be performed at an independent laboratory. The study is to
      confirm that all of the syringes tested provide consistent readings when analyzed using the
      most common multi-parameter analyzers used in hospital laboratories.

    <description>For each of the analytes that are tested, the analyte values from each of the three (3) syringe types tested will be compared for each of the three (3) multi-parameter analyzers. Average values for each analyte per patient, syringe and analyzer will be used for the comparison of syringes for each analyzer.</description>
