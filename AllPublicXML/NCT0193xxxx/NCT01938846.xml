  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of BI
      860585 alone and in combination with exemestane or paclitaxel. To determine the MTDs,
      patients are entered sequentially into escalating dose cohorts. Secondary objectives are
      objective response and disease control according to RECIST criteria version 1.1

             shown to be progressive;

          -  Patients who have received previous standard of care therapy for their disease and
             have progressed;

          -  18 years or older;

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months;

          -  Patients must have confirmed progressive disease within the last 6 months, (in case of
             measurable disease, progression should be confirmed according to Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria version 1.1;

          -  Patients carrying a tumour for whom treatment with either exemestane or paclitaxel
             would be considered appropriate by the investigator;

        Additional inclusion criteria for expansion part:

          -  Patients must have measurable progressive disease within the last 6 months
             documented/proven according to RECIST criteria version 1.1.

          -  Patients entering the expansion cohorts must also have:

             considered appropriate by the investigator.

          -  Arm C: any advanced/metastatic solid tumour for which treatment with paclitaxel would
             be considered appropriate by the investigator.

          -  Clinical Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Grade III-IV;

          -  Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to inclusion, or symptomatic
             coronary artery disease;

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function;

          -  Patients with known HIV/hepatitis/active infectious disease considered by the

          -  Patients unable to take oral medication;

          -  Chronic diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal disorders;

          -  Treatment with anti-cancer-therapies: cytotoxic or standard chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapies, molecular targeted or other
             investigational drugs, within four weeks of the first treatment with the study
             medication (or within one week for non-cytotoxic drugs);
