      This study is an 8-week open-label trial testing Lurasidone (Latuda®) as a treatment for
      mania in children and adolescents with Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Bipolar Spectrum disorders.
      We hypothesize that Lurasidone will be safe, tolerable, and effective in improving the core
      symptoms of bipolar disorders in children and adolescents ages 6-17.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 6-17 years of age

          2. Subjects must weigh at least 20 kg

          3. Subjects with the diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II, or bipolar spectrum disorder and

             features), by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV), as manifested in clinical
             evaluation and/or the Mania module of the structured interview, completed by the study
             clinician. Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar disorder) is
             operationalized as having severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV Criteria A for
             bipolar disorder but displays fewer elements in Criteria B (only require 2 items for
             elation category and 3 for irritability)

          4. Subjects must score ≥ 20 on the YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale)

          5. Subjects and their legal representative must have a level of understanding sufficient
             to communicate intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to
             cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the protocol.

          6. Subjects and their legal representative must be considered reliable reporters.

          7. Each subject and his/her authorized legal representative must understand the nature of
             the study. The subject's authorized legal representative must sign an informed consent
             document and the subject must sign an informed assent document (if ≥ 7 years old).

          8. Subject must be able to participate in mandatory blood draws.

          9. Subject must be able to swallow pills.

         10. Subjects with co-morbid PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) and depressive
             disorders will be allowed to participate in the study provided they do not meet any of
             the exclusionary criteria.

         11. For concomitant therapy used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder),
             subjects must have been on a stable dose of the medication for 1 month prior to study
             enrollment, and the dose of the ADHD therapy cannot change throughout the duration of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigator and his/her immediate family; defined as the investigator's spouse,
             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.

          2. Serious, unstable illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological, respiratory,
             cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic,
             immunologic, or hematologic disease.

          3. Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

          4. Non-febrile seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.

          5. DSM-IV substance (except nicotine or caffeine) dependence within past 6 months.

          6. Judged clinically to be at serious suicidal risk or have a C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale) score ≥ 4.

          7. Any other concomitant medication with primary central nervous system activity other
             than specified in the Concomitant Medication portion of the Protocol.

          8. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia.

          9. Mental retardation (IQ &lt; 75)

         10. Pregnant or nursing females

         11. Known hypersensitivity to Latuda®

         12. A non-responder or history of intolerance to Latuda®, after treatment at adequate
             doses as determined by the clinician.

         13. Severe allergies or multiple adverse drug reactions.
