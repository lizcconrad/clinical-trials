    <textblock>
      This study will compare two groups of subjects with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. It
      will compare their clinical outcomes and quality of life measures. The group being treated in
      this study will have their aneurysms repaired by an endovascular approach using Zenith®
      Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft. This group will be compared to a group of 461 patients
      (historical cohort) whose complex aneurysms were treated by open surgical repair.

    <description>The graft will be inserted through arteries in the leg (called endovascular repair). Endovascular repair is a procedure that uses catheters that go inside your blood vessel to place a stent graft above and below the aneurysm. This procedure lines the aneurysm with a new lining (stent) so blood does not fill the artery any more.</description>
