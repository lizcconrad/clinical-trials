    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 4-year study is to investigate the relationship between cognition and
      learning ability on patients with COPD during hospitalization to establish and evaluate the
      effects of the community-extended discharge planning program. The transition theory is used
      as the theoretical base in this study. The patients with diagnosis of COPD in hospital will
      be invited to participate. The data of demographic variables, the cognitive functionÂ¸ the
      respiratory function, the effect of learning and the usage of medical resources after
      discharged will be collected. In the first year, we will establish the protocol of
      respiratory teaching in two modes, and to compare the differences among computer interaction
      game intervention, face to face teaching and routine nursing intervention, also to evaluate
      the related factors and the effect of learning on patients with COPD for determining the
      needs of patients' learning mode and the optimal frequency of nursing teaching mode during
      hospitalization in the second year. For the second year, build upon the results of the first
      year, the preliminary draft of the community-extended discharge planning program that base on
      the experts' meeting and the interview with the patients. Also, a pilot study that revising
      the content and testing the feasibility of respiratory teaching protocol will be conducted.
      For the 3rd and 4th year, using case-control RCT design, the community-extended discharge
      planning program will be tested in patients during their hospital stay and post-discharge
      period. The effects of this community-extended discharge planning program will be evaluated
      on outcome variables of patients' cognitive learning function, utilization of health care
      resources. The results of this study will help to develop a community-extended discharge
      planning for patients with COPD on cognition level and learning ability. Furthermore, the
      protocol of the community-extended discharge planning will serve as references to prolong the
      development of disease deterioration, reduce the probability of readmission and improve the
      quality of life.

    <description>We held a professional commettee to draft a checklist(7 items) of breath retraining skill which comment to teach COPD patients. After retest and confirm the detail from pilot, we observated and rated patients breath retraing skill from none(0) to complete done(3). The higher points means the more correct skill that patients learned.</description>

    <description>PRAISAL questinnaire will be adopt after we consulted and get the author permission to use. Patients answered questionnaire(15 items) by their intuition. Rate point from 1 to 4 grades. The more confidence patient consider they have will rate more points. We propose patients learning the breath retraining skill well and correct during prepared discharge, they would get more confident.</description>
