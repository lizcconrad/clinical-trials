        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC,
             colon, or TNB cancer.

          2. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by CT scan (or PET/CT, if patient
             is allergic to CT contrast media).

          3. For NSCLC patients without EGFR or ALK abnormalities amenable to EGFR or ALK targeted
             therapy: patients must have received no more than at least 2 or 3 cycles of either
             first- or second-line systemic therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. For
             NSCLC patients with EGFR or ALK abnormalities amenable to receive EGFR or ALK targeted
             therapy: patients must have progressed on first-line EGFR or ALK targeted therapy and
             received no more than at least 2 or 3 cycles of either second- or third-line systemic
             therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease.

          4. For colon cancer patients: patients must have patients must have received no more than
             at least 2 or 3 cycles of either first- or second-line systemic therapy for the
             treatment of metastatic disease.

          5. For TNB cancer patients, patients must have patients must have received no more than
             at least 2 or 3 cycles of either first- or second-line systemic therapy for the
             treatment of metastatic disease.

          6. At the time of screening, all patients must have scans (within 28 days) showing stable
             disease by RECIST 1.1. Where applicable, measurable tumor marker (e.g. CA19-9, CEA, or
             CA125) collected within 14 days must be at least 10% less than baseline value on most
             recent systemic therapy (baseline value has to be abnormal elevated).

          7. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood
             counts at time of screening:

          8. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 9
             g/dL.

          9. Serum creatinine ≤2.0, total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of
             normal range

         10. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional normal limits. If TSH is above
             the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within institutional normal limits is
             acceptable.

         11. Persistent prior systemic therapy non-hematologic AE grade ≥2 (except alopecia or
             correctable electrolyte abnormality with supplementation)

         12. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70.

         13. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 30 days
             following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2.

          2. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          3. Patient has known brain metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled for
             at least 1 month (defined as clinically stable, no edema, no steroids and stable in 2
             scans at least 4 weeks apart).

          4. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment
             plan and follow-up requirements.

          5. Patient has known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C (patients are
             NOT required to be tested for the presence of such viruses prior to therapy on this
             protocol).

          6. Requiring daily corticosteroid dose ≥ 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.

          7. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (e.g., surgery done
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to
             Day 1 of treatment in this study.

          8. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any
             of their excipients, or the patient exhibits any of the events outlined in the
             Contraindication or Special Warnings and Precautions sections of the product or
             comparator SmPC or Prescribing Information.

          9. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or
             serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the patient's safety or the
             study data integrity.

         10. Patient will be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy during participation in this
             trial.
