      The Purpose of this study is to evaluate in a randomized, double-blind, Parallel,
      Non-inferiority, Multicenter, the efficacy and safety of UNCNT in comparison to the active
      comparator of MELSMON in female having menopausal syndrome. Patients will be allocated
      randomly to receive either UNCNT or MELSMON.

      Through the injection of UNCNT to female having menopausal disorder, efficacy in the
      improvement of the menopausal symptoms by Kupperman index is to be evaluated and compared
      with MELSMON.
