      The investigators evaluate the effectiveness of the application of continuous passive motion
      device for hand rehabilitation in two classes of patients: with a residual active motion and
      without a residual active motion.

      We will conduct a double blind clinical trial. A sample size calculation were performed to
      determine the necessary number of subjects needed for this study and was based upon the
      results of a previous pilot study. All patients had functional impairments of their upper
      extremities after the stroke.

      We hypothesized that the hand-rehabilitation oriented with robotics assistance, would improve
      edema by paralysis of the upper limb even in patient without sensory pathway recovery.
