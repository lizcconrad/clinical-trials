  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess and evaluate the safety of octaplas™ in comparison to standard plasma product
      (e.g., fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and other approved plasma products used within 24 hours of
      thawing) used in the treatment of TTP, in patients undergoing Therapeutic Plasma Exchange,
      with a special emphasis on the occurrence of thromboembolic events (TEEs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is a male or female at least 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patient has a diagnosis of TTP or suspicion of TTP that is planned on being treated
             with TPE within 3 days of study entry.

          3. Patient has thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100 x 10P9P/L).

          4. Patient is willing to give voluntary written informed consent before any study-related
             procedure is to be performed that is not part of standard medical care, with the
             understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without
             prejudice to future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to plasma-derived products
             or to FFP.

          2. Patient has an already known IgA deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA.

          3. Patient is currently participating in an interventional clinical study or has
             participated during the past 1 month prior to study inclusion.

          4. Patient has severe deficiencies of Protein S.

          5. Patient received more than 1 treatment of plasma exchange or plasma infusion for
             current episode of TTP prior to randomization.

          6. Patient is currently taking ACE-inhibitors; in case patient is under ACE-inhibitor
             treatment a wash-out period of at least 24 hours has to elapse prior the first plasma
             infusion.
