      The investigators will compare myocard vitality diagnostics using 2D-Strain echography and
      MRI.

      Each patient with typical angina pectoris symptoms will get echocardiographic examination
      during the inclusion phase. If motion disorder of regional left ventricular myocardial wall
      is detected, patient will get coronary angiography (not study related, caused of typical
      angina pectoris symptoms and high probability of CHD). If coronary stenosis related to motion
      disorder is available, patient will be randomized in two groups during coronary angiography.

        -  First Group: Patient will get echocardiographic examination during coronary angiography.
           2D-Strain Analysis will be performed based on data of this echocardiographic
           examination. Only when vitality in the contraction impaired segments will be established
           based on 2D-Strain Analysis, PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) will be performed.

        -  Second Group: Coronary angiography by patient will be canceled. Patients will get
           viability assessment using MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging) within the next 7 days. When
           vitality will be established with MRI, patient will get PCI (Percutaneous Coronary
           Intervention).

      In addition, as part of a feasibility analysis, the possibility of a consolidation of data of
      coronary angiography with the ultrasound images will be researched by first group of
      patients. The aim is to simplify the visualization of the intraprocedural vitality detection.
      For this purpose, a position sensor based on electromagnetic fields (EMT) will be used during
      coronary angiography.
