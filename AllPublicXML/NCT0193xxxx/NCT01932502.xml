  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the clinical safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      clobazam (Onfi) when it replaces the pre-existing clonazepam therapy in patients with
      refractory epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to answer frequently asked questions when clinicians replace existing
      1,4-benzodiazepine to Onfi, as follows:

        1. What should be the optimal equivalent doses for conversion?

        2. How quickly should it be converted?

        3. Would there be significant improvement of seizure control?

        4. Should we expect difference in tolerability? If so, what are common adverse events?

        5. Would the tolerance to the therapeutic effect differ with Onfi after conversion?

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>clobazam (Onfi)</intervention_name>
    <description>Subject's clonazepam will be converted to the following Onfi doses per day:
Clonazepam 0.5mg converted to Onfi 10mg first week, then titrated up to 40mg per day.
Clonazepam 1.0-2.0mg converted to Onfi 20mg first week, then titrated up to 40mg per day.
Clonazepam 2-4mg converted to Onfi 20mg first week, then titrated up to 60mg per day.
Initial conversion will occur over two weeks followed by upward titration of up to 10mg increment per week toward the target dose. Down titration of up to 10mg will be allowed during the study.
The following will be the initial conversion schedule from clonazepam to Onfi:
Week 1: 50% reduction of clonazepam and starting dose of Onfi, replacing the reduced clonazepam dose with the conversion rate of clonazepam 0.5mg = Onfi 10mg.
Week 2: Discontinuing clonazepam and increasing the dosage of Onfi by two-fold. Week 3+: Titrate the dose of Onfi up to 40mg per day as tolerated</description>
