    <textblock>
      A study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Direct Flow Medical aortic valve
      system. This is for people with severe aortic stenosis who are not well enough to undergo a
      surgical repair. The delivery of this device is done via the femoral artery.

      The Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System is indicated for symptomatic
      patients who require replacement of their native aortic valve and have a predicted operative
      mortality or serious morbidity risk of equal or greater 50% at 30 days with surgical aortic
      valve replacement or are deemed unsuitable for surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis determined by resting
             or dobutamine stress echocardiogram and Doppler, or simultaneous pressure recordings
             at cardiac catheterization defined as: mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg or peak jet velocity
             &gt;4.0 m/s and an aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 or aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2.

          2. The patient has moderate to severe symptoms from aortic valve stenosis (NYHA
             Functional Class ≥III).

          3. The patient must have a predicted risk of operative mortality or serious irreversible
             morbidity of &gt;50% at 30 days, or be deemed not suitable for surgery for other reasons.
             This conclusion shall be based on consensus of one cardiologist and two cardiac
             surgeons at the investigational site after careful consideration of the patient's STS
             risk score and co-morbidities, and after at least one of the surgeons participating in
             the decision has personally examined the patient.

          4. The patient been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, is
             willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluations and has provided
             written informed consent, approved by the appropriate IRB.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;20% determined by resting echocardiogram

          2. Patients with an acute MI within 30 days preceding the index procedure.

          5. Patients with a platelet count of &lt;50,000 cells/mm³ or a WBC &lt; 1000 cells/mm³ within 7
             days prior to index procedure.

          6. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom
             anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, or who will refuse
             transfusion.

          7. Patients who have received any organ transplant or are on a waiting list for any organ
             transplant.

          8. Patients with known other medical illness (e.g. carcinomas, chronic liver disease,
             chronic renal disease or chronic end stage pulmonary disease) or known history of
             substance abuse that may cause non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation or is associated with a life expectancy of less than one year, or
             expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of aortic stenosis.

         12. Patients presenting with hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock defined by low
             cardiac output, vasopressor dependence, or mechanical hemodynamic support.

         13. Patients who have a planned treatment with any other investigational device or
             procedure during the study period, or who are currently participating in an

             trial/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility, or
             will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with
             follow-up visits)

         19. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve determined by echocardiography

         20. Prior aortic or mitral valve surgery or pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in any
