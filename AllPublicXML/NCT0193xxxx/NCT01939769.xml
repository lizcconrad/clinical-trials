  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Research has shown that one exercise session may improve a person s ability to recall
      information they learned before the exercise. Knowing how exercise changes brain activity to
      improve memory can help researchers understand how memory works and how to improve it in
      people with memory problems. This study compares two kinds of exercise on a stationary bike
      for their ability to temporarily improve memory on certain tests. Researchers will look at
      the effect of exercise on body chemistry by drawing blood and collecting saliva.

      Objectives:

      - To understand how a single session of exercise affects memory testing in healthy people and
      people who have had traumatic brain injury (TBI).

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults ages 18 through 45 with TBI.

        -  Healthy adult volunteers, ages 18 through 45.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. This will take
           about 1 hour.

        -  Participants with TBI will also be screened with a test of their memory. This will take
           another hour.

        -  Visit 1 will take about 3 hours. Participants will:

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Have a tube inserted in their arm for drawing blood during the tests.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Take memory tests. They will look at pictures, symbols, and words, then answer
      questions.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Give a saliva sample by chewing on a small sponge for 2 minutes.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Exercise on a stationary bike.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Take the memory tests again.

      - Visit 2 will take place 1 week later. Participants will take the memory tests only.

      Objective: The goals of this study are to 1. replicate the finding that exercise after
      exposure to images enhances their subsequent recall, 2. extend the question to words and
      logical rules, 3. examine the mechanism of the effect using exercise biomarkers and fMRI and
      4. explore its usefulness as an aid to memory in individuals with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI).

      Study population: Healthy adult volunteers and individuals with TBI.

      Design: The main, clinical, experiment has a parallel, repeated-measures design, where four
      groups (two each of healthy subjects and participants with TBI) will encode pictures, words
      and rules and then exercise at either a high or very low (placebo) intensity. Recall will be
      tested one hour and again at seven days after exercise. Blood and saliva will be collected
      before and immediately after exercise and assayed for biomarkers of exercise, thought to be
      possible mediators of the memory effect. In a parallel-design fMRI experiment, intended to
      explore the brain basis of the effect of exercise on memory, healthy volunteers will view
      pictures, exercise at a high or low intensity, and then perform a recall task in the scanner.
      The analysis will look for differences in location and extent of evoked brain activations
      evoked by picture recall after low and high intensity exercise.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is recall of visual material one hour after
      exercise. Secondary measures will be the recall of word lists and letter/digit symbol
      matching (logical memory) and activations on fMRI. The blood and saliva biomarkers will are
      included as exploratory outcomes.
