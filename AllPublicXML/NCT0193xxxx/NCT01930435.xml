  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study of the use of a personalized sterile humidification device for 12
      weeks for head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy to determine if the
      usage of this humidification system will result in a decrease in severity in head and neck
      related quality of life as measured by the MDASI HN subscale following radiation therapy as
      compared with historical experience. In addition, we are exploring correlative measures using
      CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha level measurements as these are directly related to mucositis
      and presumably related to quality of life as indicated by the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients complete MDASI at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The MDASI is a validated
      instrument that measures symptom burden and we measure a subscale (HN) as our primary
      endpoint. The patients are asked to use a personal humidifier daily and complete a weekly
      diary showing compliance with the humidifier use.

    <time_frame>Mean value of [(MDASI-HN score at 6 weeks) - (MDASI-HN score at baseline)]</time_frame>
    <description>The MDASI-HN assesses the severity of symptoms at their worst in the last 24 hours on a 0-10 NRS, with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; There are 28 items in the MDASI-HN. There are 13 general inventory items, 6 general interference items, and the HN subscale adds 9 additional items assessing mucus in the mouth and throat, difficulty swallowing/chewing, choking/coughing, difficulty with voice/speech, skin pain/burning/rash, constipation, problems with tasting food, mouth/throat sores, and problems with teeth or gums. Scores for the subscales (general, interference, HN) are averaged so that a score is obtained from 0-10 for each subscale. The mean change in quality of life is calculated as the average scores at 6 weeks minus the average of the scores at baseline. Therefore a positive value represents a worsened quality of life and a negative value is an improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Quality of Life as Measured by the Subscale MDASI-HN Score.</title>
        <description>The MDASI-HN assesses the severity of symptoms at their worst in the last 24 hours on a 0–10 NRS, with 0 being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you can imagine.” There are 28 items in the MDASI-HN. There are 13 general inventory items, 6 general interference items, and the HN subscale adds 9 additional items assessing mucus in the mouth and throat, difficulty swallowing/chewing, choking/coughing, difficulty with voice/speech, skin pain/burning/rash, constipation, problems with tasting food, mouth/throat sores, and problems with teeth or gums. Scores for the subscales (general, interference, HN) are averaged so that a score is obtained from 0-10 for each subscale. The mean change in quality of life is calculated as the average scores at 6 weeks minus the average of the scores at baseline. Therefore a positive value represents a worsened quality of life and a negative value is an improvement in quality of life.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving Compliance With Use of Personalized Sterile Humidification.</title>
          <description>Compliance was pre-specified in the protocol as self-reported usage of the device at a level equal to or greater than 60% of the formal recommended usage. This cut-off at 60% represented the median of the distribution of the usage of the device among all patients. The outcome measure is the percentage of participants who reported using the device at a level equal to or greater than 60% of the total prescribed usage.</description>
