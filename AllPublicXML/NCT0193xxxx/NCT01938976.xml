      Study Hypotheses:

        1. adolescents in intervention schools who are given Triple A program plus ASP will show
           more awareness in regards to cigarettee smoking health effects and less nicotine
           dependencethan those in the control schools who are given Triple A alone.

        2. adolescents with asthma in intervention schools who are given Triple A program plus ASP
           will show less asthma symptoms and better control than those in the control schools who
           are given Triple A alone.

        3. adolescent smokers and passive smokers will exhibit higher levels of carbon monoxide
           (CO) in their breath than those who are not active or passive smokers.

        4. there is a positive correlation between self-report questions regarding student smoking
           status and levels of CO in their breath
