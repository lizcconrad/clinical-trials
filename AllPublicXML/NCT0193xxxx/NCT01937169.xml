  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurons in the brain require blood and oxygen for proper function. The term &quot;neurovascular
      coupling&quot; has been postulated in the 19th century by Roy &amp; Sherrington referring to increased
      blood flow to active neurons. The rationale of this research relies on the neurovascular
      coupling, suggesting that increased blood flow to active regions on the brain should supply
      not only more blood, but also more of a pharmacological agent present in the blood system at
      the time. Thus, active regions should be affected by the agent (=drug) to a greater extent.

      In the present study we focus on the dopaminergic system, critical in many functions such as
      cognition, response to stimuli and movement. One of the well-known dopaminergic pathways in
      the brain is the nigrostriatal pathway, mediating motor function. In this research, we intend
      to examine the effects of coupling functional activation in this pathway with a dopaminergic
      agent, Carbidopa/Levodopa, on symptoms of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). RLS is characterized
      by an irresistible urge to move the limbs (i.e. Akathisia), and results most prominently by a
      significant decrease in the quality of sleep. Our research focuses on this symptom of RLS to
      examine the effect of coupling brain activation and drug treatment.

      The first line of treatment in RLS is dopaminergic drugs. These drugs increase dopamine
      levels in motor pathways, and our research will aim to couple activation in the nigrostriatal
      motor pathway with dopaminergic treatment in RLS. Functional activation will be achieved with
      a simple motor task, known to elicit activation in the nigrostriatal pathway. We hypothesize
      that the drug will act upon the pre-activated motor system, and that this coupling between
      brain activation and drug treatment will ameliorate sleep-related symptoms of RLS, compared
      with treating these symptoms solely with a dopaminergic drug and compared with using a
      non-motor task.

    <description>Each participant will undergo physical examination by an doctor. Then, the participant will receive the Fitbit device with instructions for proper use. The next stages will take place at the participant's home environment.
Each participant will monitor motor activity in hours prior to sleep and at night for assessing baseline activity level. After 3 nights of monitoring, each participant will be administered with a quarter of a Dopicar pill (4th night) and half a Dopical pill (5th night), measuring different dose effect on motor activity during sleep.This group will be administered with a quarter of a Dopicar pill, 1 hour prior to sleep. After 15 minutes, participants in this group will perform a motor task (e.g., walking) for 30 minutes.</description>
