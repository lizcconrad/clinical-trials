  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterocolitis(EC) is the most common and serious postoperative complication of Hirschsprung's
      disease(HD) with high morbidity and mortality. Probiotics are live microbes that, when
      administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefit to the host.Based on this previous
      knowledge on the beneficial effects of probiotics during pro-inflammatory conditions of the
      gastrointestinal tract, investigators hypothesized that oral probiotics could decrease the
      incidence and severity of Hirschsprung's disease associated enterocolitis(HAEC).Investigators
      conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized and controlled trial to assess whether oral
      probiotics could decrease the incidence and severity of Hirschsprung's disease associated
      enterocolitis(HAEC).
