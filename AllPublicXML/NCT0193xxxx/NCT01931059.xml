      To detect functional correlation changes in the brain with anti-psychotic drug administration
      as compared to placebo, and b.) to measure if these changes correlate with the plasma level
      of anti-psychotic, and c.) to evaluate if these changes correlate with drug induced symptoms

    <measure>Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>The change of RBANS scores between placebo and treatment conditions on two consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>This will measure the subject's cognitive performance. RBANS is a well-characterized repeatable battery to measure a wide array of cognitive performance in different cognitive domains. We will use Total Score in RBANS: five index scores are computed from the RBANS (immediate memory, language, visuospatial, attention, delayed memory) that are combined to provide the Total Score. The Total Score is expressed as a standardized score normalized to a population mean of 100, with a standard deviation of 15 (possible scores 40-135). Higher scores reflect better performance. More detailed information is available: Randolph C, Tierney MC, Mohr E, Chase TN (June 1998). &quot;The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS): preliminary clinical validity&quot;. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 20 (3): 310-9. doi:10.1076/jcen.20.3.310.823. PMID 9845158.
Here we calculated the difference of T-scaled total RBANS score between risperidone day and placebo day in all participants</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 times on risperidone day and on placebo day</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures are the scores from side effect scales (Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects. It will measured in synchrony with Repeated Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status to explore if any of these measures would correlate with network changes in the brain. The Simpson-Angus scale is 0 if there is no extrapyramidal side effects, and is higher the worst the symptoms are.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback-based Probabilistic Classification Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Before every MRI except the 2nd and 4th which will occur during the MRI (5 times - 3 consecutive days)</time_frame>
    <description>On each trial, participants will view one of four images and will be asked to guess whether it belongs to Category A or B. For each participant, the four images will be randomly assigned to be stimuli S1, S2, S3 and S4 (these are abstract visual stimuli denoted with numbers (stiumulus 1, stimulus 2, etc). A different set of similar images (S5-S8; S9-S12, etc) will be used for repeated testing. On any given trial, stimuli S1 and S3 will belong to Category A with 90% probability and to Category B with 10% probability, while stimuli S2 and S4 will belong to Category B with 90% probability and to Category A with 10% probability. Stimuli S1 and S2 will be used in the reward-learning task and S3 and S4 in punishment-learning task. Two stimuli per valence will be employed in order to balance category outcome frequencies, so that one stimulus in each task will be associated with each outcome.</description>

        <title>Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status</title>
        <description>This will measure the subject's cognitive performance. RBANS is a well-characterized repeatable battery to measure a wide array of cognitive performance in different cognitive domains. We will use Total Score in RBANS: five index scores are computed from the RBANS (immediate memory, language, visuospatial, attention, delayed memory) that are combined to provide the Total Score. The Total Score is expressed as a standardized score normalized to a population mean of 100, with a standard deviation of 15 (possible scores 40-135). Higher scores reflect better performance. More detailed information is available: Randolph C, Tierney MC, Mohr E, Chase TN (June 1998). &quot;The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS): preliminary clinical validity&quot;. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 20 (3): 310–9. doi:10.1076/jcen.20.3.310.823. PMID 9845158.
