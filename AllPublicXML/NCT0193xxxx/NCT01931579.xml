  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solitary pulmonary nodule has become a major challenge in respiratory clinical practice.
      According to published guidelines, their management often requires close CT follow up, PET CT
      and invasive procedures to obtain a definite histology. In this context, innovative
      endoscopic techniques refered as navigational bronchoscopy have proved to be efficient, for
      the localization and sampling of peripheral lung nodules. However, these techniques are
      unable to differentiate malignant lesions from benign ones, in-vivo, in real time. Confocal
      endo-microscopy (CELLVIZIO) of the distal lung - also refered as distal lung probe based
      confocal laser endo-microscopy or alveolar lung endo-microscopy - allows in-vivo imaging of
      the distal lung structures in real time.

      This prospective trial we will assess confocal endoscopy as a tool to localize the peripheral
      lung nodules and to differentiate benign from tumoral lesions.

      Objective(s)

        1. To demonstrate that confocal endo-microscopy is not inferior to navigational endoscopy
           for the localisation of peripheral lung nodule

        2. To demonstrate that confocal endoscopy can differentiate benign from malignant tumors

      Experimental design:

      Multicentric prospective controlled trial, conducted in three academic centers, specialized
      in interventional bronchoscopy, equipped with both navigational bronchoscopy and probe based
      confocal endo-microscopy.

      Subjects with peripheral lung nodule requiring navigational bronchoscopy will be explored
      using both Confocal endoscopy AND navigational bronchoscopy. Confocal probe will be inserted
      in the same catheter as used for the navigational bronchoscopy and confocal images will be
      recorded before sampling. An ancillary study using topical methylene blue as in situ will be
      conducted at the Rouen University Center.

      An ancillary protocol includes the use of in situ methylene blue deposition and 660 confocal
      endo-microscopy analysis.

      Main assessment criteria:

        1. number of lesions localized by confocal endoscopy compared to navigational bronchoscopy

        2. Positive and negative predictive values of confocal signs before and after IV
           fluorophore injection for the diagnosis of cancer.

      In this this study, positive diagnostic criteria for the localization of peripheral nodule
      using confocal imaging is a solid pattern as opposed to the usual loose fibered network
      pattern of the normal alveolar duct. According to this criteria, the confocal imaging
      procedure will be considered as valid if the number of lesions localized by confocal is not
      inferior to 90 % of those localized by navigational bronchoscopy. Therefore, probe based
      confocal laser endo-microscopy will prove valid if it can recognize at least 70 subjects out
      of the 78 / 120 subjects for which the navigational bronchoscopy is forecasted to localize
      the peripheral lesion (Cohen concordance Kappa value of 0,74 between confocal and
      navigational bronchoscopy).

      A secondary objective will be to describe specific signs of cancer using confocal endoscopy .
      This will be assessed on the first 30 patients using confocal imaging obtained before and
      after fluorophore IV injection, in comparison to histology, and confirmed on the following 48
      patients.

    <description>The intervention consists of the use of confocal endo-microscopy using the CELLVIZIO device and either the 1 mm CELLVIZIO miniprobe (ALVEOFLEX) or the 0.6 mm CELLVIZIO miniprobe (CHOLANGIOFLEX), during a navigational bronchoscopy procedure for the diagnostic of peripheral nodule. In this study, the navigational device - either radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or electromagnetic navigation (EMN) - will be moved to another location if the CELLVIZIO displays a non solid pattern, indicating that the nodule may not have been reached during the procedure. Three attempts of EBUS or EMN are allowed until the CELLVIZIO shows a solid pattern.</description>
