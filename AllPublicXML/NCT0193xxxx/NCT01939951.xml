    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out if AES ( Activation Energy Serum) , a blend of natural minerals ,
      is effective and safe for the treatment of asthma if taken for 4 weeks . The efficacy will be
      scientifically tested by symptoms scores, questionnaires, breathing and blood tests.

      The primary objective of this study will be to compare the overall efficacy and safety of AES
      ( Activation Energy Serum) by demonstrating a clinically significant improvement in morning
      FEV1 in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma treated with 2 doses of AES for 4
      weeks compared to placebo.

      The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the effect of AES on a) clinical symptoms by
      symptom scores and the Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ) , b) fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide ( FeNO) , c) blood eosinophil count and other biomarkers , and d) quality of life
      through the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ) .

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study should fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed

          2. Males and females of any race who are between 18 and 65 years old at the time informed
             consent is obtained.

          3. Physician diagnosis of asthma, as per NIH ( National Institutes of Health) guidelines,
             for at least 3 months.

          4. Patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second) value
             of 40% to 90% of individual predicted value at screening and at randomization, and the
             value at the randomization should be within 15% of the screening FEV1. The results of
             spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS ( American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory
             Society) criteria for acceptability and repeatability.

        6. Patients who are demonstrated to have reversible airway obstruction or airways hyper-
        reactivity or have shown either of such responses in previous test(s) within the last year.

        • Reversible airway obstruction is defined as an increase of ≥12% and ≥200 ml in FEV1 over
        the patient's pre-bronchodilator value in litres within 10-15 minutes after inhaling a
        total of 360 µg of albuterol or 400 µg salbutamol via MDI (metered dose inhaler)
        (reversibility test). The administration of albuterol or salbutamol for the reversibility
        test is to be within 30 minutes after pre-bronchodilator spirometry.

        7. An ACQ ( Asthma Control Questionnaire) score ≥ 1.5 at randomization. 8. Total daily
        asthma symptom score of &gt; 4 on 3 out of 7 days between the Screening and Randomization
        Visit.

        9. A fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level of &gt; 25 ppb 9. Blood eosinophil count of
        &gt; 200 /mm3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5
             half- lives of enrollment, whichever is longer.

          2. History of hypersensitivity to any AES products.

          3. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.

          4. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU( milli
             international unit)/mL).

        6. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
        becoming pregnant, must use effective contraception during the study and for 4 days (5
        half-lives) after treatment. Effective contraception is defined as either:

          -  Barrier method: c) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
             suppository. Spermicides alone are not a barrier method of contraception and should
             not be used alone. The following methods are considered more effective than the
             barrier method and are also acceptable:

          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

          -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male partner sterilization. [For female study subjects, the vasectomised male partner
             should be the sole partner for that patient]

          -  Use of established, oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 7. Patients with serious
             co-morbidities including uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c ≥8%), heart failure, cancer,
             neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, other
             lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or
             emphysema or other conditions characterised by eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms
             (i.e. Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic
             pneumonia, etc.).

             8. Acute illness other than asthma at the start of the study. 9. History of
             life-threatening asthma, including a history of significant hypercarbia (pCO2&gt;45mmHg),
             prior intubation, respiratory arrest, or seizures as a result of asthma.

             10. History of alcohol or other substance abuse. 11. Patients who have had a
             respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks of the screening visit. Patients who
             develop a respiratory tract infection between screening and the randomization visit
             must be screen failed, and may be permitted to re-enroll at a later date.

             12. Patients who have been hospitalized due to their asthma, or that have required
             treatment with systemic steroids, within 6 weeks of the screening visit.

             13. Patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (not associated with
             the study indication) at screening .

             14. Current smokers or ex-smokers who stopped smoking within 6 months prior to
             screening or have a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack years.

             15. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 17 or &gt; 40 kg/m2. 16. Patients receiving
             or likely to require treatment during the study with any prohibited asthma related
             medications of the classes or groups listed in Table 5-3.

             17. Patients on maintenance immunotherapy who either began their immunotherapy regimen
             or had a clinically relevant change to their immunotherapy within 1 month prior to
             granting informed consent. Patients on stable maintenance immunotherapy for at least
             one month prior to Visit 1 can be enrolled.

             19. Patients who have been previously randomized into this study. 20. Who are unable
             to perform spirometry ,peak flow measurements, fractional exhaled nitric oxide ,
             complete a patient diary or complete questionnaires as required by the protocol.

             21. With any medical or mental condition that, in the investigators opinion, renders
             the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the
             study.

             22. Who are unable/unwilling to take 7 drops twice per day, who are unable to use an
             inhaler or who are unlikely to comply with the protocol.

             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational
             product or interpretation of study results.
