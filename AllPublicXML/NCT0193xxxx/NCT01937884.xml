    <textblock>
      Optimal delivery of nutritional support during critical illness is central to appropriate
      intensive care unit management, and yet fundamental gaps in knowledge exist regarding timing,
      route, dose, and type of nutritional support for critically ill infants and children.
      Understanding how to optimize nutritional support during pediatric critical illness is
      important because even brief periods of malnutrition in infancy result in permanent negative
      effects on long-term neurocognitive development. Optimized nutrition support is a way to
      improve morbidity for survivors of pediatric critical illness. Parenteral nutrition (PN)
      supplementation could improve long-term neurocognitive outcome for pediatric critical illness
      by preventing acute malnutrition, but has unknown effects on intestinal barrier function; a
      proposed mechanism for late sepsis and infectious complications during critical illness.

      While randomized controlled trials (RCT) support early PN in premature infants and late PN in
      critically ill adults, the optimal time to begin PN is unknown for critically ill infants and
      children. Acute malnutrition may develop within 48 hours of admission in critically ill
      infants and children, and repleted energy stores are predictive of survival. And yet, due to
      concerns for PN-associated infectious morbidity, current PICU standard of care is to
      supplement with PN only in children who fail to enterally feed, as late as 7 days into their
      admission. Delays in nutrition may have long-term effects on cognitive outcome in older
      infants and children. In premature infants, PN begun within hours of birth results in
      improved 18-month neurocognitive outcome without an increase in infectious complications. An
      RCT is needed to determine if early PN in critically ill infants and children prevents acute
      malnutrition and improves short and long-term outcomes of PICU hospitalization.

      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that optimized early protein and calorie delivery
      will improve nutritional outcomes and intestinal barrier function for critically ill infants
      and children. The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      early PN as a supplement to enteral nutrition to improve nutritional delivery, nutritional
      outcomes, and intestinal barrier function for infants and children with acute respiratory
      failure who are mechanically ventilated in the pediatric intensive care unit.
