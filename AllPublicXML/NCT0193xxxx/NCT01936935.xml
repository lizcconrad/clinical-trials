    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effects of dairy product consumption on insulin
      sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell function in men and women at risk for the development of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who habitually consume beverages high in sugar (non-diet
      sodas and fruit juice cocktails).
