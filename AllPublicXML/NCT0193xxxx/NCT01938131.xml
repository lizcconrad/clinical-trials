  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rehabilitation protocols in knee osteoarthritis are often difficult to be applied in
      elderly patients because they are long lasting and need the constant participation of
      patients. To rapidly improve the motor performances of patients it is possible to use the
      mechanical vibration applied to individual muscles using a protocol called &quot;repeated muscle
      vibration&quot; (rMV). The purpose of this single-blind randomized placebo-controlled study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the repeated muscle vibration (rMV) in terms of increasing the
      ability of the patients affected by knee osteoarthritis, compared to an ineffective
      treatment, considered as a placebo. Each subject, randomly assigned to either the group 1
      (study group) or placebo-treatment (group 2)is administered 3 daily applications of rMV of 10
      minutes each, for 3 consecutive days. Between two successive applications it's observed a
      break of at least 15 seconds. The probe of the specific instrument (Cro 速 System) is placed
      near the supero-medial margin of the patella, on both quadriceps. Patients in group 2
      (control group) are subjected to a treatment with muscle released in which the probe of the
      same instrument is approached to the quadriceps, without making contact. The instrument in
      these conditions emits a buzz but not provokes muscle vibration. The primary outcome of the
      study is to determine the changing in patients' ability (as measured by WOMAC scale = Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) . The secondary outcomes of the study
      are the assessment of changing of patients' balance and risk of falling (as measured by the
      Tinetti scale) and assessment of changing of patients' quality of life (as measured by
      EQ-VAS= EuroQuality of Life-VAS scale).Outcome measures are administered at baseline (T0), at
      the end of the treatment protocol (T1), at 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) after the end of
      treatment and 6 months (T4) after the end of the treatment.
