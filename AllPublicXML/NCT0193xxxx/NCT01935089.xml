  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test our primary hypothesis that treatment with Peg-IFN-α-2b will result in a
      decrease in integrated HIV DNA in peripheral blood and tissue in chronically HIV-infected
      immune-reconstituted individuals (see section 3.1) in a prospective, interventional, 1-arm,
      open label clinical trial. To this end, we propose to enroll 25 HIV-1-infected subjects
      (please refer to power calculations in section 10.1 below) currently stably suppressed (&gt; 1y
      with VL &lt; 50 copies/ml) on ART and with CD4 count &gt; 450 cells/µl.

      We hypothesize that 20 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alpha-2b, in the presence of HIV
      reactivation (i.e.: ART interruption), will result in activation of intrinsic and/or
      immune-mediated anti-HIV mechanisms resulting in a decrease in the levels of viral reservoir
      in chronically HIV-infected, immune-reconstituted individuals.
