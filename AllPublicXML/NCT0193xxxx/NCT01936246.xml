  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, few studies have been done regarding nutrition supplementation in infants with brain
      injury. Therefore, the investigators are proposing to study the effects of protein
      supplementation in this group of babies. The investigators will recruit 24 infants with brain
      injury (evidence of hemorrhage, white matter injury, or gray matter injury) admitted to the
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) into the study. Upon
      diagnosis, the investigators will obtain consent from the parents for participation in the
      study, then randomly assign the baby to one of two groups - an increased protein group and a
      control group. Both groups of infants will be monitored to ensure no adverse effects occur
      due to the supplementation.

      Protein supplementation will continue for the first 12 months of age. Growth parameters, such
      as weight, length, and head circumference, will be measured while the infant is the NICU.
      Head circumference will be measured in the investigators outpatient clinic at three, six, and
      12 months of age. At 18-22 months, the infants will be tested for neurodevelopmental outcomes
      using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The investigators hypothesize that infants who
      receive the additional protein will demonstrate increased head growth and improved
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.
