      Background: Patients with indwelling urinary catheter for chronic retention due to
      obstructive BPH refractory to medical therapy are candidates for prostatectomy still
      considered as the gold standard of treatment. Urinary tract infection, strictures,
      postoperative pain, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, anesthesiologist risk and blood loss
      are complications associated with surgery. Minimally invasive treatments were originally
      conceived as an attempt to offer equivalent efficacy without the burden and risk of operative
      morbidity. Recently, it was suggested that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) to treat BPH
      might follow uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas. Animal studies in pigs and
      dogs have shown that PAE is safe and can induce prostatic volume reduction. The first report
      of this technique in the management of BPH in humans was by DeMeritt et al, who reported a
      single case of BPH with obstructive symptoms and blood loss refractory to other treatments
      that was successfully managed by PAE with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles.

      Objective : We investigate whether PAE might be a feasible procedure as an alternative
      treatment option to treat urinary retention due to obstructive BPH. The primary objective is
      to evaluate the success rate of procedure defined when selective prostatic arterial
      catheterization and embolization were achieve and patients can be able to urinate after their
      urinary catheter has been removed.

      Patients and methods : A monocentric prospective study is undertaken in 25 patients aged
      50-85 years who present with indwelling urinary catheter due to obstructive BPH refractory to
      medical treatment with a clinical indication for surgery who agreed to undergo PAE. The study
      is approved by the hospital ethical committee and an informed consent form for PAE as an
      alternative treatment is signed by all participants.

      Statistical analysis : The sample size has been calculated in order to have an estimated
      probability of success (corresponding of primary objective) of 50% (worst case) with 95%
      confidence intervals of 30 to 70. The two-sample t-test (and Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is used
      to compare the mean changes of the variables from baseline to 10, 30 and 90 days. Finally,
      the Chi-square test is used to test for adverse events at the end of follow-up. P ≤ 0.05 is
      indicative of statistically significant.

      Embolization is performed under local anesthesia in one day surgery unit by unilateral
      approach, usually the right femoral artery. Initially, pelvic angiography is performed to
      evaluate the iliac and prostatic arteries. Then, a 5-F catheter is introduced in right
      femoral artery to catheterize the left hypogastric artery and reach its anterior division.
      The inferior vesical artery and finally the prostatic vessels are selectively catheterized
      with a 3-F coaxial microcatheter. For embolization, nonspherical 100-300 μm PVA particles is
      used. The endpoint chosen for embolization is slow flow or near-stasis in the prostatic
      vessels with interruption of the arterial flow and prostatic gland opacification. When
      embolization of the left prostatic arteries was finished, the right prostatic arteries were
      embolized in the same way.

      Urinary catheter is removed 10 days after the embolization procedure. Voiding trials is
      performed and the successfull urination after urethral catheter removal is defined as three
      consecutive spontaneous micturitions with postvoid residual less than 100% of each
      micturition volume. If the patient is unable to urinate, a urethral catheter will replace
      before hospitalization discharge and the patient will return to our outpatient clinic for
      another voiding trial until the end of protocol. Assessments were carried out 10, 30 and 90
      days after initial embolization allocation.
