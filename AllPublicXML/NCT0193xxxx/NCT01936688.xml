  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of SCH
      900222/MK-3222 in a population of participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The base study consists of a screening phase of up to 4 weeks followed by a treatment period
      of 28 weeks, and a 20-week safety follow-up period off drug. The base study is divided into 2
      sequential parts.

      In Part 1 of the base study (Week 0 to Week 12), participants will be randomized to one of 4
      study arms (Arm A: MK-3222 200 mg at Week 0 and Week 4 + matching placebo to etanercept twice
      weekly; Arm B: MK-3222 100 mg at Week 0 and Week 4 + matching placebo to etanercept twice
      weekly; Arm C: Matching placebo to MK-3222 at Week 0 and Week 4 + matching placebo to
      etanercept twice weekly; Arm D: Matching placebo to MK-3222 at Week 0 and Week 4 + etanercept
      50 mg twice weekly).

      In Part 2 of the base study (Week 12 to Week 28), participants in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm D
      will receive matching placebo to MK-3222 to maintain blinding at Week 12. Participants in Arm
      A and Arm B will continue to receive either MK-3222 200 mg (Arm A) or MK-3222 100 mg (Arm B)
      at Week 16 and Week 28 and will also receive matching placebo to etanercept once weekly
      through study Week 28. At study Week 12, Arm C participants will be re-randomized to receive
      their first dose of MK-3222 200 mg or MK-3222 100 mg, and will receive additional doses of
      study medication according to their re-randomized treatment assignment at Week 16 and Week
      28. Participants in Arm C will also receive matching placebo to etanercept once weekly
      through treatment Week 28. Participants in Arm D will continue with once weekly doses of
      etanercept through study Week 28 in combination with matching placebo to MK-3222.

      For all participants, completion of Week 28 marks completion of Part 2 and of the overall
      base study. Participants originally assigned to Arm D and participants who discontinue
      treatment prior to completing Part 2 will not be eligible to enroll in the extension.
      Participants that are ineligible or opt not to enter the extension study will be encouraged
      to complete the 20-week follow-up period.

      Eligible participants that choose to enroll in the extension study will have an additional
      treatment period of up to 192 weeks and will be followed for an additional 20 weeks in the
      follow-up period. Each participant will receive MK-3222 200 mg or MK-3222 100 mg every 12
      weeks up to study Week 220 according to their treatment assignment at the conclusion of Part
      2 of the base study.
