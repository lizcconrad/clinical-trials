  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed indication for GSK1940029 is topical treatment of acne, the early clinical plan
      will evaluate the irritation potential of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study); and
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study),
      after topical administration on healthy subjects and acne patients. Study SCD117226 will be a
      randomized, single-blind, dose-rising study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary pharmacokinetics of single and 14 day repeat topical applications of GSK1940029
      gel on the intact skin of healthy human subjects. Part 1: (single-dose) subjects will receive
      0.3% or 1% GSK1940029 (or matching vehicle), as a single approximately (App) 24 hour (h)
      (22.5h) application to a surface area of 400 square centimeter (cm^2) (0.3%), 400 cm^2 (1%)
      or 1200 cm^2 (1%), respectively, in each of three sequential cohorts. Part 2: (repeat-dose)
      subjects will receive 0.3% or 1% GSK1940029 (or matching vehicle), as 14 daily App24h (22.5h)
      application to a surface area of 400 cm^2 (0.3%), 400 cm^2 (1%) or 1200 cm^2 (1%),
      respectively, in each of three sequential cohorts. Parts within Study SCD117225 and Study
      SCD117226 will have interdependencies. No significant primary irritation signal in Study
      SCD117225 Part 1 (primary irritation) would allow initiation of Study SCD117226 Part 1. Once
      safety, tolerability and exposure information are determined in Study SCD117226 Part 1, then
      Part 2 (cumulative irritation) of Study SCD117225 may be initiated along with Part 2 of Study
      SCD117226. No significant cumulative irritation signal (study SCD117225 Part 2) in
      combination with adequate 14-day safety (study SCD117226 Part 2) would allow initiation of
      Part 3 (facial irritation) of Study SCD117225.
