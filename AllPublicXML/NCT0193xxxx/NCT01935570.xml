  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is composed of two steps. The first step aims at validating the
      pharmacokinetic approach based on the magnesium concentration in erythrocyte and plasma.

      According to these results and if this pharmacokinetic approach is validated, the second step
      will set up. The second phase aims at comparing the relative bioavailability of magnesium
      administrated by two different drug formulations: ChronoMag Smart Tablet® (two tablets50mg)
      versus Mag2® (three tablets100mg).
