  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune cytopenias are a significant complication observed after hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) and carries a substantial rate of morbidity and mortality. This entity is
      usually challenging to treat, resulting in prolonged hospitalization and predisposes patients
      to complications either directly due to the specific cytopenia or due to the immune
      suppression that is part of its therapeutic management. One of the mediators of refractory
      autoimmune cytopenias are antibodies produced by plasma cells, which are historically
      challenging to target. The purpose of this study is to use a proteasome inhibitor called
      Bortezomib for the treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenias after HCT, and monitor the
      clinical response.

      This is a pilot study which will enroll 5 patients over 2 years, prospectively. Our
      hypothesis is that bortezomib will effectively target plasma cells and successfully treat
      refractory autoimmune cytopenias. This will be a relevant study as it will be the first step
      in establishing a novel therapeutic modality and potentially reducing length of
      hospitalization and degree of immune suppression for refractory autoimmune cytopenias.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients, having undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation at our center.

          -  Should have failed at least 2 standard treatments for autoimmune cytopenias. Standard
             treatments include corticosteroids, rituximab, IVIG, plasmapheresis, withdrawal of
             cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and MMF. Definition of &quot;failed&quot; treatment will be no
             response of cytopenia after 2 weeks of continued treatment OR requirement of daily
             GCSF at 10 mcgs/kg/day for autoimmune neutropenia despite 2 weeks of treatment,
             transfusions of packed red blood cells or platelets 3 times weekly for 2weeks despite
             continued treatment OR 5days/week plasmapheresis for 2 weeks and inability to wean the
             duration.

          -  Definition of autoimmune hemolytic anemia- development of anemia, where there is a
             hemoglobin drop of &gt;2 g/dL/48 hours or an absolute value of hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL, and
             evidence of hemolysis by positive direct Coombs test with compatible peripheral blood
             cell morphology, reticulocyte count and bilirubin level.

          -  Definition of autoimmune neutropenia - absolute neutrophil counts &lt; 500 for 2 weeks
             and presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies.

          -  Definition of autoimmune thrombocytopenia- Platelet counts &lt; 20,000 cells/uL for 2
             weeks and presence of anti-platelet antibodies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing life threatening infections

          -  Documented anaphylaxis to bortezomib

          -  Failed engraftment

          -  Relapse of primary malignancy

          -  â‰¥6/8 matched or haploidentical transplants
