      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of heated humidified high flow nasal cannula
      (HHHFNC) as compared to noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) on lung
      function as a measure of lung injury in preterm infants born at 28 to 37 weeks gestation
      requiring continuing respiratory support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support continues to be a common problem
      for preterm infants. Presence of the breathing tube and duration of respirator provided
      breaths have been shown to be associated with increased risk for secondary lung injury and
      subsequent development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Early application of
      noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been shown to be an
      effective, non-invasive, mode of respiratory support in preterm infants and to be associated
      with a lower incidence of chronic lung disease. A recently published large randomized
      multicenter study concluded that, among infants born at 28 weeks and longer gestation, heated
      humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) had similar clinical efficacy and safety as
      compared to NCPAP. Both NCPAP and HHHFNC are currently used to assist infants with breathing
      problems.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of HHHFNC as compared to NCPAP on lung function
      as a measure of lung injury in preterm infants born at 28 to 37 weeks gestation requiring
      continuing respiratory support. In this study, infants will remain on the assigned treatment
      of either NCPAP or HHHFNC until they require more support as provided by a respirator or
      until a treatment cross-over from NCPAP to HHHFNC, or the reverse, as decided by their
      attending physician. The infant's respiratory support will be managed according to his/her
      attending doctor as per accepted standards of care. A pulmonary function test will be
      performed twice weekly on each enrolled infant while receiving either NCPAP or HHHFNC
      support, followed-up by once weekly lung function measurements post respiratory support while
      infants are breathing only room air until discharge.
