    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether mutations in genes coding for
      Na/Pi-cotransporters are associated with aortic valve calcification. A patient population
      with premature aortic valve calcification treated with aortic valve replacement will be
      screened for mutations in these specific genes. Furthermore, aortic valve tissue received
      from the operations, will be examined for the presence of Na/Pi-cotransporters, and for
      molecular characterization of the transporters.
