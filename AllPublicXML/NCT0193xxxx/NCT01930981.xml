  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are interested in studying whether and how medical problems other than primary cancer
      before hematopoietic cell transplantation would impact the profiles of quality of life and
      toxicities post-transplantation for patients with blood cancers. We want to see if by
      assessing comorbidities (such as diabetes) early on, we can identify those patients who will
      have more toxicities or limitations in their quality of life after transplant. The generated
      information could set the stage for future intervention studies aiming to improve quality of
      life for patients with blood cancers after transplantation.
