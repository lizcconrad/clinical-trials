      Unlikely the other element for high quality chest compression during Cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation(i.e. compression rate, chest recoil, hand position), chest compression depth
      (CCD) is influenced by surface on which the patient is placed, especially in hospital. For
      solving this problem, to place the patient on rigid surface, use a backboard that might
      decrease the mattress compression, receive a feedback that reflects the mattress compression
      depth (MCD) using dual accelerometer or magnetic sensor have been proposed. As the other
      solution, we hypothesized that training of 6-7cm CCD for healthcare providers improve
      accurate CCD during cardiopulmonary resuscitation when manikin is placed on mattress in
      hospital.
