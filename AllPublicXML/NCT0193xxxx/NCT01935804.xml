  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tests whether pioglitazone (PIO)as compared to metformin (MET)affects bone health
      including bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, and osteocyte biomarker in patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

      Women with T2DM exhibit normal or higher bone mineral density (BMD) for their age, but with
      approximately twice the overall risk of bone fragility compared with nondiabetic subjects.
      Known the apparent association between T2DM and the risk of bone fragility, examining the
      effects of commonly used oral antidiabetic agents; such as MET and thiazolidinediones (TZDs;
      for example rosiglitazone [ROS] or PIO), on BMD and/or bone turnover is of great clinical
      relevance for both diabetic patients and their treating physicians. Recent clinical trials,
      showed that women treated with ROS had higher risk of bone fragility and self-reported
      adverse events. Similarly, women on long-term treatment with PIO for T2DM experienced higher
      incidence of distal extremity fractures. TZDs are agonists of the nuclear transcription
      factor peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) which increase insulin
      sensitivity and improve glycemic control in T2DM. PPAR (γ) acts also as a molecular factor
      that favours adipogenesis over osteoblastogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. The latter was
      suggested as a potential mechanism for the effects of TZDs on bone among others. In humans,
      TZDs decrease BMD and increase bone fragility risk. This study tests whether pioglitazone as
      compared to MET (both are commonly used in the treatment of T2DM in Saudi Arabia and other
      countries) affects bone health including bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, and
      osteocyte biomarker in patients with T2DM.
