  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if gemcitabine given during surgery can
      enter pancreas cancer cells in patients who have already received chemotherapy and radiation.

      Gemcitabine is a drug used to treat pancreatic cancer. However, it has not previously been
      studied if gemcitabine can enter pancreatic cancer cells. Gemcitabine is designed to block
      the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.

      Surgery:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your surgery will be performed in the same way as it
      would be even if you were not taking part in this study. You will sign a separate consent
      form for surgery. The length of the surgery and the time you are under anesthesia will not be
      changed by taking part in the study.

      During surgery, you will have routine procedures to learn if the disease has spread to other
      areas. If the disease has spread beyond the pancreas, surgical removal will not be possible.

      If there are no signs of spread or other reasons the cancer cannot be removed, the surgeon
      will begin the process of removing the disease.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive gemcitabine by vein during surgery. Gemcitabine will be given through an
      infusion catheter that is placed in your arm or chest in the operating room after you are
      asleep.

      The infusion catheter is a standard-of-care procedure for all participants who are having
      this surgery. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for the infusion catheter.

      The infusion will take either 50 or 75 minutes, depending upon when you joined the study. The
      first 5 participants will receive gemcitabine over 50 minutes and the rest of the
      participants will receive gemcitabine over 75 minutes.

      Blood and Tissue Collection:

      Up to 8 blood samples (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn over 70-95 minutes for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) testing on the day of surgery. PK testing measures the levels of study
      drug in your blood at different time points. The blood will also be used for biomarker
      testing. Biomarkers are chemical markers found in the blood and tissue that may be related to
      your reaction to the study drug.

      Some of the tumor tissue and normal tissue removed during surgery will be collected to learn
      if gemcitabine is able to enter the tissue cells and for biomarker testing.

      Length of Participation:

      If for any reason during the surgery the surgeon decides that removal of the pancreas is not
      possible, you will not receive gemcitabine and your participation in this study will end.

      Your active participation in this study will be over once you have had surgery and completed
      the follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      One (1) time each day while you are in the hospital recovering from the surgery and then at
      the time of a routine clinic visit or by phone call at least 1 time a week, for up to 30 days
      after surgery, you will be asked if you have had any side effects.

      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Its use during surgery is investigational.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Quantification of serum, PBMC, and cancer tissue levels of gemcitabine from frozen samples assessed using standardized techniques in high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood vessels in resected tumors detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies to CD31 or vWF. The mRNA and protein expression of SHH, Gli and SMO measured by RT-PCR and IHC method. Range of levels in patients with PC established. These markers correlated to the gemcitabine levels measured in the cancerous tissue. The expression level of genes involved in gemcitabine metabolism in the resected primary tumors examined. The mRNA level measured using real time PCR and protein expression by IHC. Gene expression level correlated to the gemcitabine measurements. Markers of proliferation and apoptosis measured by p21 and Ki67 IHC and fluorescent TUNEL analysis.</description>

    <description>Gemcitabine administered intravenously as a dose of 500 mg/m2 at a fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m2/min for the first 5 patients (to validate hematologic safety). Next 15 subsequent patients receive 750 mg/m2 at a fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m2/min. The drug infusion started 50-75 minutes prior to complete gross tumor removal (timing dependent on dose) in order to have drug administration complete at tumor removal.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is required. Patients
             with Islet cell tumors are not eligible.

          2. Patients do not have known metastases.

          3. Patients must have potentially resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer
             and have agreed to undergo surgical resection at MD Anderson Cancer Center if
             operable. They will have undergone staging (physical examination, chest x-ray,
             contrast enhanced CT or MRI (if CT contraindicated) and/or angiogram) to determine
             resectability.

          4. Patients have completed radiation and chemotherapy with either fluoropyrimidines (5-FU
             or capecitabine) or gemcitabine as a radiosensitizing agent as part of their
             preoperative therapy. Previous systemic chemotherapy alone is not allowed.
             Preoperative therapy will be completed at least 4 weeks prior to surgery.

          5. Patients with Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 are eligible.

          6. There will be no upper age restriction. Patients less than 18 years of age are
             excluded from the protocol because adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is rarely seen in
             the pediatric population.

          7. Adequate renal and bone marrow function: Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL; Absolute neutrophil
             count &gt;= 1,500/uL; Platelets &gt;= 100,000/Ul; Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL; Creatinine
             clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min (calculated by the Cockcroft -Gault equation)

          8. Adequate Hepatic function (endoscopic or percutaneous drainage as needed): Total
             bilirubin &lt; = 3 X institutional upper limits of normal (ULN); AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;=
             5 X institutional ULN

          9. Patients must have no fever or evidence of infection or other coexisting medical
             condition that would preclude administration of gemcitabine. Patients with
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable angina and myocardial infarction
             within 3 months will be excluded.

         10. Patient is not pregnant. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are
             pre-menopausal or not surgically sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods
             (abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device)
             and refrain from breast-feeding, as specified in the informed consent.

         11. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidity that precludes use of general anesthesia
             (NYHA [New York Heart Association] Class III and IV).

          2. Identification of metastatic disease.

          3. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Gemcitabine.

          4. Pregnant women

          5. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          6. Patients &lt; 18 years of age.
