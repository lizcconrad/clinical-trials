      -  4 tubes (2 x7-ml dry tubes with yellow gelose, and 2 x 5 ml tubes with blue CTAD) will
           be taken from the patient within 24 hours following inclusion (D0) in the department in
           which the patient is hospitalised

        -  4 tubes (2 x7-ml dry tubes with yellow gelose, and 2 x 5 ml tubes with blue CTAD) will
           be taken from the patient every 7 days following inclusion for 5 weeks (if the patient
           is still in hospital at the time), in the department where he/she is hospitalised (D7,
           D14, D21, D28, D35). Samples will no longer be taken once the patient has left the CHU,
           even if all of the samples have not been taken.

        -  For children less than 6 years old, only 2 tubes (1 x 7 ml dry tube with yellow gelose,
           and 1x5 ml tube with blue CTAD) will be taken following the same timetable.

        -  For hospitalised patients, a leeway of 48 hours is authorized for the sampling
           procedure. Samples will be taken at the same time samples are taken for the usual care
           of the patient.

        -  The tubes will be taken to the Bacteriology Laboratory using the usual collection
           circuit of the CHU. These tubes will then be redirected to the Infectious Diseases
           Laboratory to be centrifuged and then stored at -80°C. The strain of Streptococcus
           pneumoniae isolated in the patient will be preserved at -80°C. If strains other than
           Streptococcus pneumoniae are isolated, these different strains will all be preserved at
           -80°C under the same identification number.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (children or adults) hospitalised at Dijon CHU

          -  Presenting invasive pneumococcal disease, confirmed by:

        The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in a blood culture, or The presence of
        Streptococcus pneumoniae in a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, or The presence of significant
        levels of Streptococcus pneumoniae in an endobronchial sample (bronchial brushing or
        bronchoalveolar lavage), or in protected tracheal aspirations or in the spit of
        non-hospitalised patients or those in Intensive care Units.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients in whom the implication of Streptococcus pneumoniae is suspected because of:
        positive urinary soluble antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae with the exclusion of any
        other positive sample, presence of non- significant levels of Streptococcus pneumoniae in
        bronchopulmonary samples The presence of significant levels of Streptococcus pneumoniae in
        protected tracheal aspirations or in the spit, with the exclusion of any other positive
        sample in patients who had been in an Intensive care Unit for more than 48 hours at the
        time the sample was taken.

        - Patients in whom Streptococcus pneumoniae had already been isolated in the 5 weeks
        preceding inclusion in the present study.
