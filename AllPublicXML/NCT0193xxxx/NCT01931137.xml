  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the
      effect of the investigated drug on the body) of NNC0123-0000-0338 (insulin 338) in a tablet
      formulation with three different coatings in healthy subjects.
