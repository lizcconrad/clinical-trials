      Background:

      Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor. The drug
      pazopanib is used to treat people with a type of kidney cancer. Topotecan is used to treat
      lung cancer. Both topotecan and pazopanib have individually been used to treat patients with
      glioblastoma and some anti-tumor activity has been found. Researchers want to see if these
      two drugs together may be able to help people with glioblastoma.

      Objectives:

      To learn if pazopanib with topotecan can help control glioblastoma. Also, to study the safety
      of this drug combination.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old whose glioblastoma has returned after treatment.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) For these, participants
      lay in a machine that takes pictures.

      Chest CT scan or x-ray

      Heart electrocardiogram (EKG)

      A questionnaire about quality of life

      Participants will be assigned to a study group.

      Participants will take the study drugs for 28-day cycles for up to 1 year. They will take
      capsules of topotecan by mouth once every day. They will take tablets of pazopanib by mouth
      once every day.

      Participants will write in a diary the times they take the study drugs.

      Participants will have several study visits during each cycle. These may include

      Blood pressure measurement

      Blood and urine tests

      EKG

      Physical exam and/or neurological exam

      Brain MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease

      A symptom questionnaire

      At the end of treatment, participants will have a physical exam. They may have blood drawn.

      Participants will have follow-up calls once every 3 months to check.

      Background

        -  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal
           treatment,consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by
           adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of
           tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression,
           treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective.

        -  Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab
           indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months
           of 0%.

        -  Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Kit, and was
           recently FDA approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and HIF-1 alpha inhibitor with
           reasonably high CNS/CSF penetration

        -  Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic
           chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of
           Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor
           vasculature (both existing capillary endothelial cells and circulating bone marrow
           derived endothelial cell precursors), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1
           alpha inhibition, and the induction of DNA damage. Further support for the combination
           comes from recent data tying drug-induced VEGF inhibition to the induction of HIF-1
           alpha activity in GBM suggesting possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan

        -  The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in

      animal models

      Objectives

                opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would
                compromise the patient s ability to tolerate this therapy.

             -  No history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
                in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for
                that disease for a minimum of 3 years are eligible.

      progressing in severity, except alopecia.

        -  No ongoing use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agents (EIAEDs), unless 2 week washout

      Design

      This is a 2 arm phase II trial of the combination of topotecan and pazopanib in patients with
      recurrent GBM or GS. Patients will be enrolled into one of the following groups: (A)
      Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma with no prior bevacizumab exposure: (B) Glioblastoma or

      gliosarcoma with prior bevacizumab exposure. Topotecan and pazopanib are administered orally
      daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) at six months from
      patient registration for bevacizumab na(SqrRoot) ve patients and PFS at 3 months for patients
      with prior bevacizumab treatment.

        -  General Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or
             gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade
             glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM or GS is made. Patients must
             have evidence of progression of the GBM or GS on MRI or CT scan. Patient must have
             failed prior chemoradiation with temozolomide and any other therapies except BEV
             (group A), or must have failed primary chemoradiation and a BEV-incorporating
             treatment (group B).

          -  Patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses. Relapse is defined
             as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as
             initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 3 prior
             therapies

        (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient had a surgical resection for
        relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the
        patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1 relapse. For patients
        who

        had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a high-grade glioma
        will be considered the first relapse.

          -  Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiation or any
             additional radiation to reduce the chance of pseudoprogression.

          -  Measurable disease is required unless patient is post-operative and in that case
             patient can have no evidence of disease.

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study.

          -  Archived tumor tissue must be available for all subjects for confirmation of the
             diagnosis before or during treatment. Samples must be provided within 4 weeks of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.

          -  At the time of registration: Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             prior therapy: greater than or equal to 28 days from any investigational agent,
             greater than or equal to 28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy, greater than or equal
             to 14 days from vincristine, greater than or equal to 42 days from nitrosoureas,
             greater than or equal to 21 days from procarbazine administration, &gt;21 days from
             bevacizumab administration and greater than or equal to 7 days for non-cytotoxic
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.
             (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the definition of
             noncytotoxic agents should be directed to Academic PI.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function:

               -  Bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to 3,000/microl, ANC greater than
                  or equal to 1,500/mm3, platelet count of greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3,
                  and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dl).

                  ---Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.

               -  Liver function (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
                  (AST) &lt; 2.5 X ULN, and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN), prothrombin time (PT) or
                  international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time
                  (aPTT) less than or equal to 1.2 X ULN.

                    -  Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0 x ULN (upper limit
                       of normal) are not permitted.

                    -  Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is stable
                       and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation.

               -  Renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromol/L), or
                  if &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50
                  cc/min), and urine protein to creatinine ratio of &lt; 1 prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by
             MRI or CT scan as defined by Section 6.4.1.4.5. A scan should be performed within 14
             days prior to registration and on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing
             for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and
             registration a new baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT
             must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

             --They have recovered from the effects of surgery and be &gt; 28 days from surgery.

          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent GBM or GS is not mandated for
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease
             post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate
             post-operative

        period or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the
        96-hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If
        the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new

        baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

        -Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater

        than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.

          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation
             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or
             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
