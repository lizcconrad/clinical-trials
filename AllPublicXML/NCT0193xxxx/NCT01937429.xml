  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonoscopy is the reference examination for the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in the
      colon and rectum. Mass screening assessment studies have shown that colonoscopic detection
      and removal of adenomas in patients selected through fecal occult blood test reduces
      colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. However, the literature has reported interval
      cancer cases or adenomas, probably &quot;missed&quot; by the colonoscopy. In theory, using coloured
      warm water could improve colon preparation by mobilizing the residual faeces, decreasing the
      colic spasm and increasing the visualization of the pit pattern. Preliminary American
      studies, led by Leung et al, have shown a very clear increase in the adenoma detection rate.

      The investigators' study involves 1 000 patients, treated in the Rhône-Alpes / Auvergne
      region. The patients present an indication for colonoscopy following a positive fecal occult
      blood test or symptoms or personal and family histories of pre-cancerous colonic lesions.
      They will be randomized into two study groups:one of both groups of study: Group 1: patients
      undergoing a colonoscopy wtih instillation of tepid water tinged with blue (Indigo Carmin®)
      Group 2: patients undergoing a standard colonoscopy with insufflation of air. The main
      objective is to show that the colonoscopy with blue water (Indigo Carmin®) enable detection
      of more lesions than standard colonoscopy with insufflation of air. The two techniques will
      be also compared in terms of tolerance, of duration of colonoscopy and type of detected
      lesions.

      In case of improved detection of colorectal lesions, the blue water instillation technique of
      could dramatically change gastroenterologists' practice by becoming the reference method. The
      expected clinical benefits are potential revealing of more neoplastic lesions and improvement
      in abdominal discomfort after colonoscopy.

    <description>We chose three classifications recognized by the medical field:
The Paris endoscopic classification defines macroscopic appearance.
The Kudo classification explains endoscopic appearance.
The Vienna classification describes the histologic nature of the lesions.</description>

    <measure>Measure 3 The comparison of the tolerance of the two colonoscopy procedures by assessing patient reported side effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>At patient's awakening the day of colonoscopy or one day after</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerance is measured using a Visual Analog Scale.
The questionnaire includes four questions :
Did you have any pains?
How would you describe your bloating?
How would you describe your sensations of abdominal discomfort?
How would you describe your overall tolerance of the examination?
In addition to this Visual Analog Scale, we administer a short multiple choice questionnaire:
Would you be ready to redo the colonoscopy in the same conditions? (yes or no)
For patients who have already had colonoscopies with insufflation of air in the past, which examination (tepid water or air) would you prefer during the next exam?</description>
