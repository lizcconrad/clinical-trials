  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV to very low levels in the blood, but it cannot
      cure HIV infection because a small amount of virus remains in cells as a hidden (latent)
      form. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single dose and
      multiple dose administration of romidepsin (RMD) in HIV-infected adults.

    <textblock>
      A major challenge in eradicating HIV-1 infection is the persistence of virus in long-lived
      cells, such as latently infected memory CD4 T cells. One approach for eliminating the HIV-1
      reservoir is to activate viral replication in these latently infected CD4 T cells by
      targeting cellular mechanisms that repress proviral transcription. Histone deacetylase
      inhibitors (HDACis), such as RMD, induce HIV-1 expression by increasing acetylation and
      facilitating transcriptional activation of HIV-1. RMD administered in combination with ART
      may serve as an important component of a strategy to eradicate the HIV-1 latent reservoir.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single dose and multiple
      dose administration of RMD in HIV-infected adults.

      Participants will be sequentially enrolled into four cohorts and randomly assigned to receive
      either RMD or placebo. The cohorts will differ in the dose of RMD given. Participants in
      Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will have one intravenous (IV) infusion of RMD or placebo at Day 0.
      Participants in Cohort 4 will have four IV infusions of RMD or placebo at Days 0, 14, 28, and
      42.

      For participants in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, study duration is 4 weeks. For participants in
      Cohort 4, study duration is a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 48 weeks.

      Participants will attend several study visits, which may include a physical examination,
      blood and urine collection, pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, and an electrocardiogram (ECG).
