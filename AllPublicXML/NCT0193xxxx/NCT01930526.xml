  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) with supervised exercise training is a key part of care for
      patients with chronic lung disease (COPD). Patients can improve their shortness of breath,
      walking distance and quality of life. However, many patients do not improve their overall
      fitness. They are too breathless to train at a high enough intensity. In a laboratory
      training study, patients with COPD improved their overall fitness by using single leg
      cycling. Despite this knowledge, single leg cycling has not been used clinically. The
      objective of this project is to use and assess single leg cycling in a clinical setting.
      Single leg cycling can be incorporated into a clinical service (replacing traditional two
      legged cycling) as the predominant aerobic training strategy, resulting in improvements in
      cardio-respiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake).

    <description>Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a short course 6-12 weeks of supervised exercise training and education for patients with COPD. This is part of their usual treatment. This study is replacing two-legged cycling with single leg training. Patients will have the usual PR outcome measures assessed but in addition will have a laboratory exercise test.</description>
