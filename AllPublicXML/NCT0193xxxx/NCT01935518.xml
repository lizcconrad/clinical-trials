      This study will examine whether fasudil is effective and safe in treating patients with
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled, single center clinical study with placebo of historical researches
      as control. 10 patients will be enrolled in the study. The basic treatment is riluzole, 50mg
      twice a day. For the procedure, patients will take fasudil treatment for 14 days (30mg twice
      a day, intravenous). 3 months later, patients will repeat the fasudil treatment. All the
      patients will be followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was the decline rate of
      ALSFRS-R. The secondary outcomes are the survival time, endpoint time(death, tracheotomy and
      continuous ventilator-dependent), forced vital capacity (FVC), the short form health survey
      (SF-36), evaluation of cognitive function (verbal fluency and Frontal Behavioral Inventory
      Scale) and safety.
