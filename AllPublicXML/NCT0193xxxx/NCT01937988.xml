      This study will be a non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of women presenting for
      abortion at &lt;13 6/7 weeks. Women will be randomized either to receive support by a trained
      abortion doula (intervention) or to have standard procedure (control) during the abortion
      procedure. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive doula support during a first
      trimester abortion will report less pain during the abortion procedure compared to women who
      do not receive abortion doula support.
