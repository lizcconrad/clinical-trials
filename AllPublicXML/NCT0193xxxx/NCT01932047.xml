      ■ Unmet medical needs for Refractory cancer Conquest

      - Many advanced cancers are still detected Despite remarkable technological advances for the
      early diagnosis of cancer in the field last 20 years.

      In the type of progressive carcinoma is very high malignancy despite a variety of therapeutic
      target treatment for refractory cancer.

      The refractory cancer patients who main focus of this research defined as the adult solid
      tumor patients who have failed standard therapy according to the criteria

      NCCN / ASCO (American Society of imsangam) / KCSG (Study Group for chemotherapy).

      The survival rate of refractory cancer patients are estimated to be 30-40% of the total
      patients with metastatic solid tumors and these refractory cancers are

      difficult to deal with or control to conventional treatment so shows almost close to 100%
      mortality.

      Therefore the new development of therapies for conquer of refractory cancer are urgently
      required.

      ■ Preclinical translational research Unmet Needs of Bio-new drug development for conquer of
      refractory cancer

      - The stage of preclinical translational research (Translational Research) connects between
      the early stages of development and clinical trials in the stage drug development.

      The establishment of foundation based on the translational research is very necessary and
      this must have proven ability to treat refractory cancer.

      The most anti-cancer drugs developed by existing preclinical testing method actually does not
      show a remarkable effect in many cases in the clinical trials,

      even if showed a remarkable inhibitory cancer effect in animal testing.

      The exact molecular diagnosis to treat targets and paradigm for the development of new drugs
      at the same time requires for target treatment.

      The tailored cell lines by patients and the proven technology by animal models and unmet need
      for preclinical translational research is increasing

      ■ The specimen obtainer in surgery room contact with the manager of Institute Refractory
      Cancer Research team by calling to Medi-call system(Phone No.system T.9825).

      The specimen obtainer gives the information of speciman to the manager .

      The manager contact to the speciman deleverer and The speciman deleverer transported the
      specimens safely to the laboratory space.

      The written informed consent form should obtained from the subject prior to the surgery.

      In the case of blood samples, The total 15 ~ 20 ㎖ blood (only once) extracted from the
      subject and about 10 ~ 15 ㎖ blood is used for the genomic DNA extraction.
