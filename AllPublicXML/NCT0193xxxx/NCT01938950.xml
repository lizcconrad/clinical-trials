  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current epidemic rate of childhood obesity is a leading health concern as
      overweight/obese youth may suffer from comorbid conditions, once considered exclusive to
      adults. It has been suggested that physical inactivity is a major determinant of obesity and
      obesity-related health risk in children and adolescents. Recent studies in adults report that
      the combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is a better strategy than aerobic or
      resistance exercise alone for reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Currently, the most
      effective exercise modality for concurrent reductions of adiposity, in particular abdominal
      fat, and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown in
      adolescents. Therefore, we will employ a randomized trial to examine the effects of a
      long-term aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and a combination of both exercise regimens
      on: 1) in vivo insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and risk for type 2 diabetes, 2) total
      adiposity, skeletal muscle mass, visceral adiposity and ectopic fat in the liver and skeletal
      muscle, and 3) traditional and non-traditional risk factors/markers for CVD in overweight
      boys and girls. We will recruit 168 sedentary overweight (BMI &gt;85th percentile) adolescent
      boys and girls aged 12-17 years old and randomly assign them to one of three 6-month
      intervention groups (n = 56 each group): 1) aerobic exercise (180 min/week), 2) resistance
      exercise (180 min/week), or 3) aerobic and resistance exercise (180 min/week) group. A weight
      maintenance diet (55-60% carbohydrate, 15-20% protein, and 25-30% fat) will be prescribed and
      monitored for all groups, so that any changes in energy balance will be induced by exercise
      intervention alone (e.g., no calorie restriction). We believe that this proposed application
      will have a significant implication that is directly relevant for one in three American
      adolescents who are at increased risk of developing obesity-related co-morbidities.
