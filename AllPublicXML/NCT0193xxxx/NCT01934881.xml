  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The programming of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's
      disease (PD) is complex work because the parameter setting has not been standardized so far.
      The objective of the present study is to set up a standardized programming algorithm for
      Chinese PD patients treated with bilateral STN DBS.

      A total of 150 subjects will be recruited from the concurrent NCT01922388 study and followed
      up for two years. All patients will be evaluated using the Movement Disorder
      Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part
      III at baseline (one week before surgery) and at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.

      Stimulation parameters setting: The first programming is performed at 3-4 weeks after
      surgery. Bilateral contacts are as cathode for monopolar configuration. The initial voltage,
      pulse width and frequency are bilaterally 1.0-1.5 V, 60 μs and 130 Hz for each individual,
      respectively. Voltage is gradually increased to a stable level first, until the optimal
      efficacy is achieved. Two weeks later, when patients came back to hospital for reprogramming,
      the voltage is also first adjusted to optimize the stimulation parameters. Either pulse width
      or frequency will be adjusted when increasing voltage more than 0.4 V for one time still can
      not get satisfactory outcomes. The frequency is adjusted when bilateral symptoms are
      unresponsive to voltage. Frequency is increased by 15-20 Hz for each time. Pulse width is
      then adjusted for the satisfactory clinical response of unilateral symptoms which are not
      satisfied after increasing voltage or frequency. Pulse width is increased to 90 μs if
      necessary (e.g. severe tremor).

      Groups: Patients are divided into two groups according to the parameter settings during
      follow-up. Group I: patients with voltage adjustment only. The pulse width is kept to 60 μs
      and frequency to 130 Hz constant throughout the follow-up period. Group II: patients with
      adjustment of more than two stimulation parameters (voltage, pulse width or frequency) during
      the follow-up.
