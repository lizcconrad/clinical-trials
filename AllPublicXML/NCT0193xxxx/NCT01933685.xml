      The primary purpose of this study is to define in HIV-uninfected volunteers the innate,
      cell-mediated and humoral responses induced by AIDSVAX B/E in the systemic and mucosal
      compartments and to characterize B cell functional specificities in peripheral blood, bone
      marrow and sigmoid compartments.

               -  Platelets: 150,000 to 450,000/mm^3

               -  ALT and AST &lt;/= 1.25 institutional upper limit of reference range

               -  Creatinine: &lt;/= 1.25 institutional upper limit of reference range

               -  Urinalysis (dipstick) for blood and protein no greater than 1+, glucose negative

          8. Female-Specific Criteria:

               -  Negative human choriogonadotropin (Î²-HCG) urine pregnancy test for women at

                  corticosteroid for a non-chronic condition (based on investigator clinical
                  judgment) at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment in this study.

          9. Blood products within 120 days prior to HIV screening.
