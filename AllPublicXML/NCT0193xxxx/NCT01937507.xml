      Deliver oxliplatin and 5-FU via HAI to breast cancer patients with liver-only or

      In this pilot study, the investigators will deliver oxliplatin and 5-FU via HAI to breast
      cancer patients with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one
      line of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic setting. The investigators hypothesize that HAI
      chemotherapy will be able to convert some patients to surgical resection candidates, or/and
      to overcome chemo-resistance of liver metastases to systemic i.v. chemotherapy for some
      clinically fit, heavily pre-treated patients.

          2. Patients were required to have measurable disease in the liver, defined as lesions
             measuring &gt;1 cm in largest diameter on spiral-computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI)

          3. Histologically confirmed metastatic advanced solid tumors involving the liver, liver
             replacement less than 70%
