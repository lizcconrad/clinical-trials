  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well azacitidine and entinostat before
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, irinotecan
      hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride, docetaxel, and pemetrexed disodium, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Entinostat may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine and
      entinostat before chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percentage of patients progression-free at 6 months from time of randomization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS). II. Overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat
      orally (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or progressive disease
      receive chemotherapy of the treating oncologist's choice comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 1, docetaxel IV on day 1, pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1, or
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine PO on days 1-21 and entinostat PO on days 3 and 10.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or progressive disease receive chemotherapy of
      the treating oncologist's choice as in Arm A.

      ARM C: Patients receive chemotherapy of the treating oncologist's choice as in Arm A.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 24 months and
      then yearly thereafter.

    <description>The final analysis will be by Fisher's Exact test, with percentage of patients who have not progressed as the outcome variable. Using Fisher's Exact test for analysis with 55 patients per treatment group will provide 88% power to detect an increase from 40% (chemotherapy alone) to 65% (epigenetic therapy followed by chemotherapy) in the number of patients who are progression free at six months.</description>
