      This study is being done to better understand how genetic information might improve
      assessment of heart attack risk.

      This study aims to randomize patients to 2 arms. The first arm will receive the conventional
      Framingham risk score for coronary heart disease while the intervention arm will receive the
      genetics-informed risk for coronary artery disease.

      The investigators will assess baseline blood lipid levels and follow the 2 arms up to 6
      months after randomization. Primary endpoint is change in LDL levels between the 2 arms.
      Secondary outcomes include blood pressure control, weight, smoking cessation, and other
      lifestyle modifications.

      This trial will help us understand whether coronary artery disease risk derived from genetic
      information would have a significant impact on patients' perception of coronary artery
      disease risk and motivate healthy lifestyle modifications that reduce their long term risk.
