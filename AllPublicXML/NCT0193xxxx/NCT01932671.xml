  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After having had a first cardiovascular event, there is a considerable risk of developing a
      subsequent event. Only recently, a risk prediction model was developed for this group of
      patients. Imaging techniques such as the coronary artery calcium score and contrast-enhanced
      computed tomography (CT) of the coronary and carotid arteries could be able to add improve
      this model. Imaging may further improve the prediction of future manifestations of arterial
      disease and personalize disease monitoring and treatment.

      Patients with a prior cardiovascular event exhibit an elevated risk for subsequent
      cardiovascular events. The Second Manifestation of Arterial Disease Study (SMART) has
      recruited over 10,000 patients since 1996 with clinically manifest cardiovascular disease in
      a multidisciplinary single center study involving primary care physicians, cardiologists,
      neurologists, vascular surgeons, vascular medicine specialists and radiologists. Within this
      study a prediction model was developed to accurately estimate the risk for new cardiovascular
      events. It is now possible to acquire high-quality motion-free computed tomography (CT)
      images of the coronary and carotid arteries. Imaging biomarkers extracted from these images
      may further improve the prediction of future manifestations of arterial disease and
      personalize disease monitoring and medical care.

      The SMART-ORACLE study is a prospective, single center, observational cohort study aiming to
      include 1500 patients. The primary aim is to identify predictors of future cardiovascular
      events. Eligible patients will be selected via the recruitment of the original SMART study.
      Patients participating in the SMART-ORACLE study will undergo calcium scoring in multiple
      cardiovascular beds and contrast-enhanced CT-scans of the coronary and carotid arteries in
      addition to the regular SMART investigations. Patients with renal dysfunction will be either
      excluded from the study or will receive pre-hydration (depending on eGFR) to minimize the
      risk of contrast nephropathy. Follow-up with questionnaire-based assessment will take place
      every 26 weeks until death of participant or end of the SMART study, asking participants
      about possible new cardiovascular events. Endpoints will be adjudicated by a committee of
      three experts. The aim is to collect 170 future events.

      The main analysis will consist of Cox proportional hazard analysis. Imaging biomarkers will
      be added to the existing prediction model to assess their (independent) discriminatory
      capacity for future events. The c-statistic will be used to measure the discrimination of
      each model. Net reclassification improvement tables will be constructed to evaluate the added
      value of imaging markers in terms of reclassification. Based on a one-year-occurrence rate of
      subsequent cardiovascular events in the current SMART population database of 2.6%, about 6500
      person years of follow-up are needed to obtain the adequate number of endpoints.

    <description>The SMART (Second Manifestation of ARTerial disease) cohort comprises patients at high-risk for or who have clinically manifest cardiovascular disease, including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, aneurysma aorta abdominalis, myocardial infarction, coronary ischemia for which coronary intervention is required, renal artery stenosis, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus, pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, abruption placentae and Intrauterine growth restriction in medical history. Participants are re-invited after 4 years for a second screening. This screening is performed to study the progression of atherosclerosis and evaluate the effects of the advice of the multidisciplinary team.</description>
