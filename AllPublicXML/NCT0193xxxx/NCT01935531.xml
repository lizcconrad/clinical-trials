  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to investigate the effects of topical diclofenac on tumor
      metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised
      patients.

      Study hypothesis is that topical diclofenac lowers lactate level in skin biopsies of actinic
      keratoses. Planned number of patients is 38.

      This study is a monocenter study investigating the effects of 3% diclofenac in 2.5%
      hyaluronic acid gel on tumor metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses. Treatment
      duration is 3 months. Skin biopsies will be obtained before treatment, at the end of the
      treatment and four weeks after the treatment. Control biopsies at visit 1 and 3 are performed
      in healthy, sun damaged and untreated skin. Evaluation of efficacy will be performed at the
      end of the treatment and four weeks after the treatment.

      Duration of treatment is 3 months (±4 weeks). Approximately 0,5g Solaraze® 3% gel is applied
      on a 5cm x 5cm lesion. Solaraze® 3% gel is applied twice daily on the study lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoplastic cells show an increased glucose metabolism and glycolysis which is associated with
      high lactate concentrations. There is also data for several tumor entities that high levels
      of lactate in the tumor are associated with tumor progression, metastasis and poor clinical
      outcome. Kreutz et al. demonstrated that diclofenac inhibits tumor cell proliferation in
      vitro and tumor growth in vivo via COX-independent effects on glucose metabolism. Diclofenac
      is taken up by tumor cells and inhibits tumor cell proliferation through inhibition of the
      oncogene MYC and subsequently glycolysis and block of lactate transport. MYC regulates genes
      involved in glycolysis and is upregulated in neoplastic cells, which is in line with the
      metabolic switch to glycolysis, the so called &quot;Warburg effect&quot;, that cancer cells show.
      Although these results were found in vitro using human melanoma cells and in vivo in a mouse
      model, a similar mechanism of action is assumed to be relevant for the treatment of actinic
      keratoses with topical diclofenac. However tumor metabolism in diclofenac-treated actinic
      keratoses has never been investigated. To investigate the mechanism of action of diclofenac
      in the treatment of actinic keratoses, a clinical study analyzing particularly lactate
      levels, glycolysis and inflammatory infiltrate is needed.
