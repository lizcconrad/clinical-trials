  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) are major causes of morbidity and among the top
      10 causes of deaths in Hong Kong in 2008 (Department of Health 2009). The Hospital Authority
      (HA) has initiated service improvement through introducing the patient empowerment programme
      (PEP) to improve the quality of care (QOC) for DM and HT patients. The evaluation on the QOC
      is an essential part of the programme in order to inform future policy. The Family Medicine
      Unit (FMU) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has been appointed by the HA to carry out the
      evaluation of the QOC of the programme.

      The Action Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of
      care intended by the PEP programme is achieved. Each PEP participating clinic and
      non-government organization (NGO) will be invited to complete a structured evaluation
      questionnaire. The data of all patients who have enrolled into the PEP for more than one year
      will be included in the evaluation on the process and outcomes of care. A hundred and thirty
      participants will be followed up by telephone to evaluate the effect of the programme in
      quality of life (QOL), patient enablement, and global rating of change in health condition at
      baseline and 6 months after enrolment. Data on the process of care will be retrieved from the
      HA medical records. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of
      participants who have received the planned process of care and achieved the target HbA1c and
      blood pressure levels.

      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on proportions meeting the QOC criteria will be
      calculated. The changes in clinical, service, and patient reported outcomes at 6 and 12
      months will assessed by paired sample t-test. The audit cycle will be repeated annually over
      a period of 5 years.

      Results: The QOC of the PEP programme will be determined. Areas of deficiency and possible
      areas for quality enhancement will be identified. Conclusion: The results of this study will
      provide empirical evidence on whether the HA's PEP programme can enhance QOC for patients
      with diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension (HT). The information will be used to guide
      service planning and policy decision making.
