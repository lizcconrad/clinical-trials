  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether is is feasible and acceptable to deliver a
      telephone based coaching intervention compared with education alone in community dwelling
      older adults (age 60 and older) after a fall related hip fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial design to inform the development of a
      larger scale study to test effectiveness of a clinician supported telephonic self management
      intervention for older adults after hip fracture. The primary aim is to determine feasibility
      and acceptability of the intervention, and the secondary aim is to measure statistical trends
      on quality of life at 4 months after fracture in community dwelling older adults. In
      parallel, we will conduct a process evaluation to ascertain key features of the intervention
      via qualitative interviews of participants and health care professionals involved in delivery
      of the intervention.

Medication Management
Activity/Exercise Prescription and Goal-Setting
Falls Prevention
Clarification of Appointments
Coordination of Post-Discharge Home Services
