  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an 8 week double blind randomized controlled split-face studies, we tried to compare the
      clinical efficacy, safety and histopathological changes between Lactobacillus fermented
      Chamaecypris obtusa (LFCO) and existing tea tree oil (TTO)

      Basically, this is a split face study - one side of face randomly assigned was applied with
      LFCO and the other side with TTO in same patients.

    <textblock>
      Screening of natural compounds for the development of anti-acne therapeutic agents has been
      steadily required considering various side effects of acne medications.However, previous
      studies have mainly focused on experimental tests without clinical trials and
      histopathological analysis.

      To compare the clinical efficacy, safety and histopathological changes between Lactobacillus
      fermented Chamaecypris obtusa (LFCO) and existing tea tree oil (TTO)

      Total thirty four patients were instructed to apply 5 % LFCO to the involved areas of
      randomly allocated side and 5 % TTO extract to the other side for 8 weeks in a double blind
      split-face clinical trial.
