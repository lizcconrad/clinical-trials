      HYPOTHESES:

      The hypotheses are that:

        1. nurse midwives will be able to safely deliver interpersonal psychotherapy by telephone
           to women with postpartum depression

        2. women receiving interpersonal psychotherapy will have less symptoms of postpartum
           depression, better functioning, better bonding with their babies, and better
           relationships with their partners

        3. women with postpartum depression will be more satisfied with their care than women in
           the group that was referred to a mental health center.

      The specific aims of this pilot non-randomized clinical trial are to evaluate among women
      with PPD recruited between 6 and 24 weeks postpartum:

        1. The (a) feasibility, (b) acceptability and (c) safety of a psychological intervention
           (Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT]) provided by nurse midwives in collaboration with a
           mental health team (psychiatrist team leader and a licensed social worker) for treatment
           of PPD in a pilot two-armed non-randomized clinical trial.

        2. The preliminary evidence of efficacy of IPT in decreasing depressive symptoms when
           administered via telephone by nurse-midwives/ women's health nurse practitioner

        3. The proposed study will also evaluate preliminary evidence for the efficacy of IPT
           administered by nurse midwives in

             1. Improving the general level of maternal functioning

             2. Specific improvement in marital adjustment

             3. Increase in maternal infant bonding

      This pilot study is the first step in developing an intervention to decrease depressive
      symptoms, improve functioning, improve interpersonal relationships between mother and spouse
      and infant, improve access to care, and improve treatment engagement among postpartum women
      diagnosed with PPD. The intervention will be cost-effective, brief and acceptable to both
      patients and nurse midwives for incorporation into current midwifery practice. If the IPT
      program is found to be feasible, acceptable and safe with preliminary evidence of efficacy, a
      postpartum IPT manual for advanced practice nurses will be finalized in order to test whether
      other advanced practice nurses such as pediatric nurse practitioners and family nurse
      practitioners can also safely and effectively administer IPT in a full-scale randomized
      clinical trial
