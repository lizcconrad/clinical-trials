    <description>Adjustment the dosage of colchicine during study:
The colchicine dosage will be changed when the hepatic reserved function of the participant changes from Child A to B according as following: 2 tablets after breakfast, 1 tablet after lunch and 2 tablets after dinner; continue 4 days and stop for 3 days (1 cycle); repeat this cycle until patients quit this trial. If the hepatic reserved function of the participant changes to Child C, colchicine will be stopped and participant receives regular follow-up only.If participant suffers from severe diarrhea, colchicine will be temporarily stopped. When the symptom of diarrhea subsides, colchicine will be given again but the dose will be reduced 0.5 mg/day.</description>
