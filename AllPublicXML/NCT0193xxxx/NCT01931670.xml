      A randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of elagolix in the management of
      moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain in adult premenopausal female subjects.

      The study consists of 4 periods: 1) Washout Period (if applicable); 2) a Screening Period of
      up to 100 days prior to first dose; 3) a 6 month Treatment Period; and 4) a Post treatment
      Follow-up Period of up to 12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be dispensed
      and training provided to record endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and
      analgesic medication use for endometriosis-associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy
      testing will be performed monthly throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use
      nonhormonal dual contraception during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and
      effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.

          4. Subject has a Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score total score of 6 at Screening
             with a score of at least 2 for dysmenorrhea AND at least 2 for non-menstrual pelvic
             pain.

          5. Subjects must have at least two regular menstrual cycles with an interval of 24-38
             days within the Screening Period, prior to Day 1.

          2. Subject has a history of previous non-response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone
             (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, or aromatase
             inhibitors as assessed by subject report of no improvement in dysmenorrhea or
             non-menstrual pelvic pain.

          3. Subject has chronic pelvic pain that is not caused by endometriosis that requires
             chronic analgesic or other chronic therapy, or that would interfere with the
             assessment of endometriosis related pain.

          4. Clinically significant gynecologic condition identified on Screening transvaginal
