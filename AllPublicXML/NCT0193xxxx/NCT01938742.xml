    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 700 males and
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine
      administered at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with and
      without MF59 adjuvant and without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL
      dose). Subjects will receive two doses via intramuscular injection, approximately 21 days
      apart. Safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity data will be collected at standard time
      points with safety follow-up to continue through one year post dose 2. The duration of the
      study for each subject will be approximately 13 months.

      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 700 males and
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. The study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur
      administered to healthy adults at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)
      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and without
      adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose). The A/H7N9 vaccine was
      made with HA antigen derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (up to 100 subjects per group) to receive two doses of the
      A/H7N9 vaccine with and without MF59 adjuvant delivered intramuscularly approximately 21 days
      apart. The same dosage of A/H7N9 vaccine will be given to subjects at both their first and
      second study vaccinations. The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant; and 2) assess new-onset chronic medical
      conditions following receipt of two doses of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant. The duration of the study for each subject will
      be approximately 13 months.

        diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion Criteria) are stable.
        Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site
        principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to
        subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal,
        and inhaled medications (with the exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject
        Exclusion Criteria (see section 5.2)), vitamins, and contraceptives are permitted. -Oral
        temperature is less than 100.4 degrees F. -Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive. -Systolic
        blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive. -Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg,
        inclusive. -Female subjects of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile via
        tubal sterilization, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy or who are not postmenopausal
        for &gt;/= 1 year must agree to practice highly effective contraception that may include, but
        is not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship
        with a vasectomized partner, male condoms with the use of applied spermicide, intrauterine

        contraception for a minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure and agree to
        practice highly effective contraception for the duration of study product exposure,
        including 2 months (defined as 60 days)after the last study vaccination. A highly effective
        method of contraception is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e., less
        than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. Method of contraception will
        be captured on the appropriate data collection form. -Female subjects of childbearing
        potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study
        vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Have an acute illness within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. -Have any condition
        that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator,
        would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to
        meet the requirements of the protocol, or confound the interpretation of the results. -Have
        an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
        investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, or would
        interfere with the evaluation of responses. -Have immunosuppression as a result of an
        underlying illness or treatment, or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy
        (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study vaccination. -Have known active neoplastic
        disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy. -Have known HIV, hepatitis B, or
        hepatitis C infection. -Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg or chicken
        protein, squalene-based adjuvants, or other components of the study vaccine. -Have a
        history of severe reactions following previous immunization with licensed or unlicensed
        influenza virus vaccines. -Have a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. - Have a history of
        neuralgia, paresthesia, neuritis, convulsions, or encephalomyelitis within 90 days prior to
        study vaccination. -Have a history of autoimmune disease, including but not limited to
        neuroinflammatory diseases, vasculitis, clotting disorders, dermatitis, arthritis,
        thyroiditis, or muscle, liver or kidney disease. -Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse
        within 5 years prior to study vaccination. -Have any diagnosis, current or past, of

        prior to study vaccination. -Have taken oral or parenteral corticosteroids of any dose
        within 30 days prior to study vaccination. -Have taken high-dose inhaled corticosteroids
        within 30 days prior to study vaccination. High-dose defined as &gt;800mcg/day of
        beclomethasone dipropionate CFC or equivalent. -Received any licensed live vaccine within
        30 days or any licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days prior to the first study
        vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine from the first study vaccination through the
        follow-up visit at approximately 21 days after the last study vaccination. This is
        inclusive of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines. -Received immunoglobulin or other blood
        products (with exception of Rho D immunoglobulin) within 90 days prior to study
        vaccination. -Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood
        product, or medication) within 30 days prior to the first study vaccination, or expects to
        receive an experimental agent other than from participation in this study during the
        13-month study period. -Are participating or plan to participate in another clinical trial
        with an interventional agent (licensed or unlicensed vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood
        product, or medication) during the 13-month study period. -Prior participation in a
        clinical trial of influenza A/H7 vaccine and assigned to a group receiving influenza A/H7
        vaccine (does not apply to documented placebo recipients) or have a history of A/H7 actual
        or potential exposure or infection prior to the first study vaccination. -Plan to travel
        outside the U.S. (continental U.S., Hawaii and Alaska) in the time between the first study
        vaccination and 42 days after the first study vaccination. -Female subjects who are
        breastfe eding or plan to breastfeed at any given time from the first study vaccination
        until 30 days after their last study vaccination. -Blood donation within 30 days prior to
        enrollment and within 30 days after the last blood draw (only for a subset of healthy adult
        subjects - up to 75 volunteers, 19-64 years old, enrolled at the Emory VTEU site, who
        consent to blood donation for the immunology exploratory assays).
