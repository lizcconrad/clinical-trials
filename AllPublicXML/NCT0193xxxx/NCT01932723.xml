  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menstrual low back pain (LBP) is one of the common complaints among women. Menstrual LBP may
      be attributed to the spinal instability resulting from ligament laxity due to hormonal
      change. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of functional lumbar
      stabilization exercises on pain, disability and kinesiophobia in women with menstrual LBP.

      Pain intensity using Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland-Morris
      questionnaire (RMQ) and Tampa scale of kinesiophobia (TSK) were collected at base line and at
      the end of treatment (after three months) in both groups.
