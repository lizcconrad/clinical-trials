  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep sea water (DSW) is characterized by high purity, low temperature, high nutrients and
      minerals and is obtained from the water flows 200 meters under the surface of the sea. The
      inhibition of H. pylori growth by DSW has been demonstrated in vitro study. However, up to
      now, there is few randomized control study to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of
      ingesting DSW in patients with H. pylori infection.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of ingesting DSW in patients with H. pylori
           infection;

        2. to evaluate the patient adherence and adverse effects of ingesting DSW.

      Patients having H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis with/without small erosions or peptic
      ulcer scars will be recruited. Before treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined
      by endoscopy with biopsy or 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT). All patients will receive 13C-UBT
      before treatment, at the end of 2 week's treatment and 4 weeks after termination of
      treatment. A computed generated random numbers sequence will be blocked (2:1; block sizes of
      six) into two groups, say A and B.

      group A - ingesting DSW 200 cc four times a day (one hour before meal and bed time); group B
      - ingesting non-DSW drinking water 200 cc four times a day (one hour before meal and bed
      time).

      To keep the study in double-blind model, the picture of package for DSW and non-DSW drinking
      water will be the same.

      Prokinetics (metoclopramide 5 mg/tab 1 tid) and antacid (strocain tablet (oxethazaine 5 mg
      and polymigel 244 mg/tab) 1 tid) will be permitted for relieving the dyspeptic symptoms.

      All patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and water/drug
      consumption daily during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the patients will be seen at
      the Outpatients Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse of treatment.
