  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality bowel preparation is a prerequisite for colonoscopy. Few studies have evaluated
      visual aids as a means of improving the quality of bowel preparation. We assess the effect of
      patient-judging dose adjustment of bowel preparation solution for bowel preparation using
      SMARTPHONE application on the quality of bowel preparation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, prospective, endoscopist-blinded clinical trial in which the efficacy
      of SMARTPHONE application on the bowel cleansing was inspected.

      A intervention patients take the picture of stool using SMARTPHONE camera application, and
      then assess the bowel cleansing result. If the result is &quot;Pass&quot;, they stop the addition of
      bowel preparation agent. but the result is &quot;Fail&quot;, so they have the additive bowel
      preparation agent and repeat using the SMARTPHONE application.

      After the bowel preparation, Endoscopists, who were blinded to the study group of the
      patient, immediately completed the Ottawa scale after procedure.
