  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized trial utilizing a three-period, balanced
      block design, with each period comprising a unique study product administration. The
      treatments studied are PBF-680 5 mg, PBF-680 20 mg and placebo, as an orally administered
      capsule. The study includes a screening visit, a selection visit, three visits for the
      randomized treatment sequence, and an end-of-study follow-up visit, spanning through a 65-day
      maximum study duration. The study will be conducted on 18 male or female adults aged ³18
      years, with a diagnosis of stable, mild to moderate asthma as per GINA guidelines, with no
      smoking or less than a 5 packs-years smoking history history, responsive to AMP airway
      challenge as determined in the selection visit.

      The primary efficacy variable will be the PC20 yielded from AMP airway challenge testing at
      the three treatment visits. FeNO, sampled at three time points at each treatment period
      visit, will be a exploratory variable. Safety assessment will include monitoring of adverse
      events, physical examination, vital signs, EKGs, spirometry, serum and urine pregnancy tests,
      and laboratory determinations. Blood sampling at a time-point series will provide
      pharmacokinetics data.

      The primary variable of the study is PC20, mg×mL-1. The PC 20 distributions will be analyzed
      by treatment using ANOVA for repeated measurements, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons
      as appropriate. Other analyses will comprise FeNO, pharmacokinetics, data sets generated from
      baseline characteristics and safety assessments, and discretionary expiratory analyses to
      evaluate the influence of baseline and clinical covariates on the primary variable.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adults aged 18, who have signed the informed consent form prior to
             initiation of any study procedures.

          -  Subjects with mild to moderate asthma, diagnosed as per Global Initiative for
             Asthma(GINA) guidelines.

          -  Subjects must have a body mass index between 18 and 35 kg/m².

          -  Subjects must be able to perform acceptable spirometry in accordance with ATS/ERS
             criteria for acceptability repeatability.

          -  Subjects must have a baseline FEV1 60% of predicted normal, and greater than 1 L in
             absolute value, on Visit 2.

          -  On Visit 2, eligible subjects must show airway hyperresponsiveness to AMP, determined
             by PC20 thresholding (the AMP provocative concentration that elicits a 20% drop from
             baseline FEV1 value, under AMP challenge test as per the ERS Task Force on Indirect
             Airway Challenges).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current smokers, smokers within six months prior to Visit 1, or subjects with an
             smoking history greater than 5 pack-years.

          -  Asthmatics in treatment Step 5 as per GINA guidelines, including oral corticosteroids
             and/or omalizumab, or any immunosuppressive medication whether asthma-related or
             indicated for any concomitant morbidities.

          -  Subjects with a history of life-threatening asthma attacks (i.e. requiring ICU
             admission, orotracheal intubation).

             atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, QTc(F) interval greater than 450 ms at
             screening(Visit 2), or any other EKG abnormality deemed clinically significant by the
             investigator.

          -  Subjects who have a clinically significant laboratory abnormality at screening (Visit
             2).

          -  Subjects with current uncontrolled arterial hypertension.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are surgically sterile (i.e. bilateral
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), are at least 2
             years postmenopausal, practice abstinence, or agree to employ effective contraception

             transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with
             spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, or use of a condom with spermicide by the
             sexual partner.

          -  Women supplying lactation.

          -  Receipt of any investigational drug therapy or biologicals within 3 months before
             randomization in this study, or within 5 half-lives of the investigational agent or
             biologic, whichever is longer.

          -  History of any known immunodeficiency disorder.

          -  Subjects with a history of malignancy within the past five years, with the exception
             of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
