  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) will be facilitated through the use of a
      stimulator, with the patient in a semi recumbent position, using UltraStim electrodes. Two 5
      cm x 5 cm electrodes will be placed over the soleus muscle for calf stimulation. The
      participant will be allowed to ramp up the stimulus level themselves to get used to the
      sensation and determine their maximum tolerated stimulus level.

      A goniometer will be used to assess mobility at the knee and ankle joints. Transcutaneous
      oxygen measurements (tcpO2) will be assessed using the PERIMED Periflux System 500 tcpO2
      monitor.

      The level of oedema will be measured using the figure of eight measurement, tape
      circumference measurement and water displacement measurement.

      Comfort will also be assessed by use of a 100mm non-hatched visual analogue scale (VAS). Each
      participant will be asked to indicate their level of comfort following the application of
      NMES.

      Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) will be facilitated through the use of a
      two-channel, research stimulator, with the patient in a semi recumbent position, using
      UltraStim electrodes. Two 5 cm x 5 cm electrodes will be placed over the soleus muscle for
      calf stimulation. The participant will be allowed to ramp up the stimulus level themselves to
      get used to the sensation and determine their maximum tolerated stimulus level.

      A goniometer will be used to assess mobility at the knee and ankle joints. Transcutaneous

      The level of oedema will be measured using the figure of eight measurement, tape
      circumference measurement and water displacement measurement.

      Comfort will also be assessed by use of a 100mm non-hatched visual analogue scale (VAS). Each
      participant will be asked to indicate their level of comfort following the application of
      NMES. VAS pain scores of 30 mm or less will be categorised as mild pain, between 31 and 69 mm
      as moderate pain, and scores of 70 mm or greater as severe pain.

    <description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is to be applied using a custom-built, two-channel stimulator, Bioelectronics Research Cluster, National University of Ireland, Galway) with a frequency of 36 Hz, a balanced biphasic waveform with a pulse width of 350μs, a ramp up time of 500ms, a contraction time of 1s and a ramp down time of 500ms. Stimulation is to be applied every 20 seconds over a period of 90 minutes. Its affect on oedema reduction, joint mobility and skin oxygenation will be assessed both before and after its application.</description>
