      Objective: To evaluate the effects of technical-Breath Stacking (BS) and incentive spirometry
      (IS) on the volume of the chest immediately after and within thirty minutes after the
      techniques in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: This is a study of cross-over.
      The study investigated 14 patients with mild to moderate PD. The subjects performed the
      technique Breath-Stacking, incentive spirometry volume and participated in a phase control
      according to randomization. The volunteers were evaluated by opto-electronic plethysmography
      in four stages: before, immediately after fifteen and thirty minutes after the completion of
      the techniques. The investigators used a repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test for
      parametric variables, and the Friedman test with post-hoc Dunns for nonparametric variables.
      The level of significance was set at 5%, p &lt;0.05.

    <description>We used a silicone face mask, connected to a unidirectional valve which allowed only inspiration and is connected to a spirometer showed that the volume inspired by the individual. The face mask was attached to the appraised performed successive breaths until the researcher realized the lack of volume of air being inhaled and this time it was allowed to expire (Baker et al., 1990; Feitosa et al., 2012).</description>
