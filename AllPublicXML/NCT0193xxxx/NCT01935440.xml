      The primary objective of this funded research is to conduct an HIV prevention intervention to
      train HIV seropositive drug users to be peer health educators to: (1) recruit their high risk
      social network members for voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT) at the research clinic,
      (2) promote risk reduction among social network members, and (3) promote engagement in HIV
      care by encouraging HIV seropositive network members to schedule and keep HIV primary care
      appointments. There will be four types of participants in the Full Trial: 1) Index, 2)
      Testing Network 3) Longitudinal Network and 4) HIV positive network participants. This
      longitudinal study includes baseline, 6-months, and 12-month assessments
