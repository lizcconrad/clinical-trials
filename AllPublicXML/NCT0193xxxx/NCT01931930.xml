    <measure>daily gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>was assessed daily during 4 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The following gastrointestinal were rated and reported by the study participants on a daily based. Bloating, rumbling, feeling of fullness, passage of gas, abdominal discomfort (pain and cramps). The rating was done based on a number scale. 0 not at all and 4 extremely.</description>

    <measure>validated questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at visit 1 (before) and at visit 2 (after 4 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Three validated questionnaires were used. Two of them were specially designed to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life of people with constipation. The third questionnaire was a validated questionnaire to report stress levels and related changes of stress levels.
Patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC SYM)
Patents assessment of constipation quality of life (PAC QOL)

    <measure>stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>reported at days with stool during 4 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The stool consistency was rated referring to the Bristol stool scale. A scale indicated with pictures how the stool consistency can be rated.</description>

    <time_frame>assessed at visit 1 (before) and at visit 2 (after 4 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events which might be linked to the study product were reported. As the tested study product is a food product being safe for consumption as food no specific parameter to define safety were defined.</description>
