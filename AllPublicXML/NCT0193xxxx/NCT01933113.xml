  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a continuation of the clinical pilot study of lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe obesity. Patients who met the enrollment criteria
      underwent stereotactic placement of bilateral hypothalamic chronic stimulating electrodes.
      The current trial will continue to monitor these subjects as well as objectively measure
      metabolic rate (including energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, oxygen consumption, and
      carbon dioxide production).

    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol to continue to monitor effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on
      the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) on the metabolic rate in the treatment of chronic
      refractory obesity. Three subjects have been previously implanted in an IDE study at West
      Virginia University. The subjects continue to be monitored and data is gathered on weight
      loss, metabolism and any other effects or side effects over time.

      The subjects will be seen as often as every month but no less than every three months at the
      outpatient clinic. They will be weighed and asked about changes in their overall health.
      Their stimulators will be interrogated for use and battery status. All device related adverse
      events will be captured as well as any non-device related serious adverse events.

      In addition, each subject will utilize the metabolic chambers and Deltatrac II Metabolic
      Carts (SensorMedics Corporation, Anaheim, California or Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) at
      Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC), in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to objectively
      measure the correlation of their metabolic rate to various novel settings on the DBS for a
      one week period.

      The schedule for the metabolic testing will include: Day 0 baseline overnight chamber with no
      stimulation. Days 1-4 Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be performed hourly with variable LHS
      DBS settings. The settings will be changed approximately every 15 minutes after the DBS
      settings are changed. Day 4 overnight chamber at ideal metabolic rate setting. After RMR test
      on Day 4, the subject will have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan performed to
      assess body composition.
