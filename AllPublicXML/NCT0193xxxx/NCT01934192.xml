  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, parallel group, placebo-controlled and active-compared, randomized
      study to assess the ability of GSK962040 to enhance the delivery of enteral feed to
      critically ill subjects that are predisposed to developing feeding intolerance (e.g.,
      percentage of goal volume); enhance gastric emptying in this population; and provide
      preliminary evidence of the drug's effect on outcomes of therapy (length of stay in the
      Intensive Care Unit [ICU], time on ventilator, ICU acquired infections, and 60-day
      mortality). Other aims are evaluation of GSK962040 safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      upon repeat dosing in a critically ill population.

      After meeting eligibility criteria, male and female subjects will be randomized to either
      receive GSK962040 (50 milligram [mg]) once daily (OD) via naso-gastric (NG) or orogastric
      (OG) feeding tube (oral solution), or placebo by the same route. If subjects develop
      intolerance to enteral feeding at any point up to Dose 5 of study medication (inclusive),
      study treatments will switch such that those originally receiving GSK962040 will receive
      metoclopramide (10 mg, intravenous [iv], every 6 hours) and those subjects originally
      randomized to receive placebo will receive GSK962040 (50 mg, via NG, OD). Additionally, if
      subjects develop intolerance prior to any treatment, they will be randomized to receive
      either GSK962040 (50 mg, via NG, OD) or metoclopramide (10 mg, iv, every 6 hours).

      The study will consist of a screening/baseline assessment, a treatment period (up to 7 days
      in duration), and a 4-day post treatment safety follow-up assessment. The duration of each
      subject's participation in the study from screening to follow-up safety assessment will be up
      to approximately 2 weeks. In addition, mortality will be assessed 60 days after admission to
      the ICU.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &amp; Gender: Male or female between 18 and 85 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             obtaining the informed consent.

          -  First admitted to participating ICU within the previous 48 hours.

          -  Intubated and invasively mechanically ventilated

          -  Indicated to receive early EN or are already receiving EN (subject must be on EN prior
             to receiving study treatment)

          -  Have at least one of the following

          -  Clinical evidence of cardiovascular dysfunction defined as the need for vasopressor
             agents (e.g. norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin), &gt;5 microgram/kg/min of
             dopamine, or &gt;/= 50 microgram/min phenylephrine) for greater than or equal to 2 hours;

          -  Poly-trauma with an injury severity score (ISS) &gt;=15 points

          -  Acute traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt;=12, prior to
             the initiation of sedation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are not expected to be in the ICU and alive for at least 48 hrs from
             point of screening.

          -  Subjects with acute hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis B or C) or severe chronic liver
             disease (e.g. Child Pugh class C cirrhosis) will be excluded

          -  Liver function tests: If Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;=8x upper limit of normal
             (ULN); OR If ALT &gt;5-8x ULN and bilirubin &gt;2&lt;=3 ULN or bilirubin &gt;3x ULN (Include only
             if bilirubin &lt;1.5xULN); OR If ALT &lt;=5xULN and Bilirubin &gt;3xULN (Include only if ALT
             &lt;=3xULN and Bilirubin &gt;2 &lt;=3xULN)

          -  Subjects who have received a gastric prokinetic agent in the previous 12 hours (e.g.,
             erythromycin, azithromycin, metoclopramide, domperidone).

          -  QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt;480 ms. QTcF is the recommended correction
             factor for all sites. If QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF) is not possible to obtain or calculate, QT duration corrected for heart rate by
             Bazett's formula (QTcB) or machine or manual over read, may be obtained after
             consultation with the medical monitor. The QT correction formula used to determine
             inclusion and discontinuation should be the same throughout the study.

          -  Use of strong Cyp3A4 inhibitors

          -  Subjects who require renal replacement therapy or with an estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;30 mL/min byCockroft-Gault calculation).

          -  Subjects who have a history of or who have undergone major esophageal or gastric
             surgery on this admission (major lower abdominal surgery will not result in exclusion
             unless this carries a contraindication to enteral feeding).

          -  Subjects with an absolute contraindication to enteral nutrition e.g. subjects with
             ongoing bowel obstruction or perforation.

          -  Subject has a gastric pacemaker

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in other interventional study involving a novel (i.e.unapproved
             or experimental) chemical or biopharmaceutical entity.

          -  Previous randomization in this study

          -  Subjects for whom the reason for admission to ICU was an overdose (deliberate or
             accidental; medicinal product or not).

          -  Exclusion to re-randomization:

          -  Subjects with an untreated pheochromocytoma.

          -  Subjects with a past history of a seizure disorder (e.g., epilepsy) and is currently
             receiving anti-epileptic treatment for their seizure disorder, ongoing refractory, or
             sustained seizure disorder (prophylactic use for head injury/isolated new seizure
             maintained on anti-seizure meds in ICU acceptable).

          -  Subjects taking drugs likely to cause extrapyramidal reactions.

It is calculated as 100 multiplied by total volume received via EN during the on treatment period prior to intolerance divided by total prescribed volume. 'Prior to intolerance' means 'prior to start of intolerance treatment. One participant was missing for prior to start of intolerance treatment. The average percentage goal volume received via EN was assessed and comparison between Camicinal 50mg and placebo arm was performed. Adjusted mean and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model was used for analysis.</description>

          <description>The average percentage goal calories received via EN was defined as the percent of goal calories received via EN from the first study dose up to permanent discontinuation of EN. It is calculated as 100 multiplied by total calories received via EN during the on treatment period prior to intolerance divided by total prescribed calories. 'Prior to intolerance' means 'prior to start of intolerance treatment. The average percentage goal calories received via EN was assessed and comparison between Camicinal 50mg and placebo arm was performed. Adjusted mean and its 95% CI were estimated and ANCOVA model was used for analysis.</description>

Three ECGs approximately 5 min apart were collected prior to dose 1and single recordings were made at other time points. On Day 1ECGs were collected at pre-dose (up to 6 hrs) and 2 hr post treatment. Number of participants with maximum increase from Baseline were collected and participants showed increase in 3 parameters namely QTc, QTcB and QTcF. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate change from Baseline in albumin and total protein values at Baseline, Day 2-7 and follow-up (till Day 23). Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate change from Baseline in alk.phosp., ALT, AST and GGT values at Baseline, Day 1- Day 7 and follow up (till Day 23). Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate change from Baseline in calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, potassium, sodium, BUN values at Baseline, up to Day 7 and follow up (till Day 23). Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate change from Baseline in MCH values at Baseline up to Day 7 and follow up (till Day 23). Blood samples were also collected on Day 9 for those participants who completed 7 days of dosing. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. For participants who developed intolerance, blood samples were taken for Day 1 to Day 7 up to 6 hrs prior to dosing. NA indicates that data were not available. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). If n &lt; 3 the SD was set to missing.</description>

        <title>Log Transformed Concentration at 60 Minutes (Min) (C60) and Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Acetaminophen (Prior to Intolerance)</title>
        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were collected at Baseline, and at Day 2 or at Day 3 (OR very rarely Day 4 – only if Day 2 or Day 3 sample could not be obtained) prior to intolerance. Prior to intolerance was defined as prior to development of intolerance. C60 was defined as observed plasma concentration at 60 min after administration of enteral feed with acetaminophen and Cmax was defined as maximum observed plasma concentration of acetaminophen. The absorption profile of acetaminophen was used as an indirect measure of gastric emptying function. The analysis was performed on ITT (exposed) Population. Due to change in sampling schedule, samples were only obtained to 4 hours. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n= x in the category titles).</description>

          <description>Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at Baseline and at Day 2 or Day 3 (or very rarely at Day 4 – only if Day 2 or Day 3 sample could not be obtained)prior to intolerance. Prior to intolerance was defined as prior to development of intolerance. C60 was defined as observed plasma concentration at 60 min after administration of enteral feed with 3-OMG. The absorption profile of 3-OMG was used as an indirect measure of gastric emptying function. The analysis was performed on ITT (exposed) Population. Cmax was not analyzed. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>
