    <textblock>
      The elderly population has increased significantly in the last years. The number of falls has
      also increased due to the decrease of balance. The Kinesio Taping (KT) is a method with the
      aim to improve muscle physiology, proprioception, coordination and balance. The aim of the
      study was to investigate the effect of KT on postural balance in the elderly. We evaluated 62
      elderly with a mean age of 67.98±5.321, female, submitted to the protocol for the application
      of KT in gastrocnemius muscles of the midfoot and a placebo tape (3M Micropore) in the
      control group. The application of the tapes was bilateral. Half of the participants (n=31)
      received KT in the lower limbs, while the control group (n=31) was applied placebo tape. To
      analysis of posture and balance, we used a force plate to record stabilometric signals. Both
      groups were evaluated post-application and 48 hours after application of the tape. The
      variables used were total displacement in centimeters (cm), amplitude AP (anterior-posterior)
      and ML (medial-lateral) in centimeters, area (cm²) and speed AP and ML in centimeters for
      seconds. The experimental protocol was performed in standing posture and the subjects were
      instructed to stand with feet apart, eyes open to look at the fixed point 1.5 m from force
      plate in a horizontal direction. It was requested that the elderly maintain the position for
      a time of 40 seconds to collect data The data were collected immediately post application of
      tapes and after 48 hours. The data was tabulated, descriptive statistics were calculated.
      Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (Prism, Chicago,
      IL). The Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used to verify the data distribution. Differences
      between the means were evaluated using the Student T test for the normally distributed data,
      and using the Mann-Whitney test for the data not normally distributed. Significance levels
      were set at p&lt;0.05.

      The Kinesio Taping Group (KTG) was composed of 31 participants that received the application
      of KT (K-Taping®) on the gastrocnemius muscle and the muscles of the midfoot. The placebo
      tape group (PTG) was composed of 31 participants that received the application of a placebo
      tape (3M Micropore®) on the same muscles of both limbs. The order of application of KT tape
      and placebo was conducted randomly among the elderly. Before the tape applying the site was
      cleaned with 70% ethanol for better fixation of the tape and for both groups were determined
      the application technique in &quot;I&quot; shaped. This technique consist in placing two tapes that
      format. The first tape was placed along the length of the plantar aponeurosis fixed point in
      the middle third of the medial gastrocnemius muscle to the metatarsal phalangeal joint. The
      second tape was also applied in &quot;I&quot; shaped without fixed point was placed around the midfoot
      arch in the direction of tension lines to assist with the metatarsal arch support.
