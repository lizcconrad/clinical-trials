      By using a novel technique of extraesophageal saline injection (ESI),the esophagus is to be
      separate from the adjacent organs.The space between esophagus and adjacent organs can be
      detected by endoscopic ultrasonography enhanced with ESI.Therefore, ESI plus with EUS is to
      be differentiate between T3 and T4 stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The
      objective of this Phase Ⅰstudy is to confirm the safety and efficacy of ESI.

    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and China has
      the highest incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).According to the TNM
      staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (7th Edition, 2012), EC
      invades the esophageal adventitia at the T3 stage; invades the pleura, pericardium and
      diaphragm at the T4a stage; and involves adjacent vital organs (mainly the thoracic aorta,
      aortic arch, trachea, tracheal bifurcation, and spine) at the T4b stage.It is considered that
      T3- and T4a-stage tumors can be surgically resected, while tumors at the T4b stage are not
      suitable for surgical resection.Therefore, it is important for physicians and patients to
      know whether the tumor has metastasized to adjacent organs before considering resection. The
      preoperative stage is unclear in many cases of progressive disease and the involvement of
      vital organs is only discovered by exploratory thoracotomy, because of which the resection
      may need to be terminated prematurely, leading to unnecessary injuries.Therefore, accurate
      preoperative staging of EC, especially during the later stages, is important for deciding the
      appropriate therapeutic option and evaluation of the prognosis.

      The imaging methods used for preoperative staging of EC include endoscopic ultrasonography
      (EUS). However, EUS has poor accuracy in advanced ESCC, especially in T3 and T4 stage ESCC.
      Therefore, it is necessary to improve the preoperative accuracy of EUS for advanced EC.

      Since extraesophageal space contains loose connective tissue and saline can permeate into
      extraesophageal space and separate esophagus from adjacent organ; furthermore, saline serves
      as an EUS contrast agent (negative) and is detected by EUS.Therefore, we envisaged that if
      saline is directly injected into extraesophageal space, the separation between the esophageal
      adventitia and its adjacent organs (especially the thoracic aorta, arcus aortae, and tracheal
      bifurcation) can be observed by EUS. In our recent experiment in canine model, guided by
      EUS,extraesophageal saline injection was successfully conducted and saline separated
      esophageal adventitia from adjacent organs including thoracic aorta, arcus aortae, trachea
      and bronchial bifurcation without any complication.
