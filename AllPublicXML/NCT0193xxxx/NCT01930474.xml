  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of genetic alterations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the oncogene (eg. EGFR
      and ALK) is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancers. Therefore, the detection of altered genetic
      alterations is useful for predicting the treatment response for TKIs in non-small cell lung
      cancer patients. However, good quality tumor tissues are available only in &lt;50% of patients
      with inoperable lung cancer for mutation analysis. In this study, the investigators will
      detect and quantify the genetic alterations in plasma. the investigators will investigate if
      the serial measurement of cancer-derived genetic alterations in plasma can provide a means
      for monitoring disease progression, as well as treatment response. In addition the
      investigators will analysis the resistant mechanism of TKIs and chemotherapy with plasma
      tumor DNA.
