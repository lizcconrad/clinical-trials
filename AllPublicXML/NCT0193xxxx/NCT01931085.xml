  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triclabendazole is a benzimidazole compound used as a systemic antihelmintic in veterinary
      practice. Triclabendazole is considered to be a second-line drug for parasites and is used
      when other preferred agents cannot be used because they are ineffective or because adverse
      reactions limit their use. Although Triclabendazole is widely used in developing countries
      for the treatment of parasites it is not approved by the FDA for this treatment in the US. It
      is currently being distributed in the US through a special arrangement with the FDA and the
      manufacturer on an individual patient approval basis. This arrangement requires that a single
      patient Investigational New Drug (IND) be obtained from FDA for each patient requiring
      Triclabendazole. Upon approval by FDA, the manufacturer (Novartis) will ship the drug
      directly to the prescribing physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of parasites whose resistance pattern has indicated
             resistance to first line agents and sensitivity to Triclabendazole or in whom an
             additional drug needs to be added to their regimen because of inadequate response to
             existing therapy.

          -  Patients with a parasite that is sensitive to Triclabendazole and who have experienced
             an allergic or adverse reaction to other agents that prevent their use.

          -  Patients with parasitic disease that has responded to treatment with first line drugs
             but who experienced allergic or adverse reactions to these agents that has prevented
             their continued use or who have experienced a relapse in their disease that
             necessitates the addition, or substitution, of second-line agents

          -  Patients who do not qualify for a study using Triclabendazole or for whom a study does
             not exist and thus the patient would not otherwise have access to the drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone whose parasitic disease can be adequately treated by other available
             medications.

          -  Anyone who is allergic or who has had a severe adverse reaction to Triclabendazole in
             the past.
