  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized control trial evaluating the efficacy of two training
      programs in increasing physician identification, documentation, and motivation of overweight
      children. Pediatric primary care physicians will be recruited from the College of Physician
      and Surgeons of Ontario and randomized into two practice-based interventions
      (behavioural/educational) which are a one-time training attendance. The educational
      intervention will focus on the medical management of pediatric obesity, the use of Body Mass
      Index charts, and information about how obese children would like to be approached by their
      physicians. The behavioural intervention will incorporate Motivational Interviewing tools in
      addition to an abbreviated training program received by the educational intervention group.

      There are no prospective, randomized clinical studies on training physicians to effectively
      manage pediatric obesity using both Motivational Interviewing (MI) tools and advice from
      overweight children. A novel aspect of this study is that the skills taught during the
      trainings are made so that physician can easily incorporate them into their busy practice.
      The generated findings from focus groups with obese children, merged guidelines for the
      medical management of childhood obesity, and training in specific MI tools, also make this
      study unique. Primary Objective:

      To determine which of two interventions (behavioural/education) is most effective in
      increasing discussion initiation around weight with overweight children by calculating,
      plotting, and tracking BMI, and increasing self-reported efficacy in counseling overweight
      pediatric patients. HYPOTHESIS: The behaviour change intervention will be most effective
      because it will achieve greater changes in the above mentioned behaviours that are maintained
      for 6 to 12 months. These outcomes will be influenced by counselling efficacy, frequency, and
      type of reported barriers and not physician demographics.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate current physician practices of BMI calculating, plotting and/or tracking, and
      discussion initiation with overweight pediatric patients, and the factors that influence
      these behaviours. HYPOTHESIS: Physicians do not consistently calculate, plot, and/or track
      BMI and/or discuss weight with their pediatric patients. These practices will be primarily
      influenced by physicians' characteristics, counselling efficacy, frequency and type of
      reported barriers

    <description>Physicians will be asked to complete a self-efficacy questionnaire about their perception of their own abilities to initiate discussion with pediatric patients and/or their families about overweight, tendencies of frequency of BMI calculating, plotting, and tracking, identify obesity or overweight in their pediatric patients, as well as identify the type of barriers they have in preventing/treating obesity.</description>

    <description>Educational is modeled on the Theory of Planned Action, which proposes that unless people believe that their actions can have an effect on the desired outcome they have little incentive to act or persevere in the face of difficulties. Based on this theory we will be providing physicians with information on how to calculate, plot and track BMI and how this can be associated with identification of overweight children before they present with symptoms of obesity. This intervention will attempt to demonstrate that BMI calculating, plotting and tracking are useful diagnostic monitoring tools and that their actions may lead to more effective prevention and/or treatment.
The education intervention will not prescribe specific discussion initiation tools, although the participants will not be prevented from independently changing their communication behaviour.</description>

    <description>The behavioural intervention will incorporate specific Motivational Interviewing (MI) tools and information from a previously completed qualitative study with obese children (Obadia et al.). This study generated suggestions of how physicians can encourage children to think positively about making changes towards a healthier body weight. This intervention is designed to address physicians' lack of self-efficacy in communicating with children and their families about achieving a healthy body weight, and therefore would likely benefit from the input from children and the patient-centred theme of MI. It is based on the Trans-Theoretical Model and Stages of Change which postulates that people follow a step-wise progression towards change with specific constructs that need to be addressed before moving to the next step. These constructs are integral to the principles of MI</description>
