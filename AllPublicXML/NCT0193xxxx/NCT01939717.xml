    <textblock>
      Primary aim is to conduct a pilot trial to determine:

        1. The feasibility and efficiency of randomisation procedures and study design

        2. If recruitment rates are sufficient to adequately power a larger trial

      The secondary aim is to determine the efficiency of set dancing in comparison to a control
      for people with Patkinson's disease.

    <description>The exit questionnaire will assess participants' satisfaction with the dance intervention at the end of the study. The questionnaire asks participants if they have noted improvements in different aspects of physical well-being, and allows feedback relating to the structure, material and enjoyment of the dance classes to be gathered. This questionnaire has previously been used in other studies investigating the benefit of dance for those with Parkinson's disease (Hackney and Earhart 2009; Hackney and Earhart 2010).</description>

    <description>Participants will attend ten weeks of set dancing classes. Each class will be one and half hours. Family members will be invited to partner each participant with Parkinson's disease during the class. Set dancing steps and sets will be thought and progressed in line with the participants abilities. Frequent rests will be taken during the classes.
Participants will be given a home exercise programme which will involve chair based exercises, mental rehearsal, listening music, watching a dance DVD and practicing dance material thought in class.</description>
