      The goal of this study is to create new retinal imaging processing software useful for the
      development of novel retinal biomarkers of cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Result of the standard neuropsychological assessment

          2. Are men or postmenopausal women, at least 55 years of age. Postmenopausal women are
             defined as women who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; or who
             have been amenorrheic for at least 2 years;

          3. Fluency in English

          4. Participants in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/prodromal and mild-to-moderate
             dementia groups must assign a surrogate for purposes of informed consent and help with
             protocol compliance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected diagnosis of non-AD, associated dementia;

          2. Major ophthalmologic comorbidities: Ruptured globe, retinal vascular occlusive
             disease, retinal artery occlusion, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, media
             opacification due to corneal abnormalities or cataract that prevent ocular and OCT
             examination, glaucoma, wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration, history of
             intravitreal injections, and macular edema. If two eyes satisfy the inclusion
             criteria, both eyes will be included in the study.
