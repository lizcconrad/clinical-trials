      This study compared the bioavailability of two formulations 100 mg (one capsule or other
      respectively) of each one of the products, of Minocycline, under fasting conditions, in
      healthy Mexican volunteers of both sexes. The single dose study under fasting (10 hours prior
      to study) conditions, cross, with two treatments, two periods, two sequences (2x2) randomized
      sequence, balanced, and with a washout period of at least 7 days between each dose, in 24
      healthy volunteers.
