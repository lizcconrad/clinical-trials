      Brief Description:

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Selatinib Ditosilate
      Tablets, and explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity in patients
      with advanced breast cancer.

      1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Selatinib Ditosilate Tablets, and
           explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of single and multi oral Selatinib Ditosilate
           Tablets .

        3. To determine preliminary dose and regimen for phase II study of oral Selatinib
           Ditosilate Tablets.

        4. To assess preliminary antitumor activity .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women aged 18-65.

          -  Patients with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Expected life-expectancy of more than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer. Either the
             primary breast tumor or the metastasis must overexpress HER2; acceptable methods of
             measurement of HER2 expression include immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in
             situ hybridization (FISH); tumors tested by IHC must be 3+ positive for HER2
             overexpression immunohistochemistry ; tumors tested by FISH must be positive.

          -  Prior Herceptin therapy is discontinued because of disease progression or patients can
             not afford for Herceptin therapy.

          -  patients with at least one measurable lesion (RECIST1.1 criteria).

          -  Hematology： WBC≥3.5×109/L, ANC≥1.5×109/L, PLT≥100×109/L，HB≥90g/L;

          -  Biochemistry： Serum bilirubin≤1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN),AST and ALT ≤1.5
             times ULN; creatinine and urea nitrogen≤1.5 times ULN; LVEF≥50%, ECG normal, and
             Fridericia corrected QT(QTcF)＜470ms.

          -  patients receiving damage caused by other therapeutic has been restored, the interval
             more than six weeks since the last receiving nitroso or mitomycin; more than 4 weeks
             since last receiving radiotherapy, other cytotoxic drugs or surgery.

          -  Female subjects should agree to take contraceptives during the study and within 6
             months after the study (such as intrauterine device [IUD], contraceptive drugs or
             condoms); within 7 days before they enter the study, their serum or human chorionic
             gonadotropin should be negative, and must be in the non-lactation period.

             arrhythmia，Myocardial infarction, Heart failure, LVEF&lt;45%, other heart diseases that
             are not suitable for participating in the study judged by investigator.

          -  Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions
             （including hypertension, severe diabetes, thyroid disease, etc.) that could cause
             unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with study requirements are
