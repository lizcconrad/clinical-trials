        <title>Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>IPSS Total Score is the sum of Questions 1 through 7 of the IPSS questionnaire. Each question was scored from 0 (none/no symptoms) to 5 (frequent symptoms) for an IPSS Total Score ranging from 0 to 35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, prior alpha-blocker therapy, baseline Erectile dysfunction (ED) severity (mild/moderate/severe),visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment.The centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country interactions was removed if p &gt;= 0.10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Yes Responses to Question 2 of the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) Questionnaire at Week 12</title>
        <description>Participant-assessed diary assesses the mean change from baseline in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2, &quot;Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?&quot;. The SEP Q2 score was determined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2 out of all sexual attempts recorded during the time period. Change is defined as the percentage of “yes” responses at endpoint minus the percentage of “yes” responses at baseline. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model includes terms for treatment, country/region, baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe), centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), the centered baseline-by-treatment and the treatment-by-country/region interactions.

        <title>Change From Baseline in IPSS at Week 12</title>
        <description>IPSS Total Score is the sum of Questions 1 through 7 of the IPSS questionnaire. Each question is scored from 0 (none/no symptoms) to 5 (frequent symptoms) for an IPSS Total Score ranging from 0 to 35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, prior alpha-blocker therapy, baseline Erectile dysfunction (ED) severity (mild/moderate/severe),visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment. The centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country interactions was removed if p &gt;= 0.10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IPSS Storage (Irritative) Subscore at Week 12</title>
        <description>IPSS Storage (Irritative) subscore is the sum of Questions 2, 4 and 7 of the IPSS questionnaire. Scores ranged from 0 (no irritative symptoms) to 5 (frequent irritative symptoms), with total subscore of the 3 questions for irritative subscore ranging from 0 to 15; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, prior alpha-blocker therapy, baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IPSS Quality of Life (QoL) Index at Week 12</title>
        <description>IPSS QoL assess participant response to the following question:&quot;If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?&quot;. Response options are Delighted(0),Pleased(1);Mostly satisfied(2);mixed about equally satisfied and dissatisfied(3);Mostly dissatisfied(4);Unhappy(5);Terrible(6),with a total ranging from 0 to 6; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares(LS) mean of change from baseline(bl) to endpoint is from MMRM.The model includes effects for treatment,country/region, prior alpha-blocker therapy,baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe),visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered bl value (defined as the bl value for a participant -the overall bl mean value),placebo lead-in total IPSS change(change from Visit 2 at Visit 3),centered bl-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IIEF Overall Satisfaction (OS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>IIEF is a 15 item self-reported questionnaire used to assess overall erectile function and satisfaction during the past 4 weeks. IIEF-OS is the sum of Questions 13 and 14. Scores range from 1 (low/no satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction) for each question, with a total subscore ranging from 2 to 10;higher scores represent better erectile function. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, baseline LUTS severity (moderate/severe), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction,centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions. The centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country interactions was removed if p &gt;= 0.10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IIEF Orgasmic Function at Week 12</title>
        <description>IIEF is a 15 item self-reported questionnaire used to assess overall erectile function and satisfaction during the past 4 weeks. IIEF orgasmic function is the sum of Q9 and Q10 of the IIEF. Scores ranged from 0 (no stimulation) to 5 (almost always) for each question, with the total possible score for the 2 questions ranging from 0 to 10. Higher scores were indicative of better orgasmic function. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from MMRM. The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, baseline LUTS severity (moderate/severe), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions.

The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, baseline LUTS severity (moderate/severe), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions. The centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country interactions was removed if p &gt;= 0.10.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total IPSS at Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>IPSS Total Score is the sum of Questions 1 through 7 of the IPSS questionnaire. Each question is scored from 0 (none/no symptoms) to 5 (frequent symptoms) for an IPSS Total Score ranging from 0 to 35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, prior alpha-blocker therapy, baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe),visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in IIEF EF at Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>IIEF is a 15 item self-reported questionnaire used to assess overall erectile function and satisfaction during the past 4 weeks. IIEF- EF is the sum of Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF. Questions 1-5 were scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Question 15 was scored 1 (very low confidence) to 5 (very high confidence) with a total score ranging from 1 to 30. Higher scores represent better erectile function. LS mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from MMRM. The model includes effects for treatment, country/region, baseline LUTS severity (moderate/severe), visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), centered baseline-by-treatment and treatment-by-country/region interactions.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Yes Responses to Question 2 of the SEP Questionnaire at Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>Participant-assessed diary assesses the mean change from baseline in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2, &quot;Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?&quot;. The SEP Q2 score is determined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2 out of all sexual attempts recorded during the time period. Change was defined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses at endpoint minus the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses at baseline. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model includes terms for treatment, country/region, baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe), centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), the centered baseline-by-treatment and the treatment-by-country/region interactions.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Yes Responses to Question 3 of the SEP Questionnaire at Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>Participant-assessed diary assesses the mean change from baseline in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q3, &quot;Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?&quot;. The SEP Q3 score is determined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q3 out of all sexual attempts recorded during the time period. Change was defined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses at endpoint minus percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses at baseline. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model includes terms for treatment, country/region, baseline ED severity (mild/moderate/severe), centered baseline value (defined as the baseline value for a participant - the overall baseline mean value), placebo lead-in total IPSS change (change from Visit 2 at Visit 3), the centered baseline-by-treatment and the treatment-by-country/region interactions. The interaction terms are removed if p &gt;= 0.10.</description>
