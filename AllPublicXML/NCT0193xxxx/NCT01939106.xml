      This is a pre market study to assess safety and performance of a one piece drainable pouch.
      Twelve subjects will be recruited and will use the study pouch for 10 days. During this time
      data on skin and stoma condition will be collected along with questions related to ease of
      use comfort and overall pouch performance. The study will be conducted in the US in one
      single site.
