  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to examine whether operating room (OR) efficiency will be
      improved by significantly decreasing non operative time. This study also aims: 1) to evaluate
      whether a decrease in non-operative time will result in increased surgeon and staff
      satisfaction, 2) to determine whether there is an increase in the complication rate during
      the redesigned process perioperatively and until discharge from the post anesthesia care
      unit, and 3) to rate patient satisfaction.

      The study aims to examine whether operating room efficiency will be improved by decreasing
      non operative time while ensuring patient safety.

      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups:

      In group A (new process): patients will be inducted in the induction room. At the end of
      surgery and after placement of the surgical dressing, the registered nurse will call in the
      house keeper to start cleaning of the OR (parallel processing) before the patient exits the
      room. The patient will be reversed with sugammadex 4mg/kg IV, and then extubated before being
      moved out of the OR. In group B (the current practice at AUBMC), patients will be treated as
      follows: patients will be induced in the operating room and at the end of surgery will be
      reversed with neostigmine 50µg/kg and glycopyrrolate 10µg/kg. Once extubated and rolled out
      of the room, the house keeper team will start cleaning the operating room. Induction time
      (IT), emergence time (ET), and turn over time (TOT) will be recorded for both groups.

      We expect to show that OR efficiency will be improved by significantly decreasing non
      operative time while ensuring patient safety.
