    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the blood profile of the N-methylnicotinamide
      (MNA) following administration of TRIA-662 (N-methylnicotinamide Chloride). The secondary
      objectives of the study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of TRIA-662 and to
      assess any potential gender-related differences in the plasma profile of MNA. Changes in
      serum lipid parameters with particular reference to triglycerides, lipoprotein lipase, and
      blood pressure effects will also be noted.

      A total of 20 subjects volunteers (10 male and 10 female) will receive the following
      treatments administered in a randomized fashion with 2 embedded placebo dosages in each group
      (8 active Males and 8 active females with 2 placebo males and females):

        1. DRUG (Low Dose): Single therapeutic dose of MNA administered as a 90 mg oral dose

        2. DRUG (High Dose): Single therapeutic dose of MNA administered as a 270 mg oral dose

        3. PLACEBO: Placebo for MNA administered as an identically appearing oral dose Each
           treatment period will consist of a 3-day two-night confinement cycle with admission on
           day 1, treatment on day 1 with a single dose of active or placebo with discharge 24
           hours following the last assessment the next morning. A washout period of 5 days will
           separate each treatment period. Standard biochemical and clinical baseline medical
           background and physical examination will occur at screening and at Day -1 to
           assess/confirm entry criteria. During each treatment period, serial plasma samples
           (n=12) for MNA assay will be collected on the treatment day. Safety assessments,
           including vitals signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and oral body
           temperature), will be performed at screening, at baseline, and at 4 times throughout
           each treatment period. Physical examinations and standard clinical laboratory tests
           (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained at screening, and at
           admission for each treatment period, and prior to subject's final discharge from the
           study. The Lunch meals on the dosing day will be identical in each subject on each
           occasion.

      The pharmacokinetic and safety assessments will be performed at specified times prior to and
      after study MNA administration.
