      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and dosing of an intravenous (IV) infusion of clevidipine
      for blood pressure (BP) management in pediatric participants in the perioperative setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess, in a stepwise approach across 4 age cohorts from
      oldest to youngest (birth to &lt;age 18), the efficacy and safety of clevidipine exposure for a
      minimum of 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 96 hours in pediatric participants undergoing a
      surgical procedure with anesthesia for greater than or equal to 1 hour and for whom
      parenteral intravenous antihypertensive therapy for the management of blood pressure is
      expected.

    <description>An initial clevidipine IV infusion dose for the adolescent cohort has been specified per protocol. The initial dose for each of the subsequent age cohorts will be modified if necessary, based on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
Following the initial dose, clevidipine will be up-titrated every 1.5 minutes, according to participant need, to achieve a systolic blood pressure (SBP) within the pre-specified SBP target range. Doses may be increased by less than doubling, and the time between dose adjustments may be lengthened, as the target blood pressure is approached. The infusion rate may be maintained for up to 96 hours, once the participant's SBP is within the target range, and titrated as necessary to maintain blood pressure within the range.</description>
