      This project is the pilot step necessary to develop a system of vaccination
      pharmacoepidemiology that associates a sophisticated analytical approach, appropriate for
      this challenge and case series analysis, with the use of linked medicoadministrative data for
      hospitalisations the reimbursement of healthcare costs. This linkage of medicoadministrative
      data is new in France. The example of the risk of hospitalisation for febrile convulsions in
      infants less than two years old following vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and
      pertussis is given as the reference association. This choice is justified by the numerous
      publications over many years on the existence of this association (Miller et al BMJ 1981,
      Farrington et al Lancet 1995). In addition, as case series analyses have been carried out to
      assess this risk, the results can be compared directly (Lancet 1995). The study to determine
      whether the analysis tools are suitable for the data will be tackled at the following levels:

        -  Validity of the selection of cases from administrative records alone using coding based
           on the international classification of diseases ICD10

        -  Validity of the risk assessment. This methodology feasibility project must make it
           possible to identify the different potential problems. This is a prerequisite necessary
           for the systematic implementation.
