      This trial will assess the incidence of new and/or undiagnosed diabetic macular edema (DME)
      in diabetic patients that undergo a DME screening exam. The screening exam will consist of
      medical history, Electronic ETDRS visual acuity assessment, SD-OCT and color fundus
      photography
