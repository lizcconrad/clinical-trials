    <textblock>
      This observational study will establish a clinical baseline and measure changes over time in
      movement, thinking, behavior, brain imaging, blood and spinal fluid markers in subjects with
      early stage Huntington's disease. Participants enrolled in this study may be eligible to
      participate in a future planned study of stem cell therapy for Huntington's Disease (HD).

      In-person study visits occur at screening, baseline, and every 6 months thereafter for a
      minimum of 12 months, with interim phone call assessments.

      In PRE-CELL the investigators propose to enroll a cohort of early-stage HD patients in a
      prospective observational study designed to characterize clinical, neuro-imaging, laboratory
      and biomarker correlates of disease progression over 12-18 months. Subjects who complete a
      minimum of 12 months' participation in this trial will be candidates for enrollment in the
      future planned Phase 1 trial of intrastriatal delivery of mesenchymal stem cell
      (MSC)/Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

        Subjects will be primarily recruited from the Huntington's disease clinic in the University
        of California, Davis (UC Davis) department of neurology. We also plan to recruit
        participants from among northern California regional support groups, from letters to
        neurologists and psychiatrists who are treating patients with HD, from listing our study on
        clinical trials.gov, and at regional and national HD meeting presentations, and via print
        and video recordings on our website.
