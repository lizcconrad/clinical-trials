    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of eye opening/closure on the quality of IOP (intraocular
      pressure) related patterns recorded with SENSIMED Triggerfish. Each subject receives 2
      24-hour recording sessions, one with the recorded eye open and the other with the eye
      closed,using an ophthalmic patch.

    <measure>The difference between start and end TF (SENSIMED Triggerfish) in a closed eye as compared to the difference between start to end TF in an open eye</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TF will be installed on subjects' eyes for 24 hours in two sessions. In one session the eye will remain open (except during sleep) while in the other session the eye will be closed using an ophthalmic patch throughout the 24 hours. For both sessions, the initial TF output value in millivolt equivalent will be subtracted from the final output value to yield the difference from start to end. The difference obtained in the session with closed eye will be divided by that of the session with open eye (ratio).</description>
