  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Children diagnosed with a lysosomal disease will exhibit developmental, adaptive,
      and behavioral strengths and difficulties depending upon 1) biomedical risk factors (i.e. the
      specific genetic disorder responsible for the illness); 2) available modifying interventions,
      whether medical or behavioral; and 3) social risks in the children's families, neighborhoods
      and communities. A valid and reliable telephone-based surveillance system can successfully
      collect the data required to elucidate these developmental, adaptive and behavioral strengths
      and difficulties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who have lysosomal disease experience declines in health status and central nervous
      system integrity which result in motor, communication, self-care, learning and behavioral
      challenges. Medical interventions such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation can improve the health and functioning of children with lysosomal
      disease. To date, however, there is no established system for evaluating the health status,
      developmental status, behavioral outcomes or functional outcomes of these preschool-aged
      children across time and differing settings. The primary objective of this study is to
      develop a valid and reliable telephone-based data-gathering system for obtaining health
      status data, developmental status data, behavioral outcomes data, and functional outcomes
      data which reflect skills of daily living including feeding, moving, communicating and
      responding to others.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the validity of several early-childhood
      standardized assessment tools as compared to the standard neuropsychological assessment
      battery specified by the Lysosomal Disease Network's 'Neurobehavioral Core.'

      The third objective of this study is to describe the impact of lysosomal disease upon the
      families of lysosomal disease-affected children.
