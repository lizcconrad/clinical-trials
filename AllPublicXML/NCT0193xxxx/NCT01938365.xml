      primary outcome: To explore the genetic susceptibility of diabetes in Chinese adolescent and
      youth.

      secondary outcomes:

        1. To classify diabetes by gene detection in Chinese adolescent and youth.

        2. To make the relationship between genotype and clinic phenotype in type 1 diabetes.

        3. To evaluate the effect of environmental factors (intestinal ecosystem)in the
           pathogenesis of diabetes.

      Phase 1: Baseline investigation Aims: To explore genetic susceptibility of diabetes in
      Chinese adolescent and youth.

      Subjects and Methods: 500 patients under diabetic conditions and sex,age-matched NGR Healthy
      control(2:1) will be enrolled ,all aged from 14-30 years old. A comprehensive examination
      including questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, biochemical analysis will be performed
      in each study participant. Diabetes should be diagnosed according to the WHO 1999
      criteria,type 1 or type 2 diabetes diagnosed by clinical features recommended by
      International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes ( ISPAD ).

      Phase 2: Cohort follow-up Aims : To explore the association of genetic backgrounds and
      clinical characteristics in different types of diabetes in Chinese adolescent and youth.

      Subjects and Methods: To recruit and follow up 200 newly diagnosed and genotyped patients for
      3 years. Questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, biochemical analysis performed
      respectively at baseline,3,6,12,24,36 months after enrollment.
