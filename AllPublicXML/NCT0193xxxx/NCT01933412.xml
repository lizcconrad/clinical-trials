    <textblock>
      This is an open label clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis B Vaccine compared to Engerix-B Hepatitis B Vaccine in dialysis patients.
      The study hypothesis is that vaccination with Sci B Vac will achieve a higher seroprotection
      rate and a higher anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody serum titer level than vaccination with
      Engerix-B Dialysis patients will be categorized as &quot;naïve&quot; or &quot;previously vaccinated&quot; and
      each group will be randomized to treatment. Naïve patients randomized to Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis
      B vaccine will receive vaccination in three doses, 10 μg each, at 0, 1, and 6 months, or
      Engerix-B Hepatitis B vaccine given in four doses, 40 μg each, at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.
      Previously vaccinated patients randomized to Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis B vaccine will receive
      vaccination in three doses, 20 μg each, at 0, 1, and 6 months, or Engerix-B Hepatitis B
      vaccine given in four doses, 40 μg each, at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. All vaccines will be
      administered via intra-muscular injection to the deltoid muscle. The study will consist of
      three periods: a screening period of up to four weeks, a 24-week open-label treatment period,
      and a 24-week safety follow-up period. The total expected duration of the study per subject
      is 52 weeks as follows: Screening period: approximately 4 weeks; treatment period: 24 weeks;
      and follow up period: 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the by-vaccine difference in the
      proportion of subjects attaining seroprotective immune response (anti-Hepatitis B surface
      antibody ≥ 10 IU/mL) 4 weeks after the last vaccination with either Sci-B-Vac or Engerix-B.
      Secondary endpoints include anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody geometric mean concentrations
      calculated for all subjects upon last active dose; the proportion of subjects with
      anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody concentrations equal to or above 10 IU/mL for all subjects
      at 12 weeks following the first vaccine dose; the by-treatment difference in serum titer
      levels of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibodies at 12, 24 and 52 weeks following the first
      vaccination. A by-vaccine comparison of adverse events will also be performed.
