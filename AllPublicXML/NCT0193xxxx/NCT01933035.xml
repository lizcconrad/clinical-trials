    <textblock>
      To utilise extended platelet parameters in order to individuate Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
      from hypo-proliferative causes of thrombocytopenia.

      To develop the clinical potential of the extended platelet parameters as they pertain to
      distinguishing different causes of thrombocytopenia from one another.

      To test the hypothesis that mean platelet component (MPC) and mean platelet mass (MPM) might
      distinguish between thrombocytopenia related to bone marrow dysfunction and immune mediated
      destruction of platelets.

      Study subjects will have the following collected: Lavender tri-potassium EDTA tubes filled
      according to the manufacturer's specifications [approximately 4ML of venous blood], labeled,
      and promptly dispatched to the laboratory.The sample will be gently inverted several times
      prior to analysis on the ADVIA 120 taking care not to overly agitate the sample. Moreover,
      the specimen shall be inspected for clot formation prior to being assayed. The full blood
      count shall be obtained and in the configuration sub-menu the extended platelet parameter
      option shall be selected and thus actuated. A print out will be generated including the MPC,
      MPM, platelet component distribution width, platelet mass distribution width, and large
      platelet count in addition to the standard platelet count and mean platelet volume [MPV].

        The study population would consist of adult female and male subjects of all ethnic
        persuasions in good general health apart from thrombocytopenia, bone marrow aplasia,
        myelodysplasia, or active malignancy requiring therapy. Vulnerable strata of the hospital
        population will not be recruited into the study.
