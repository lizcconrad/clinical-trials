      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AD5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3
      in patients with localized prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2a clinical trial in subjects who are diagnosed with prostate cancer to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 in the treatment of localized prostate
      cancer.

      Subjects enrolled will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1/T2)
      having a Gleason score of 6 to 7 (3+4 or 4+3). Subjects will receive up to four (4)
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided IT treatments with Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 into the prostate
      approximately 6-weeks apart. Each treatment cycle will be performed using a minimum of three
      track injections through the prostrate using a total of 3 mL volume. Approximately 2 mL of
      the total volume will be injected into the most dense areas of cancer based on biopsy and MRI
      mapping (fusion biopsy) and 1 mL total volume will be injected into the opposite lobe of the
      prostate or other areas to ensure complete saturation of the prostate over multiple
      injections.

      Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are progressing at any time after the
      second injection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 may be discontinued and will be treated according to
      standard medical practice.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included:

          1. Male aged between 50 and 80 years (inclusive) with histologically documented
             clinically localized, adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          2. Subject with clinical stage T1 or T2 with Gleason score of 6 or 7 (3+4 or 4+3).

          3. At least one (1) MRI evaluable tumor with volume of 400 mm3 or greater.

          4. At least total of 10 mm of cancer tissue based on an MRI guided 12-core biopsy.
