  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a specific case management intervention for frequent
      users (FU) of Emergency Department (ED).

      Compared to infrequent or non-users, most of the ED-FU visitors are identified as vulnerable
      patients because they are more likely to be of low social and economical status, be more
      isolated and live alone. They report more chronic medical conditions, have a higher mortality
      rate and consume more healthcare resources.

      In the literature, interventions aimed at improving the management of ED-FU have demonstrated
      several positive outcomes, but there are still some knowledge gaps.

      The proposed project tests the hypotheses that case management intervention as compared with
      standard emergency care

        -  is a more efficient use of healthcare resources and reduces ED attendance,

        -  is cost-saving and

        -  improves quality of life,

        -  altogether leading to favorable cost-utility ratio.

    <description>Furnish specific assistance and to provide referrals for the patients:
If the social determinants are not adequate, the team will lend assistance for obtaining income entitlements, health insurance coverage if eligible, stable housing, schooling for children, etc.
If there are mental disturbances, the team will refer to mental health departments inside the hospital, and if necessary, to a psychiatrist, psychologist or general practitioner (GP) out in the community.
If the patient presents risk behaviors, the team will refer to substance abuse services and links to community services in order to maintain continuity of care.
In case of somatic problems, the team will find a new GP or make contact with the previous provider, contingent on the patient's consent.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to control group (usual care) will receive standard emergency care by physicians (resident or attending physician) and nurses, without the case manager been involved. Nevertheless, the mobile team will take contact with each patient of the control group, giving them short information through a flyer (flyer) which will underline the existence of the mobile team, its addresses and telephone numbers.</description>
