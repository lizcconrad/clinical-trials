    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to document immunogenicity and safety of VRVg in a pre-exposure
      regimen in healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of
           subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 international
           units (IU)/mL at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.

        -  To describe if at least 99% of subjects achieve an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D42 with a
           lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%, in the VRVg group.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when
           administered in a pre-exposure schedule.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 14 days after the last
           vaccination, i.e. at D42, and 6 months after the first vaccination

        -  To describe the geometric mean titer ratio between the two vaccine groups at D42, i.e.
           14 days after the last vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive a total of three vaccinations, one each at Day 0, Day 7, and Day
      28, respectively, and will be assessment for immune response to rabies vaccine before the
      first injection (baseline titer), at Day 42, and at Month 6.

      Safety will be assessed in all participants up to 28 days after each injection. Serious
      adverse events and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected up to 6
      months after the last injection.
