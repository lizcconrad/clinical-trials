    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to find biological markers (certain proteins or cellular markers
      found in a blood test) that will inform doctors which patients diagnosed with ANCA-associated
      vasculitis (AAV) are most likely to be able to stop their medications suppressing their
      immune systems and remain in remission.

    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are small vessel
      vasculitides that typically follow a chronic course and are associated with serious illness
      and death.Three clinical conditions are recognized: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA);
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's, GPA); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (EPA, formerly Churg Strauss Syndrome). Though these conditions have different
      clinical features, they can have overlapping immunological characteristics.

      The precise cause of AAV is not understood, but there are clear genetic associations which,
      in the context of predisposing environmental factors, such as infections, may lead to
      development of disease. There are no diagnostic criteria for AAV, but there are validated
      classification criteria and disease definitions.

      There is a need to find biological markers that define immunological tolerance so that
      immunotherapy medicines may be correctly changed and safely withdrawn in some people.

Subjects have blood samples and other assessments collected for analysis at Week 0 and Week 26.</description>

The subjects’ primary physicians have planned to discontinue immunosuppression medication in the next year after screening. Subjects have blood samples and other assessments collected for analysis at Week 0 and at 8 weeks after discontinuation of immunosuppression medication.</description>
