  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosage based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The objective of this project is to assess whether a dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      without a significant degradation in post-meal glucose control.

      Our primary hypothesis is that meal-announcement strategy (pre-meal CHO-independent bolus) is
      equivalent to meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy (full CHO-matching bolus) during
      closed-loop regulation of glucose levels in adults with T1D. Our secondary hypothesis is that
      closed-loop strategy with meal-announcement strategy (pre-meal CHO-independent bolus) or
      meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy (full CHO-matching bolus) is better than
      conventional pump treatment in regulation of glucose levels in adults with T1D.

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      Each patient will be admitted three times to a clinical research facility. In the
      meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement visit, patients will eat 3 meals accompanied with a
      matching insulin bolus (depending on the carbohydrate content of the meal) and glucose levels
      will be subsequently regulated using dual-hormone closed-loop system. In the
      meal-announcement visit, patients will eat the 3 same meals but will inject only a partial
      insulin bolus (not depending on carbohydrate content of the meal) and the remaining needed
      insulin will be delivered based on glucose sensor excursions as part of closed-loop
      operation. In the control visit, patients will use conventional pump therapy to regulate
      glucose levels.
