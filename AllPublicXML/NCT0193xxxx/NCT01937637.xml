  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with lung cancer experience debilitating breathlessness at some point during
      the course of their illness. Unfortunately, few interventions exist to treat this distressing
      symptom of cancer.

      In this study, the investigators plan on recruiting individuals with lung cancer to
      participate in a behavioral intervention to help relieve breathlessness. The principal
      investigator of the study, Dr. Joseph Greer, is a licensed clinical psychologist who has
      trained nurse practitioners in how to deliver the behavioral intervention. The nurse
      practitioners will meet with patients diagnosed with lung cancer during their outpatient
      oncology appointments, such as chemotherapy infusions, to review the behavioral skills that
      may help with breathlessness. Specifically, the intervention includes education about the
      relationship between breathlessness and the stress response as well as teaches patients
      skills for breathing control and relaxation of the body.

      For this single-group pilot study, the investigators will ask participants to provide
      feedback about whether they found the intervention acceptable and effective. Participants
      will also complete questionnaires about their physical and psychological symptoms before and
      after the intervention in order to measure its effectiveness for treating breathlessness and
      any distress related to breathlessness. The data from this study will help inform
      improvements to the intervention in order to make it feasible and effective for treating
      breathlessness in patients with lung cancer.

      The purpose of this single-group pilot study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of
      a cognitive-behavioral intervention for breathlessness in patients with lung cancer. Clinic
      staff and research assistants will recruit potential participants in the outpatient oncology
      department of the Massachusetts General Hospital. All participants will complete informed
      consent procedures prior to initiating the study. The Dana-Farber/Partners Institutional
      Review Board has approved the study methods.

      Before beginning the first intervention session, enrolled participants will complete
      questionnaires either on paper or online via a secure survey website. The questionnaire takes
      about 15 minutes to complete and asks about the experience of breathlessness, mood and
      anxiety symptoms, as well as general quality-of-life. Participants may refuse to answer any
      questions that they do not wish to answer.

      The study intervention involves two sessions with a nurse practitioner. Each session will
      take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

        -  The first session will be scheduled around another oncology appointment, such
           immediately before or after a clinic visit, or at the same time as a chemotherapy
           infusion. During this session, participants will learn about several breathing and
           relaxation exercises designed to relieve breathlessness. The nurse practitioner will
           also provide handouts with directions for these exercises, an audio recording of the
           relaxation techniques, and worksheets to encourage daily practice of these breathing and
           relaxation exercises at home.

        -  The second session, which will take place 1-4 weeks after the first session, may also be
           scheduled either before or after another oncology appointment. However, if this is not
           possible, the second session may be completed over the telephone. During this session,
           participants will meet with the same nurse practitioner to review the behavioral
           exercises and to address any difficulties the participants may have experienced in
           practicing the exercises.

      Within two weeks after the second intervention session, a research assistant will contact the
      participants either in person or over the telephone to complete the same questionnaires
      administered before the intervention. Participants may choose to complete the follow-up
      questionnaires on paper, over the telephone, or on a secure internet survey website. Also,
      within two weeks after the second intervention session, the research assistant will conduct a
      brief interview with the participants. Specifically, the research assistant will ask
      questions about participants' perceived satisfaction with the behavioral intervention and
      obtain feedback about how to improve the intervention. The interview will be audio-recorded
      and take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. These recordings and transcripts will only
      be identified with a study number and stored electronically in a computer file that is
      protected with a password only accessible to study staff. After completing the interview,
      participants will be finished with the study.

    <description>Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be determined via individual qualitative, exit interviews with participants. These interviews will assess the following: 1) satisfaction with the dyspnea intervention; 2) perceptions of potential problems with the approach, and 3) recommendations for improving the dyspnea intervention and delivery methods to enhance feasibility and acceptability.</description>

    <description>Baseline Dyspnea Index-Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI-TDI): For the primary outcome measure, we will also use the BDI-TDI to assess change in dyspnea from baseline to post-intervention. The scale is a valid and reliable interviewer-administered measure that consists of three sub-categories which each assess breathlessness on a 5-point grading system. We administer only the &quot;magnitude of task&quot; subscale, which assesses breathlessness based on the intensity of tasks that elicit shortness of breath.</description>

    <description>Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRCDS): For the primary outcome measure, we also will use the MMRCDS to assess change in dyspnea from baseline to post-intervention.

The nurse practitioner will also provide handouts with directions for these exercises, an audio-recording with the relaxation exercises, and worksheets for daily home practice. During the second session, participants will again meet with the nurse practitioner to review the study exercises and to address any difficulties participants may have experienced in practicing the skills.
All participants will complete questionnaires before and after the study intervention as well as a brief follow-up interview with the research assistant to obtain feedback about ways to improve the intervention to relieve breathlessness in patients with lung cancer.</description>
