      This study will evaluate the effects on emotions and neural activity of a one time dose of
      intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo in patients with FTD and healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Pick's disease cause changes in personality, behaviour, and
      emotional responses. The usual treatments for Frontotemporal dementia focus on reducing
      agitation and aggressive behaviours. However, these drugs do not help all patients who
      experience blunting of emotion and loss of empathy. This study will evaluate the effects on
      emotions and neural activity of a one time dose of intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo in
      patients with FTD and healthy controls.

    <description>Oxytocin can be given intravenously (with a needle) or intranasally (a spray into the nose). The intravenous form of drug is approved by Health Canada for use in pregnancy. The intranasal formulation is not currently approved for use by Health Canada, but is used in Europe to induce labour in pregnant women or aid lactation (breastfeeding). Participants will be randomized to receive 72 IU intranasal oxytocin on either study visit 2 or 3.</description>
