      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of repetitive TMS in reduction of
      depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. In a randomized, single blind clinical
      trials, 30 patients with bipolar disorder in Atieh Neuroscience center will be assigned to
      receive bilateral TMS and unilateral TMS, daily; for 20 sessions. The depressive and anxiety
      symptoms and quality of life will be assessed before the treatment (pre test) during the
      treatment (10th session), and after the treatment (post test). QEEG apply before and after
      rTMS in all subjects.
