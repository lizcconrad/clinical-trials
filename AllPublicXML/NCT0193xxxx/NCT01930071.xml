    <description>The PQ Bypass Guide Wire Delivery System is used to bypass lesions in the peripheral vasculature percutaneously. A guidewire is placed from the artery proximal to the lesion to the artery distal to the lesion using the vein as a conduit with the Guidewire Delivery System. Once in place, commercially available stent grafts will be placed to complete the bypass.</description>
