    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether topical application of a cromolyn sodium
      solution is able to decrease the facial redness seen in patients with papulopustular rosacea.
      Previous work in the lab of Dr. Di Nardo on mice has suggested that cromolyn may be able to
      have this effect. The study will enroll a total of 10 patients. 5 will randomly be assigned
      to receive the cromolyn sodium solution, and the other 5 will be randomly assigned to receive
      the placebo solution. All participants will be instructed to apply their assigned solution
      twice daily to their face. Patients will return to the clinic 3, 6, and 8 weeks after the
      distribution of the solutions to measure the efficacy of their assigned solution.

             treatment of concurrent medical condition (including oral contraceptive pills,
             vasodilators, adrenergic blocking agents) OR the investigator has determined that the

             study

          -  Subject has been treated with another investigational device or drug within 28 days

             with this study

          -  Subject has clinically significant findings, medical history or conditions (other than
             rosacea), which in the opinion of the Investigator may compromise the study, treatment
             protocol, or safety of the patient or treatment allocation.

        Subject has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to tape or other adhesive materials
