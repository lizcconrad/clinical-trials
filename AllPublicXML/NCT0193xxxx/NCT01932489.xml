  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the use of genomic tests for patient inclusion in clinical trials, it is essential
      for the Jules Bordet Institute (JBI) to pilot the logistical and technical aspects by
      examining the feasibility and turnaround time of performing and obtaining data from a few key
      molecular assays.

      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma will be
      enrolled. Biopsie from metastatic lesions will be performed. A targeted cancer gene screen
      assay will be performed using DNA sequencing.

      Results will be discussed during a molecular screening tumor board.
