      This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, 2-way cross-over study to investigate
      the effects of a single dose of inhaled AZD7624 on white blood cells and inflammatory markers
      in induced sputum and blood after oral inhalation of LPS as well as the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD7624 following a single inhaled dose.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male and/or female volunteers aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) with suitable
             veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture. (Healthy as determined by medical
             history and physical examination, laboratory parameters, and ECG performed before the
             first administration of the IP)

          2. Female volunteers must have a negative pregnancy test at Visit 1 and on admission (Day
             -1 of Visit 3 and Visit 5) to the study centre, must not be lactating and must be of
             non childbearing potential

          3. Be able to produce a minimum of 100 mg sputum (pellet weight) of good quality with
             total cell count (defined as total cell count &lt;14 x 106/g, eosinophils &lt;3%, sputum
             neutrophil % differential &lt;65%, &lt;30% squamous cell contamination and a minimum of 50%
             ce

          4. Have normoresponsive airways with a methacholine PC20 &gt;16 mg/mL. Screening
             methacholine provocation is not required if the volunteer has been tested by the
             centre in the past 1 year, with documented records of this testing

          5. Be able to inhale from SPIRA nebuliser

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate

          2. Any infection within the previous 4 weeks. Volunteers who get an infection between
             Visit 1 and admission to the centre can be rescreened

          3. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important
             allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator or reason to expect untoward
             reactions to LPS and/or AZD7624

          4. History of chronic respiratory disease

          5. Volunteers who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions -
