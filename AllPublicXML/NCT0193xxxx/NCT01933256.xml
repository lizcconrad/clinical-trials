  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIP2B is being developed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of
      HIP2B in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study will also assess whether islet
      β-cell number and function will increase over time in response to repeat HIP2B injections.

    <measure>The safety and tolerability of repeat doses of HIP2B in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events / vitals are monitored at each study visit between Days -9 and 84.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations will include clinical observation and adverse event (AE) reporting; evaluation of the injection site, physical examination, vital signs; electrocardiograms (ECGs), hematology, chemistry panels (inclusive of expanded markers of liver function), dipstick urinalysis (microscopic evaluation if dipstick positive), amylase, LDH.</description>

    <time_frame>IVGTT performed on Day -8 and Day 49. GGI performed on Day -1, Day 25 and Day 46.</time_frame>
    <description>First-phase insulin response will be assessed (a) as the incremental insulin peak (above baseline) after glucose injection during the IVGTT and (b) as the incremental insulin area obtained over 10 min; incremental area under the curve (AUC) during the GGI will be calculated for insulin and C-peptide.</description>

    <time_frame>GGI used for assessments is performed on Day -1, Day 25 and Day 46.</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in β-cell responsiveness.</measure>
    <time_frame>GGI measured on Day-1, Day 25 and Day 46.</time_frame>
