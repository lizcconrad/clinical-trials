      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) - methylphenidate treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to (1) determine the efficacy and dose-response of
      methylphenidate treatment of attention problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      and (2) provide a better understanding of the relationship of a prior history of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ADHD subtypes after TBI, executive function, and
      attentional control to treatment efficacy. The proposed clinical trial will enroll 50
      children, age 6-17 years, with attention problems &gt;6 months after moderate to severe TBI into
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design trial with 3 dose
      conditions (low, medium, and high).

    <description>The study medication will consist of identical capsules filled ConcertaÂ® over-encapsulated to preserve double-blinding. The weekly dosages will be low, medium, and high based on weight cut-offs. Participants weighing less than 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 27mg (medium), and 36mg (high) dosages and participants weighing above 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 36mg (medium), and 54mg (high) dosages during the 3-week upward titration trial. Weekly ratings monitoring behavioral and side effect symptoms score and the Pittsburgh Side Effects Rating Scale.</description>
