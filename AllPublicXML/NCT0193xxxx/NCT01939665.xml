  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method
      for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near
      vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are
      applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the
      cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of
      homeostasis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of percutaneous IRE in the treatment
      of patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Other objectives are
      feasibility and efficacy of IRE based upon symptomatic response and tumor response.

      Fourty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      (&lt;5cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and
      ultrasound guidance. After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and any (serious)
      adverse events are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT scanning, as well as
      serum CA19.9 tumor marker.

      We hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation and local tumor
      control, without causing severe complications.

    <description>Number of adverse events of IRE-treatment (within 12 months after treatment) are registered and analyzed according to the CTCAE version 4.0. Complications related to IRE are early complications during hospital admission (e.g. bile leak, bowel leak, infection, pancreatitis), or late complications of IRE such as bile duct stenosis that become apparent during follow-up in the year after treatment.</description>
