  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to evaluate ropivacaine blood concentrations during and after local
      anaesthetic (ropivacaine) infiltration - the Caledonian technique - for total knee
      replacement surgery. The investigators plan to measure these levels by testing blood samples
      taken over a timed period.

      This will allow us to confirm whether the current regimen of local anaesthetic use is within
      safe limits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anaesthetic (LA) toxicity may occur when the blood levels of a drug become particularly
      high. There is a need to confirm that the technique is safe to use. In addition, journal case
      reports may only describe serious side-effects of toxicity such as abnormal heart rhythms
      whilst more subtle clinical signs are rarely reported.

      The investigators would like to study whether or not toxic levels may be approached in some
      patients or whether more subtle toxicity symptoms and signs are missed. For example,
      irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure or confusion/agitation.

      Therefore, the investigators intend to study ropivacaine blood levels in patients receiving a
      total hip replacement in the Golden Jubilee National Hospital. A series of timed samples will
      be taken during the perioperative period. The anaesthesia and surgery will be performed as
      routine and no new treatment will be involved. Patient demographics, ropivacaine blood levels
      and clinical observations following LA administration will be collected.
