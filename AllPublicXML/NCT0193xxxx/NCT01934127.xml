    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different
      formulations of GSK Biologicals H7N1 influenza vaccine in subjects 21 to 64 years of age. The
      study will evaluate safety related events and antibody immune responses to different
      formulations of study vaccine and placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults who are 21 to 64 years of age (inclusive) at the time of first
             study vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and physical examination.

          -  Access to a consistent means of telephone contact, which may be either in the home or
             at the workplace, land line or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or other multiple-user
             device.

          -  For subjects who undergo a screening visit, results of all safety laboratory tests
             obtained at the screening visit must be within reference ranges. Results of any repeat
             testing cannot be used to qualify a subject for enrollment.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.
             Non-childbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy,
             ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if they

               -  have practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  agree to continue to practice adequate contraception until 2 months after the
                  last dose administered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or evidence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable,
             are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to
             provide accurate safety reports.

          -  Presence or evidence of substance abuse.

          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer within three years.

               1. Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for three
                  years or more are eligible.

               2. Persons with a history of histologically-confirmed basal cell carcinoma of the
                  skin successfully treated with local excision only are excepted and are eligible,
                  but other histologic types of skin cancer are exclusionary.

               3. Women who are disease-free three years or more after treatment for breast cancer
                  and receiving long-term prophylaxis are eligible.

          -  Diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness (unintended sleep episodes during the day
             present almost daily for at least one month), or narcolepsy.

          -  History of narcolepsy in subject's parent, sibling or child

          -  Presence of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥100.4ºF), or acute symptoms greater than &quot;mild&quot;
             severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination.

        NOTE: The subject may be vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, and
        all other eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             vaccine/placebo, or any other cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or immune-modifying drugs
             within 6 months of first study vaccine/ placebo dose. Topical, intra-articularly
             injected, or inhaled glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or imiquimod are
             allowed.

          -  Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of
             24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic
             antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose aspirin, and without a clinically-apparent
             bleeding tendency, are eligible.

          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or Guillain Barré Syndrome within 42 days of
             receipt of prior seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine.

             blood sampling at the Day 42 visit.

          -  Previous administration of any H7 vaccine or physician-confirmed H7 disease.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 90 days before the
             first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned administration of any of these
             products during the study period.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component
             used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine including a history of
             anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse
             reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.

          -  Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test
             result before the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.
