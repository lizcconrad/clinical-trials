    <textblock>
      Breast milk is best food for neonates and preterm infants. However many handling would be
      done if direct breastfeeding is not feasible, and it may result in nutrients change in human
      milk. We investigate the influence of storage in different containers and different thawing
      or heating methods on human milk nutrients.

    <description>we measure the changes of nutrients, including fat, protein, lactose, energy, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, leptin, and lysozyme in human milk after several processes, such as freezing, pasteurization, storage in different containers, thawing, and heat treatments.</description>
