    <description>The PK parameters were summarized descriptively by treatment as appropriate. Two (2) PK parameters specified in the protocol and SAP were not reported: AUClast was not reported since it was the same as AUC24 in this study, and apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was not reported since the log-linear terminal phase of the concentration-time profiles was not consistently well characterized in the 24-hour sampling period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma PF-04937319 Apparent Clearance (CL/F) on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, 1.5, 3, 5, 6.5, 8, 11, 12.5, and 14 hours on Days 0 and 14; and predose on Days 7 and 15.</time_frame>
    <description>The PK parameters were summarized descriptively by treatment as appropriate. Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
