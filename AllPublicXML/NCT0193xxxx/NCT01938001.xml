    <textblock>
      This double-blind randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      lenalidomide (Revlimid, CC-5013) in combination with rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either lenalidomide or placebo for twelve 28-day cycles in combination
      with rituximab. Anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indolent lymphoma is a slow growing but incurable lymphoma which includes follicular lymphoma
      and marginal zone lymphoma. Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal zone lymphoma are cancers of the
      B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (a drug
      that affects the immune system) which alters the body's immune system and it may also
      interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels involved in tumor growth. Therefore,
      lenalidomide may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide has also been
      shown to restore the immune cells' ability to attack and kill tumor cells, an ability that
      may be inhibited by follicular lymphoma and other lymphomas. The combination of rituximab and
      lenalidomide may eliminate the cancer while restoring the immune system's ability to attack
      tumor cells.

    <description>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
