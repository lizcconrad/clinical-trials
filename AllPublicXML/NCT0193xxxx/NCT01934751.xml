      Hypothesis: Patients who are addicted to opioids or alcohol will have reduced substance use,
      health care utilization if they have immediate and convenient access to pharmacotherapy and
      addiction counselling.

      Summary: This randomized trial will compare two different interventions for 124 alcohol and
      opioid-addicted patients admitted to either Women's Own Detox (WOD) at the University Health
      Network or the Withdrawal Management Service (WMS) at Saint Michael's Hospital (SMH. The
      Delayed Intervention group will receive a card with contact information for the St. Michael's
      Hospital and Women's College Hospital addiction medicine services. The Rapid Intervention
      group will be seen by an addiction physician from one of these services, within a day or two
      of their admission to the WOD or the SMH WMS. The addiction physician will prescribe
      buprenorphine or anti-alcohol medications, and the physician, nurse and/or therapist will
      provide ongoing counseling, follow-up and shared care with the family physician. Outcomes
      (measured at 6 and 12 months) include treatment retention, health care utilization and cost,
      medications prescribed, and alcohol and opioid use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a possible alcohol use disorder, as determined by a score of 8 or above on the AUDIT
             (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test); or, a possible opioid use disorder, as
             determined by positive responses on the eligibility form: within the past 30 days,
             opioid use has been a problem, and at least one harmful consequence of opioid use has
             been present, eg withdrawal symptoms, or problems with family, friends, work, money
             etc. If the addiction physician who assesses the patient at the first visit to the
             addiction service concludes that these screening tests were falsely positive and the
             patient does not have an alcohol or opioid use disorder, the physician will contact
             the RA to discharge the patient from the study.
