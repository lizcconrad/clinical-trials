      RATINALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is to study genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with HER-2 positive advanced solid tumors,such as breast cancer, gastric
      cancer, hepatic carcinoma, endometrial cancer and ovary cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with anti-HER-2 vector(referred to as CART-HER-2 cells).

      II.Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-HER-2 cells. RT-PCR(reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction)analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-HER-2 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR(T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I.For patients with detectable diseases, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-HER-2 cell
      infusions.

      II.Estimate relative trafficking of CART-HER-2 cells in tumor bed.

      III.Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-HER-2,
      and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-HER-2(loss of engraftment).

      IV.Determine the relative subsets of CART-HER-2 T cells (Tcm,Tem,and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive
      anti-HER-2-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced
      autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.

      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-HER-2 cells in peripheral blood.
