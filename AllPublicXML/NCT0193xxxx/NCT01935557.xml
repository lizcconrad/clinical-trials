      Optimal anticoagulation using heparin with close attention to maintain therapeutic dosing
      during the procedure is important.

      Randomized comparison of continuous and intermittent heparin infusion during catheter
      ablation of Atrial Fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous heparin was used during the procedure to prevent catheter-induced thrombosis.

      heparin is administered during the procedure to achieve recommended activation clotting times
      (ACT) values, typically &gt;300 seconds to prevent thromboemboli during the procedure.

      Most of the practitioners was that ACT level should be checked at 30- to 60-minute intervals
      and then have injected intermittently.

      intermittent heparin infusion, concentration is great changed because the heparin has
      30minutes half-period.

      researchers postulate that a constant therapeutic concentrations would be beneficial to
      continuous infusion than intermittent infusion.
