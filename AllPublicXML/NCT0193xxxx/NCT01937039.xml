      The Breast Cancer Program Longitudinal Repository (BCPLR) is being established to fulfill the
      research mission of the Breast Cancer Program at Johns Hopkins and to serve investigators
      affiliated with it - to develop a repository of specimens with corresponding characteristics
      from patients seen in the breast care and cancer clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to collect samples for future use that we may learn more about
      cancer by studying cells in blood and tissue collected from people with breast cancer as well
      as from volunteers without breast cancer. Our goal is to make these available for research to
      help to learn how cancer develops and how it may be treated.
