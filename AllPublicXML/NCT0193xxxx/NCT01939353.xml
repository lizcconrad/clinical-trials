  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 exploratory study being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      EB-1020 SR in treating adult male patients who meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for ADHD on
      the M.I.N.I.-Plus. Evaluations include determining an effectiveness signal for ADHD and
      related symptoms and exploring dosing, tolerability, onset of action, and duration of effect.
      Dose-response/tolerability relationships with EB-1020 SR will also be explored. The 1-week
      placebo lead-in also will be used for informal safety comparison purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, flexible-dosage, single-blind study consists of a Screening Phase (up to 28
      days [Visit 1]), a 5-week Treatment Phase (1 week of treatment with placebo [Baseline-1/Visit
      2 to Baseline-2/Visit 3] followed by 4 weeks of treatment with EB-1020 SR [Weeks 1 through
      4/Visits 4 through 7]), and a 2-week Discontinuation Phase, which starts at the time of Week
      4/Visit 7 and includes a Follow-up Visit (Week 6/Visit 7). Approximately 40 patients are
      planned to enter the treatment period. At Baseline-1, patients must have a score of greater
      than or equal to 28 on the ADHD-RS-IV to be eligible to continue participation in the study.
      At the end of single-blind placebo treatment (i.e., Baseline-2), the ADHD-RS-IV with adult
      prompts is re-administered. Patients who show an improvement greater than or equal to 30%
      over baseline values or who have a score of less than 28 on the ADHD-RS-IV are withdrawn from
      the study prior to receiving any active drug. Those who show less than 30% improvement from
      Baseline-1 to Baseline-2 scores will continue in the study. The consent form will be phrased
      such that patients are not informed of the exact timing of EB-1020 SR vs. placebo treatment
      in order to maintain the blinded nature of the placebo treatment and reduce potential placebo
      effects. Dosing will be flexible, with a target maximum dosage of 500 mg daily in divided
      doses (morning and afternoon, approximately 5 hours later) to be achieved if possible during
      Week 2 of EB-1020 SR treatment. The patient will take a starting dose of 100 mg of EB-1020 SR
      daily; the dose will be titrated in 100 mg increments up to the maximum dosage of 500 mg
      daily. The treating physician will escalate the dose to the maximum dose if patients have not
      achieved remission of ADHD in his/her judgment, and EB-1020 SR is still well tolerated. If in
      the physician's judgment the patient could not tolerate further dose escalation, or is not
      tolerating the current dose well, the dose may be maintained or reduced, with the goal of
      re-assessing dose and response at the subsequent visit for a possible increase in dose, until
      study completion.

    <time_frame>Baseline-2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>BRIEF-A is a validated 75-item questionnaire composed of three indexes (Global Executive Composite, Behavioral Recognition Index, and Metacognition Index). Items are rated 1 (never), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often). Raw scale scores are used to generate T-scores. A reduction in score indicates less impairment. Total scores range from 30 to 90, with broader composite indexes including the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) and the Metacognition Index (MI).

    <time_frame>Baseline-2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The WFIRS-S is a validated rating scale that is used to capture functional difficulties in the lives of individuals with ADHD. It investigates emotional or behavioral problems over the last month in the domains of family, work, school, life skills, self-concept, social problems, and risk-taking.

Any item rating of 2 or 3 is considered in the clinically impaired range. A total score is derived by summing all scores from every domain.</description>

             and Baseline-2.

          4. Patients must have a CGI-S (ADHD version) score of greater than or equal to 4.

          5. Patients must be male.

          6. Patients must be 18 to 55 years old, inclusive.

             other patient materials.

          8. Patients must be able to be reliably rated on the psychiatric scales required by the
             protocol based on investigator's judgment.

          9. Patients must be able to read and understand English.

         10. Patients must have a body mass index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 35 kg/m2. The BMI is

             Guidelines for this calculation will be provided to the investigational centers.

        Sex and Contraceptive Criteria

          1. Sexually active, fertile males must use effective birth control if their partners are
             women of childbearing potential. Adequate birth control methods for both males and
             females (as appropriate) are defined as those which result in a low failure rate
             (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants,
             injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, an IUD,
             double-barrier contraception, or true sexual abstinence. The form of birth control for
             the male and/or partner, where relevant, must be documented at screening and baseline.

          2. Women of childbearing potential (if a partner of a male participant) include any

             is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive
             months); or women on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented serum follicle
             stimulating hormone [FSH] level greater than 35 mIU/mL. Even women who are using oral
             contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or
             implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine
             device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or
             are practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be
             considered to be of childbearing potential.
