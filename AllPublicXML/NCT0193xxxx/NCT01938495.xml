  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to determine if DPS treatment for people with ALS and
      hypoventilation is associated with improved survival or diaphragm function.

      The primary objective of the study is to conduct a multi-center, randomized controlled
      clinical trial comparing standard of care (control) to diaphragm stimulator treatment with
      the NeuRx® Diaphragm Pacing System™ (DPS) with respect to survival.

      The secondary objective of the study is to conduct a multi-center, randomized controlled
      clinical trial to compare standard of care treatment (control) to DPS in ALS subjects with
      hypoventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled study to compare standard of care (control) to DPS
      (diaphragm stimulator named The NeuRx® Diaphragm Pacing System™). Although it remains
      uncertain if DPS is efficacious for the ALS subject, given the preliminary studies performed
      by the device manufacturer, it has received FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) approval
      as a humanitarian use device (HUD). This study will utilize a 2:1 randomization schedule such
      that eligible ALS subjects will have a 2/3 chance of receiving DPS and 1/3 chance of standard
      of care (control) treatment.

      The NeuRx® Diaphragm Pacing System™ (DPS) is a four channel, implanted percutaneous diaphragm
      muscle stimulation system. Under general anesthesia, the intramuscular electrodes are
      laparoscopically implanted in the diaphragm. The ends of the implanted electrodes are
      tunneled subcutaneously to an exit site on the chest or abdominal wall and connected to an
      external stimulator.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21 years or older.

          2. Sporadic or familial ALS diagnosed as definite, probable or possible ALS as defined by
             revised El Escorial criteria.

          3. Evidence of hypoventilation at Screening with at least one of the following:

               1. Maximal static inspiratory pressure (MIP) &lt;60 cm H20.

               2. Upright or supine forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;50% predicted for gender, age, and
                  height.

          4. A phrenic nerve potential should be recordable bilaterally.

          5. Subjects must not have taken riluzole for at least 30 days, or be on a stable dose of
             riluzole for at least 30 days, prior to randomization (riluzole-naïve subjects are
             permitted in the study).

             injected contraception or other hormonal (patch or contraceptive ring, for example)
             contraception), intrauterine device (IUD) in place for ≥ 3 months, barrier method in
             conjunction with spermicide, or another adequate method.

          1. Upright forced vital capacity (FVC) ≤ 45% of predicted for gender, age, and height.

          2. Any prior use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) outside of sleep (nighttime or naps).

          3. Any pulmonary or cardiac disorder or other medical disorder that would be a

          5. Known diaphragm abnormality such as hiatal hernia or para-esophageal hernia of
             abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity.

          6. Participation in another treatment research study for people with ALS.

          7. Exposure to any other agent currently under investigation for the treatment of people
