  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Colorado Longitudinal Eating And Physical activity (LEAP) Study utilizes a social
      ecological approach to explore individual, family and environmental factors and their
      relationship to child weight status over a 3 year timeframe. Our primary research questions
      are as follows:

        1. Are behavior changes (increased willingness to try new foods and gross motor skills)
           from a preschool nutrition and activity program, The Food Friends速, sustained through
           early elementary school?

        2. Do The Food Friends速 programs have an impact on reducing the percentage of children
           considered overweight and/or obese over a 3 year timeframe?

        3. Do food preference and gross motor performance directly affect child weight status or
           are they mediators to dietary intake and physical activity?

      The preschool years are a critical time to begin obesity prevention efforts as they represent
      a time when young children establish healthy eating habits and physical activity patterns.
      These habits can place children at risk for obesity and are shaped by many characteristics,
      including individual characteristics as well as school, family and societal environmental
      characteristics. Predictive behaviors, or behavioral antecedents, within these environments
      can influence child behaviors. While many predictive behaviors have been shown to influence
      dietary intake, physical activity, and weight status, two potential behavioral antecedents -
      food preference and motor performance - need further exploration. Understanding the context
      in which child behavioral patterns are developed is critical to developing a model to address
      childhood obesity.

      The Colorado LEAP project is a longitudinal cohort study utilizing a controlled
      quasi-experimental design in 5 rural Colorado communities. Two communities serve as
      intervention communities with the other 3 as matched controls. Intervention sites receive The
      Food Friends速 nutrition and physical activity programs in preschool and 'booster' programming
      in kindergarten and 1st grade. Assessments are administered 4 times - twice in preschool
      (Fall and Spring) and once in both kindergarten and 1st grade (Spring). Observational
      measures with children are conducted at the school; parent/home measures are sent home and
      returned to school via the child; and school personnel complete school environment and policy
      assessments.

    <description>The Food Friends is a research-based preschool program designed to address childhood obesity by establishing healthful eating and physical activity behaviors in preschool-aged children. The Food Friends: Fun With New Foods (12 weeks) focuses on helping children increasing children's willingness to try new foods and The Food Friends: Get Movin' With Mighty Moves (18 weeks) aims to enhance preschoolers' gross motor skill development. In effort to sustain the preschool behavior changes, the messages from The Food Friends速 (Super Taster and Mighty Mover) will be extended into early elementary school through a 'booster' program. The booster program will consist of a kindergarten and 1st grade curriculum with 5 monthly units.</description>
