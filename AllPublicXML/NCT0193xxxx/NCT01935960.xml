      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of retinoid 9cUAB30 in
      preventing cancer in healthy volunteers. The use of retinoid 9cUAB30 may keep cancer from
      forming in healthy volunteers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and recommended phase II dose of 9cUAB30 (retinoid 9cUAB30).

      II. To characterize the urine and plasma single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of
      9cUAB30 in normal volunteers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 with toxicity. II. To compare observed
      toxicity between placebo controls and each dose level. III. To assess for any change in
      single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) after repeat dosing (day 1 vs. day 36).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 8-36.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive a placebo PO QD on days 1 and 8-36.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days.

    <measure>Recommended phase II dose of retinoid 9cUAB30, based on maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose level with &lt; 25% of treated patients experiencing a grade 2 toxicity or any treated patients experiencing a grade 3 or higher toxicity</measure>

    <measure>Urine &amp; plasma single dose &amp; steady state PK of retinoid 9cUAB30, including maximum concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), area under curve (AUC)0-least quantifiable concentration (lqc), AUC0-infinity, half-life (TÂ½), and clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes; 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours on day 1; and 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>Basic pharmacokinetic and summary pharmacokinetic measures from the extensive plasma sampling on days 1 and 36, and levels obtained from single plasma and urine samples taken on days 8, 15, 22, and 29 will be summarized with basic statistics, including means, standard errors, medians, and interquartile ranges by dose, visit, and time point, as available.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in single dose pharmacokinetics, including Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-lqc, AUC0-infinity, T1/2, and CL</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 36</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetics of retinoid 9cUAB30 will be compared between day 1 and day 36 using one-sample t-tests, or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests as appropriate in order to evaluate the single vs. steady state levels. An appropriate regression model will be used to explore the relationship of dose with change in PK: logarithmic transformations will be used as necessary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicity, graded according to the CTCAE version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient toxicity will be summarized by the presence or absence of any toxicities, worst CTCAE grade, and strongest investigator defined relationship will all be examined and characterized by dose. Correlations between the different PK measures of retinoid 9cUAB30 and the different measures of toxicity will be estimated with polyserial correlation. To compare toxicities at each dose level to placebo, the Chi-square test will be used for the presence or absence of toxicities, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests will be used for CTCAE grade and investigator defined relationship data.</description>
