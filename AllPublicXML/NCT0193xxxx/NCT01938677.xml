  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on hearing loss, in patients with vestibular
      schwannoma (VS) and preserved hearing is still unclear. Retrospective data indicate that the
      hearing is preserved in most patient years after the gamma knife treatment. Recent
      prospective data suggests that radiosurgery could be a hearing preserving treatment for these
      patients.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate if GKRS can inhibit progression of hearing
      loss in patients with VS. Patients with preserved hearing will be offered to participate in
      the study and randomized ether to GKRS or initial conservative treatment for their vestibular
      schwannoma. They will then be followed with scheduled magnetic resonance image(MRI) and
      audiometry and evaluated after one, three and five years after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients newly (&lt;6 months) diagnosed with Vestibular schwannoma less than 20 mm in
             diameter.

          2. Vestibular schwannoma with or without evidence of growth.

          3. Patients between 18 and 80 years of age.

          4. Karnofsky performance score &gt;70

          5. Patients with vestibular schwannoma and preserved hearing according to Gardner
             Robertson class 1-2, and speech discrimination (SD) scores between 50-100% will
             participate in the hearing preservation part of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 will be excluded to achieve a homogenous
             study population.

             2. Patients who had other treatments prior to the GKRS (usually microsurgery (MS),
             GKRS or external beam radiation) for their tumour will also be excluded for the same
             reason.

             3. Patients who are not citizens in the country where they will be followed will be
             excluded, to reassure the same follow up within the study population.

             4. Hearing loss due injury or to active ear disease, such as MeniereÂ´s disease,
             otosclerosis or chronic otitis media.

             5. Patients with poor comprehension of the the language in the country where they are
             followed, such that adequate performance on speech tests, are unlikely.

             6. Claustrophobia, making MR follow up impossible without sedation. 7. Alcohol- or
             narcotic abuses that effect compliance to the follow up. 8. Uncontrolled neoplastic
             disease.
