    <textblock>
      Hepatic pseudoaneurysm (HPA) is a rare complication after liver trauma, yet it is potentially
      fatal, as it can lead to sudden severe haemorrhage. The risk of developing posttraumatic
      hepatic pseudoaneurysm is one of the reasons why some trauma centres do follow-up CT of
      patients with liver injuries to take the therapeutic consequence. The aim of this study was
      to investigate the occurrence of HPA post liver trauma.
