             psoriasis (PASI ≤15) aged 18-75 years who must have at least two psoriasis lesions of
             &gt;9 cm2 (located at arms and/or trunk, excluding elbows and legs), stable for at least

          5. Affected body surface area (BSA) ≤10%.

             trial requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             calcium channel inhibitors or lithium) prior to randomization

          3. Ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments (duration of washout, i.e.

               2. Systemic therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (other than above) e.g.
                  methotrexate, cyclosporin, fumaric acid (derivatives), systemic steroids (4
                  weeks)

               3. Photochemotherapy e.g., ultraviolet A with psoralen (PUVA) (4 weeks)

               4. Phototherapy e.g., ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) (2 weeks)

               5. Topical therapies for the treatment of Ps such as corticosteroids, vitamin D
                  analogues or retinoids within 14 days prior to baseline

             tuberculosis status using a blood test (QuantiFERON TB-Gold) unless this test has been
             performed within 4 months prior to randomization and was negative. Patients with

             [NYHA] class III or IV)

         15. Inability or unwillingness to undergo repeated venipunctures (e.g., due to poor

                  implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, condoms (by the partner),
                  and intrauterine devices (IUDs)). Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,
