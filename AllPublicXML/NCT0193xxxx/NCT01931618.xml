    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test - in a workplace setting - if an online multi-session
      alcohol intervention improves treatment effect over and above a single session screening with
      feedback.

      Hypothesis: automated online multi-session follow-up improves the effect on alcohol
      consumption over and above a single session screening

      Setting: Online study among Norwegian employees.

      Participants: At-risk drinkers among employees in a select group of norwegian workplaces is
      recruited through an e-mail to their job e-mail account, and advertisements on the intranet
      of their organization.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT). Subjects in both conditions receives a single
      session screening procedure including individualized normative feedback. The control group
      receives an online booklet about the effects of alcohol. The treatment group receives the
      multi session follow up program &quot;Balance&quot;.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of standard alcohol units consumed during the previous seven days</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured six months after enrollment/baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to indicate (through online questionnaires) how many standard alcohol units they consumed on each of the previous seven days, on a scale from zero to ten. Then a sum-score for weekly consumption is calculated, ranging from zero to 70.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sick leave during last week</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at six months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sick leave was assessed with a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response for each of the past seven days, and then accumulated, resulting in a score of zero to seven. Participants were instructed to report any sick leave regardless of reason.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative consequences of alcohol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at six months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived negative consequences of own alcohol consumption, during the seven previous days, was assessed by a 13 item index, resulting in a sum score with a theoretical range from zero to 13. The items comprised: headache, nausea, anxiety, worn out, depressed, breaking a plan, breaking a date, sick leave, memory problems, bad conscience, conflict, destroyed something and injuries.</description>

    <intervention_name>Online multi session follow-up</intervention_name>
    <description>An online multi session follow-up program (i.e., &quot;Balance&quot;). The central concept of Balance is to support continued self-regulation throughout the behavior change process. There are four key aspects of the program, the first is focus on goal setting and tracking of alcohol consumption on a day-to-day basis. The second on relapse prevention - for example, when clients report drinking more than their target, they receive individualized content aimed at preventing a full blown relapse. The third is emotion regulation, where content and assignments from positive psychology and from cognitive behavioral therapy are used. Finally, intervention covers alcohol education (i.e. the same topics as in the booklet provided to the control group).</description>
