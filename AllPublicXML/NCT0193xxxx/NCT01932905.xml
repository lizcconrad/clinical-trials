      Pain affects up to 30% of the general population. In particular, neuropathic pain (NeP) is
      caused by lesion or desease affecting peripheral or central somatosensory pathways and
      affects 7% of the adult population. Despite the availability of evidence based
      pharmacological and surgical treatment for NeP, about 50% of patients remais symptomatic
      despite best medical treatment. Some neuropathic pain syndromes are specially refractory. In
      particular, central NeP is caused by disease or lesion to central structures involves in
      somatosensory integration of nociceptive information is non-responsive to drugs usually
      employed in other NeP syndromes. Classical neuromodulatory techniques such as conventional
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation aiming at the motor of prefrontal cortices are
      ineffective to relieve pain in this population. Recently new technology advances have made
      possible non-invasive stimulation of deeper cortical targets. Some of them are activelly
      involved in the integration of the perception of pain, such as the anterior cingulate cortex
      or the posterior insula. The aim this study is to treat 90 patients with central pain (post
      stroke pain, spinal cord lesions after trauma or demyelinizating diseases) under best medical
      pharmacological treatment in three different conditions: AAC (n= 30 with the H-Coil),
      Superior Posterior Insula (SPI) n=30 cooled double cone coil double cool coil, and
      sham(n=30). Each patients will undergo daily stimulation for a week, then weekly stimulations
      for 3 months (total of 17 sessions). The main study outcome is pain relief at the last
      stimulation week (visual-analogic scale). Secondary end-points are changes in the McGill Pain
      Questionnaire, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, DN4 questionnaire, SF -36, brief pain
      inventory and cognitive assessment including the trail making test A and B, Strrop color
      interference test, and subscalles from the CERAD. All patients will undergo quantitative
      sensory test and measurements of cortical excitability over M1 before and after to treatment.
