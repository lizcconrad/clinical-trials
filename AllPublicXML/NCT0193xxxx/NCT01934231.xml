  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a respiratory inflammation commonly seen in clinical
      practice, which has with respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea,
      postnasal discharge and cough and is associated with headache, cheek pain, facial pressure
      and other conditions. The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS include Streptococcus
      pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. These three
      bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less than or equal to 5 years of
      age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin (AMPC) produces higher
      antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The present study is designed
      to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14)
      administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years with ABRS. It is an
      open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a post-treatment follow-up phase
      for 7 to 14 days.

    <description>Clinical assessment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis was performed by the investigator (or subinvestigator) at TOC (Day 15) on the basis of the following criteria: &quot;Cure&quot; is defined as sufficient resolution or improvement of the signs and symptoms such that no additional antibiotic therapy is needed. Failure is defined as no change or deterioration of the signs and symptoms or as additional antibiotic therapy being needed. The outcome was unable to be determined if no information was available regarding the signs and symptoms or, despite improvement of the signs and symptoms, the use of a non-study antibiotic was administered, indicating that there was a protocol deviation.</description>

The outcome was unable to be determined if no information was available regarding the signs and symptoms or, despite improvement of the signs and symptoms, the use of a non-study antibiotic was administered, indicating that there was a protocol deviation.

    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), Day 4, Day 8, and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator (or sub-investigator) categorized the severity of symptoms such as rhinorrhoea and bad mood/productive cough as none, mild/small amount (M/SA), or moderate or severe (M or S). For the nasal cavity finding of nasal/postnasal discharge (N/PD) the categozation was serous [containing serum]), mucopurulent (MU/SA [containing both mucus and pus]), and moderate or larger amount (M/LA). In cases in which both sides of the nasal cavity were affected and there was no difference in severity between the sides, the right-side results were recorded. If there was a difference in severity, the more severe-side results were recorded.</description>

The sample collected at the EOT was used to evaluate the bact. response to the investigational product of each path. If the same pathogen was not detected at the EOT, this pathogen was classified as &quot;eradication&quot; (E).

    <description>The investigator used the sample collected at the start of study treatment (trt) to isolate and identify the pathogenic bacteria. The sample collected at the EOT was used to evaluate the bact. response to the investigational product of each par. using the following classification: Bact. eradication (erad.), presumed bact. erad. and colonization were categorized as erad. Bact. persistence (pers.), presumed bact. pers. and superinfection were categorized as pers. Bact. erad. elimination of the pathogen (path.) after trt; presumed bact. erad.-resolution of signs/symptoms (s/s) after trt; colonization-resolution of s/s but initial path. still recovered from sample; bact. pers.-no improvement in s/s and initial path. was recovered from sample; presumed bact. pers.-no improvement in s/s and isolation of initial path. was impossible/not performed; superinfection-initial path. was eradicated but a new path. was recovered; unable to determine-bact. test could not be performed.</description>

Failure is defined as no change or deterioration of the signs and symptoms or as additional antibiotic therapy being needed.

        <description>The investigator used the sample collected at the start of study treatment (trt) to isolate and identify the pathogenic bacteria. The sample collected at the EOT was used to evaluate the bact. response to the investigational product of each path. If the same pathogen was not detected at the EOT, this pathogen was classified as &quot;eradication&quot; (E). If the same pathogen was detected at the EOT, this pathogen was classified as &quot;persistence&quot; (P).</description>

The daily dose of CVA/AMPC (1:14) was equal to CVA 6.4 milligrams (mg) (potency)/kilogram (kg)/day and AMPC 90 mg (potency)/kg/day in two divided doses (every 12 hours) just before lactation or meal depending on body weight at the start of treatment (Day 1).</description>

          <description>The investigator used the sample collected at the start of study treatment (trt) to isolate and identify the pathogenic bacteria. The sample collected at the EOT was used to evaluate the bact. response to the investigational product of each path. If the same pathogen was not detected at the EOT, this pathogen was classified as &quot;eradication&quot; (E). If the same pathogen was detected at the EOT, this pathogen was classified as &quot;persistence&quot; (P).</description>

        <description>The investigator used the sample collected at the start of study treatment (trt) to isolate and identify the pathogenic bacteria. The sample collected at the EOT was used to evaluate the bact. response to the investigational product of each par. using the following classification: Bact. eradication (erad.), presumed bact. erad. and colonization were categorized as erad. Bact. persistence (pers.), presumed bact. pers. and superinfection were categorized as pers. Bact. erad. elimination of the pathogen (path.) after trt; presumed bact. erad.-resolution of signs/symptoms (s/s) after trt; colonization-resolution of s/s but initial path. still recovered from sample; bact. pers.-no improvement in s/s and initial path. was recovered from sample; presumed bact. pers.-no improvement in s/s and isolation of initial path. was impossible/not performed; superinfection-initial path. was eradicated but a new path. was recovered; unable to determine-bact. test could not be performed.</description>
