  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate whether the knowledge of a
      personalized diabetes risk score affects adherence to a 12-week diet and exercise lifestyle
      change program in prediabetic patients. The intervention group will receive diabetes risk
      score results at the beginning of the twelve weeks, and the control group will not receive
      these results. Both groups will review their baseline and 12-week diabetes risk score results
      at the conclusion of the program and will be followed for an additional twelve weeks.
      Attendance rates and changes in weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, HgA1c,
      fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, and diabetes risk score will be compared between the
      groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women of all ethnic groups

          -  ≥30 -75 years of age

          -  Pre-diabetic defined as follows: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125mg/dL, HbA1c 5.7%
             to 6.4%.

          -  Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2

          -  Tricare beneficiary

        Diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (defined as FPG ≥126 mg/dl on two different
        occasions or random blood sugar ≥200) If fasting glucose &gt;= 126 only once, a second lab
        does not need to be arranged in an attempt to diagnose diabetes. It is acceptable for the
        patient to proceed in the trial. Also, Tethys lab results (e.g., fasting glucose and A1C)
        should not be used to make decisions about including or excluding patients in the trial.
        Only Air Force lab results should be used to make this determination.
