  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles and to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of two commercial amoxicillin-suspension formulations in healthy Brazilian
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under fasting condition, 25 volunteers (13 males and 12 females) were included in this
      randomized, open-label, two-period crossover (1-week washout interval) bioequivalence study.
      Blood samples were collected at pre-dose (0h) and 0.5, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and
      12 hours after drug ingestion. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2,
      Area-under-curve0-12h and Area-under-curve0-inf) were calculated from plasma concentrations
      for both formulations in each subject.

    <description>Amoxicillin were extracted from plasma by precipitating plasma proteins with acetonitrile. Amoxicillin plasmatic concentration was accessed every 30 minutes until 3h hours after drug administration and every 2h after this time until 12h of drug administration. Drug plasmatic concentrations were obtained by using a HPLC method.</description>
