  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a form of phototherapy which involves the application of
      light to injuries and lesions to promote tissue regeneration. It is a noninvasive treatment
      modality based on the photochemical effect of light on tissues, which modulates various
      metabolic processes.

      LLLT has been used for a wide range of conditions, in particular in dermatology, to promote
      wound healing, reduce inflammation and oedema, and relieve pain. In this study, we intend to
      assess the efficacy of LLLT to manage radiotherapy-induced skin reactions (or radiation
      dermatitis), a very common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of noninvasive (Stage 0) or invasive (Stages 1, 2 or 3A) breast
             adenocarcinoma

          -  Treatment with primary breast-sparing surgery (lumpectomy) and/ or neoadjuvant
             (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy or hormonal treatment

          -  Scheduled for postoperative radiotherapy with standard technique (isocentric) and
             fractionation regime (i.e., 25 daily fractions to the whole breast followed by a boost
             of 8 fractions to the tumor bed, 2 Gy per fraction, five times per week)

          -  Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous irradiation to the same breast

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  Mastectomy surgery

          -  Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy

          -  Required use of bolus material to deliver radiation therapy (i.e., material placed on
             the to-be-irradiated zone to modulate the delivered dose in order to ensure an optimal
             distribution of the radiation dose)
