      This Observational Registry study is designed to collect self-reported Transmucosal Immediate
      Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access
      program-enrolled patient experience with breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) as a result of
      treatment with Abstral® through the use of Quality of Life and pain measurement tools
      administered via questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing, single arm, open label multicenter trial to assess Abstral
      (fentanyl) Sublingual Tablets for breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in opioid-tolerant cancer
      patients.

        -  Prior to study enrollment, patient enrollment in the TIRF REMS Access program must be
           confirmed.

        -  Eligible patients will sign written informed consent. Patients or their proxy with a
           witness must be able to sign written informed consent to participate in the study; and
           the patient may use a proxy caregiver to assist in the completion of the study
           questionnaires.

        -  Day 0, study site must enroll patient by completing a patient demographic profile
           (de-identified).

        -  Day 0, patient will be instructed how to use the questionnaires.

        -  Day 0, patient will complete the baseline questionnaire before leaving the physician
           office.

        -  On study Days 14, 21, and 28 (±3 days) patient questionnaire will be completed by
           patient (or caregiver proxy) via secure online data entry portal.

        -  For patients completing paper questionnaires, within 1 month of day 28, patient will
           return completed questionnaires via mail, fax or hand carried to the study site
           coordinator for processing.

        -  Patient will be considered to have completed the study successfully once all completed
           questionnaires have been received by the CRO within appropriate time limits.
