      The purpose of this study is to improve care delivered to patients with serious illness by
      enhancing communication among patients, families, and clinicians in the outpatient setting.
      We are testing a new way to help patients share their preferences for talking about
      end-of-life care with their clinicians and families. To do this we created a simple, short
      feedback form. The form is designed to help clinicians understand what patients would like to
      talk about. The goal of this research study is to show that using a feedback form is possible
      and can be helpful for patients and their families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four decades of research on end-of-life care indicate that people who are dying often spend
      their final days with a significant burden of pain and other symptoms and receive care they
      would not choose. Patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care is an important
      focus for improving care for three reasons: 1) when it occurs, it is associated with improved
      quality of life, reduced anxiety, and fewer intensive life-sustaining therapies at the end of
      life; 2) physicians frequently do not have discussions about end-of-life care with their
      patients even though most patients desire these discussions; and 3) our preliminary studies
      suggest that a simple intervention based on each patient's informational needs and
      preferences can increase the occurrence and quality of patient-clinician communication about
      end-of-life care. By tailoring patient-clinician discussions to the individual patient,
      patients will be able to make care decisions that are best for them and clinicians will be
      able to provide patients with the care patients' desire.

      Our long-term goal is to ensure that patients receive the end-of-life care they desire
      through improved patient-clinician communication. If effective, this health-system
      intervention will improve: 1) the occurrence and quality of patient-centered communication
      about end-of-life care for patients with chronic life-limiting illness and their families; 2)
      the agreement between patients' wishes for care and care received; and 3) the burden of
      symptoms of anxiety and depression experienced by patients and families.

      We propose a randomized trial of a feedback form, called a &quot;Jumpstart&quot; form, provided to
      patients, family members and clinicians, specifying the individual patient's communication
      needs and preferences concerning end-of- life care. The trial will be tested with clinicians
      (n=120) who provide primary or specialty care to eligible patients at clinics of two large
      healthcare systems. Eligible patients (up to 6 per clinician, goal n=500) will include those
      with chronic, life-limiting illness. Family members of patients and interdisciplinary team
      members of primary clinicians may participate. Primary clinicians will be randomized to the
      intervention or usual care. The intervention's effectiveness will be compared with usual care
      using validated self-report questionnaires that will be collected longitudinally
      (baseline/enrollment, within 2 weeks of the target visit, 3 months, 6 months) from patients
      and families. Analyses include statistical approaches that take into account that there will
      be more than one patient for each physician and that data are collected at multiple time
      points.

      Outcomes of this study include patient assessments of: 1) frequency and quality of
      patient/clinician communication; 2) agreement between care patients desire and care patients
      receive; and 3) symptoms of anxiety and depression.

      We will also use qualitative data to accomplish the following goals: 1) to explore subjects'
      experiences with the study's activities; 2) to understand barriers to participation; and 3)
      to explore patient and family experiences with the intervention. To obtain these goals, we
      will contact a total of 30-40 participants, selected from all subject groups, to participate
      in one-on-one semi-structured interviews during which they will be asked to share their
      experiences as a study participant and their perspectives on study activities.

    <description>The intervention, based on self-efficacy theory, identifies patients' preferences for communication about end-of-life care (EOLC) and barriers and facilitators to this communication, and collates these data into a feedback form. The feedback forms are tailored to each recipient (clinician, patient, family) to support the communication tasks which that recipient will address. Feedback forms are sent to participants prior to the target clinic visit. The primary clinician's form suggests referral to palliative care if there are &quot;potentially unmet palliative-care communication needs.&quot; All forms include &quot;tips&quot; to help the recipient respond to communication preferences appropriately.</description>

             physicians (family medicine and internal medicine), oncologists, pulmonologists,
             cardiologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, neurologists, hepatologists, and
             geriatricians. Primary clinicians may also include nurse practitioners and physician
             assistants playing a &quot;primary role&quot; with eligible patients. A &quot;primary role&quot; denotes
             any clinician for whom having a discussion about end-of-life care with eligible
             patients would be indicated

          -  Eligible interprofessional team members will include nurses, social workers and other
             clinicians who are part of an enrolled primary clinician's clinic team.

          -  Eligible patients will be those under the care of a participating clinician who are 18
             years of age or older, have had 2 or more visits with the primary clinician in the
             last 18 months, and meet diagnostic criteria. Diagnostic criteria include: 1)
             metastatic cancer or inoperable lung cancer; 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             with FEV1 values &lt;35% predicted or oxygen dependence or restrictive lung disease with
             a TLC &lt; 50% predicted; 3) New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure; 4)
             Child's Class C cirrhosis or MELD score of &gt;17; 5) dialysis-dependent renal failure
             and either diabetes or a serum albumin of &lt; 2.5; or, 6) older than 75 years with at
             least one life-limiting chronic illness or older than 90 years. Additional criteria
             include: PAH w. 6MWD &lt;250m, restrictive lung disease (IPF, ILD) w/ TLC &lt;50%, and
             cystic fibrosis with FEV1 &lt; 30%. Eligible patients will also be English-speaking and
             have no significant dementia or cognitive impairment that would limit his/her ability
             to complete questionnaires.

             patient would want the family member involved in medical decision-making for the
             patient if he/she was not able. For the purpose of this study, &quot;family member&quot; is not
             confined to legal next-of-kin or immediate family member. Any family member, friend,
             or caregiver is eligible who is English-speaking and has no dementia or delirium
             limiting his/her ability to complete questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Reasons for exclusion for all subject groups include: legal or risk management
             concerns; and physical or mental limitations preventing ability to complete research
