  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study, which means we want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, this
      combination of drugs may have on the patient and the liver cancer at different dose levels.
      All patients will have an operation to remove tumors in the liver and may have a pump placed
      in their abdomen.

      On this study, both drugs given have been used in other patients for treatment of
      cholangiocarcinoma and other gastrointestinal cancers. Both drugs are approved by the food
      and drug administration (FDA) for treatment of liver cancer, but the two drugs have only been
      combined in a few patients.

      That means that in this trial we also want to find out if this combination is safe.

      The study will also evaluate if this treatment works in delaying or stopping the cancer from
      coming back after surgery.

    <description>This is an open-label single arm study. multi-institution phase I dose escalating trial of adjuvant HAIP FUDR and Gemcitabine chemotherapy after curative resection of ICC. Hepatectomy with or without bile duct reconstruction and pump placement are performed. The patients will start therapy 4 weeks postoperatively. They will receive HAI FUDR/Dex and systemic gemcitabine in the following dose escalation levels of gemcitabine. The dose of HAI FUDR will be fixed. A classic 3+3 cohort dose escalation scheme will be used to identify the MTD of the combination.
Level 1: Systemic gemcitabine 650mg/m^2 Day 1 and 15 and HAI FUDR/Dex 0.12mg/kg/day Day 1-14 Level 2.Systemic gemcitabine 800mg/m^2 Day 1 and 15 HAI FUDR/Dex 0.12 mg/kg/day Day 1-14 Level 3. Systemic gemcitabine 1000mg/m^2 Day 1 and 15 HAI FUDR/Dex 0.12 mg/kg/day Day 1-14</description>
