      The study is being conducted to evaluate look the TOPS System when used in patients with
      degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar spinal stenosis who would normally be candidates
      for spinal fusion.

      This study is being conducted to evaluate the TOPS™ SP System from (&quot;TOPS™ System&quot; or
      &quot;TOPS&quot;). TOPS is an alternative to spinal fusion and is designed to stabilize but not fuse
      the affected vertebral level to alleviate pain stemming from degenerative spondylolisthesis
      (abnormal/excessive movement of the vertebrae causing pain in the lower back and legs) and
      spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in compression of nerves producing
      symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the legs).

        IInclusion Criteria - Prospective subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be
        considered eligible for inclusion in this clinic study:

          -  Age 40-85 years old;

          -  One or both of the following at a single level from L3 to L5; (1) symptomatic
             monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis or facet arthrosis, (2) degenerative
             spondylolisthesis up to and including grade 1.

          -  At least three (3) months of failed, conservative treatment prior to surgery (unless
             deemed inadvisable due to progressive motor weakness or other evidence of rapidly
             deteriorating condition) including the use of anti-inflammatory medications at maximum
             specified dosage, administration of epidural/facet injections, rest, heat,
             electrotherapy and/or physical therapy;

          -  Narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal (central and/or foramenal) classified as moderate
             to severe using CT scans/MRI;

          -  VAS leg pain of at least 40/100;

          -  Oswestry Disability Index score of at least 40/100;

          -  Lower back pain or sciatica with or without spinal claudication and

          -  Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to fully comply with the clinical
             protocol and willing to adhere to follow-up schedule and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria - Prospective subjects must not meet any of the exclusion criteria to
        participate in this clinical study:

          -  Primary diagnosis of discogenic back pain at the TOPS System level;

          -  Lytic spondylolisthesis at the index level;

          -  More than one (1) motion segment involved in the degenerative pathology to the extent
             that justifies its inclusion in the surgical procedure, unless a decompression alone
