      Background:

      - Podoconiosis is a disease of the lymph vessels in the legs and feet. It is caused by
      long-term barefoot exposure to irritant soils, such as those in volcanic areas. It causes
      severe swelling and disfigurement, as well as infection and chronic pain. It mostly affects
      people who live in tropical Africa, Central and South America, and India. The reasons why
      some people develop this disease and others do not is not well understood. Researchers want
      to study people with the disease and healthy volunteers in Ethiopia. They will collect skin
      and blood samples to study genetic and other aspects of the disease.

      Objectives:

      - To collect skin and blood samples to study genetic and other aspects of podoconiosis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have podoconiosis (early stage or advanced
           stage).

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

        -  Participants will be recruited from a study clinic and hospital in Ethiopia.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Blood samples will be collected. A skin biopsy will be performed to collect tissue for
           study. People who have podoconiosis will provide affected and unaffected tissue. Healthy
           volunteers will provide a single skin biopsy sample.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      This research protocol is designed to study gene expression differentials and immunologic
      profile and histopatologic presentation of podoconiosis by comparing cases and controls in
      Ethiopia. Podoconiosis is a geochemical lymphedema of the lower limbs resulting from long
      term barefoot exposure to irritant red clay soils of volcanic origin. The disease imposes
      huge social and economic burden and affects more than 4 million individuals in tropical
      Africa, Central and South America, and North India. The pathologic changes in podoconiosis
      are still not known and the histopathologic features of the disease have not been well
      studied. Our recent genome-wide association study revealed that variants in HLA class II
      genes (HLA-DRB1, -DQB1, and -DQA1) are associated with podoconiosis, and suggests that the
      disease may be a Tcell mediated inflammatory condition (New Eng J Med 2012). The objectives
      of the present study are to investigate the immunologic profiles and gene expression
      differences between podoconiosis patients and healthy controls. The study will include 150
      subjects consisting of 100 cases (50 early stage and 50 advanced stage), and 50 controls from
      Ethiopia. Anonymized discarded skin tissue samples will be obtained from excised nodules of
      50 advanced stage patients that undergo nodulectomy (surgical excisions of nodules) in Bahir
      Dar Hospital. Punch biopsies will be obtained from affected skin tissues (epidermis and
      dermis) of 50 early stage podoconiosis patients that attend routine treatment in Dur-Bete
      Podoconiosis Center, and normal skin tissues (epidermis and dermis) of 50 control subjects
      undergoing orthopedic surgery of the lower legs in Bahir Dar Hospital. We will also obtain 6
      mm skin tissue punch biopsies from the unaffected areas in the lower limbs of all
      podoconiosis patients and peripheral blood samples (PBS) from all study subjects. RNA from
      PBS and T cells separated from other cells will be extracted in Armauer Hansen Research
      Institute of Ethiopia (AHRI) and will be shipped along with skin biopsies that will be kept
      in liquid nitrogen to CRGGH/NHGRI. We will use RNA-seq, a high throughput RNA sequencing
      technology, to characterize the transcriptome by sequencing complementary DNAs (cDNAs)
      followed by mapping of the sequence reads to the genome. Generation of double-stranded cDNA
      from mRNA and quantitation of cDNA concentration will be done in our lab at NIH. Sequencing
      will be done by a commercial high throughput sequencing company, SeqWright (Houston, TX) an
      Illumina certified service provider. Immunologic profiling will be done using a FACSCalibur
      type flow cytometry. Analysis of data will be done using appropriate statistical programs and
      pipeline suites as described below. This study is expected to reveal differential gene
      expression between podoconiosis patients and controls. Furthermore, it will chart the
      evolution of gene expression signatures in podoconiosis patients through the different
      clinical stages of the disease. The findings could potentially lead to biomarkers that
      complement the clinical and genetic characteristics of the disease. The histopathological
      studies will provide a rich description of cutaneous and immunologic response across the
      spectrum of the disease. The integration of clinical, immunological, genetic, cellular and
      molecular characteristics of the disease will facilitate the development of a model for the
      natural history and pathogenesis of this neglected tropical disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  All individuals included in our study will be adults (greater than or equal to 18
             years) because the average age of onset of the disease is during the third decade of
             life. In addition, in Ethiopia the legal age to give independent consent for research
             is 18 years or older. Previous studies have shown that diagnosis of podoconiosis using
             physical diagnostic criteria in endemic highland areas is highly accurate. To rule out
             filarial elephantiasis, a rapid ICT card test will be done. Advanced stage
             podoconiosis cases will be included in the study based on prior assessment of an
             experienced surgeon (Dr Wendemagegn Enbiale Yeshanehe) who assures eligibility for
             nodulectomy if a patient with clinical stage III, IV or V podoconiosis has fibrotic
             nodules. Early clinical stage podoconiosis patients will be individuals with negative
             filarial test and at clinical stages I or II. Controls will be individuals with no
             past or current history, signs and symptoms of podoconiosis and no family history of
             podoconiosis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -In addition to clinical criteria that make patients and controls non-eligible to undergo
        surgery, we will also exclude individuals with skin infection, skin lesion at the
        prospective biopsy site, medical contradictions to biopsy, history of adenolymphangitis
        during the previous 2 weeks, topical steroid treatment during the previous 2 weeks, with
        biologically related family members that are included in the study, recent infection, use
        of systemic antibiotics and use of systemic steroids. Attempts will be made to enroll an
        equal number of men and women. No prisoners, pregnant women or fetuses will be included in
        this study.
