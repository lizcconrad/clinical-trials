      This pilot clinical trial studies copper Cu 64 (64Cu) tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid
      (DOTA)-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in studying
      patients with gastric, or stomach cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu
      64-DOTA-trastuzumab PET/CT, may help doctors study the characteristics of tumors and choose
      the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab) in
      gastric cancer patients with pathologic evaluation of tumor human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)/neu expression.

      II. To compare copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-PET-CT scan with standard radiographic imaging
      for staging patients with gastric cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and then undergo
      PET/CT scan on days 2 or 3.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 15 days and periodically for up to 6
      months.

    <measure>Tumor uptake of copper Cu 64-DOTA trastuzumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Parameterized in terms of single-voxel maximum values peak standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and whole-tumor volumes of interest (SUVwhtum). Ratios of tumor to non-tumor activity concentration will be calculated. Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis will be performed to estimate optimal cutoff values of SUVmax, SUVwhtum, tumor:background, and tumor:organ ratios for classifying tumors as &quot;HER2 positive&quot; or &quot;HER2 negative&quot;.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic confirmation of Cu-PET/CT SUV variation over the tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and negative areas of the tumor will be sent to pathology for confirmation. This will be exploratory.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic confirmation of Cu-PET/CT SUV</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation of Cu-PET SUV (measured as peak SUV) and pathology will be explored. As correlation requires a continuous measure from pathology, and some pathology will use FISH and/or IHC, this will be exploratory. Comparing Cu-PET in positive cases versus negative by pathology will depend on the percent of patients deemed positive.</description>
