  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial penetration can be assessed through evaluation of antimicrobial concentrations
      in various lung compartments, including bronchial mucosal tissue, epithelial lining fluid
      (ELF), and alveolar macrophages (AM). Antimicrobial concentrations determined in ELF and
      alveolar macrophages represent an ideal estimate of concentrations at the site of infection
      and can be accessed via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). However sampling of antimicrobial
      concentrations via BAL is not routine in clinical practice due to its complex methodology and
      poor patient tolerability. This study will evaluate intrapulmonary and plasma
      pharmacokinetics of GSK2140944 after single IV dose in adult healthy volunteers. This is a
      Phase I, open-label study to evaluate plasma and pulmonary pharmacokinetics following
      intravenous administration of GSK2140944 in healthy adult participants. Part A will evaluate
      the single dose PK profiles. Part B is optional and will only be conducted if necessary. Each
      part will consist of a maximum of 6 cohorts. In Part A, only 4 of the 6 cohorts will be dosed
      initially; cohorts 5 and 6 are optional and will only be dosed if additional time-points are
      necessary to adequately model the pulmonary pharmacokinetic profile.

    <description>Study BTZ116666 has two parts. Each part will consist of a maximum of 6 cohorts. Part A will be initiated with 4 initial cohorts/timepoints in order to minimize the number of healthy volunteers that undergo bronchoscopy in this study. After review of data from Cohorts 1 through 4 of Part A, the study team will determine if additional cohorts are needed to be studied in Part A and/ or if Part B is needed. If the study team determines that additional cohorts are needed, then only the necessary cohorts in Parts A and/or B will be executed. In Part A, participants will receive GSK2140944 1000 mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours x 1 dose</description>

             evaluation including medical history, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical
             examination, and laboratory tests. A participant with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included if in the Investigator's judgement the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             confirmatory. Male participant with female partners of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use one of the contraception methods listed as per protocol. This criterion
             must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until the final

             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such
             conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator may place the participant at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol (or alcohol breath test) at

             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 grams (g) of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml)
             of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary

             acetaminophen (&lt;=2 grams/day) up to 48 hours prior to the first dose of study
             medication. However, the Investigator and GSK study team can review medication on a
             case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise participant safety or
             interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, including GSK2140944 and those
             that may be used in association with the BAL procedure, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
