      This pilot clinical trial studies ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in diagnosing breast cancer. New diagnostic
      procedures may be a more sensitive way to detect breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To implement quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, diffusion-weighted
      (DW)-MRI, 31 phosphorus (31P) MRS, magnetization transfer (MT)-MRI, chemical exchange
      saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI, and high-resolution structural imaging at 7 Tesla in patients
      for diagnosing breast tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo measurement of tumor perfusion and permeability using DCE-MRI, tumor
      cellularity using DW-MRI, phospholipid metabolism using 31P MRS, macromolecular content using
      MT-MRI, and cellular protein content using CEST-MRI. Diagnostic performance of one, or a
      combination, of these metrics will be investigated in the context of breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have signed an approved consent form

          -  Must be at least 18 years old

          -  Subjects must have undergone x-ray mammography and/or ultrasonography

          -  Subjects must have undergone standard clinical (1.5 Tesla) MRI as part of their
             standard-of-care diagnostic workup:

               -  To evaluate the extent of disease for a previously diagnosed cancer, or

               -  To evaluate a clinically suspected lesion that was occult on mammography and/or
                  ultrasonography, or

               -  Because the patient is considered high-risk (according to National Comprehensive
                  Cancer Network [NCCN] criteria)

          -  Subjects must be classified Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 or 5

          -  Subjects must be scheduled for diagnostic biopsy to evaluate a lesion that measures
             &gt;10 mm in the greatest dimension.

             magnetic means (e.g., cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulators,
             electronic infusion pumps, aneurysm clip, etc), because such devices may be displaced
             or malfunction

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding; the MRI Procedure Screening Form will be
             used to identify and exclude subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding; a urine

             intravenous injection of Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or other

          -  Subjects who exhibit noticeable anxiety and/or claustrophobia or who exhibit severe
             vertigo when they are moved into the magnet bore

          -  Subjects incapable of giving informed written consent, for the following reasons:

               -  Inability to adhere to the experimental protocols for any reason

               -  Inability to communicate with the research team

               -  Limited ability to give informed consent due to mental disability, altered mental
                  status, confusion, or psychiatric disorders
