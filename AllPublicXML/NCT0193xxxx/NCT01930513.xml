  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is very common worldwide and breathing problems at night (obstructive sleep apnea,
      OSA) are common in obesity. Despite the best treatment, obesity and OSA are linked to early
      death from heart problems. They are also associated with lower levels of physical activity.
      Exercise strategies for weight loss, increasing physical activity and improving fitness are
      needed for obesity. In Obese individuals with OSA

        1. The investigators will compare corridor walking tests compared to laboratory exercise
           tests. The null hypothesis is that the peak oxygen uptake achieved and the
           cardiopulmonary response during both the six-minute walk test and Incremental Shuttle
           Walk Test would not be different from that observed during an Incremental Treadmill
           Test.

        2. The investigators will investigate whether cycling or walking uses more calories for the
           same intensity. We hypothesise that cycling (weight supported) will be endured for long.

        3. The investigators will compare commonly used exercise tests with levels of daily
           physical activity.

      The information from these three projects will help us set up the optimal exercise program
      for obese individuals.

    <measure>Peak oxygen uptake (Peak VO2) measured at the end of the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>All outcome measures will be performed within four weeks of each other</time_frame>
    <description>Two Incremental Shuttle Walk tests will be performed within two hours on the same day with expired gas analysis measured by a portable gas analyser. An ISWT is conducted over a 10m course and the speed is externally paced and increases each minute. The participant is asked to continue until they are either too breathless or too tired to continue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT will be performed over a 30 m level, straight course within an enclosed corridor. The test protocol described by the American Thoracic Society will be modified to include standardized encouragement every 15 seconds to recommence walking if the participant chooses to rest during the test. Participants will be familiarized with the test prior to participating in the study and, therefore, only one test will be performed.</description>
