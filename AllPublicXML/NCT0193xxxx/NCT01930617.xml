  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are numerous reported ways to treat chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) and practice is
      still differing considerably between departments. Except for a recent randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) that found that postoperative subdural drainage was better than no drain, there
      is no higher level evidence. Another recent RCT did not replicate these findings, but the
      study was severely underpowered.

      Aim of this population based study is to compare clinical results (reoperation rates,
      complications, perioperative death, and survival) between neurosurgical departments treating
      CSDH with different treatment policies.

        The patients have been selected to the given therapy solely on the basis of geography. All
        patients treated with evacuation of primary chronic subdural hematoma(CSDH) from 2005
        through 2010 at St.Olav University Hospital and UNN, and primary CSDH from 2006 through
        2010 at Karolinska University Hospital (not 2005 due to practical reasons since major
        changes occurred in electronic surgery protocols 2005).
