      The investigators aim to study the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women who live in
      the riverside community in the state of Amapa (The Bailique Island) and compare it to the
      prevalence of urinary incontinence in women who live in the urban region -Macapa-the capital
      city of the Amapa State - Brazil.

      The study aims to compare urinary complaints of women belonging to two different groups:
      women who live in a riverside area of the Amapa State-the Bailique Island, which is about 12
      hours by boat from the state capital city and compare them to those of the women who live in
      the urban region -Macapa (the capital city of the Amapa State). The main goals are: to
      describe the clinical features of the women in the study, assess probable risk factors
      concerning the urinary incontinence, make physical gynecological exam as well as urodynamic
      studies in the patients who have urinary complaints and use a life quality questionnaire with
      those patients (Kings Health Questionnaire).

      Cross and prevalence Study, followed by case series. Cohort study between the two
      populations. The riverside group with 120 interviews and the urban group with 260 interviews,
      where the sample calculation was based on the population of each region and the incidence of
      urinary incontinence checked through a pilot study.

      After reading and signing an informed consent, interviews with women aged 20 years or over
      and non-pregnant are hold so as to identify those who have complaints about urinary
      incontinence, socio-economic data and risk factors. In patients who complain about urinary
      incontinence, gynecological exams are performed in order to assess genital prolapse and
      urodynamic studies are made as to confirm urinary incontinence and life quality
      questionnaire. All the data will be encoded in the database and analyzed through statistics
      programs and a comparison between the two groups (urban and riverside) will be made.
