             performed. If children are old enough (age usually deemed by each institution) to
             understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should also be informed and
             provide their written assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with known homozygous congenital deficiency of Protein S.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to plasma-derived products
             or to any excipient of the investigational product.

          3. Patient has an already known IgA deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA.

          4. Patient is currently participating in another interventional clinical study or has
             participated during the past 1 month prior to study inclusion. This is not applicable
             to non-interventional trials and does not exclude patients who have been exposed to
             Investigational Medicinal Product with a washout of at least 30 days from enrollment
             in LAS-213

          5. Patient is pregnant.

          6. Use of Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-inhibitors within 72 hours of the start of the
             first infusion episode or planned used of these medications while on study.
