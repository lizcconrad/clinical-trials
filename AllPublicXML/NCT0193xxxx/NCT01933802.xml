    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of intrathecal administration of autologous mesenchymal stem cell-derived neural
      progenitor cells (MSC-NP) in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. Study participants
      will receive three intrathecal injections of culture-expanded autologous MSC-NPs at three
      month intervals.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal therapy with autologous MSCNPs in MS. Number of participants with adverse events will be documented 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 2 months post treatment for three treatments (followup for third treatment is 3 months instead of 2 months).</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to observe trends in efficacy over the course of the experimental treatment. Outcome measures include evoked potentials (baseline and 3 months post 3rd dose) ,quality of life questionnaire, EDSS, and MSFC (baseline, at the time of each dose, and 3 and 6 months after third dose), and MRI (baseline, 2 months after first dose, and 3 and 24 months after third dose).</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MS as defined by the McDonald criteria

          -  Diagnosis of primary progressive or secondary progressive MS

          -  Between the ages of 18-70 years

          -  Significant disability shown by an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 3.0 or
             greater that was not acquired within the last 12 months

          -  Stable disease state as evidenced by a lack of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on an MRI
             and by a stable MRI disease burden (number of T2 lesions and size of lesions) in the
             last six months and no significant change in EDSS (1 point or more) in the last 12
             months

          -  Must agree to undergo MRIs at the time of enrollment, 2 months after the first
             treatment, and 27 months after the last treatment

          -  Live in northern New Jersey, southern New York, or southwestern Connecticut during the
             study period, or patients must be able to arrange reliable travel accommodations to be
             present for every study visit if they live farther away.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers or any woman intending to become pregnant in the next
             three years

          -  All patients will have pre-study liver function tests, PT/PPT, platelets, hematocrit,
             and renal function laboratory tests done. Only patients whose values are in the normal
             range as determined by the laboratory norms based on age and sex will be allowed to
             participate.

          -  Use of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of
             study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure

          -  Any patients with a history of or with active malignancy

          -  Use of steroids within three months of the study start date, as this would suggest a
             highly active disease state

          -  History of cirrhosis due to increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) infection

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension because of increased risk for stroke or CNS hemorrhage.
             Specifically, any patient with a systolic blood pressure value of ≥ 145 mm/Hg or a
             diastolic blood pressure value of ≥ 95 mm/Hg will be excluded from study
             participation.

          -  History of thyroid disorders or other endocrine disorders because of hormone influence
             on cell growth

          -  History of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to
             increased risk of CNS infection

          -  Preexisting blood disease (such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia,
             thrombocytopenia, or significant anemia) due to invasive nature of bone-marrow
             aspiration

          -  Previous or current history of a coagulation disorder

          -  Any metal in the body, which is contraindicated for MRI studies

          -  Allergy to any of the antibiotics used in this study, e.g. tobramycin, vancomycin, or
             gentamicin

          -  Patients with alcohol or other substance abuse problems

          -  Other major disease that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would preclude
             participation in the study

          -  Patients with HBV, HCV, syphilis, HIV-1, or HIV-2.

          -  Any evidence of significant cognitive dysfunction based on a screening history and
             physical examination because it would preclude giving a truly informed consent

          -  Patients who are enrolled in another clinical trial for MS treatment or who have
             received any study drug/biologics within the last 6 months
