  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analgesia after cesarean section is still not satisfactory for many women. Even if pain
      reduction is sufficient with the technique of intrathecal morphine injection, side effects
      such as nausea and pruritus are common.

      Since several years, an alternative technique has been studied, the &quot;transversus abdominis
      plane (TAP)&quot;-block. Here a local anesthetic is injected in the abdominal wall muscles, and
      this has been shown to give a similar analgesic effect compared to intrathecal morphine, with
      potentially less side effects.

      With this study, we want to evaluate if the TAP-block yields indeed less side effects when
      compared with intrathecal morphine.

      The study will be a prospective study with the patients randomized to either a group with
      intrathecal morphine or a group with TAP-block.
