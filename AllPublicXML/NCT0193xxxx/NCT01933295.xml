  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is recognized as the most prevalent and &quot;costly&quot; sleep disorders and is associated
      with considerable morbidity including significantly reduced quality of life, impaired work
      performance, and increased risk for major depressive disorder.1-4 Insomnia is a key symptom
      of the menopausal transition. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) yields
      equivalent short-term efficacy and superior long-term durability to pharmacological treatment
      of insomnia. The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia comorbid with
      menopause will be tested.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of multi-component CBT-I compared to a wait-list
      control group on self report and laboratory-based polysomnographic (PSG) sleep parameters. We
      hypothesize that multicomponent CBT-I will increase sleep efficiency, reduce the frequency of
      awakenings, reduce wake after sleep onset, and increase sleep bout duration compared to the
      control group evaluated using polysomnographic (PSG) and self-report measures of sleep.

      Specific Aim 2a: Test the efficacy of a brief two week single component sleep restriction
      therapy (SRT) to a wait-list control group on PSG and self-report sleep measures (sleep
      efficiency, frequency of awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and sleep bout duration). We
      hypothesize that brief SRT will be efficacious compared to the control condition in women
      with menopausal-related insomnia.

      Specific Aim 2b: Test the comparability (non-inferiority analysis) of SRT to CBT-I. We
      hypothesize that SRT will produce comparable efficacy in terms of the PSG and self-report
      measures of sleep compared to CBT-I (primary endpoints: sleep efficiency, frequency of
      awakenings, wake after sleep onset, and sleep bout duration).

      Specific Aim 3: Determine if CBT-I and SRT improves specific aspects of daytime functioning
      in patients with menopausal-related insomnia. We hypothesize that patients treated with CBT-I
      or SRT will have greater improvements in depressive symptomatology, quality of life,
      sleepiness and fatigue compared with a wait list control group.

    <description>Subjects will be evaluated at pre treatment, post treatment and at approximately 6 months follow up. A total of 4 standarized nocturnal PSGs will be performed for each participant (screening night, baseline assessment, and post-treatment night 1 and post treatment night 2. For each participant, self report sleep diaries will be measured in the home nightly throughout the 2-week baseline, treatment protocols, during the 2 weeks immediately post-treatment and for 2 weeks during follow up assessment at 6 months post treatment.</description>
