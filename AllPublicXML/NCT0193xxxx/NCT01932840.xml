  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daily consumption of plant sterols have been demonstrated to lower blood cholesterol. The
      Canadian government has recently allowed plant sterols to be added to certain foods and has
      also approved a disease risk reduction claim to be allowed on products containing plant
      sterols. However, it is unknown how Canadian consumers respond to plant sterol claims.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and understanding of different
      types of plant sterol claims on food labels

    <measure>Response to survey questions measuring attitudes towards plant sterol claims using 5-point likert rating scales</measure>
    <time_frame>On average the survey took 25 min to complete</time_frame>
    <description>Within a online survey, participants were exposed to 4 mock margarine packages that differed only by the claim it carried. After being exposed to each mock package, participants were asked to rate their perceived attractiveness, healthiness, credibility, usefulness of the tested plant sterol claims using 5-point likert scales. Participants were also asked to rate their purchasing intentions of the mock margarine product with the different plant sterol claims.</description>

    <measure>Response to survey questions evaluating participants understanding of plant sterol claims</measure>
    <time_frame>On average the survey took 25 minutes to complete</time_frame>
    <description>After each mock package, understanding of plant sterol claims was evaluated using various survey methods. First, participants were asked to rate their perceived clarity of the wording of the claim using a 5-point likert scale (a subjective measure of understanding). Second, participants were ask to rate, on 5-point likert scales, the perceived benefit of consuming the mock margarine package for subgroups with different health conditions (an indirect measure of understanding). Finally we asked participants, in an open ended question, to explain what a claim means to a friend (an objective measure of understanding).</description>
