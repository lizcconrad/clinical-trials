      In these single- blind clinical trial 67 primigravida females, gestational aged 34-36 week
      were selected using multi-stage sampling and assigned into two groups randomly.
      Decision-making (before, two weeks after and at admission in maternity department) was tested
      by a researcher -made questionnaire. In experiment group, advantages and disadvantages of
      normal delivery and cesarean-section delivery were presented by role-playing in three 90-min
      scenarios. It was also presented in a 90-min lecture. Data were analyzed using SPSS by mean
      difference test, exact fisher test, independent t-test and paired t-test.
