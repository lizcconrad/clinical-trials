  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention to address both
      executive function and processing speed changes that contribute to poor driving performance
      in adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

      Our hypotheses are that the study intervention will improve performance on a driving
      simulator and will improve (i) executive function, specifically attention and planning, (ii)
      useful field of view, (iii) mood, (iv) quality of life, and (v) reported motor vehicle
      crashes and driving infractions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Executive function and processing speed are recognized critical correlates of driving
      performance and have been shown to decline in older adults and in persons with mild cognitive
      impairment. Members of our research team have shown that group executive function training
      such as Goal Management Training results in benefits for healthy older adults, including
      improved simulated daily activities. The ultimate purpose of our research is to develop
      interventions to help maintain older adults' mobility in order to assist their 'aging at
      home'. The planned study will assess the effectiveness of an intervention that includes Goal
      Management Training + processing speed training (using DriveSharp software), which is
      designed to address both executive function and processing speed changes that contribute to
      poor driving performance in people with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment. The
      investigators will measure the effectiveness of the intervention on driving performance,
      sustained attention, divided attention, executive function, depressive symptoms and quality
      of life.
