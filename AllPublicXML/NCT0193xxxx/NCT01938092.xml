      To determine the efficacy of intravaginal diazepam for the treatment of pelvic pain
      associated with pelvic floor hypertonic disorder.

      Women who are asked to participate will already be receiving a standard conservative therapy
      consisting of a psyllium-based bowel regimen, heat therapy, pelvic stretching exercises, and
      Kegel exercises. Participants will randomly be assigned by a computer-derived random number
      sequence (after pregnancy is ruled out) to either the treatment group (intravaginal diazepam)
      or the placebo group Investigators and patients will be blinded to group assignment. The
      placebo or diazepam tablet will be distributed to the participant in the examining room on
      the day of allocation. The participant will be instructed to insert the diazepam or placebo
      tablet into her vagina at home. The treatment group will insert the diazepam 10 mg vaginal
      tablet 1-2 times daily as needed in addition to the standard conservative therapy. The
      placebo group will receive the standard conservative therapy, and an intravaginal tablet
      (visually indistinguishable from diazepam) commercially produced by the university pharmacy.
      After 4 weeks, patients from either group will have the option of enrolling into a standard
      routine program (not research) of comprehensive pelvic floor rehabilitation therapy. The
      Visual Analog Pain Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 Questionnaire, McGill Pain
      Questionnaire and Global Response Assessment will be completed by the participant at the
      initial visit, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Participants will be given the option of
      choosing one or more methods for returning questionnaires: electronic mail, self-addressed
      home envelope, or telephone call.

    <description>The PFDI-20 is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress (quality-of-life) caused by pelvic floor symptoms. Includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The change in PFDI-20 score from the initial visit will be measured at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Initial visit, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Used to evaluate a person experiencing significant pain. It can be used to monitor the pain over time and to determine the effectiveness of any intervention. It asks the participant what the pain feels like, how it changes with time, and how strong it is. The change in symptoms from baseline measured by this questionnaire will be measured at 4 weeks, 12 weeks ,and 24 weeks.</description>

    <description>Used to evaluate patients' perceptions of treatment effectiveness. The change in the GRA from from the initial visit will be measured at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.</description>
