      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experimental alternative imaging method,
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (abbreviated as NIR), can be used with a controlled respiratory
      system to examine the breasts for cancer. The NIR system uses light beams to produce an image
      or picture of the inside of the breast. The respiratory system will help researchers get more
      information about the breast tissue by changing the amount of oxygen the tissue receives
      during NIR imaging.
