      The purpose of this study is to search for the hereditary (genetic) causes of uterine
      fibroids. Some women with uterine fibroids may have one or more genes that make them more
      likely to develop uterine fibroids. We are trying to identify these genes to better
      understand how and why uterine fibroids develop and to design better treatment options for
      women with uterine fibroids. This information may also help us to understand and treat other
      problems that may be caused by these genes.

      There is little information to predict outcomes of leiomyoma therapies. It is clear that both
      environmental exposures and genetic predisposition influence disease manifestations. Our work
      has identified a new area of genetic linkage for leiomyomas from a genome wide scan. We
      therefore propose to prospectively collect biologic samples that will allow us to analyze
      gene/environment interactions of women enrolled in leiomyoma clinical trials or undergoing
      leiomyoma clinical treatments using the same methodology used previously. Specifically we
      will collect serum aliquots, genomic DNA and information using a genetic epidemiology
      questionnaire. In the short term we will also be able to use prospectively obtained
      information on epidemiologic and anthropomorphic data to characterize women undergoing
      treatment.

    <description>Participants will be females age of 18 or older who have be diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma. Study Subjects will be asked if mothers or siblings also have diagnosis of uterine leoimyoma (either past or present diagnosis) and these family members will be invited to participate in this trial. All participants will provide blood samples for serum aliquots for hormonal analysis and genomic DNA analysis, and will answer a baseline genetic epidemiology questionnaire.</description>
