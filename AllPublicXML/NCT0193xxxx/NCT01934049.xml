  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures incidence grows rapidly with the aging of the population. After indicated
      surgical treatment, hip fracture patients experience high rates of postoperative
      complications, postoperative delirium (PD), postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD),
      leading to poor postoperative recovery during hospitalization, which can cause disability,
      distress for both patients and their families, are associated with other medical
      complications and account for significant additional health care costs. We currently use
      dexmedetomidine in elderly patients with hip fractures undergoing hip hemi-arthroplasty in
      order to improve postoperative recovery and prevent and treating PD and POCD.

      Dexmedetomidine is a drug used for sedation in critically ill patients that provides some
      pain relief and controls the bodies response to stress. The sedation produced by
      dexmedetomidine appears more similar to natural sleep than any other drug used for anesthesia
      and postoperative sedation. Data suggesting that dexmedetomidine can prevent delirium
      following cardiac surgery and the developing understanding of the causes of PD and POCD
      suggest that dexmedetomidine will be particularly effective.

    <description>POCD is assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA), which was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration,executive functions, memory, language,visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking,calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>7days</time_frame>
    <description>The postoperative recovery is assessed by the Post-operative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS),which is a research tool designed to measure postoperative quality of recovery in multiple domains and over multiple time periods. Recovery domains include physiological, emotive (depression and anxiety), nociceptive (pain and nausea), cognitive, activities of daily living (ADL), and overall patient perspective (including satisfaction).</description>
