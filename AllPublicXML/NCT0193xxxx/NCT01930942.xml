      The aim of this study is to find some genetic factors in predicting the sensibility of
      preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For locally advanced rectal carcinoma,preoperative chemoradiotherapy(CRT) achieved similar
      overall survival and better local control compared with postoperative therapy,so it was
      considered to be one of the standard therapy of these patients.But,not every one will be
      cured,the possible reason is the difference gene expression and mutation status among
      patients.So,we performed this trial to study the relationship between genetic factors and
      response of preoperative CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.
