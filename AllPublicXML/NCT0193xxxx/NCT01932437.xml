    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and local tolerability of single intramuscular (IM)
      doses of ETI-204; to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single IM dose of ETI-204; and
      to evaluate the immunogenicity of a single IM dose of ETI-204.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females or males ≥18 years of age;

          2. All females regardless of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1;

          3. Females of childbearing potential (i.e., not postmenopausal or surgically sterile)
             must agree to practice abstinence or to use a medically accepted method of
             contraception from the time of Screening through 30 days after the final study visit.
             Acceptable methods of contraception include diaphragm/cervical cap with spermicide;
             sponge with spermicide; condom with spermicide; or intrauterine device with condom or
             spermicide. The following contraceptive methods are acceptable only when used with a
             condom and spermicide: birth control pills, birth control patches, vaginal ring,
             hormone under the skin, or hormone injections;

          4. Postmenopausal females, defined as females who have had amenorrhea for at least 12
             months either naturally or following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments,
             and have a follicle stimulating hormone level of &gt;40 mIU/mL at Screening;

          5. Females who have undergone surgical sterilization, including hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, or tubal essure;

          6. Males must agree to practice abstinence or use a condom with spermicide and to refrain
             from sperm donation from Screening during the study and for 30 days after the final
             study visit;

          7. Provide written informed consent;

          8. Willing to comply with study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Body weight &gt;100 kg;

          2. Body mass index ≥32 kg/m2;

          3. Pregnant or lactating female;

          4. Clinically significant comorbidity that would interfere with completion of the study
             procedures or objectives, or compromise the subject's safety;

          5. Supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥150 mmHg or ≤90 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥95 mmHg;

          6. Use of H1 receptor antagonists (i.e., antihistamines) within 5 days prior to Day 1;

          7. Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months of Day 1 as determined by the
             Investigator;

          8. Positive test result for drugs of abuse (with the exception of medically prescribed
             drugs) at Screening or on Day -1;

          9. Positive test for alcohol at Screening, subject to Investigator's discretion. Subjects
             who test positive for alcohol at Day -1 are excluded from the study;

         10. Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent at Day 1 (whichever is longer);

         11. Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;

         12. Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplant;

         13. Positive test for Hepatitis B (surface antigen), Hepatitis C, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at Screening;

         14. History of prior treatment for anthrax exposure or prior anthrax infection;

         15. Prior immunization with any approved or investigational anthrax vaccine or prior

             14 days) of systemic steroid therapy is allowed, provided it concluded more than 6
             months prior to Day 1;

         18. Donation or loss of &gt;500 mL of blood within 30 days or plasma within 7 days of Day 1;

             or urinalysis) at Screening. Out of range tests may be repeated to confirm;

         24. History of allergic or hypersensitivity reaction or hives to other therapeutic
             antibodies or immunoglobulins;

         25. History of any malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years, with the exception of
