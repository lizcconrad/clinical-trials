  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability of older adults to improve their muscle strength through exercise training
      appears related to how well their immune system functions. Thus, a nutritional supplement
      which improves immune function could theoretically boost strength gained for older adults
      from exercise. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if a nutritional supplement
      has any effect on immune function.

      Veterans (age 60-80 yrs, N=12) be randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion to
      consume supplement or placebo for four weeks. After two weeks of consumption, subjects will
      be treated with a vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Blood will be drawn from
      each subject before and after vaccination to determine the effects of the supplement on
      immune response to vaccination. Additionally, subjects will undergo blood draw and muscle
      biopsy before and after two weeks of supplementation to determine the effects of
      supplementation on other measures of immune function (e.g. cytokine and growth factor
      levels). This is an important issue due to the serious health consequences associated with
      muscle loss in older adults and the need for improved strategies for rehabilitation.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 and 2 weeks post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The study will randomize subjects to consume supplement or placebo for 4-weeks. After two weeks of consumption, subjects will be vaccinated against tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria. Blood will be drawn before and at two time points after vaccination. Change in antibody titer against the vaccine antigens will be calculated. A comparison between groups will determine if supplementation improves the antibody response to vaccination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gene expression and protein levels in muscle and/or blood.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2-weeks of supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>The study will determine whether markers of inflammation in serum (e.g. C-reactive protein and cytokines) or blood mononuclear cells are decreased by the nutritional supplement. Blood will be drawn before and after periods of supplementation. The groups will be compared for protein and gene expression levels. The study will also determine whether supplementation affects muscle expression of genes associated with inflammation or tissue growth and remodeling. Muscle biopsies will be collected before and after two weeks of supplementation.</description>
