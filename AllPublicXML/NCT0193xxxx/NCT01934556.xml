    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; regimen
      (increasing the time between visits when the disease is stable and not getting worse) of
      Ranibizumab 0.3 mg injections inside the eye is safe and effective at treating patients with
      swelling of the retina from diabetes.

    <textblock>
      This research study will compare the visual outcomes between a group of patients who are
      treated with monthly injections of Ranibizumab 0.3 mg and two groups of patients who are
      treated with the &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; regimen. One of the &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; groups will also
      receive laser therapy to determine if this has any additional beneficial effects.

    <description>(60 eyes) - Monthly intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab for four visits. At the fourth visit (Week 12), if the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm then the eye will receive 0.3 mg ranibizumab and begin the extension phase of the study. For all subsequent visits in the extension phase, appropriate changes to the treatment interval with 0.3 mg ranibizumab (i.e. extend, maintain, reduce) will be made based on pre-specified SD (Spectral Domain)-OCT criteria. Treatment is rendered at every visit. The time between visits is individualized based on each subject's response to treatment. If the central foveal thickness is &gt; 325 μm at week 12, then the patient will continue to receive monthly intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab until the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm. Once the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm, then the study eye will begin the extension phase of the study.</description>

    <description>(60 eyes) - Monthly intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab for four visits combined with guided laser photocoagulation to all microaneurysms in the area of DME at visit 2 (Week 4) and then again every 3 months, if leakage is present on fluorescein angiography. If the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm at visit 4 (Week 12), eyes will receive 0.3 mg ranibizumab and the extension phase will begin. For all subsequent visits in the extension phase, appropriate changes to the treatment interval with 0.3 mg ranibizumab (i.e. extend, maintain, reduce) will be made based on pre-specified SD-Optical coherence tomography criteria. If the central foveal thickness is &gt; 325 μm at week 12, then the patient will continue to receive monthly intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab and possible guided laser every 3 months until the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm. Once the central foveal thickness is ≤ 325 μm, then the study eye will begin the extension phase of the study.</description>

             patient, then the eye in consideration will be excluded.

          -  Evidence of vitreomacular interface abnormality or epiretinal membranes which may be
             responsible for macular edema
