    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of romidepsin when given
      together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and to see how well they
      work in treating patients with metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. Romidepsin may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving romidepsin and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation may be an effective treatment for inflammatory breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the safety of the combination of romidepsin plus Abraxane (paclitaxel
           albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) delivered weekly. (Phase I)

        2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of romidepsin with full dose weekly
           Abraxane to define a recommended phase II doses of the combination. (Phase I)

        3. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with human epidermal growth
           factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, newly diagnosed metastatic inflammatory breast cancer
           treated with the combination of romidepsin and Abraxane. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of romidepsin and Abraxane.

        2. To determine the adverse event profile of the combination of romidepsin and Abraxane.

        3. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients
           with newly recurrent inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) treated with the combination of
           romidepsin and Abraxane.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of romidepsin followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes and romidepsin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
