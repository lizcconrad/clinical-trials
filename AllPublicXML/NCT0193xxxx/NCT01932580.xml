  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is commonly treated with chemotherapy
      before and after surgery. The chemotherapy regimen used in our institution, called DCF
      (docetaxel,cisplatic, 5-fluorouracil) is active, resulting in tumor reduction and dysphagia
      relief. however, it is toxic, causing approximately half of patients severe inflammation of
      the mucosa (lining) of the mouth and gut. This results, in turn, in mouth sores, vomiting and
      diarrhea. Similar regimen called FLOT (5-FU, oxaliplatin,docetaxel) appears to be at least
      equally active, but less toxic.

      Our ultimate plan is to perform a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT. Before embarking
      upon this, we are conducting this pilot trial in 10 subjects with the FLOT regimen. If less
      than 5 patients develop severe mouth sores, vomiting or diarrhea, plans will be made to
      proceed with the next trial, a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastro-esophageal junction
             (GEJ), or lower third of the esophagus.

          -  The tumor must be deemed by the team to be potentially resectable. This includes
             imaging studies (detailed below) to clinically stage the tumor and rule out the
             presence of metastatic disease, and includes a preoperative laparoscopic evaluation.

          -  Stage IB (T1N1 only), II, IIIA, IIIB, and IV (T4N1 only)

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (i.e. restricted in physically strenuous activity but
             ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light
             house work, office work).

          -  Adequate hematologic reserve: Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000
             microlitre, WBC greater than or equal to 2000 microlitre,

          -  Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 ml/min, AST &amp; ALT less than or equal
             to 2 ULN, Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 ULN, bilirubin less than or
             equal ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic therapy for gastric cancer

          -  Prior docetaxel-containing chemotherapy

          -  Pre-existing medical conditions precluding treatment, including any contraindication
             for major surgery

          -  Pregnancy or lactating mothers. Women of childbearing age must use contraception
             during and for 3 months following treatment

          -  Inability to give informed consent

          -  Inability to maintain nutrition by oral consumption of food alone must have additional
             enteral feeding.

          -  Macroscopic disease noted at laparoscopy

          -  ECOG peformance status of 3 or higher

          -  Unwillingness to undergo investigations and/or treatment as outlined on the study
