    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized into the control or intervention group. Based on patient
      preference, the intervention group will be trained for one hour in either individual or group
      format on vegan diet. They will also be directed to www.pcrm.org and www.drmarymd.com for low
      glycemic, animal free, low fat food options and support. The control group will continue
      their normal omnivorous diet program. Twenty-four hour food recalls will be obtained at the
      start and end of the trial, and once a week for the 6 weeks of the trial by telephone.
      Patients will undergo a final interview at the end of the 6 week study period. The
      intervention group should strive to obtain 90% of their calories from plants. They will be
      encouraged to eat freely and not count calories. Patients will undergo additional individual
      consultation as needed to promote compliance and answer specific questions.

      Over the 6 weeks, the Patient Global Improvement of Change (PGIC) and the 36 item short form
      health survey (SF-36) will be performed weekly by telephone. Patient will perform a Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) of their pain level randomly daily on their own. C-reactive protein levels
      will be assessed at the beginning and end of the study at Munson Medical Center Laboratories
      as a secondary measure of diet changes.

      There have been no published prospective randomized controlled trials assessing whether a
      vegan diet would benefit osteoarthritis. The specific aim of this study is to determine if a
      vegan diet will result in subjective reduction in perceived pain and limitations to function
      in patients with osteoarthritis.
