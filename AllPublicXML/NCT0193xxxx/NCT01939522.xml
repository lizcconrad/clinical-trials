  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children/ young people with diabetes may be at a higher risk of acquiring certain infections.
      These infections include those caused by a bacterium called the pneumococcus which can cause
      pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections. In the UK older children with diabetes are given a
      vaccine against the pneumococcus bug called Pneumovax (or PPS23 for short). Although PPS23
      causes a good immune response in children over 2 years of age it is not actually known how
      well PPS23 protects against infection in children of any age. In addition there is some data
      in adults and children that PPS23 may result in a reduced response to future doses of
      pneumococcal vaccines (hyporesponsiveness). Because of the lack of information on how well
      PPS23 protects and potential hyporesponsiveness the investigators would like to study the use
      of an alternative vaccine against pneumococcus called Prevenar13 (or pCV13). This vaccine is
      known to be safe and to work well in babies and young children and there have been no
      concerns about hyporesponsiveness. It has been approved for use in children up to 17 years of
      age but there is little information on the size and duration of immune response to PCV13 in
      children aged 6 years and older.
