  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-reported sleep complaints are common in peri- and postmenopausal women and have been
      identified as a key symptom of the menopausal transition. The MsFLASH study, A Pilot Trial of
      Telephone-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Midlife Women with Menopause-related Sleep
      Disturbance, is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm clinical trial. The
      target population will include women in general good health, aged 40-65 years, who report
      symptoms of insomnia (trouble sleeping) and who are bothered by hot flashes. We plan to
      enroll 100 women from Seattle, Washington and surrounding areas into the trial. Half of the
      women will be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention and half to receive
      the behavioral control.

      The intervention arm participants will receive 6 sessions of a telephone-based,
      cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for insomnia (CBT-I), based on state-of-the-art
      methods and specifically targeted to women with menopause-related sleep disturbance (CBT-I).
      The control arm participants will receive telephone-based Menopause Education Control (MEC)
      that includes elements of sleep hygiene. Assessments for both groups will be collected at
      baseline (pre-randomization), 8-week post-randomization, and 6-month post-randomization.

      The inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to target broadly those midlife women who have
      menopause-related sleep disturbance and also report being bothered by vasomotor symptoms.
      This target population defines the clinical population seeking treatment for relief of
      menopause-related sleep problems. Exclusion criteria are kept minimal and intended only to
      exclude women with significant medical problems likely to account for their sleep problems
      (instead of menopause), or likely to interfere with their ability to participate in the
      intervention. We include women taking hormone therapy or other medication who meet these
      criteria because they are part of the population seeking clinical care for relief of sleep
      disturbances.

      Our primary objective is to develop an intervention that is generalizable to the greatest
      number of women and maximally translatable into real-world primary care practice.

    <description>The primary outcome is insomnia symptoms as assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The primary objective of this pilot trial is to determine the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) vs. Menopause Education Control (MEC) in improving insomnia symptoms among mid-life women with menopause-related sleep disturbance. 24-week follow-up will be additionally assessed.</description>

    <description>Participants will have contact with a menopause counselor 6 times over 8 weeks. The first session will be in-person at a private research office. All other contacts will be by telephone. Women unable to attend the in-person session will receive a phone call. All in-person and telephone consultations will be 20-30 minutes.
Participants will receive reading materials before each phone call relating to menopausal changes, menopausal changes in sleep and strategies for lessening menopause related sleep disturbances. A daily sleep diary will be completed each week during the 8-week intervention period. The day before each telephone session, the participant will email that week's completed diary to a secure email address accessible only by the counselor; women who are unable to use email will provide their data by telephone directly to the counselor. During the weekly telephone calls, the reading and materials will be discussed and the sleep diary will be reviewed.</description>
