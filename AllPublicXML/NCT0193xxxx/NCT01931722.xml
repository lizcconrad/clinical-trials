  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Likely, branched chain amino acid (BCAA) requirements are increased in older strength-trained
      (ST) individuals. If so, supplementation in this group will maximize muscle protein synthesis
      (MPS) and minimize loss of muscle with age (sarcopenia).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the dietary requirement for the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in an
      older strength-trained (ST) population will be greater than the current recommendation (RDA).
      If so, a greater intake of BCAA together with ST is necessary if one aims to maximize muscle
      protein synthesis (MPS). Currently, the BCAA requirement in the ST older population (55-65 y)
      is unknown. This is critical information especially given the value of ST for overall health.

    <description>Strength training will include a split-training program using all major muscle groups of the body on a three day &quot;on&quot;, one day &quot;off&quot; protocol. Muscle areas targeted on each training day will be as follows: Day1: chest, shoulder, triceps; Day2: back, biceps; Day3: legs and calfs; Day4: will be a rest day. On Day5: this cycle will begin again. A combination of free weights and machines will be used for each training day. Progressive overload protocol will be applied where the load used by every participant will be adjusted bi-weekly based on their 70% of 1RM (repetition maximum). Instruction will be provided for all exercises and professional trainers will oversee all training sessions.</description>
