      The purpose of this study is to see if a drug called Candesartan will help to reduce use of
      cocaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The noradrenergic system may play an important role in cocaine addiction in humans.
      Angiotensin II (Ang II) is known to enhance noradrenergic activity, which contributes to
      effects on blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system responses to stress. Inhibition of
      Ang II has been shown to reduce cravings for stimulants, including cocaine and
      methamphetamine.

      This clinical trial among 75 cocaine-dependent subjects is designed to test the efficacy of
      the Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, Candesartan, for treatment of cocaine dependence. The
      results of this study will provide medical safety and efficacy data, and will guide future
      pharmacotherapy trials using this class of medications for cocaine addiction.

      This 8-week trial includes a 1-week titration of the medication and 7-weeks of full dose
      medication (weeks 2-8), with all subjects receiving the active agent.

      At the conclusion of the trial, subjects who wish to be referred to an appropriate treatment
      program or treatment research program will be assisted with a referral.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for study entry, all subjects must satisfy the following criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 64 years inclusive;

          2. Females either must be of non-child bearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized or
             postmenopausal) or must be using adequate contraception, have a negative pregnancy
             test, and must agree to continue to use such precautions for the duration of the
             study.

          3. Meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR)
             criteria for a principal diagnosis of cocaine dependence as confirmed by the MINI
             and/or as per PI/study investigator's examination of the patient during screening.
             (Per DSM-IV-TR, principal diagnosis is the condition that is the primary target of
             treatment at the time of presentation);

          4. Motivated to discontinue or reduce cocaine use during the period of the study, as
             evidenced both by the judgment of the Investigator or designee and by the subject's
             compliance level with the requirement for attendance at clinic visits such that the
             urine sample requirements for inclusion criteria #6 is fully met;

          5. Has a positive pattern of cocaine usage as determined by provision of at least one
             cocaine positive urine sample (benzoylecgonine (BE) level at least 300 ng/ml) during
             the screening period; typically conducted over a 7-14 day period.

          3. Subject is currently taking a dopaminergic, dopamine-blocking, dopamine-modulating, or
             other central dopamine-altering drug (e.g., antipsychotic drugs); a monoamine oxidase
             inhibitor (MAOI); or an opiate antagonist;

          4. Subject has an unstable medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness that would
             interfere with the subject's safety, ability to participate in the study, or the
             interpretability of data. Subjects who meet the DSM-IV-R criteria for psychosis,
             schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or clinically significant suicidal ideation as
             assessed by the PI/study investigator and/or the MINI will be excluded. Subjects who
             have been taking stable doses of antidepressants for at least 3 months at the time the
             consent is signed will be allowed onto the study unless those antidepressants are of
             the types specified under exclusion criteria #3,above;

          5. Subject is dependent on benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates

             hypertension, a current cardiac condition, and those having a high risk of
             cardiovascular disease, seizure disorder, or another significant underlying medical
             condition which would contraindicate Candesartan treatment;

          9. Upon review of a compilation of screening data, at the discretion of the PI/study
             investigator, a participant may be excluded from the study if they test positive
