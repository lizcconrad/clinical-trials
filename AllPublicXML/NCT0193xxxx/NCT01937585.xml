  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether female partners of African American men can
      promote initiation of a discussion with a healthcare provider about prostate cancer screening
      when the partner is supported by a print message designed to provide relevant information and
      strategies for her to use in this effort.

      Objective: Although AA men are at elevated risk for prostate cancer (Pca), medical guidelines
      do not present consistent screening recommendations for this group. However, all guidelines
      stress the need for screening decision making with a provider. This study evaluated the
      effectiveness of a brochure designed for the female partners of AA men, designed to help
      promote such discussion on the part of their mates. We also explored the effect of the
      partner's monitoring style (i.e., the extent to which the partner typically attends to health
      threats) on promoting discussion.

      Methods: Female partners of AA men (N=231) were randomized to receive either a Pca screening
      CDC brochure for AA men, combined with a &quot;partner&quot; brochure containing strategies to promote
      men's initiation of a provider visit to discuss screening, or the CDC brochure only, and
      completed pre- and post-intervention surveys online.

      Conclusions: High monitoring partners may be effective in influencing their AA mates to
      initiate provider discussion, particularly when tailored messaging is provided.
