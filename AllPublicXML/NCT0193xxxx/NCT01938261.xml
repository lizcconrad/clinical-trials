    <textblock>
      Present randomized, controlled, double-blind trial investigates the efficacy and safety of
      early (&lt;24 h) intravenous paracetamol therapy for both the early closure of the ductus and
      pain medication in very small premature infants. This phase 2 drug study focuses on the
      efficacy and safety of short-term use. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      paracetamol, as well as the long-term effects, are studied.

      This study recruits preterm infants born less than 32 weeks gestational age and treated at
      the neonatal intensive care unit of Oulu University Hospital. The informed consent is asked
      from all parents. The first drug dose is given before 24 hours of age. Masked study drug is
      paracetamol infusion solution 10 mg/mL (PERFALGAN ®) or placebo, 0.45% saline solution. The
      loading dose is 20 mg/kg, and the maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days. The
      exact date of the closure of ductus is studied by repeated echocardiographic examinations.
      The symptoms of pain are screened by a locally used pain scale of preterm infants (NIAPAS).
      Patients are monitored for signs of possible side effects. After discharge from hospital,
      patients are examined at follow-up clinic for the first year every 3 months and at 2 years of
      age.
