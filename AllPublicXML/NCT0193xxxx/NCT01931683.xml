  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators attempted to determine the optimal effect-site concentration of
      remifentanil for smooth removal of the LMA from propofol anesthesia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of the surgery, propofol infusion was stopped and remifentanil was titrated to
      predetermined (initial concentration 1.0 ng/ml for the first patient). LMA removal was
      performed when the patients opened their eyes and spontaneous respiration and adequate tidal
      volume and ventilatory frequency were confirmed.
