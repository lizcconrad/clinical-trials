  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Vitamin E and Choline in children or adolescents with
      well-characterized and liver biopsy confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be enrolled.
      They will be randomized to treatment with DHA, VIT E and Choline (n=30)or an identical
      placebo (n=30) given orally for a period of 12 months. All patients will be included in a
      lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements
      and physical exercise.

      Patients will undergo a medical evaluation every three months during the 12-month study
      period. Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. Anthropometric analysis,
      laboratory tests, including liver enzymes and lipids will be repeated at 3-month intervals
      during the 12-months study duration. Ultrasonography of the liver will be repeated after six
      months at the end of the study period.
