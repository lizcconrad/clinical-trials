      This post approval, observational study is being conducted to further evaluate the safety of
      the NovaSure Endometrial Ablation System when it is performed in the presence of Essure
      micro-inserts.

      A prospective, single arm, multi-center, post approval study that is designed to provide
      additional information on the safety of performing a NovaSure Impedence Controlled
      Endometrial Ablation System in the presence of Essure Permanent Birth Control System,
      following the Essure Confirmation Test has confirmed both bilateral tubal occlusion and the
      satisfactory location of the Essure micro-inserts. The study will be conducted at up to 15
      clinical sites and enroll 318 patients. Patients who meet the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria will have the study explained to them and be invited to participate.
      Enrolled subjects will have baseline data collected at the time of their NovaSure procedure
      and will be followed for 1 month after the NovaSure procedure to be assessed for adverse
      events.

    <description>The NovaSure Endometrial Ablation device consists of a disposable single-use, conformable bipolar electrode array mounted on an expandable frame that can create a confluent lesion on the entire interior surface area of the uterine cavity. The device is inserted transcervically into the uterine cavity, and the sheath is retracted to allow the bipolar electrode array to be deployed and conform to the uterine cavity. The disposable device works in conjunction with a dedicated NovaSure RF (radio frequency) controller to perform customized, global endometrial ablation.</description>

        Premenopausal women 18 years of age or older who have abnormal uterine bleeding and are
        candidates for a NovaSure Endometrial Ablation that have already had an Essure Permanent
        Birth Control system procedure and an Essure Confirmation Test that has confirmed both
        bilateral tubal occlusion and the satisfactory location of the Essure micro-inserts.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older and premenopausal.

          -  Subject's gynecological history supports the use of NovaSure endometrial ablation for
             the treatment of menorrhagia.

          -  Subject has had an Essure Permanent Birth Control System procedure.

          -  The Essure Confirmation Test has confirmed both bilateral tubal occlusion and
             satisfactory placement of the Essure micro-inserts. A written report or ECT radiologic
             films need to be provided by the physician who performed the ECT. If neither is
             available, the ECT must be repeated prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known or suspected endometrial carcinoma (uterine cancer) or pre-malignant
             conditions of the endometrium, such as unresolved (atypical) adenomatous hyperplasia.

          -  Subject has abnormal/obstructive uterine cavity as confirmed by hysteroscopy or other
             imaging study (e.g. congenital malformation, large fibroid or large polyp)

          -  Subject with any anatomic condition (e.g. history of previous classical cesarean
             section or transmural myomectomy) or pathologic condition (e.g. long term medical
             therapy) that could lead to weakening of the myometrium.

          -  Subject has an active genital or urinary tract infection at the time of the procedure
             (e.g., cervicitis, vaginitis, endometritis, salpingitis, or cystitis).

          -  Subject has an intrauterine device (IUD) currently in place.

          -  Subject has active pelvic inflammatory disease or history of recent pelvic infection.

          -  Subject has undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

          -  ECT unable to adequately assess bilateral tubal occlusion and proper micro-insert
             placement.

          -  Subject has uterine sound measurement greater than 10 cm.

          -  Subject with a uterine cavity length less than 4 cm.

          -  Subject with a uterine cavity width less than 2.5 cm, as determined by the width dial
             of the disposable NovaSure device following device deployment.

          -  Subject is unable to comply with the protocol and be available for follow up

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject has a medical condition that precludes
             safe participation in the study.
