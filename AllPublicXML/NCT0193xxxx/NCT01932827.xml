  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oat fibre consumption has been shown to lower blood cholesterol, which is advantageous for
      heart health. Oat and fibre claims on food labels should help people find heart healthy food
      choices; however consumer attitudes and understanding of such claims are unknown.

      The objective of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and understanding to different
      types of permitted oat fibre claims.

    <measure>Response to survey questions measuring attitudes towards sodium claims using 5-point likert rating scales</measure>
    <time_frame>On average the survey took 25 minutes to complete</time_frame>
    <description>Within an online survey, participants were exposed to 4 mock cereal packages that differed only by the claim it carried. After being exposed to each mock package, participants were asked to rate their perceived attractiveness, healthiness, credibility, usefulness of the tested oat fibre claims using 5-point likert scales. Participants were also asked to rate their purchasing intentions of the mock cereal product with the different oat fibre claims</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response to survey questions evaluating participants understanding of oat fibre claims</measure>
    <time_frame>On average the survey took 25 minutes to complete</time_frame>
    <description>After each mock cereal package, understanding of oat fibre claims was evaluated using various survey methods. First, participants were asked to rate their perceived clarity of the wording of the claim using a 5-point likert scale (a subjective measure of understanding). Second, participants were ask to rate, on 5-point likert scales, the perceived benefit of consuming the mock package for subgroups with different health conditions (an indirect measure of understanding). Finally we asked participants, in an open ended question, to explain what a claim means to a friend (an objective measure of understanding).</description>
