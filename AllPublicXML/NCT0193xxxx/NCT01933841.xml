  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) provide anesthesiologists with powerful intraoperative
      tools, but their use carries the potential risk of serious postoperative complications.
      NMBD-induced muscle weakness that lingers into the postoperative period, known as
      postoperative residual curarization (PORC), is present in as many as 40% of all patients that
      receive neuromuscular blocking agents. The Post Anesthesia Care Unit will be introducing
      monitoring as part of standard of care. This study will collect data about patients who
      receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of PORC.

      Our study is designed to test the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: The initiation of quantitative TOF monitoring as part of the standard PACU
      entry evaluation will change practitioner behavior in a manner that decreases the incidence
      of PORC in surgical patients at VUMC.

      Hypothesis 2: The initiation of the routine TOF monitoring program will decrease the
      incidence of short- and long-term postoperative complications at VUMC.

      Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) provide anesthesiologists with powerful intraoperative
      tools, but their use carries the potential risk of serious postoperative complications.
      NMBD-induced muscle weakness that lingers into the postoperative period, known as
      postoperative residual curarization (PORC), is present in as many as 40% of all patients that
      receive neuromuscular blocking agents. Physiological data suggest that PORC impairs normal
      respiratory function, and compelling evidence suggests PORC impairs clinical recovery in the
      immediate postoperative period and prolongs PACU length of stay. However, despite the
      widespread use of NMBDs and the frequent occurrence of PORC, limitations in the literature
      prevent an understanding of their full impact on clinical outcomes. This study will collect
      data about patients who receive NMBDs and examine the impact of monitoring on incidences of
      PORC.

      The incidence of PORC and postoperative complications after the introduction of monitoring in
      the PACU will be determined by measuring TOF ratios and tracking the postoperative outcomes
      in the surgical patients over time.

    <description>This aim will test the hypothesis that initiation of quantitative Train-Of-Four monitoring as part of the standard PACU entry evaluation will change practitioner behavior in a manner that decreases the incidence of PORC in surgical patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Quantitative TOF monitoring will be introduced as a standard component of the PACU entry evaluation for all patients that receive NMBDs as part of their care. It is expected that the proportion of patients with TOF &lt; 0.9 will decrease over time after initiation of the routine monitoring system.</description>
