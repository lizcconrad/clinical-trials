  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to do a cluster randomized trial to test the effect of
      different educational programs for staff according to nursing home patients FI (fecal
      incontinence). Since there are very few published trials of treatment of FI in older people,
      and no rigorously evaluated studies on interventions for FI in nursing homes, or rigorously
      evaluated continence education program for staff concerning continence care, a pilot study is
      necessary. The aim for the pilot study is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and
      adherence according to the educational intervention, methods used and outcome measures. This
      is designed to be an external pilot study. External pilot studies are small scale versions of
      the main study which are not intended to be part of the main study. The pilot intervention
      period is 3 month.

    <description>Educational and counselling program: In addition to educational meeting and printed educational material the investigators will include the use of local opinion leaders and educational outreach .

Opinion leadership is the degree to which an individual is able to influence other individual's attitudes or overt behavior informally in a desired way with relative frequency.
