    <textblock>
      This project seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications have
      limited efficacy in Late Life Depression (LLD) in order to develop new treatment
      interventions for this prevalent and disabling illness. We hypothesize that the presence of
      executive dysfunction (ED),which is common in depressed adults over 60, impairs the ability
      to form appropriate expectancies of improvement with antidepressant treatment. Greater
      expectancy has been shown to improve antidepressant treatment outcome and is hypothesized to
      be a primary mechanism of placebo effects. Moreover, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more prevalent in patients with LLD compared to healthy
      controls. It has been argued that WMH contribute to the pathogenesis of LLD with ED and
      decrease the efficacy of antidepressant medications by disrupting connections between
      prefrontal cortical (PFC) and subcortical structures. Vascular lesions to white matter tracts
      may also compromise the pathway by which expectancy-based placebo effects influence
      depressive symptoms. Expectancies reflect activation in PFC areas that may improve depressive
      symptoms by modulating the activity of subcortical regions subserving negative affective
      systems (i.e., amygdala) as well as those important in reward and hedonic capacity (nucleus
      accumbens and ventral striatum). Thus, LLD patients withED and WMH may sustain a &quot;double-hit&quot;
      to their ability to experience placebo effects in antidepressant treatments: ED diminishes
      the ability to generate appropriate treatment expectancies, while WMH disrupt the physiologic
      pathways by which expectancies lead to improvement in depressive symptoms.

      To determine whether decreased antidepressant medication response in LLD patients with ED and
      WMH is caused by a loss of expectancy effects, we will evaluate 130 outpatients with LLD at
      baseline to determine their degree of ED (interference score on Stroop Color-Word Test), WMH
      burden (severity score on Fazekas modified Coffey Rating Scale derived from anatomical MRI),
      and white matter tract integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]). Building on work
      from my K23 Award, we will manipulate participants' expectancy of improvement in an 8-week
      duration antidepressant trial by randomizing them between open administration of escitalopram
      (i.e., high expectancy) and placebo-controlled administration of escitalopram (i.e., low
      expectancy). The difference in antidepressant response observed between open and
      placebo-controlled medication treatment is a measure of the expectancy contribution to
      outcome, which is substantial in younger depressed adults but we hypothesize will be
      diminished in LLD patients with ED and WMH.
