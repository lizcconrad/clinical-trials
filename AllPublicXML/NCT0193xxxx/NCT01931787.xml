      This pilot clinical trial studies CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid) in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. CPI-613 may interfere with the
      growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities in patients with relapsed or refractory
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have failed 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-3.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of responders as the percent of patients who are SD, PR and CR will be estimated, as well as RR (sum of PR + CR) and disease control rate (DCR, which is the sum of SD, PR and CR). 95% confidence intervals will be included.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival curves for PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier techniques. In addition, the 6 month and 1-year PFS rates will be estimated. Median PFS will be estimated as well.</description>
