      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of gefitinib as
      third-line retreatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation
      patients who had benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment with EGFR 19del/L858R positive
      mutation and tumor progression after the second-line chemotherapy

      -  Primary Study Objective: To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of gefitinib as
           third-line retreatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation
           patients who had benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment with EGFR 19del/L858R
           positive mutation and tumor progression after the second-line chemotherapy

        -  Secondary Study Objectives: To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), progressive-free
           survival (PFS), overall survival(OS) and quality of life (QoL) of gefitinib as
           third-line retreatment in NSCLC patients To evaluate the safety of gefitinib as
           third-line treatment in NSCLC patients

        -  Exploratory analyses: To dynamically monitor EGFR mutation status and explore the
           relationship with clinical outcome

          2. Male or female aged 18 years or older;

          3. Subjects were diagnosed with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC before starting the first dose of
             gefitinib third-line treatment;

          4. EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutation confirmed;

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2;

          6. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks or longer;

          7. Has at least one measureable lesion by RECIST 1.1;

          8. NSCLC of enrolled subjects previously progressed after first-line gefitinib treatment
             (PFS ≥ 6 months) and progressed again after second-line chemotherapy (not limited for
             chemotherapy regimen, ≥ 4 cycles of chemotherapy). Investigator considers adopting
             third-line gefitinib retreatment;

          9. Criteria for laboratory examinations:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2 times upper
                  limit of normal; for subjects with hepatic metastasis, AST,ALT≤ 5 times upper
                  limit of normal

               -  Creatinine clearance≥45ml/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any ingredients of the product;

          2. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the EGFR axis except gefitinib
             (e.g. erlotinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab) ;
