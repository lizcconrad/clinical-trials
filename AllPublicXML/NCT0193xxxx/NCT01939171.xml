      To determine the efficacy and Security of Thymoglobuline in cadaveric donor Efficacy: To
      demonstrate that in cadaveric donor, Thymoglobuline diminished graft alloreactivity by
      decreasing expression of inflammatory markers in graft biopsies Security:To demonstrate that
      the administration of Thymoglobulin does not have side effects in renal recipients.

      This is randomized controlled Multicenter phase II clinical trial promoted by members from
      IdiPAZ. At least two hospital (La Paz and Santa Maria from Lisbon, will be involved. A per
      nature pilot study will recruit 10 cadaver donors from each hospital, and randomized
      half-to-half per center, for study and control groups.

      The RCT initiated in 2009 and finished in 2013.

      Cadaver donor from the study group will receive 3 mg/kg iv. Thymoglobulin 3-6 hours prior to
      organ procurement. The randomization process recruits 1:1 study/control donors.

      Kidney biopsies will be taken from each kidney before transplantation to examine the
      expression of pro-inflammatory and HLA molecules (anti-DR, VCAM, ICAM, E-selectin) at tubular
      cells by immunohistochemical techniques under blinded conditions.

      Recipients will be managed as usual and expressly followed up for one year, recording the
      incidence of delayed graft function and rejection and graft survival at the first year.

      A comparison between the results obtained in kidney biopsies and patients transplanted in
      each group will permit differentiate whether Thymoglobulin administered in cadaver modifies
      the expression of antigens by kidney tubular cells and the results obtained with
      transplantation, in terms of graft function, rejection and survival.
