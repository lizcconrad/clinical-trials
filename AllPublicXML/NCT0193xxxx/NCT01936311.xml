    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether having patients identify a self-management goal
      (health goal), prior to a visit with their primary care provider, leads to health behavior
      improvement over six weeks.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Single item measure of self rated health:
&quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week? (1=Very Poor, 7=Excellent)?&quot;
We will compare scores between groups as well as change over 6-weeks between groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behavior improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome measure will include a measure of behavior specific improvements. We will evaluate both component improvements for their specified behavior, as well as the composite score of negative health behaviors assessed from a series of questions.</description>
