  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data support the hypothesis that the administration of AHRO-001 reduces LDL
      cholesterol levels, improves HDL function, and finally, decreases atheromatous plaque burden.

      4 sequential dosing cohorts, each cohort beginning with single dose (SDD), single day
      exposure, followed by one week of multiple daily dosing (MDD) with bid exposure, a 4 day drug
      honeymoon, then one week of MDD utilizing tid exposure. Each subsequent cohort utilizes the
      same SDD/MDD design, starting with SDD higher than prior SDD but a SDD significantly lower
      than prior tid MDD cohort just completed, the overall goal being to provide gradually
      increasing dose exposure contingent on satisfactory safety and tolerability of lower doses in
      the previous groups. Cohort 4 (MDD) utilizes best dose determined by Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3 for 21
      days.

      Estimated Duration of Subject Participation: 8-9 weeks

      Under Protocol Amendment Version 5.0, an additional cohort, Cohort 5, will concomitantly
      enroll 48 volunteers randomized to receive either AHRO-001 or placebo. Volunteers included in
      the study may be either currently receiving or not receiving a statin treatment. The 48
      volunteers in Cohort 5 will thus be allocated to 3 treatment groups with 16 volunteers
      enrolled per group:

      Group A: AHRO-001 alone Group B: Statin + AHRO-001 Group C: Placebo

      SUBJECT POPULATION:

      Healthy volunteers, both males &amp; infertile females, with asymptomatic mild to moderate
      hypercholesterolemia

Next dose can be started as soon as 6 volunteers will finish 2 weeks of administration of the previous dose. All dose increases occur only after drug washout and are only undertaken after medical review of the previous dose as determined by symptoms, vital signs, clinical examination, clinical laboratory results, urinalyses, electrocardiograms and adverse event reporting declares that progression of dosing is safe and appropriate</description>
