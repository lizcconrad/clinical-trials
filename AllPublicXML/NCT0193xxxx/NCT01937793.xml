  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the treatment efficacy of 8 weeks swallowing exercise
      programs for patients with NPC after radiation therapy. This study also compares two
      different swallowing exercise: effortful swallow and Mendelsohn's maneuver, to see which one
      can bring more benefits to patients after a certain period of exercise training. Three
      assessment tools are selected to evaluate the study result: Mann Assessment of Swallowing
      Ability (MASA), videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and Chinese version Swallowing
      Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CSWAL-QOL). The hypothesis of this study is that the effortful
      swallowing exercise would have better treatment efficacy.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in VFSS at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) measures the bolus transit time including: 1.oral transit time; 2. pharyngeal transit time; and 3. pharyngeal delay time. It also reveals the occurrence of swallowing aspiration or not.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Chinese version of the Swallow Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CSWAL-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in CSWAL-QOL at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of SWAL-QOL questionnaire (CSWAL-QOL) contains 10 scales related to swallowing and quality of life, including burden, eating desire, food duration, food selection, communication, fear, mental health, social functioning, sleep, and fatigue. All scales are linearly transformed into a 0-to-100 metric, with 0 indicating most dysfunction and 100 indicating no dysfunction.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in MASA at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) is designed to yield specific information about a patients's swallowing ability through examiner interpretation of responses. Two scores are obtained: a total score out of 200, and an ordinal risk rating for both aspiration and dysphagia (definite, probable, possible, unlikely).</description>

Besides the at home exercise, each subject is scheduled to meet the investigator at the hospital at weekly basis to discuss and review his/her exercise practice.</description>
