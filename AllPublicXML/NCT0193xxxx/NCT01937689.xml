  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. This
      study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2
      positive advanced breast cancer:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pyrotinib, and the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD)

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Pyrotinib and its metabolites

        -  To assess preliminary antitumor activity

        -  To determine preliminary regimen dose for phase II study

        -  To explore the relationship between biomarkers and the toxicity/efficacy of Pyrotinib.
