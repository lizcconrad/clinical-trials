      The aim of the study was to assess the reproducibility of quantitative measurements of
      myocardial uptake of Iobenguane I 123 on planar and single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) imaging following intravenous (i.v.) administration of AdreView. Efficacy
      was assessed based upon the absolute differences between quantitative analyses of imaging
      data on 2 scans performed 5 to 14 days apart.

    <measure>To Assess Test-retest Reproducibility of Iobenguane I 123 Injection Myocardial Uptake in Heart Failure (HF) Participants on Planar Imaging at 3 Hours 50 Minutes Following I.V. Injection of AdreView (Iobenguane I 123 Injection)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours 50 Minutes post administration of 2 dosing within an interval of 5 to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants underwent 2 AdreView (Iobenguane I 123 Injection) exams on the same gamma camera within 5 to 14 days, with the requirement that there was no change in the clinical condition of the participant or in the imaging equipment between the 2 procedures. Each imaging study was processed and read independently by 3 technologists. Mean heart/mediastinum (H/M) ratio difference (with 95% confidence interval [CI]) was used as the measure of test stability.</description>

    <measure>To Assess the Test-retest Reproducibility of Iobenguane I 123 Injection Myocardial Uptake on Planar Imaging at 15 Minutes Following Administration of AdreView (Iobenguane I 123 Injection)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes post administration of 2 dosing within an interval of 5 to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of H/M ratio and the extent of difference between H/M measurements following AdreView administration and 15 minutes delayed planar imaging on 2 separate days within an interval of 5 to 14 days, was used to assess the test-retest reproducibility. Data from test-retest study was used to estimate the normal ranges for variation in quantitation of myocardial tracer uptake using AdreView. H/M ratios were calculated by 3 technologists and average of 3 technologists was calculated based on non-missing technologists reviewing results. All non-missing technologist evaluations were averaged per participant.</description>

        <title>To Assess Test-retest Reproducibility of Iobenguane I 123 Injection Myocardial Uptake in Heart Failure (HF) Participants on Planar Imaging at 3 Hours 50 Minutes Following I.V. Injection of AdreView (Iobenguane I 123 Injection)</title>

        <description>Measurements of H/M ratio and the extent of difference between H/M measurements following AdreView administration and 15 minutes delayed planar imaging on 2 separate days within an interval of 5 to 14 days, was used to assess the test-retest reproducibility. Data from test-retest study was used to estimate the normal ranges for variation in quantitation of myocardial tracer uptake using AdreView. H/M ratios were calculated by 3 technologists and average of 3 technologists was calculated based on non-missing technologists reviewing results. All non-missing technologist evaluations were averaged per participant.</description>
