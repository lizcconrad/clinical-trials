    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for anal
      cancer. Treatment effect in terms of survival and local recurrence will be analyzed. The
      utility of PET-CT and MRI for radiotherapy and for prediction of treatment effect will be
      investigated. Molecular and genetic markers in tumor and blood will be analyzed for
      prognostic and predictive effects. Patient-reported outcomes, such as faecal incontinence,
      sexual dysfunction and quality of life will be assessed. A structured intervention program
      for management of late effects will be evaluated. Symptom relief of palliative radiotherapy
      will be investigated. The main purpose of the study is to increase the knowledge of anal
      cancer treatment, improve treatment results, and improve anal cancer survivor care.
