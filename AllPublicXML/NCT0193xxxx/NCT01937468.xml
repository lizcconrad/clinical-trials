      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cells and also tries to define the
      appropriate dose of the investigational combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg
      cells to use for further studies. IL-2 is involved with cell signaling and regulation of
      white blood cells (WBCs). WBCs are part of the immune system. Treg cells are also part of the
      immune system; they are involved with anti-inflammatory responses. &quot;Investigational&quot; means
      that the combination of IL-2 and anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion is being studied. It
      also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination
      of IL-2 and anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion for use in people with cGVHD.

      Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that may occur after you have received your bone marrow,
      stem cell or cord blood transplant from a donor. The donor's immune system may recognize your
      body (the host) as foreign and attempt to 'reject' it. This process is known as
      graft-versus-host disease.

      Traditional standard therapy to treat cGVHD is prednisone (steroids). Participants on this
      trial have not responded to steroid therapy. The investigators are looking to assess the
      safety and optimal dose for the combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cells,
      that may help control cGVHD by stopping the donor's immune system from 'rejecting' your body.

      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research
      study: If you take part in this research study, you (and your donor) will have the following
      tests and procedures:

      Donor Lymphocytes Collection: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell involved with the
      immune system. Your original marrow/stem cell donor will undergo one white blood cell
      collection procedures called leukapheresis. Blood from the vein in one arm will be circulated
      through a special machine to remove the white blood cells, and the rest of the blood will be
      returned to the donor's other arm. The cells collected from the leukapheresis will be sent to
      the laboratory where the amount of white blood cells collected will be measured. A sample
      will be removed for study testing, and the remaining lymphocytes will be set-aside for
      infusion.

      Donor Lymphocyte Processing: Once the lymphocytes are collected from your donor, the
      CliniMACS System device will enrich (preferentially select) the number of Treg cells. Samples
      will be taken before and after processing by the CliniMACS System to examine the cells. After
      completing the necessary safety tests, the Treg-enriched donor lymphocyte cells will be ready
      for administration.

      Donor Cellular Infusion (DCI): The Treg-enriched donor lymphocytes will be infused through an
      intravenous (I.V.) catheter over approximately 5-10 minutes. Prior to the infusion, you will
      receive Tylenol and Benadryl to prevent transfusion related reactions. You will be observed
      for about 1 hour after the infusion. The total anticipated time you will spend in the clinic
      is approximately 2 hours.

      Since the investigators are looking for the highest one-time dose of the anti-inflammatory
      donor cells that can be administered safely in combination with IL-2 without severe or
      unmanageable side effects in participants that have cGVHD, not everyone who participates in
      this research study will receive the same dose of the donor cells. The cell dose you get will
      depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how
      well they have tolerated their cell doses.

      Study Drug: You will give yourself or be given IL-2 daily through an injection under your
      skin. You will do this once every day for 8 weeks, starting from the day of donor Treg cell
      infusion. You will then have 4 weeks off of IL-2.

      IL-2 will be provided in single-use (one-time only) syringes to be refrigerated at home at 36
      - 46°F (2 - 8°C).

      During the first 6 weeks of IL-2, you will continue to take steroids and other immune
      suppressing medications without changing the dose your doctor has set for you while you are
      on IL-2. After 6 weeks of IL-2 therapy, your doctor may reduce the amount of steroids you
      take.

      If your cGVHD improves after 8 weeks on IL-2, you may have the option of continuing
      extended-duration therapy. Extended-duration therapy is daily IL-2 treatment starting at the
      end-of-study visit after week 12. Your doctor will discuss this option with you. If you
      continue with extended-duration IL-2 therapy after completing the week 12 evaluation, you
      will be assessed on the following schedule:

        -  Clinic visits for evaluation of toxicity and clinical benefit approximately every 4
           weeks

        -  Immunologic assays approximately every 8 weeks. Immunologic assays will measure the
           effect of IL-2 on immune cells.

      Drug Diary: Each day for the first 8 weeks you take IL-2 and each day during extend-duration
      IL-2 (if applicable), you will be asked to document, in a drug diary, when you took the drug
      and where you injected it. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the
      study drug(s). The diary will also ask if the entire syringe was injected, and if there were
      other issues related to IL-2. You will be asked to return your drug diary to clinic every 14
      days while you receive IL-2. If you continue taking IL-2 in the extend-duration portion, you
      will return your drug diary every 8 weeks (at your clinic visit).

      Chronic GVHD Assessments: While you are on study, a member of the study team will examine you
      to evaluate your cGVHD. These assessments may include examination of your skin,
      joints/muscles, eyes, mouth, lungs and gastrointestinal system (for example, whether you have
      experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing). The investigators will
      also look at the range of motion of different body parts (for example, your arms).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible
             to participate in the study:

          -  Recipient of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Participants must have steroid-refractory cGVHD. Steroid-refractory cGVHD is defined
             as having persistent signs and symptoms of cGVHD (Appendix D; section 17.4) despite
             the use of prednisone at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least
             4 weeks (or equivalent dosing of alternate glucocorticoids) without complete
             resolution of signs and symptoms. Participants with either extensive chronic GVHD or
             limited chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy are eligible.

          -  Stable dose of glucocorticoids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g.,
             calcineurin-inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment. The dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the
             therapeutic range of that drug

          -  Patient age 18 years old. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of IL-2 in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded
             from this study.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Appendix A; section 17.1)

          -  Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below:

          -  Hepatic: Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl-exception permitted in
             participants with Gilbert's Syndrome; AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2x ULN), unless hepatic
             dysfunction is a manifestation of presumed cGVHD. For participants with abnormal LFTs
             as the sole manifestation of cGVHD, documented GVHD on liver biopsy will be required
             prior to enrollment. Abnormal LFTs in the context of active cGVHD involving other
             organ systems may also be permitted if the treating physician documents the abnormal
             LFTs as being consistent with hepatic cGVHD, and a liver biopsy will not be mandated
             in this situation.

          -  Pulmonary: FEV1 ≥ 50% or DLCO(Hb) ≥ 40% of predicted, unless pulmonary dysfunction is
             deemed to be due to chronic GVHD

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than upper limit of normal institutional limits or
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function indicated by ANC&gt;1000/mm3 and platelets&gt;50,000/mm3
             without growth factors or transfusions

          -  Cardiac: No myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or NYHA Class
             III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction
             system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening must be
             documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

          -  The effects of IL-2 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt;1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)

          -  Concurrent use of calcineurin-inhibitor plus sirolimus (either agent alone is
             acceptable)

          -  History of thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic
             thrombocytopenic purpura

          -  New chronic GVHD therapies (e.g. gleevec, extracorporeal photopheresis, rituximab,
             immunosuppressive medications) in the 4 weeks prior

          -  Low-dose IL-2 therapy in the 4 weeks prior

          -  Post-transplant exposure to T-cell or alternative IL-2 targeted medication (e.g. ATG,
             alemtuzumab, basiliximab, denileukin diftitox) within 100 days prior

          -  Donor lymphocyte infusion within 100 days prior

          -  Active malignant relapse

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Inability to comply with IL-2 treatment regimen

          -  Organ transplant (allograft) recipient

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used after
             allogeneic HSCT. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal
             infections. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at
             high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after HSCT.

          -  Other investigational drugs within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, unless cleared by the
             Principal Investigator.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued.
