  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is increasingly clear that the environment in which a child lives, plays, and goes to
      school has a significant impact on their health. With the implementation of a Community to
      Clinic Linkage Program (CCLiP) in the SFGH Pediatrics Clinics, we will routinely address
      Social Determinants of Health when families present. We will randomize patients to receive
      either the CCLiP intervention or standard of care. We will evaluate programmatic outcome,
      health care utilization data and return on investment data. We hypothesize that by addressing
      the environmental and social factors that contribute to health within the setting of the
      medical home, we will be able to better connect families to community resources, enable more
      appropriate use of healthcare resources, improve health status, and enhance patient
      satisfaction.

      We are proposing a 4-arm, 18 month randomized control clinical trial to address social
      determinants of health, improve health status and health care satisfaction, and change health
      care utilization patterns in the Pediatric Urgent Care and Primary Care Clinics at San
      Francisco General Hospital. We will compare our CCLiP protocol to standard of care in both
      the Pediatric Primary Care Clinic &amp; Urgent Care. All arms (intervention and control) include
      a baseline survey including social needs assessment, health care status, health care
      satisfaction and health care utilization assessment; and two telephone-based follow up
      surveys at 3 and 6 months. Patients in the intervention arms (whether in urgent care or
      primary care) will receive a maximum of 3 months of intervention protocol which includes a 30
      minute on-site intervention at time of enrollment in addition to twice monthly follow-up
      phone calls for up to 3 months to help address social needs. Patients in all arms will
      receive 3 and 6-month follow up surveys.
