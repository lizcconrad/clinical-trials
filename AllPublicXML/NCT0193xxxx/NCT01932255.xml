    <textblock>
      Even at centers with very large experience, the risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in
      surgery for microvascular decompression is reported up to 3%.

      Prevention of leakage is important since meningitis may follow. Also, leakage usually means
      longer hospital stay and increased cost.

      In case of detected leakage extra sutures may be applied, placement of a lumbar drain may be
      considered or a revision and improved closure may be attempted. With leakage in the
      subcutaneous tissue, but not through the skin, a local accumulation causing local symptoms
      may also occur. In addition to being burdensome and being associated with longer hospital
      stays with possible revision surgery, such complications are also very costly. The best way
      to reduce cost and burden, and to improve patient care, is to prevent CSF leakage.

      The aim of this study is to determine if prophylactic lumbar tap is beneficial for prevention
      of cerebrospinal fluid leakage following microvascular decompression, by comparison of
      surgical approaches in 3 geographical areas in the Scandinavian health system.

      Hypothesis: There is no difference in cerebrospinal fluid leakage between the group subject
      to prophylactic spinal tap versus the group without prophylactic spinal tap.

        The planned study is a retrospective review of medical charts in consecutive patients
        undergoing surgery for neurovascular conflict by microvascular decompression surgery.
        Patients will be identified from the operating protocols at the respective hospitals.
