  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently it was demonstrated that imiquimod in addition to exerting a repairing effect in pre
      malignant and malignant lesions caused by UV radiation it reverses histopathological changes
      associated with the photoaging skin.

      This is an experimental exploratory study. It included 17 patients. The patients were
      diagnosed with photoaging grades III and IV in the scale of Glogau and volunteered to
      participate in the study. Patients were treated with imiquimod 5% topically, for a time
      period of 12 weeks. Biopsies were taken from periorbital skin area at baseline and after 4
      weeks after completing the treatment. Adverse effects, adherence to therapy and patients'
      satisfaction were measured.

      Clinical and histological parameters of photoaging were studied at baseline and after
      treatment. After completion of treatment with imiquimod, the final clinical evaluation was
      compared to the initial one.

    <textblock>
      An experimental study was conducted between July and November 2010 in order to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of imiquimod as a treatment option for photoaging.

      The sample population was made up of individuals from both genders, older than 40 years, who
      worked at a flower growing farm located in a rural area of Rionegro (Antioquia) with an
      altitude of 2,125 meters above sea level; approximately composed of 80 people.

      The sample size was calculated considering improvements in 50% or more of patients had to be
      detected, with a confidence interval of 95%, a power of 80%, a sampling error of 5%.

      There were five visits: one at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3 and 4. In each visit patients
      were assesed clinically, a photograph was taken and adherence and side effects were
      investigated. Treatment was given during the first 3 months. A biopsy was taken at baseline
      and during the 4th month assessment. The last visit for clinical monitoring, photographic
      follow up and skin biopsy was at 16 weeks (4 weeks after discontinuation of the medication).
      In this last visit patient's satisfaction was evaluated through a survey.

      The clinical assessment of photodamage performed by two dermatologists independently
      included: Changes in texture: dryness/roughness; changes in color: mottled hyperpigmentation,
      lentigines, yellowing; wrinkles: fine, deep wrinkles and laxity; telangiectasias.

      Clinical signs like dryness, burning, erythema, itching, fissures and scabs were used to
      measure skin irritation.

      Severity for the parameters measured in the clinical assessment of photoaging and the
      assessment of skin irritation was graded on a point scale of 0-3 where 0 was absence, one was
      mild, 2 moderate and 3 severe.

      Biopsies were taken from sites adjacent to the temporal facial area. Aseptic iodine solution
      was used on the selected area, then the biopsy site was infiltrated with lidocaine 2% (about
      0.5 cc) with a short 30-gauge needle and once analgesia was obtained a punch biopsy number 4
      mm was taken. The skin biopsy was kept in a jar with formalin properly labeled and sent for
      histopathology. Then the biopsy site was sutured with 5-0 prolene. The biopsies were sent to
      the pathology department of the CES University for hematoxylin-eosin staining and they were
      blind - read by two dermatopathologists who evaluated the following parameters: epidermal
      changes: epidermal thickness, thickness of the granular layer, melanin content, atypia of
      melanocytes and keratinocytes, dermal-epidermal junction: pigment incontinence; dermis:
      inflammation, solar elastosis, fibrosis in the papillary dermis and telangiectasia.

      Adherence was measured by asking patients in each one of the visits and it was considered
      excellent when the drug was applied 3 times per week, regular if the patient missed 2-3
      applications between visits and poor if he/she missed more than 5 applications.

    <description>To determine the degree of patient improvement percentages were set according to the values obtained in the first and last measurement as follows:
For ordinal clinical variables that had 4 categories the following percentages were established: Slight 1-point improvement (1-32%), moderate 2-point improvement (33-66%), good 3-point improvement (&gt; 66%), same or worse, one or more points of deterioration (&lt;= 0%).
For ordinal histological variables that were 4 categories the calculated improvement percentages were equal to the ones just described and for those with 5 variables, the established percentages were as follows: Slight 1-point improvement (1-25%), moderate 2-point improvement (26-50%), good 3-point improvement (51-75%), excellent 4-point improvement (&gt; 75%), one or more points of deterioration (&lt;= 0%).</description>

    <description>From the group of subjects who met the inclusion criteria, 22 people were selected randomly (using a random number table) since a 20-25% loss to follow up was calculated and the least amount of patients needed were 17.
During the study participants applied imiquimod cream 5% (Virosupril ® laboratories Roemmers) in the periocular area during the night, three times a week, on nonconsecutive days, for 12 weeks (3 months). If patients presented irritative dermatitis a topical 0.05% desonide cream was administered and applied for less of 5 days until symptoms improved.</description>
