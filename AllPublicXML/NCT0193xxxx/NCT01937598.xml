      Objectives: To quantify differences in control of glycemia (primary objective) and the
      secretion of endogenous incretin hormones (secondary objective) comparing sitagliptin or
      placebo added to pre-existing therapy with liraglutide and metformin
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, controlled, cross-over comparison of adding sitagliptin (or placebo)
      to pre-existing metformin+liraglutide therapy. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      on pre-existing treatment with metformin (≥ 1500 mg/d) monotherapy or metformin plus
      liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) will be studied. Patients on metformin monotherapy will, after
      screening and randomization, enter a run-in period of 2 weeks with the additional treatment
      of liraglutide (0.6 mg/d for 1 week followed by 1.2 mg/d for another week). At the end of
      this 2 weeks therapy, a mixed meal challenge will take place, with the assessment of glucose
      and hormone responses (insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1], GIP
      (gastric inhibitory peptide) and gastric emptying as measured by 13C (carbon 13)-octanoate
      breath tests. Prior to the meal tests, liraglutide will be administered at a dose of 1.2 mg
      per injection, which is the recommended dose for treatment. Sitagliptin will be used at a
      dose of 100 mg, which is recommended for clinical use.

Mixed meal test: Subjects will be instructed to consume the mixed meal test within 20 minutes. The exact start and stop time of the mixed meal test consumption will be recorded in the CRF(case report form). The mixed meal test procedures will be identical for all subjects randomised in the study. To detect the plasma glucose excursion after mixed meal test, plasma glucose will be closely monitored
Liraglutide: Patients on metformin monotherapy will, after screening and randomization, enter a run-in period of 2 weeks with the additional treatment of liraglutide (0.6 mg/d for 1 week followed by 1.2 mg/d for another week) that will be continued for the entire duration of the study.</description>
