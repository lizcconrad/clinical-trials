  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand flexor tendons bend the fingers down towards the palm, and can be cut during a sharp
      penetrating injury (e.g. from a knife or saw). Damaged flexor tendons are repaired surgically
      with sutures (stitches). After repair, a splint is applied to the fingers, hand and wrist for
      six to twelve weeks to protect the repair while the tendon heals and regains its normal
      strength.

      Most rehabilitation protocols use a splint in which the wrist position is kept straight
      (neutral) or bent (flexed). Some groups have described splinting with the wrist cocked back
      (extended) and have made the argument that this may improve outcomes, as experimental data
      suggests that splinting the hand with the wrist extended increases the range of movement of
      the repaired flexor tendon (excursion), and therefore reduces the chance of the tendon
      sticking down to the surrounding tissues (adhesion). Previous studies have shown no adverse
      effects from splinting hands with the wrist extended, and no evidence tells us which wrist
      splint position is better (a state of clinical equipoise or apparently equivalent outcomes).
      This randomised trial aims to produce this evidence, and therefore improve functional
      outcomes for patients in future.

      We propose to carry out a study to compare the outcomes (grip strength and range of movement)
      of flexor tendon repair in two groups of patients: one with wrists splinted in a neutral
      position and the other splinted in an extended position during their postoperative
      rehabilitation. No changes will be made to patient assessment and management,the surgery
      undertaken and the rehabilitation regime other than those to splint position. Previous work
      suggests that both positions are safe and effective. Informed consent will be obtained from
      all patients enrolled in the trial, and we aim to find out if the extended splint position
      produces better functional results.

    <description>The primary outcome measures will be &quot;Range of Movement&quot; (ROM). Total active motion will be measured using a Roylan finger goniometer following a standardised procedure and recorded on an electronic audit form (Appendix 1.5). This will be recorded up to 26 weeks post surgeries. Outcome data will be taken and recorded by a senior hand therapist who will be blinded to the position of splintage that has been worn by the participant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary inclusion criteria for the study is patients who have had 100% division by
             sharp laceration to the Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP+)/Flexor Digitorum
             Superficialis (FDS) within zone I or II and who have undergone repair with cruciate
             and epitendinous suture. Patients with multiple digit involvement will be included in
             the study.

          -  All repairs performed with 3/0 prolene suture cruciate repair and 6/0 prolene for the
             epitendinous repair as per departmental protocol.

          -  Patients with digital nerve repair along with the above injury will be included in the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with associated phalangeal fractures, skin and soft tissue loss or who had
             vascular compromise will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients with tendon repairs other than cruciate will be excluded from the study
