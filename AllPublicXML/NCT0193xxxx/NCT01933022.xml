  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the study medication (Eligard®) on
      cancer markers (in the blood) of prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to explore the effect of Eligard® on the following
      prostate cancer biomarkers:

      Testosterone in serum, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in serum, Prostate Cancer Antigen
      (PCA3 score) in urine, PSA mRNA in blood/Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC), PCA3 mRNA
      in blood/PBMC, Transmembrane protease, serine 2-Ets Related Gene (TMPRSS2-ERG) mRNA in
      blood/PBMC

      A blood sample for RNA analysis will also be collected and stored for future investigation in
      patients giving specific informed consent.

    Termination due to high current screen rate failure and unreliable PSA mRNA assay.

          -  Serum PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2

          -  A life expectancy of at least 12 months.

          -  Is able to tolerate injection of study drug and comply with the study requirements.

          -  Positive blood PSA mRNA at screening. A positive PSA mRNA in PBMCs (defined as
             exceeding the Limit of Detection [LoD] for the central lab assay, i.e. ≥ 10 copies per
             Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bilateral orchidectomy.

          -  History of any hormonal treatment/therapy with GnRH agonist, GnRH anti-agonist within
             6 months of enrolment.

          -  Treatment with anti-androgens (except where used to prevent testosterone flare up,
             starting up to 2 weeks prior to Eligard injection, according to local treatment
             guidelines), 5-α reductase inhibitors, estrogens and/or other any investigational
             hormone-derivative within 3 months of enrolment or 5-times the half-life, whichever is
