  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the type of macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid or
      protein) that most potently stimulates the endogen secretion of different gut hormones
      (primary outcome = Glucagon-Like peptide-1) in gastric bypass operated patients. The study
      also includes a comparison of the secretion of gut hormones after oral intake of lipid with
      or without a pancreatic lipase inhibitor.
