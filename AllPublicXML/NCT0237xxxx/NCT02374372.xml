    <textblock>
      The site where the clinical trial will be conducted is at the St-Luc hospital from the CHUM.
      This is a prospective randomized study that will compare the two treatment modalities, HD and
      HDF, through economics and pharmaco-economics parameters.

      Patients, who had previously been randomized in the CONTRAST study, will remain in their
      respective group and monitoring will continue. The next patients will be randomized in the
      same way (1: 1) using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. HDF randomized patients will
      receive post-dilution standard reinjection (at least 100ml/min or 6 liter/hr). In rare cases,
      HDF patients can briefly have reinjection on a pre-dilution mode (if heparin need to be
      avoided for example) and the reinjection flow should be adjusted accordingly (200ml/min).

      Length and frequency of sessions will be the same in the 2 groups. Blood tests will not
      change and will be the same than those used as routine assessments. Metabolic control of
      patients will be maintained according to the guidelines. Patients will be monitored for a
      minimum of 3 years. A set of demographic and clinical data will be collected from patient
      medical records and throughout the study.

      Biochemical data as part of the usual blood tests of dialysis patients will be collected each
      month as well as will be stored and analyzed information about the annual cardiac
      ultrasounds.

      All events will be scored (hospitalizations, patterns, duration) and the list and cost of
      drugs will be compiled every three months. These data will be useful in the economic analysis
      comparing the two treatment modalities.
