      The primary objective of I-CARE is to assess prospectively the presence and the extent of
      safety concerns (cancers, especially, lymphoma, and serious infections risks) for anti-TNF
      alone or in combination with thiopurines among IBD patients.

      We will stratify the risk of cancers and serious infections according to IBD phenotype and
      disease activity (clinical, radiologic and endoscopic).

      The four main secondary objectives of the I-CARE project are:

        -  To investigate prospectively the impact of anti-TNF based strategies on the natural
           history of IBD and their potential for disease modification by collecting validated
           surrogate markers such as mucosal healing and disease complications such as bowel damage
           (strictures, fistulas, abscess), surgeries, and hospitalizations

        -  To assess the evolution of Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) on a yearly basis and the
           impact of anti-TNF agents on ePRO in IBD

        -  To evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of strategies based on an earlier and wider use of
           anti-TNF therapy for IBD

        -  To assess the healthcare costs and cost-efficacy of current therapeutic strategies in
           IBD 5-ASA and Steroids across Europe At least 5000 IBD patients treated with 5-ASA or
           Steroids and FU for 3 years

             -  use of 5-ASA and efficacy (persistence, switch, mucosal healing etc.)

             -  chemoprevention of CRC: first study that will specifically and accurately address
                this question

             -  use of budesonide mmx and efficacy (clinical efficacy, mucosal healing and
                potential for disease modification)

             -  safety of steroids (infections etc)

      STUDY DESIGN:

      22 patients per investigator, 800 investigators for a total of 17600 patients. Each
      Investigator will recruit and enrol 20 patients with imposed treatment stratification : Group
      1: 5 without previous or ongoing exposure to IS or biologics, (5 ASA and Steroids are
      allowed) Group 2: 5 with on-going anti-TNF monotherapy Group 3: 5 with thiopurines
      monotherapy Group 4: 5 with on-going combination therapy Group 5: 2 patients on vedolizumab
      (on vedolizumab alone and 1 on combination therapy)
