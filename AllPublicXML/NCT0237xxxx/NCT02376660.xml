    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial to assess the effect of oats on lipid profile of mildly
      hypercholesterolemic subjects. Subjects consumed 35g of oats twice daily (total of 70g / day)
      in place of carbohydrates as part of their usual diet. 70 grams of oats provide 3 grams of
      soluble fiber. Control group consumed the usual diet. Subjects followed up for 4 weeks. In
      total 3 assessment visits of the subjects planned for the study period.
