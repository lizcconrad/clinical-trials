  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using the MedLog is helpful to patients. Since the
      investigators do not yet know if this MedLog is helpful, some patients will receive it and
      some will receive our standard of care. The investigators want to know whether providing
      patients with this additional information is helpful and if having this additional
      information about their treatment schedule has an effect on their quality of life.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive a personalized medication log that includes all treatment medications (IV and oral), days of treatment and medication specific information such as timing or diet restrictions. The personalized medication log and patient education materials (fact cards) will be placed in a clear plastic envelope that the patient can carry with them throughout treatment.</description>
