      The purpose of this research study is to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a
      double dose of contrast, or dye, and delayed imaging with MRI can help to diagnose Meniere
      Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meniere's disease (MD) is a medical condition causing attacks of vertigo, ringing in the
      ears, hearing loss and often a fullness in the ear. Currently there is no definitive test to
      diagnose the problem. It is believed to be caused by inner ear abnormalities, specifically of
      an over-collection of lymphatic fluid.The goal of this trial is to determine if an MRI with
      double dose of IV gadolinium can be diagnostic.

    <description>Two Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ)-certified neuroradiologists will evaluate the MRI findings. The degree of EH in the vestibule and cochlea will be classified as &quot;none&quot;, &quot;grade I&quot; and &quot;grade II,&quot; with grade I being defined as mild and grade II being defined as significant.</description>
