  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical efficacy of repeat subcutaneous
      (SC) doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to relieve symptoms in adult patients with
      active, moderate to severe EoE.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SC doses of dupilumab in adult
           patients with active, moderate to severe EoE

        -  To assess the effect of dupilumab on esophageal eosinophilic infiltration

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab in adult patients with EoE

        Key inclusion criteria:

          1. Documented diagnosis of EoE by endoscopy prior to or at screening

          2. History of on average at least 2 episodes of dysphagia (with intake of solids off
             anti-inflammatory therapy) per week in the 4 weeks prior to screening and on average
             at least 2 episodes of documented dysphagia per week in the weeks between screening
             and baseline; dysphagia is defined as trouble swallowing solid food, or having solid
             food stick, by patient report

          3. Must remain on a stabilized diet for at least 6 weeks prior to screening and during
             the course of the study; stable diet is defined as no initiation of single or multiple
             elimination diets or reintroduction of previously eliminated food groups

          4. Documented history of or presence of any of the following: allergic disease (e.g,
             allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis (AD), or food allergies),
             peripheral eosinophil counts ≥0.25 GI/L, or serum total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) ≥100
             kU/L

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior participation in a dupilumab (anti-IL-4R) clinical trial

             syndromes, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis

          3. History of achalasia, active Helicobacter pylori infection, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and prior esophageal surgery prior to screening

          4. Any esophageal stricture unable to be passed with a standard, diagnostic, adult (9
             to10 mm) upper endoscope or any critical esophageal stricture that requires dilation
             at screening

          5. History of bleeding disorders or esophageal varices

          6. Use of chronic aspirin, nonsteroidal agents, or anti-coagulants within 2 weeks prior

             entry into this study

          7. Treatment with an investigational drug within 2 months or within 5 half-lives (if
             known), whichever is longer, prior to screening

          8. Use of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months or swallowed topical corticosteroids
             within 3 months prior to screening

          9. Use of inhaled (pulmonary or nasal) topical corticosteroids within 3 months prior to

             screening biopsy, which cannot be changed during the study

         10. Treatment with oral immunotherapy (OIT) within 6 months prior to screening

         11. Allergen immunotherapy unless on stable dose for at least 1 year prior to screening
