  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine whether autologous TIL infused in conjunction
      with systemic high-dose IL-2 after non-myeloablative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine can cause consistent and durable objective responses in patients who have
      metastatic melanoma at the John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI).

    <time_frame>12 weeks, or until development of new metastases or recurrence</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of 12 week follow up, the proportion of patients that showed clinical response (CR) determined by the disappearance of all target lesions, or partial response (PR) will be calculated. The patient is determined to have partial response as if 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of target lesions are shown from the baseline sum LD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, or until development of new metastases or recurrence</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed and scored per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) EORTC-QLQ-C30 version 3.0 requirements. The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains subscales for global health status, and physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social function with higher scores indicating better functioning (19). The change in QOL measured throughout the study period will be examined through mixed effect model adjusting for the baseline. Akaike information criteria (AIC) will be used to determine appropriate covariance structure.</description>

    <description>Patients will have a melanoma metastasis resected and cultured in IL-2 in vitro either as part of this treatment protocol or the JWCI procurement protocol. TIL from these cultures will be assessed for tumor-reactivity and those with such activity will be further expanded and adoptively transferred. Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day X 2 days IV) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day IV X 5 days). Following this regimen, patients will receive an intravenous adoptive transfer of at least 109 tumor-reactive lymphocytes (TIL) followed by high-dose intravenous IL-2 (600-720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for up to 12 doses).</description>

    <description>Patients will receive an IV adoptive transfer of at least 10^9 tumor-reactive lymphocytes. An IV catheter in the patient's arm or upper chest will be used for cell infusion. The TIL will be administered over 20-30 minutes at room temperature using a standard infusion protocol or by hanging the infusion bag from a stand and allowing gravity to pull the cells down.</description>

          -  Platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3.

          -  Serum Alanine transaminase/Aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST) less than three times the
             upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl.

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert's
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3 mg/dl.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign the Informed Consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria - Tumor/TIL Harvest Exclusion Criteria

          -  All systemic, cytotoxic therapy (including targeted therapies) must be stopped at
             least 5 weeks prior to cell infusion (see 2.1.3).

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Life expectancy of less than three months.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
             antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibody will be excluded unless a post anti-CTLA-4 antibody
             treatment colonoscopy was normal with normal colonic biopsies.

          -  Patients who require immediate active treatment for symptomatic Central Nervous System
             (CNS) lesions will not be eligible until after treatment of their symptomatic lesions.

             receives the preparative regimen. All patients' toxicities must have recovered to a
             grade 1 or less or as specified in the eligibility criteria in Section 2.1.1. Patients
             may have undergone minor surgical procedures or focal palliative radiotherapy (to
             non-target lesions) within the past 5 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered
             to grade 1 or less or as specified in the eligibility criteria in Section 2.1.1.

             experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune
             system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the
             experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)
