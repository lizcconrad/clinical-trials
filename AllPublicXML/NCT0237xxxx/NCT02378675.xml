  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apelin, Visfatin, Omentin and Resistin are adipocytokines derived from human adipose tissue
      as well as placental tissue and have been shown to be potential mediators of insulin
      resistance. In each pregnancy, a physiological Insulin resistance syndrome occurs to ensure
      that the fetus is sufficiently supplied with glucose. Due to their impact on glucose
      transport mechanisms adipocytokines play an important role for the development of insulin
      resistance.

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy - associated diseases
      with a prevalence of 5-10% of all pregnancies and its prevalence is increasing. It is
      associated with severe hazards to both mother and fetus such as macrosomia, plexus palsy,
      premature delivery and intrauterine death. Furthermore, up to 50% of women with GDM develop
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) within the following ten years after pregnancy. GDM seems to
      be a potent risk factor for the development of DM2 in later life by sharing a number of
      epidemiological, physiological and genetic characteristics with DM2. Therefore, alterations
      in adipocytokine levels in women with GDM, if present, may resemble those observed with DM2.

      Furthermore, the exact pathogenesis of GDM is not completely understood, however, increased
      insulin resistance is a well demonstrated mechanism.

      Adipocytokines are known to alter insulin resistance through several mechanisms described in
      the literature. The investigators therefore expect a possible relationship between the above
      described adipocytokines and gestational diabetes mellitus.

      Results of the HAPO-Study have shown a significant association between fetal outcome and mean
      blood glucose levels in women suffering from GDM. The HAPO Study group supposed a possible
      relationship between GDM and fetal insulin levels and used C-Peptide to quantify fetal
      hyperinsulinemia.

      A recent study suggests that not only hyperglycemia but also altered maternal lipid
      metabolism may constitute a risk factor for macrosomia in GDM.

      In summary, the investigators aim to illuminate a possible association between the
      adipocytokines Apelin, Omentin, Resistin and Visfatin, lipid metabolism and gestational
      diabetes mellitus.
