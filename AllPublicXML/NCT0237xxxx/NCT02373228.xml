  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impaired persons suffer from inferior music perception with and without hearing aids.
      Hearing aids, however, are primarily designed to improve speech intelligibility not music
      enjoyment. This study investigates the potential benefit of signal processing strategies that
      are optimized for music. The purpose of this study is to improve music compression for
      hearing impaired people.
