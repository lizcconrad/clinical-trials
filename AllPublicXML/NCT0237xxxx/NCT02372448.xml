  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients eligibility to targeted therapies relies on a molecular test performed on a tumor
      sample collected by biopsy. This invasive procedure is associated with a relative high risk
      of morbidity and requires the intervention of a costly and important technical platform.
      Thus, inoperable patients can be deprived from potentially more efficient therapies. A
      &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) present in the blood and their molecular
      characterization is an appealing alternative to meet an urgent need for these patients.
      Moreover no CTC-based molecular test is currently routinely available.

      The 5-year survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is low.
      Recent reports demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in the tumor tissue
      allows patients with late-stages NSCLC to benefit from crizotinib treatment.

      However, 1) the detection of an ALK rearrangement is currently performed on small biopsies or
      fine-needle aspirates and can be hindered by the limited tissue quantities available. Tumor
      tissue is difficult to obtain in patients with advanced/metastatic lung cancer for whom
      surgery is rarely a component of treatment. Finding alternative and more effective means of
      diagnosing an ALK rearrangement are critical issues for identifying patients who may benefit
      from treatment with crizotinib; 2) some patients develop resistance to crizotinib due to de
      novo ALK mutations.

      In this setting, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which have been shown to be detectable by
      ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor Cells) method in 80% to 100 % of late stages lung
      cancer patients represent a non-invasive and easily accessible source of tumor material for
      assessing ALK rearrangement and escaping mutations in a kinetic manner. The ISET method was
      first published in 2000 and several independent teams have now established its high
      sensitivity and specificity of ISET for NSCLC. With ISET, specificity can be achieved using
      the same methods and criteria used by cytopathologists to diagnose solid tumors.

      The high sensitivity and specificity of ISET are two essential starting points for the
      feasibility of this present project. Low-throughput molecular characterization of CTCs
      isolated by ISET has also been achieved. The remaining challenge consists in developing
      high-throughput ISET-based molecular tests for personalized medicine that are transferable to
      the clinics.

      The Team 1 at the CHU de Nice and the Team 2 at the Gustave Roussy Institute have
      demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in CTC isolated by ISET is feasible
      and consistent with results obtained in corresponding tumor tissues. In this context, the aim
      of this project is to obtain 1) a definitive prospective clinical validation of the use of
      CTC as an alternative to tumor tissue for ALK analysis-based patients stratification; 2) a
      proof that escaping mutations can be detected early by kinetic analysis of CTC in patients
      treated by crizotinib. ALK rearrangement will be prospectively investigated in CTCs isolated
      by ISET at diagnosis and during follow up from patients with stage IIIb/IV lung cancer and de
      novo mutations will be searched in patients with resistance to crizotinib. This study will
      provide both clinical and economic benefit to targeted treatment of patients with advanced
      lung cancer.

      This project is strongly original as no CTC-based ALK rearrangement test has been
      independently validated up to now with clinical samples. The development of non-invasive
      theranostic test through the genetic analysis of CTCs is a clinically relevant goal for
      non-invasive stratification of cancer patients, avoiding morbidity related to lung biopsy and
      surgery. It would allow determining patient's eligibility to targeted therapies on a blood
      sample analysis. CTC-based ALK test could be useful to guide the choice of ALK targeted
      therapy in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, developing biomarkers based on CTCs
      analysis would open the way to the non-invasive follow up of aggressive cancers, early
      detection of mutations associated with resistance to targeted therapies and tailoring
      treatment to a real time analysis of the evolving tumor cell populations. This test is
      expected to markedly improve patients' quality of life avoiding invasive diagnostic
      procedures.

    <description>ALK rearrangement positivity by FISH analysis in CTC will be defined as the presence of an ALK rearrangement in four or more CTCs isolated per 1 ml blood. The proportion of ALK-rearranged CTCs (determined by FISH analysis) among the total numbers of CTCs determined by cytomorphological examination or by combining immunofluorescent staining and cytomorphological examination will be also determined and compared to that obtained in the tumor tissue.</description>

    <description>The ALK-rearranged CTC levels evolution will be defined as the difference, between baseline and respectively M6 and M12, of the CTC number per 1 ml blood as determined by the ISET method. The systemic progression under crizotinib or another ALK inibitor will be evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (http://www.recist.com/). Patients will be categorized into 3 groups with: stable disease, response (complete/partial) or with progressive disease. The association will be adjusted on covariates such as gender, age, smoking history, histology, T4 subtypes (in patients with stage IIIB), and M1 subtypes (in patients with stage IV disease), the initial treatment modality (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, none, or both).</description>
