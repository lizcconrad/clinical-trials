      Retrospective analysis of a 6-month follow up within a randomised controlled study in cardiac
      surgery with pharmacological postconditioning (sedation on intensive care unit with
      sevoflurane)

      Introduction: In a recent randomized controlled (RCT; NCT00924222) trial the investigators
      demonstrated in 102 patients that late post-conditioning with sevoflurane performed in the
      intensive care unit (ICU) reduced myocardial injury. These patients presented with lower
      troponin T values on the first post-operative day compared with patients undergoing propofol
      sedation. In order to assess possible clinical relevant long-term implications in patients
      enrolled in this study, the current retrospective analysis is performed focusing on cardiac
      and non-cardiac events during the first six months after surgery.

      Methods: All patients who had successfully completed the late post-conditioning trial were
      included in this follow-up. Primary and secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients
      experiencing cardiac and non-cardiac events, respectively. Additionally, therapeutic
      interventions such as initiation or change of drug therapy, interventional treatment or
      surgery were assessed.
