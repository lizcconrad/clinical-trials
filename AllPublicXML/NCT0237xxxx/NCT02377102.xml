    <textblock>
      Purpose: For the target population of adult patients with end stage osteoarthritis, this
      randomized clinical trial will be used to evaluate the benefit of three months of physical
      therapy compared to no treatment in patients indicated for total knee arthroplasty.

      Participants:Patients that are diagnosed with end stage osteoarthritis who are indicated for
      total knee arthroplasty.

      Procedures: Patients will be randomized to either receive physical therapy or no treatment.
      They will be scheduled to return in 3 months for discussion of operative versus continued
      nonoperative treatment of their osteoarthritis.This will be determined by change in PROMIS
      (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) score and prevention of surgery.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS-(Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Lower Extremity Function Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS score incorporates questions from multiple validated instruments of functional outcome. The system was then calibrated to the normal population distribution and has been applied previously to assess lower extremity dysfunction. This will increase our sensitivity in detecting differences between the two groups. The CAT is an adaptive test that responds to previous patient responses to decrease the amount of questions required to obtain a score. This will allow our CAT to last 1-5 minutes as opposed to a longer patient reported score or system. PROMIS has also been utilized in the setting of arthritis and should allow for a greater detection of functional improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients will be provided a prescription for 12 weeks of physical therapy at a location of their choice. No set protocol will be issued to allow for adjustments based on patient activity level and the therapist's professional choice. The physical therapy techniques, consisting of active and passive physiological and accessory movements and soft tissue mobilization, active range of motion exercises, muscle strengthening, muscle stretching, and exercises such as riding a stationary bicycle will be applied at the discretion of the treating physical therapist primarily to the knee and surrounding structures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with grade 3 and 4 (severe) osteoarthritis and indicated for primary
             total knee arthroplasty.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 y/o

          -  Any form of arthritis other than osteoarthritis (traumatic, rheumatic, etc)

          -  Previous knee surgery

          -  Inability to personally consent to or participate with therapy due to cognitive
             impairment, physical disability, intoxication or sedation

          -  known contraindications would include patients that will be unable to participate with
             therapy or who will put themselves at significant risk due to therapy (this could be
             either severe cardiac or respiratory impairment that prevents the patient from
             ambulating or mental impairment preventing the patients from following instructions
