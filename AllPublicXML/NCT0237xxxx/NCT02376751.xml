  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter expanded access protocol to allow patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency in the United States (US),
      access to sebelipase alfa (recombinant lysosomal acid lipase [rhLAL]) until commercial
      product is available.

      Patients enrolled in the expanded access protocol will receive 1 mg/kg intravenous infusions
      of sebelipase alfa every other week.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is â‰¥ 8 months of age at commencement of treatment with sebelipase alfa.

          2. Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of LAL Deficiency.

          3. Patient or patient's parent or legal guardian (if applicable) consents to
             participation in the study. If the patient is of minor age, he/she is willing to
             provide assent where required per local regulations, and if deemed able to do so.

          4. Male and female patients of childbearing potential must use a highly reliable method
             of birth control (expected failure rate less than 5% per year) from the time they
             commence treatment through 4 weeks after the last dose of sebelipase alfa.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             commencement of treatment with sebelipase alfa.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are nursing or pregnant.

          2. Patients who received an investigational product within 30 days (for a small molecule)
             or 60 days (for a biologic) of commencing treatment, and which in the opinion of the
             investigator or Sponsor, may negatively impact patient safety.

          3. Patients who have received sebelipase alfa as part of a clinical trial that is
             currently active.

          4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to eggs.
