    <textblock>
      Selected patients with early stage breast cancer undergone conservative surgery were
      randomized in two arms: Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation versus Accelerated Partial
      Breast Irradiation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation (WBI) received SIB
      irradiation of the whole breast and surgical bed at two different dose levels. Dose
      prescription was 40.5 Gy to PTVWB and 48.0 Gy to PTVboost in 15 fractions over 3 weeks, with
      simultaneous integrated boost delivering 2.7 and 3.2Gy/fraction for each PTV respectively.
      Daily image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were generated before each treatment session in each
      patient to verify the set-up.

      Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) using external intensity -modulated
      radiotherapy (VMAT RA) was delivered at a dose of 30 Gy in five 6-Gy/day fractions over 10
      days (every other day) with IGRT at each treatment.
