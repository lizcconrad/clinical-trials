  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AGT-181 is a fusion protein containing alpha-L-Iduronidase that is intended to deliver the
      enzyme peripherally and to the brain, when administered intravenously. This study is a safety
      and dose ranging study to obtain safety and exposure data, as well as information on the
      biological activity of the investigational drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male age 18 years or older

          -  Diagnosis of MPS I (documented fibroblast or leukocyte IDUA enzyme activity level of
             less than 10% of the lower limit of the normal range of the measuring laboratory)

          -  Voluntary written consent by patient or legally responsible representative

          -  All women of childbearing potential and sexually mature males must be advised to use a
             medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (females)

          -  Must not have received ERT for at least 6 weeks prior to AGT-181 treatment

          -  Must have elevated urinary GAGs if no ERT has been received in the prior 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to complete baseline evaluations.

          -  Any medical condition or other circumstances that may significantly interfere with
