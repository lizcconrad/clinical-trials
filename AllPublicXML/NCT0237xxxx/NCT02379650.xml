  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 5% of couples trying to achieve parenthood. Most cases
      of RPL are unexplained and have no effective treatment to improve the likelihood of a
      pregnancy resulting in a live birth. This leads to significant patient and provider
      frustration and emotional stress. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a medication commonly used in
      pregnancy to treat autoimmune and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). This use has shown that HCQ is very safe in pregnancy. HCQ has
      anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects and thus may improve pregnancy outcomes in
      couples with unexplained RPL. Although some providers are already prescribing HCQ for
      unexplained RPL, a randomized controlled trial is necessary to determine the true efficacy
      and safety of this treatment. This study has the potential to establish support for a new
      treatment option for unexplained RPL.
