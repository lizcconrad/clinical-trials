    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effects of fasting or not fasting
      overnight before a cardiac catheterization (heart procedure). The study will compare patients
      who have nothing to eat after midnight before the procedure to those who are allowed to eat
      or drink before the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For years it has been common to have patients fast before a cardiac catheterization. It is
      believed that fasting may lower the risks of upset stomach, vomiting, and aspiration (stomach
      contents going to the lungs). New findings show that fasting before the procedure may not be
      needed. This study will look at the safety and possible benefits of not fasting.
