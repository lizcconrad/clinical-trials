  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the radiotherapeutic treatment of lung cancer, the dose that can be safely applied to the
      tumour is limited by the risk of radiation induced lung damage. This damage is characterized
      by parenchymal damage and vascular damage. In rats, we have found that radiation-induced
      vascular damage results in increased pulmonary artery pressure. Interestingly, the consequent
      loss of pulmonary function could be fully explained by this increase in pulmonary artery
      pressure. We hypothesize that also in patients a radiation induced increase in pulmonary
      artery pressure can be observed after radiotherapy, which may contribute to the development
      of radiation pneumonitis.

      The objective is to test the hypothesis that radiotherapy for lung cancer induces an increase
      in pulmonary artery pressure.

          -  WHO PS 0-2

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer or an
             18F-FDG-positive, growing mass on CT-thorax suggestive of NSCLC.

          -  Stage IIIA or IIIB

          -  Patients with extensive mediastinal lymph node involvement (such as N3), or large
             primary tumour size

          -  Adequate pulmonary function estimated by flow volume curves

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months
