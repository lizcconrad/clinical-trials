  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton beam therapy is a safe irradiation modality for choroidal melanoma. But often after
      irradiation the exudation increases resulting in an exudative retinal detachment requiring
      vitreoretinal surgery. It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is
      capable to decrease the exudation. If there is any advantage in a combined treatment this
      study will investigate.

    <textblock>
      Proton beam therapy is an eye preserving irradiation modality for uveal melanoma. After
      proton beam therapy tumor related lipid exudation and exudative retinal detachment often
      increase. Therefore vitreoretinal surgery is sometimes required to reattach the retina to
      protect visual acuity. It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is
      capable to decrease exudation. If there is any advantage in a combined treatment and if it is
      that effective to possibly avoid vitreoretinal surgery this study will investigate.

    <description>Transpupillary thermotherapy is performed as monotherapy. It is performed with an infrared diode laser adapted to a slit-lamp biomicroscope at a wavelength of 810 nm and beam diameters of 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0, or 3.0 mm using a contact lens and through a dilated pupil. Each TTT spot was applied for a duration of about 1 minute to achieve a grayish-white color on the surface of the tumor. TTT could be repeated at intervals of 6-8 weeks with the goal of achieving a complete resolution of fluid</description>

    <description>transpupillary thermotherapy followed by an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone. It is performed with an infrared diode laser adapted to a slit-lamp biomicroscope at a wavelength of 810 nm and beam diameters of 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0, or 3.0 mm using a contact lens and through a dilated pupil. Each TTT spot was applied for a duration of about 1 minute to achieve a grayish-white color on the surface of the tumor. After an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone was perfomed under sterile conditions. TTT and triamcinolone injection could be repeated at intervals of 6-8 weeks with the goal of achieving a complete resolution of fluid.</description>
