  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population is aging worldwide, which requires more attention to health needs and leads to
      a dramatic increase in health care costs. Prevention or delay of onset of disorders
      associated with aging is needed. Dietary intake of pectin, a dietary fiber, may have
      beneficial effects on gut health parameters, i.e. intestinal barrier function, immune
      function and microbial composition. As intestinal barrier function may be compromised in the
      elderly we will investigate whether the effects of pectin on selected parameters of gut
      health differ between young vs. older individuals. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate the effects of aging on pectin-induced changes in intestinal permeability.
      Furthermore, this study has seven secondary objectives. This study conforms to a randomized,
      double-blind and placebo-controlled design including two parallel arms.The study population
      consists of Healthy human volunteers (male and female), 18-40 and 65-75 years old, BMI 20-30
      kg/m2. One group will receive 7.5 grams of pectin supplements twice daily for four weeks. A
      second group will receive 7.5 grams of placebo supplements twice daily for four weeks. Before
      and after the supplementation period, several measurements will take place. The main study
      parameter is the change in urinary sugar excretion ratio before and after the intervention
      period.
