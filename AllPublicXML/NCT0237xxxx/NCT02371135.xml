  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the role bacteria that normally live in the colon
      may play in colorectal cancer risk, in addition to the hereditary risk to colorectal cancer.
      The investigators will collect stool specimens as well as additional colon biopsy specimens
      during the patient's scheduled colonoscopy procedure. The investigators will also collect a
      questionnaire about diet and lifestyle. The samples will be used to study the impact of diet
      on naturally-occurring oral and gut bacteria and their influences on human health including
      risk of cancer.

    <description>At least 2 weeks prior to scheduled lower endoscopy, consented study participants will be mailed a Brief Diet and Lifestyle Questionnaire, a stool collection kit with detailed instructions and a Stool Collection Data Sheet. No more than one week prior to the lower endoscopy but prior to initiation of bowel preparation, the consented participants will provide a stool specimen and fill out the two questionnaires. The routine lower endoscopy will be performed according to routine clinical procedures. Clinical biopsies of suspicious areas and/or lesions will be taken as per standard clinical care with all such tissue samples sent to pathology for routine clinical analysis. For the sole purposes of research, at the routine lower endoscopy, up to 8 additional colonic biopsies will be taken from normal appearing colon mucosa</description>
