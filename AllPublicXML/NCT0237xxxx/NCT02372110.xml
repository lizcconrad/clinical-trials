      The proposed study aims to investigate experimentally anxiety sensitivity and physiologic
      sensations associated with anxiety using a paradigm combining hydrocortisone, caffeine, and a
      set of social stress challenges. Following informed consent, participants will be instructed
      to ingest either 400 milligrams of caffeine (an amount of caffeine roughly equivalent to that
      in two 8 oz. cups of brewed coffee from Starbucks), and 20 milligrams of hydrocortisone or
      two placebo capsules via stratified, random assignment. Physiologic and self-reported
      measures of stress and anxiety will be taken.

    <textblock>
      Given the debilitating nature of anxiety disorders, a greater understanding of its etiology
      and the development of appropriate early interventions are critical. However, due to the
      mutually reinforcing nature of anxiety sensitivity (a key component of anxiety disorders) and
      physiological sensations associated with anxiety, no previous studies have examined these two
      variables separately in response to an acute stressor. The proposed study aims to investigate
      these two variables independently using a paradigm combining hydrocortisone, caffeine, and
      TSST.

      It is hypothesized that when an individual's physiological stress responses (SNS and HPA
      axis) are enhanced, he or she will experience greater subjective stress and a lesser sense of
      mastery in response to an acute stressor (e.g., the TSST). In addition, anxiety sensitivity
      will moderate subjective ratings of stress and mastery, such that individuals high on anxiety
      sensitivity will rate the TSST as more subjectively stressful and their performance as less
      effectual compared to individuals low on anxiety sensitivity, due to greater vigilance of
      interoceptive responses and internal stimuli.
