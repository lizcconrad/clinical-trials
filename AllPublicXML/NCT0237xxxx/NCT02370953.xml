      OVERVIEW Cataract is a clouding of the crystalline lens which causes vision loss and
      blindness if untreated. Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgical
      intervention in medicine with an incidence of 880 surgeries per 100.000 population in 2010
      amounting to a total number of over 160.000 surgeries per year in the Netherlands.

      Approximately 22% of patients with cataract have a substantial pre-existing corneal
      astigmatism. Toric IOLs provide the opportunity to correct pre-existing astigmatism, offering
      the patients optimum distance vision without the use of spectacles or contact lenses. Toric
      IOLs are increasingly used in cataract and refractive surgery.

      Since the introduction of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) in the treatment of cataract in
      patients with pre-existing corneal astigmatism, numerous studies have shown the importance of
      accurate positioning of the toric IOL to the intended alignment axis. An error of 5º in toric
      IOL alignment will decrease the anticipated effect by 17% and thus misalignment will decrease
      the effectiveness of the astigmatism treatment. There are several methods used to align the
      toric IOL at the intended axis. Most of these use a 3-step ink-marking procedure and are
      performed manually. Clinical study showed an average error of 5º in toric IOL alignment when
      using this method.

      Two new tools that have recently been introduced to the market are the VERION Measurement
      Module and VERION Digital Marker. Together, these tools provide integrated digital guidance
      for alignment of toric IOLs and they have the potential to eliminate the error in horizontal
      axis marking and the alignment axis marking error. This will lead to an improved visual
      outcome. So far, there are no published studies using the VERION tools for toric IOL
      alignment in cataract surgery. Therefore, the investigators will perform this randomized
      control trial.

      MAIN HYPOTHESIS

      The investigators hypothesise that cataract surgery with the implantation of a toric IOL,
      when using the VERION-tools, compared to manual ink-marking, in patients with corneal
      astigmatism will lead to:

      - An increase in accuracy in toric IOL alignment

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the accuracy in toric IOL alignment when
      using the VERION-tools for alignment of the toric IOL or the conventional manual ink-marking
      procedure.

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary objective of the study is to compare residual astigmatism when using the VERION
      Measurement Module and VERION Digital Marker for alignment of the toric IOL or the
      conventional manual ink-marking procedure.

      Other Secondary Objectives:

      The other secondary objectives are to compare:

    <description>The VERION Measurement Module is a diagnostic device which can make high resolution colour reference images of the patient's eye for position reference. The VERION Digital Marker is a medical device that assists the surgeon in planning and performing surgical procedures on the eye. The VERION tools use several reference points on the conjunctiva and limbus, and make an overlay between the preoperative achieved and live-surgery image. During surgery, this device projects the horizontal axis and the estimated placement axis of the toric IOL on the patient's eye, and therefore, the surgeon can accurately place the toric IOL to its preoperatively calculated angle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Conventional, manual ink-marking for toric IOL alignment</intervention_name>
    <description>Several manually performed methods are used to align the toric IOL at the intended axis. Most of them use a 3-step procedure. First, the horizontal axis of the eye is temporarily marked with ink in a seated position to correct for cyclotorsion when changing into supine position. Three spots on the conjunctiva, close to the edge of the cornea, are applied at 0°, 90° and 180°, which may be done by using a bubblemarker or gravity marker with a calibrated horizontal position. Next, the desired alignment axis for the toric IOL is marked intra-operatively. The last step is to rotate the implanted toric IOL until the IOL markings agree with the alignment marks. After surgery is performed, the ink marks will disappear within a few hours.</description>
