  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are the sickest in hospital, and need
      advanced life-support. Survivors of critical illness are very weak and disabled. Up to 1 in 4
      have severe leg weakness impairing their quality of life for as long as 5 years after ICU
      discharge. In-bed cycling involves use of special equipment that attaches to a patient's
      hospital bed, allowing them gentle exercise while in the ICU.

      Methods: Adult patients admitted to the ICU who need a breathing machine and are expected to
      survive their ICU stay are eligible. Patients will randomly receive 30 minutes of in-bed
      cycling each day they are in the ICU or routine physiotherapy, both delivered by specially
      trained physiotherapists.

      Outcomes: Feasibility: The investigators will study whether patients can cycle on most days
      of their ICU stay, whether patients and their families agree to be a part of the study, and
      whether investigators can systematically assess patients' strength.

      Relevance: Effective methods of physiotherapy are needed for critically ill patients to
      minimize muscle weakness, speed recovery, and improve quality of life. This pilot randomized
      study is the second of several future larger studies about in-bed cycling in the ICU.
