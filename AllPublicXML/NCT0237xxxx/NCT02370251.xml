  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-assignment study to evaluate whether Omegaven (IV fish oil) is effective at
      treating liver disease in children on long-term IV nutrition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children up to 18 years of age, on parenteral nutrition, with a direct bilirubin level of 2
      mg/dL or greater will be eligible to receive Omegaven at a maximum dose of 1 g/kg/day.

      Up to 200 children will be eligible for enrollment.

      Direct bilirubin levels and other labs will be monitored as well as growth parameters.
