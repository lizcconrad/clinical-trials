  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies questionnaires in identifying arms, shoulder, and neck
      (upper extremity) function and quality of life after treatment in patients with breast
      cancer. Patients may experience arms, shoulder, and neck impairments that negatively affect
      their functioning and quality of life after cancer-related treatment. Studying upper
      extremity function and quality of life in patients after breast cancer treatment may help
      doctors determine the prevalence and severity of long-term functional impairments and the
      relationship between the perception of impairments due to breast cancer treatment and its'
      impact on quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the Disabilities of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] questionnaire) and their perception of quality of life (using
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast [FACT-B] questionnaire) one to ten years
      after breast cancer surgery and compare it to the general population.

      II. To investigate whether patients' upper extremity functionality and their perception of
      quality of life after completion of breast cancer treatment changes over the duration of time
      between 1 -10 years after breast cancer surgery.

      III. To characterize patient perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of
      life in relation to current upper-extremity functionality 1-10 years after breast cancer
      surgery.

      IV. To characterize patients' upper extremity functionality (using the DASH questionnaire)
      and their perception of the impact of breast cancer on their quality of life (using the
      FACT-B questionnaire) in a sub group of individuals with stable metastatic breast cancer 1-10
      years after initial diagnosis and surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assist the multidisciplinary team to identify musculoskeletal barriers (if any) that
      impact a patient's long-term recovery with respect to the breast cancer treatments they have
      received.

      II. To assist in developing and implementing a physical therapy component within the
      Personalized Medicine to Breast Cancer Care Plan; this includes early detection of potential
      physical barriers, physical therapy intervention models, and development of survivorship
      planning for cancer-related musculoskeletal impairments.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete the DASH and FACT-B questionnaires over 30-45 minutes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' upper extremity functionally 1 to 10 years after treatment using DASH score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DASH scores ranges from 0-100 with 1 being the least disability and 100 indicating the most disability. Means and standard deviation of the DASH will be calculated separately for patients with stable metastatic disease and those without metastatic diseases. These means will be compared with the general population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' perception of quality of life (QOL) 1 to 10 years after treatment using the FACT-B score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The total FACT-B score ranks from 0-144, with a high score indicating a better QOL. Means and standard deviation of the FACT-B will be calculated separately for patients with stable metastatic disease and those without metastatic diseases. These means will be compared with the general population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Discrepancy between the presence of physical impairments and patients' perception of QOL assessed using DASH and FACT-B scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using the distribution of the DASH and FACT-B scores reported in general population based studies, the percentile rank of each patient's DASH or FACT-B score will be calculated. Given that a higher DASH score indicates worse disability while a higher FACT-B score means a better quality of life, the percentile ranks for DASH will be subtracted from 100 and the remainder will be used as the percentile ranks for DASH for analyses purposes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time effect in the DASH score 1 to 10 years following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A linear regression model will be used to examine whether there is a time effect in the DASH score with DASH being the independent variable and time after treatment being the predictive variable. Other factors that will also be investigated as affecting DASH score will include whether or not a patient had full axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node dissection, or whether or not a patient received radiation therapy or chemotherapy, etc. Interaction between these main effects and time will be included to assess differences in time effect.</description>
