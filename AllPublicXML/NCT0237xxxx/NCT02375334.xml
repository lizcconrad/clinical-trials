    <textblock>
      This research trial studies an adherence monitoring system in managing myelosuppression in
      patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas who are receiving temozolomide and radiation
      therapy. The development of an adherence monitoring system may help doctors more effectively
      utilize electronic medical records to manage myelosuppression during standard treatment with
      temozolomide and radiation therapy in patients with malignant gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop an adherence monitoring system within Epic that is functionally equivalent to
      the previously designed and validated system in the Cancer Center Oncology Research
      Information System (ORIS) for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas receiving
      concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.

      II. To test the newly designed Epic system by comparing the frequency and timing of flags
      (laboratory date flags, visit date flags and in-patient status flags) and non-adherent days
      generated with the frequency and timing of those generated by ORIS for patients with newly
      diagnosed malignant gliomas receiving concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop both systems so that they may be easily adapted in the future to other
      therapies that require compliance monitoring.

      OUTLINE:

      Patient lab and visit dates are monitored by the Cancer Center ORIS and EPIC based systems
      during the 42 days of the concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.

    <description>To compare the two systems, the McNemar's tests of paired proportions will be used. For each day, whether or not any flag (laboratory date flags, visit date flags and in-patient status flags) was generated or whether a gap occurred will be characterized. By day, the two systems will be compared to determine if they agree for flags and gap days (separately). Alternative methods will be used (such as conditional logistic regression with a random subject effect) if correlation between days is observed.</description>
