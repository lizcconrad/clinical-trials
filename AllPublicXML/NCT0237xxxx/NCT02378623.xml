  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a patent foramen ovale in the setting of endocardially placed cardiac
      implantable electronic devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, or resynchronization
      therapies are likely at higher risk for paradoxical embolic events from device lead thrombus.
      The investigators are conducting this study to determine if the anticoagulant medication
      Apixaban is more effective at reducing MRI detected brain lesions compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      400 patients who meet the study eligibility criteria and consent for enrollment will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention with apixaban or control group with placebo. The
      randomization will be performed by a computer generated block randomization protocol. The
      majority of patients will begin intervention with Apixaban or placebo at the time of cardiac
      device placement (n approximately 300), and at least a quarter of the randomized patients (n
      ≥100) will include preexisting CIED (≥6 months) in place. Each patient will undergo a
      baseline MRI and a comprehensive cognitive screening examination. Repeat MRI and cognitive
      assessment will be performed at a follow-up period of two years from date of randomization
      (or less if clinical stroke/TIA occurs prior to this follow-up period). All subjects will
      receive a phone call at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post-randomization to assess for
      endpoints and adverse events, as well as changes in clinical status, medications, and to
      assess study medication compliance.
