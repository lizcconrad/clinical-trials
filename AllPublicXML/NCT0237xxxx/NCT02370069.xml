  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a great risk for infection due to
      their immune system being suppressed. Pneumococcal infection is particularly common and often
      results in death due to inflammation of lung (pneumonia) or the whole body (sepsis). This
      infection can be prevented using vaccines which help build protective immunity. The currently
      recommended pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax), however, is often inefficient in this group of
      patients. There is thus an urgent need to improve the existing vaccination policy.

      The goal of this research is to optimize pneumococcal vaccination of patients with severe
      CKD. Many patients suffering from CKD have already been vaccinated with Pneumovax. Because
      this vaccine has low immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals, they may still develop
      infection. A new vaccine, Prevnar13, has superior immunogenicity and has been recently
      approved for immunization. There is, however, no specific policy regarding immunization of
      adult CKD patients, and it is furthermore unknown whether previous Pneumovax immunization
      negatively affects immune response to Prevnar13.

      In order to test whether previous immunization with Pneumovax affects the immune response of
      severe CKD patients to Prevnar 13, the investigators will immunize two groups of adult stage
      4 and 5 CKD patients with one dose of Prevnar 13 and will assess their initial immunological
      response, its longevity, and vaccine safety. The first group will consist of patients who had
      been previously immunized with Pneumovax, and the second group will include participants with
      no history of pneumococcal vaccination.

      Antibody levels and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) will be quantified. The longevity of the
      immune response will be assessed. As a secondary objective, the immune response will be
      analyzed in the context of demographic and clinical characteristics of the vaccinated
      participants.

    <textblock>
      Adult patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) are immunocompromised and known to
      have an increased risk of pneumococcal infection. To prevent the infection, immunization with
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is currently recommended in Canada; however, the
      vaccine effect in these patients is suboptimal because of their immune dysfunction. The
      second-generation pneumococcal vaccines (polysaccharide-protein conjugate) have superior
      immunogenicity in some immunocompromised adult individuals. In Canada, Prevnar 13 has
      recently been recommended by the NACI for certain categories of immunocompromised adults,
      such as HSCT recipients and HIV-positive patients. However, the NACI has concluded that there
      is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of Prevnar 13 in patients with
      chronic kidney disease. No published data on the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in
      adults with CKD are available. Moreover, it is unknown whether a previous immunization with
      PPV23 may have a negative effect on the immune response to Prevnar 13 in these patients. Such
      a possibility exists due to the memory B-cells' depletion following immunization with pure
      polysaccharide antigens. In this case, additional doses of Prevnar 13 may be required to
      achieve the optimal protection. The conjugate vaccine will then expand the B-cell pool
      available to respond to subsequent antigen challenge. To test whether previous immunization
      with PPV23 affects the immune response of severe CKD patients to Prevnar 13, we will immunize
      two groups of adult stage 4 and 5 CKD patients attending the Thunder Bay Regional Health
      Sciences Centre with one dose of Prevnar 13 and will assess their initial immunological
      response, its longevity, and vaccine safety. The first group will consist of patients who had
      been immunized with PPV23 more than one year prior to the enrollment in this study and the
      second group will include patients without history of pneumococcal vaccination. Fold increase
      in antibody levels and OPA, as well as longevity of the immune response over a one-year
      period will be assessed as the surrogate for protection against pneumococcal infection. The
      immune response will be analyzed in the context of demographic and clinical characteristics
      of the vaccinated patients. All infectious episodes in the study participants will be
      recorded throughout one year of observation. We will also record all vaccine adverse effects
      following immunization and compare their frequency and severity between the two groups. The
      anticipated results of this trial will provide essential evidence to justify the use of
      Prevnar 13 for immunization of adult CKD patients.
