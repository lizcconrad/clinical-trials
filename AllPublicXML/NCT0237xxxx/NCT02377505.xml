  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing efficacy and safety of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for
      treatment of patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia, by means of a random,
      controlled and crossed study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of the study will consist of implanting electrodes. Recruited patients will
      be random to 2 targets: (1) medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); (2) nucleus accumbens (NAcc).
      Continuous stimulation will be applied until the patients stabilise clinically. This period
      is anticipated between 6 and 9 months.

      After this stage, the next phase will consist of the crossover study. Those patients who
      respond to DBS will be randomly distributed in two groups, for a period of 3 months: on
      stimulation group and off stimulation group. Patients will then be crossed over to the other
      group for a further 3 months.

      Weekly visits during first month after, and fortnightly visits will be made during the entire
      study to evaluate treatment efficacy and patient tolerance.

      Patients who complete the study and respond to treatment with DBS will be provided continuing
      with treatment, and keeping control visits to assess the long-term effectiveness.
