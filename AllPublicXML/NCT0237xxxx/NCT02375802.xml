  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study of 12 patients (6 control, 6 experimental) will test the safety and efficacy
      of applying autologous, adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs), uncultured, on a Stage III or
      IV pressure ulcer. Patients in both groups would undergo a minimal risk liposuction procedure
      to withdraw 50-100 cc of adipose tissue. The tissue would be processed to extract the stromal
      layer of cells that contain stem cells. The ASCs would be injected into a fibrin sealant to
      be applied to the wound. Patients would be followed for 6 weeks to assess wound healing and
      tolerance of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound healing for Stage III and IV pressure ulcers can take four to six weeks or longer and
      cost upwards of $40,000 to treat. Past studies have shown that adipose tissue contains
      progenitor cells or regenerative cells that can release multiple angiogenic growth factors
      and cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF) and chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). A current literature review
      revealed that there is research related to use of stem cells to enhance wound healing, in
      particular with ischemic or radiation-induced ulcers. However, there is limited research
      completed on use of stem cells or ASCs with pressure ulcers. The goal is to heal pressure
      ulcers faster and prevent further complications using the patient's own natural ASCs.

    <description>Liposuction will be done to extract 50-100 cc of adipose tissue which will be processed to obtain the stromal cells. The adipose-derived stromal cells will be injected into a fibrin sealant applicator and applied to the wound (intervention), Patients will receive 5.0x106 ASCs per cubic centimeter of wound area. The wound will be dressed with an occlusive dressing and soft silicone dressing. The dressing will remain in place for one week (minimally, 3 days). Follow-up will occur weekly for 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Liposuction will be done to extract 50-100 cc of adipose tissue which will be processed to obtain the stromal cells and then stored for the duration of the study. The fibrin sealant will be applied to the wound without the additive stromal cells. The wound will be dressed as the experimental group, with an occlusive dressing and soft silicone dressing. The dressing will remain in place for one week (minimally, 3 days). Follow-up will occur weekly for 6 weeks.</description>
