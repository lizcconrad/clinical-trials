  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, approximately 2 billion people live in areas at risk for malaria with morbidity
      surpassing 250 million cases, with approximately 800,000 deaths, per year. Of the four
      species of malaria parasites that cause human infection, P. falciparum is responsible for the
      majority of severe malaria cases followed by P. vivax. Early and accurate diagnosis is
      essential for prompt and correct treatment, which can reduce the death rate and interrupt
      transmission. Currently, conventional methods for the diagnosis of malaria include
      microscopic examination of thin and thick blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
      Light microscopy in practice typically detects parasitemia as low as 100 parasites/Âµl and it
      can differentiate species. The advantage of microscopy includes the ability to estimate
      parasitemia, the possibility to identify parasite stages, including gametocytes, and its low
      cost. However, this method is labor intensive, difficult to standardize, and requires
      well-trained microscopists. The majority of RDTs are based on detection of P. falciparum
      histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) antigen and do not detect all malaria species. RDTs that
      detect lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) and aldolase generally broadly react with all four species
      of malaria parasites and therefore cannot differentiate among the species although efforts
      are underway to improve their performance for species detection. In settings where multiple
      malaria species co-circulate, molecular methods may be more reliable than microscopy and RDTs
      in accurately diagnosing the species of malaria parasites with low parasitemias. However,
      conventional molecular methods, such as nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) or
      real-time PCR, are technically challenging and resource intensive and are generally
      restricted to reference laboratories due to the need for well-equipped laboratories.
      Recently, new molecular methods that can be used in field settings have been developed and
      this opens up new opportunities for exploring molecular tools for malaria diagnosis in
      endemic countries. With the objective of facilitating use of molecular tools for malaria
      control programs, the malaria laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) in Atlanta, USA developed a simple isothermal molecular method called Real-Time
      Fluorescence Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RealAmp) for the diagnosis of malaria.
      Currently, RealAmp primers exist for detecting the Plasmodium genus and the detection of P.
      falciparum and P. vivax species. The RealAmp method has great potential as a molecular tool
      for the diagnosis of malaria in the field (and other infections of major public health
      impact, such as HIV and tuberculosis). It can provide an alternative to conventional
      PCR-based diagnostic methods for field use in clinical and operational programs. The
      objective of this proposal is to validate the sensitivity of RealAmp for detection of malaria
      parasites in blood spots from patients with clinical diagnosis of malaria in two endemic
      states of Brazil with co-circulation of P. falciparum and P. vivax. In this evaluation,
      RealAmp and microscopic examination will be compared to a real-time PCR method as a reference
      test.
