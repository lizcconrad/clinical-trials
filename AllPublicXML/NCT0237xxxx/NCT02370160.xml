  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study of DT2219 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD19 (+)
      and/or CD 22 (+) B-lineage leukemia and lymphoma. The study consists of two phases - a phase
      I dose/schedule finding component using the maximum tolerated dose identified during the
      previous phase I study, but with a higher number of doses and a two-stage phase II extension
      component to confirm safety and make a preliminary determination of the activity level by
      disease using the dose identified in phase I.
