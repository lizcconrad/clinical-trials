  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several reasons can explain non-attendance in cervical cancer screening. In low resource
      settings the attendance is even lower. The effect of fee as contributing reason of non
      attendance has not been studied before why the investigators decided to study this in a low
      resource setting as a randomised trial.

      Non-attendance in the cervical cancer screening programme is the most important factors why
      Swedish women contract the disease. Low attendance rate is observed in districts with low
      socioeconomic resources. Several reasons can explain this, including the existence of a fee.
      A low attendance rate in low resource districts is also noticed in Gothenburg, Sweden. After
      multiple interventions the coverage has slightly increased. None of the interventions
      included the aspect of the fee. The investigators decided to study the effect of fee
      abolishment in a randomized control trial emanating from the regular cervical
      cancer-screening program. Method: Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Women in low resource areas
      of Gothenburg, due for screening, January-July 2013, were randomised to receive an offer of a
      free test or receiving the regular invitation stating the regular fee of 100 Swedish kronor
      (SEK) (≈11 €). Power calculation has shown 80 % power to detect an increase in participation
      of 20% at 1972 participants.

    <description>Information from the database regarding study arm was linked, via citizen unique personal number, to the National Cervical Screening Quality Register.
