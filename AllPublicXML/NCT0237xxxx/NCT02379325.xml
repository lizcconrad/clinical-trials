    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation is a priority for preventing smoking-attributable disease and reducing its
      burden. Quitting smoking at any age confers substantial and immediate health benefits,
      including reduced risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and smoking-related cancers, and
      quitting smoking by the age of 30 reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases by
      almost 90%. The World Bank suggests that if adult cigarette consumption were to decrease by
      half in the year 2020, approximately 180 million tobacco-attributable deaths could be
      avoided. Therefore, promotion of smoking cessation has been proposed as a primary focus of
      tobacco control efforts, especially in developing countries where smoking prevalence and
      cigarette consumption are both still relatively high

      most risk factors are associated with more than one disease, and targeting those factors can
      reduce multiple causes of disease. Since smoking has 9% contributions on the leading global
      risk towards mortality in the world and this risk factor has resulted in multiple causes of
      disease for example, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory disease and
      other conditions therefore by quantifying the impact of this risk factors on diseases, may
      help to decrease the number of burden disease that is caused by smoking. University students
      age of 18 -24 are among the group of age that has the highest prevalence on smoking, thus it
      is necessary to targeting the high-risk people, who are most likely to benefit from the
      intervention. Population-based strategies seek to change the social norm by encouraging an
      increase in healthy behavior and a reduction in health risk. University students are in
      transition between the adolescence and early adulthood and developed unhealthy behaviors like
      cigarette smoking

    <description>Five tracks were created including &quot;Not Ready&quot;, &quot;Beginner&quot;, &quot;Advance&quot;, &quot;Relapse&quot;, and &quot;Distraction&quot;. The &quot;Distraction&quot; track was combined with all of the other remaining 4 tracks. It was aimed as a distraction (as the name indicated) method to lighten the participants mood. It consisted of general information such as sports, fashion, dining, movies, and travelling.</description>
