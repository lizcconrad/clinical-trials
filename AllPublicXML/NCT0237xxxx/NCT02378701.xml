  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test a quality-of-life questionnaire called QUALMS-1 in
      patients with MDS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete questionnaires twice
      during your participation in the 2014-0112 study.

      During your first treatment visit, you will be asked to complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire
      and another questionnaire that asks about your well-being.

      After your 4th cycle of treatment or when you stop receiving treatment, you will be asked to
      complete the QUALMS-1 questionnaire again and another questionnaire to rate any changes in
      your health since you started the study.

      It should take about 20 minutes total to complete the questionnaires each time.

      Information will also be collected from your medical record. This information will include
      the results of lab tests and other information relating to your health.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After you complete the questionnaires the second time, your participation in this study will
      be complete.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 240 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 80 will take part at
      MD Anderson.

    <description>Participants rate any change in their quality of life since enrollment using a 7-point Likert-type change rating scale, ranging from much better, to no change, to much worse. This change rating scale used to characterize the QUALMS-1's reliability compared to its first administration as well as its responsiveness.</description>
