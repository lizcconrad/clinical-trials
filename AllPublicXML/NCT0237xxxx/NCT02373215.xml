  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center clinical research study with the purpose to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of nalbuphine HCl ER (extended release) tablets in
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) therapy and reporting
      pruritus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PK of nalbuphine hemodialysis (HD) patients is unknown and will be investigated under
      controlled dialysis conditions in the proposed clinical PK study.

      Nalbuphine is a small molecular weight, water-soluble molecule with low protein binding
      (approximately 50%) and a large volume of distribution. In addition, its disposition is
      perfusion-rate limited. In the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on HD, nalbuphine
      plasma clearance may be impacted, although it is predominantly hepatically cleared in the
      feces.

      A dose-escalation design was selected to mimic nalbuphine use in uremic pruritus (UP)
      patients in subsequent clinical efficacy studies whereby patients will start at a low dose to
      minimize the AEs such as nausea and vomiting and allow the patients to develop some tolerance
      to these particular AEs.
