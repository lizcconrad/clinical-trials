  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm pilot study tries to invesitgate how well giving icotinib with rh-endostatin
      (Endostar®) works in treating patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations. Icotinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Anti-angiogeneiss drug, such as rh-endostatin, can block tumor growth by inhibiting the
      ability of tumors to grow new blood vessels and spread. It is not yet known whether icotinib
      is more effective when given with rh-endostatin in NSCLC patients with EGFR activating
      mutations.

      1. Open-label, single-arm, prospective pilot study.

        2. Definition of advanced non small cell lung cancer: stage IIIb or IV. EGFR mutation
           status: activating mutation (defined as deletion 19 or exon 21 L858R mutation).

        3. Before starting study treatment, computed tomography scans of the chest, B ultrasound of
           abdomen, 12-lead electrocardiogram, MRI scan of brain, and a bone scan are required.

        4. Tumor response, based on investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
           Tumors (RECIST v.1.1), will be evaluated every 6 weeks during treatment.

        5. Exploratory evaluation will be performed using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).

        6. QoL will be assessed using the core module, which will be completed by patients at
           baseline and before each cycle during treatment.

        7. All patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed for
           survival.
