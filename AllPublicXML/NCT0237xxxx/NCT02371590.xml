  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1/2 study for patients with CLL or (SLL) who have not been previously treated.
      This study will evaluate whether obinutuzumab and lenalidomide is safe and tolerable in this
      setting and induce complete clinical responses.

      This is phase 1/2 study for patients with CLL or (SLL) who have not been previously treated.
      The primary endpoint is to determine safety and tolerability of the regimen and determine
      complete response (CR) to therapy. The secondary endpoints will assess the impact of
      treatment on progression free and overall survival

      Eligible patients will receive obinutuzumab for 6 x 28 day cycles. Patients will also receive
      lenalidomide orally once daily on days 8-28 of each 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all
      patients is 5 mg PO daily. At the start of each cycle, there is intra-patient dose-escalation
      to a maximum of 25mg daily, as tolerated.
