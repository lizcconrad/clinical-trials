      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different spinal cord stimulation
      settings in the treatment of leg pain. Subjects will receive a randomized order of four
      different programmed stimulation settings for 3 weeks each followed by a fifth and final
      setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 22 years of age or older at the time of informed consent

          -  Implanted with a Medtronic RestoreSensor or RestoreUltra SCS system for an on-label
             indication at least 6 months for the treatment of chronic leg pain, with or without
             back pain

          -  Implanted with one or more Medtronic leads located in the epidural space within the
             thoracic area

          -  Receiving some level of pain relief with current SCS therapy

          -  On a stable dose (no new, discontinued or changes in) of all prescription pain
             medications and willing to maintain or only decrease the dose of all prescribed pain
             medications

          -  Read and understand English without assistance

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures, study visits, and be available
             for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), peripheral causalgia, or reflex
             sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), or causalgia

          -  Has leg, knee, or foot pain unrelated to on-label indication for SCS therapy (for eg,
             arthritis, knee surgery, etc.)

          -  Implanted with both a surgical and percutaneous lead

          -  Implanted with a peripheral lead for subcutaneous or peripheral nerve stimulation

          -  Has had any of the following procedures:

               -  Neuroablative procedure within six months

               -  Neurolytic block within two months

               -  Injection therapy for pain within four weeks

               -  Sympathetic block within two weeks

          -  Has an active implanted device (besides RestoreUltra or RestoreSensor
             neurostimulator), whether turned ON or OFF

          -  Pregnant or lactating, inadequate birth control, or at risk of pregnancy during this
             study

          -  Has an untreated psychiatric comorbidity

             for at least one year

          -  Has secondary gains which, in the opinion of the investigator, are likely to interfere
             with the study

          -  Participating or planning to participate in another clinical trial while enrolled in
             this study
