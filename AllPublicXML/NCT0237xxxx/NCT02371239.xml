      Introduction: Changes in lifestyle are responsible for an important part of the type 2
      diabetes epidemic of the last decennia. Current guidelines for physical activity focus mainly
      on high energy expenditure advising 30 minutes per day moderate to vigorous physical activity
      (most often physical exercise). Recent studies suggest that sitting has negative metabolic
      effects independent of the time spent exercising (Duvivier et al. PLOS ONE 2013).

      Low intensity physical activity (LIPA) -such as walking and standing- has been suggested to
      be an alternative to decrease the hyperglycaemic effect of sitting. Compared to exercise,
      LIPA might be a more feasible strategy. But, it remains to be determined whether reducing
      sitting time by replacing it by LIPA, results in lower 24 hour blood glucose levels and less
      blood glucose fluctuations (glycaemic variability) in type 2 diabetes patients and whether
      these effects are independent of the increase in energy expenditure

      Methods: The study population will involve 19 people with type 2 diabetes (BMI: 25-35 kg/m2)
      who perform no, or only little, exercise and who are treated with diet only or with oral
      blood glucose lowering medication. They will perform three regimes of each four days: 1) a
      sitting regime, 2) an exercise regime and a 3) sit less regime. Daily energy expenditure of
      the exercise regime will be identical to that of the sit less regime. Sitting, walking and
      standing will be objectively measured by a 24 hour physical activity monitor. The energy
      spent during exercise will be standardised and quantified by using a bicycle ergometer;
      energy intake will be standardised as well. During each regime blood glucose will be measured
      with a 24 hour continuous glucose sensor.
