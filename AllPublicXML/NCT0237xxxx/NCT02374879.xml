      This is an open-label, non-randomised pilot study, to evaluate user performance and system
      accuracy in blood Glucose monitoring system with glucose adjustment. Twelve male and female
      volunteers aged 18-45, with a documented diagnosis of Type I diabetes for at least 12 will be
      enrolled in this study.

        Summary of inclusion criteria.

          -  Male and female volunteers aged 18-45, with a documented diagnosis of Type I diabetes
             for at least 12 months and treated with a basal bolus insulin regime, and deemed
             otherwise healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             test values, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs at screening.

          -  Non-smokers from at least 12 months before study start and for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2.

          -  Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the

             during the informed consent process.

          -  Must be willing to consent to have data entered into The Over Volunteering Prevention
             System (TOPS).

          -  The volunteer's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that
             there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a
             clinical study.

          -  User Performance Accuracy Testing Only: Self-Monitoring - Volunteer is currently
             performing unassisted self-monitoring of blood glucose.

        Summary of exclusion criteria.

          -  A severe hypoglycaemic reaction, defined as causing loss of consciousness and/or
             requiring outside assistance with oral or intravenous glucose or a glucagon injection,
             within 7 days of the study start date.

          -  Female volunteers who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

             test at screening or check-in.

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days prior to study start.

          -  Any clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to study start.

          -  Donation of blood or blood products within 30 days prior to study start, or at any
             time during the study, except as required by this protocol.

          -  Weekly alcohol intake exceeding the equivalent of 14 units per week for females or 21
             units per week for males.

          -  Consumption of alcoholic beverages within 48 hours prior to check-in.

          -  Volunteers with a substantial change in eating habits within 30 days prior to study
             start or volunteers who cannot comply with the standardised meals proposed for use in
             the study.

          -  Prior experience with the BGMSs used for the study.

          -  Volunteers who are currently working for, have previously worked for, or have an
