  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study we aim to determine if early glucose screening and treatment among women
      at high risk for GDM improves perinatal outcome and decreases gestational weight gain. Half
      of the participant will be assigned to an early glucose screen group (12-18 weeks) and
      treatment if necessary and the other half to a standard 24-28 weeks glucose screen.

    <description>The primary study outcome is a composite of perinatal morbidities including perinatal mortality (stillbirth or neonatal death), neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and birth trauma. Transcutaneous bilirubin is routinely measured at Tampa General Hospital (TGH) on all babies at least once. A value greater than the 95th percentile for or need for phototherapy at any given point after birth will be considered an elevated level. Birth trauma is defined as brachial plexus palsy or clavicular, humeral, or skull fracture.</description>

    <description>Participants with high risk factors for gestational diabetes, will be randomly assigned to an early glucose screen group: it consists of an oral load of 50 grams of glucose followed by a measurement of serum glucose 1 hour later, and if abnormal (higher than 130mg/dl), will undergo a 100 gram oral load of glucose followed by serum glucose levels drawn 1,2 and 3 hours after the load. If abnormal according to Carpenter-Cousant criteria, the participant will undergo standard of care for Gestational Diabetes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pregnant subjects 18-45 y/o and Any of the following:

        Obesity defined as having a BMI&gt;30 kg/m2 History of pregnancy complicated with GDM History
        of pregnancy complicated with macrosomia First degree relative with diabetes Multiple
        gestation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Incomplete Data: if any data is missing (i.e Delivery data) , analysis cannot be
             completed.

        Pregnancy complicated with fetal malformations or aneuploidy: It affects prenatal care,
        mode of delivery as well as perinatal outcome.

        Pregestational or Overt Diabetes: Patients with Diabetes cannot be diagnosed with GDM.

        Chronic medical conditions such as hypertension, renal disease, autoimmune conditions:
        Those conditions may affect prenatal care, perinatal morbidity.

        Early diabetes screen performed prior to enrollment in study: Participant cannot be
        randomized, and probably have been treated.

        Medical contraindication to glucose tolerance test (bariatric surgery): patients with h/o
        gastric bypass frequently cannot tolerate oral glucose load, therefore cannot be screened
        for GDM in the traditional way.
