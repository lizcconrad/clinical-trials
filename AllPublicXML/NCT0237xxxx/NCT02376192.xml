  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pregnant women undergoing a cesarean delivery. It will compare their
      microcirculation before and after the anesthetic. Microcirculation means blood flow to the
      extremely small blood vessels in the body. It will also look at the differences in
      microcirculation of participants who receive an infusion of phenylephrine compared to
      participants who don't. The investigators hypothesize that spinal anesthesia will reduce the
      vascular density and proportion of perfused vessels.

    <description>Initial MicroScan® (Microvision Medical) SDF measurement are recorded in the obstetric preoperative area within two hours prior to administration of spinal anesthesia. In the operating room participants will receive a standard spinal anesthetic (hyperbaric bupivacaine, fentanyl and preservative free morphine) followed by a second comparative MicroScan® (Microvision Medical) SDF measurement within 10 minutes of initiation of spinal anesthetic. Participants who experience hypotension will receive bolus phenylephrine and/or ephedrine treatment as needed.</description>
