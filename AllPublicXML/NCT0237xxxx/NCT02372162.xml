    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized observational study in patients
      with advanced HCC. The patients qualify either to a local treatment with transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) or to a systemic treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib.
      The aim of this feasibility study is to get a comprehensive image and molecular fingerprint
      of individual tumors, with the intention to govern therapy decisions. Furthermore, to improve
      the care of patients that get progressive disease under treatment, the investigators have to
      improve the investigators understanding of the development of therapy resistance, which will
      improve patient care at the time point of progressive disease. Therefore, the data of 20
      patients in each group will be used to identify molecular and / or image patterns, that can
      be used to predict treatment responses and thus govern an optimized individual cancer
      treatment for patients with advanced HCC.

      A single-center, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized clinical trial. The two treatment
      groups to receive:

      Group A Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE): 20 patients that are treated with TACE will
      get an image and molecular fingerprint of the tumor prior to the first treatment with TACE, a
      second image fingerprint between week 2 - 4 after the first treatment with TACE, and a third
      image and molecular fingerprint at the time point of progressive disease.

      Group B Sorafenib: 20 patients that are treated with Sorafenib will get an image and
      molecular fingerprint of the tumor prior to the first treatment, between week 2 and 3 after
      the start of treatment and at the time point of progressive disease.

             uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) related to
             primary cardiac disease, a condition requiring anti arrhythmic therapy, ischemic or
             severe valvular heart disease, or a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the
             trial entry.

          6. Current evidence of any severe internal, psychiatric or neurologic disease.

          7. Altered mental status precluding understanding of the informed consent process and/or
