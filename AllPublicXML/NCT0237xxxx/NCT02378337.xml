    <time_frame>360 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be kilograms (kg) for body weight, and percentage for the variation coefficient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of dose-regimen with the variation coefficient (image noise).</measure>
    <time_frame>360 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The dose-regimen will be calculated based on radiation dose and body surface. The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be MegaBecquerel per kilogram (MBq/kg) for dose-regimen, and percentage for the variation coefficient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of acquisition protocol time with the variation coefficient (image noise).</measure>
    <time_frame>360 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Images will be acquired every 30 seconds until a maximum of 360 seconds. The image noise will be measured by VOI (Volume Of Interest) in the images. The units of measure will be seconds for the acquisition time, and percentage for the variation coefficient.</description>
