    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to compare QoL in subjects with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) requiring PD or conventional in-center HD treatment.

      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of peritoneal
      dialysis (PD) treatment as compared to hemodialysis (HD) treatment after approximately 1 year
      of therapy using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQoL-SF) questionnaire
      domain of burden of kidney disease.

      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to observe and summarize the following
      parameters in subjects receiving PD or HD treatment except for the remaining domains of QoL
      instrument KDQoL-SF™ (version 1.3) and the 2 individual QoL items scored as single items,
      which will be compared between the 2 treatment groups:

        -  Mortality rates

        -  Switch (PD to HD or HD to PD)

        -  Transplantation rate

        -  Cause of death

        -  Dialysis adequacy (ie, urea clearance time normalized by total body water, which is the
           volume of distribution of urea [Kt/V urea] to determine the proportion of subjects
           meeting standards of care for dialysis adequacy).

        -  24-hour urine volume

        -  Change in hemoglobin and S-phosphate levels, and the percentages of subjects with values
           within the target range

        -  Change in serum albumin

        -  Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), including abnormal laboratory
           test findings with clinical significance

             predialysis education program and have completed this education prior to signing the
