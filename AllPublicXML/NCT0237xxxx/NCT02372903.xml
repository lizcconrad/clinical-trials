  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main symptoms of endometriosis is pain, but his pathogenesis is not fully
      understood. The detection of mast cells in the endometriosis lesions supports the hypothesis
      that mast cell degranulation may contribute to development of pain and hyperalgesia.

      N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of endogenous compounds that regulate inflammation and
      pain, controlling mast-cell activation. The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy
      of palmitoylethanolamide-polydatin combination on pain relief in symptomatic patients with
      endometriosis.
