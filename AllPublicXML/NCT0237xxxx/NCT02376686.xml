      symptoms in patients with depressive Syndromes and often persist after successful treatment
      of affective symptoms. Normally disrupted sleep in the context of affective disorder is
      treated with sleep medication, which can lead to severe and sometimes intolerable side
      effects.

      A non-pharmacological approach for improving sleep Quality is Hearing Music before going to
      sleep. Classical indian Music can improve sleep Quality in depressed patients. In a danish
      study protocol Western Music improved sleep quality in patients with disturbed sleep and
      posttraumatic stress disorder.

      The investigators want to use western Music to improve sleep . In a three week Intervention
      time, patients shall hear before going to sleep every night for one hour relaxing Music. The
      control group receives Treatment as usual. After the end of Intervention, every participant
      has the possibility to use the sleep inducing Music.

      The aim of the study is to prove whether Hearing Music before going to sleep over three weeks
      improves subjective sleep quality, self rated depressive symptoms and Quality of life and
      objective Parameters such as sleep duration and sleep latency, measured by actigraphy. In a
      follow-up interview four weeks after the Intervention the investigators want to prove if the
      effects continue after end of Intervention.
