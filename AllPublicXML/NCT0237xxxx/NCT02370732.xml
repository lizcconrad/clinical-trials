  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will help to understand the changes in reinforcement and impairment
      experienced by Roux en Y bariatric surgery (RYGB) patients who consume alcohol. In this study
      the investigators propose to investigate RYGB patients with a prospective, longitudinal
      design. Investigators will examine driving impairment before and after surgery as well as
      study cognitive changes and reinforcement changes that may occur in RYGB patients while
      consuming alcohol. Finally, investigators aim to better characterize the changes that occur
      in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol following bariatric surgery and examine key variables
      which may play a role in the development in alcohol use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three major objectives of this NIH sponsored application are: 1) to characterize the
      severity of cognitive impairment and driving performance changes following alcohol
      consumption in a group of patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)
      bariatric surgery and 2) to investigate differential reinforcing properties of alcohol in
      patients before and after they undergo RYGB. Both of these objectives stem from observations
      from the investigators work and previous empirical studies suggesting that the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of alcohol are substantially altered following bariatric surgery. This
      may lead to alterations in the time-course and severity of alcohol-related cognitive and
      driving impairment, as well as alter the reinforcing effects of drinking alcohol.
      Particularly relevant to these objectives, PK data have shown higher peak alcohol
      concentrations and a shorter time to achieve them in bariatric surgery patients. Therefore
      the third objective of this application is to better characterize the PK profile of alcohol
      following RYGB. Finally, investigators will explore whether changes in impairment,
      reinforcement, and PKs are moderated by gender, age, smoking, and alcohol use.

      In this study investigators propose to prospectively investigate approximately 50-60 RYGB
      patients. Participants will be assessed at baseline (pre-surgery) and one year after surgery
      (to approximate their weight nadir) in an acute alcohol dosing laboratory paradigm.

    <measure>Change in Drive Safety RS-300 Research Driving Simulator Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery (up to 3 months before surgery) and 1 year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will be assessing participants for evidence of a change in driving impairment using the Drive Safety RS-300 Research Driving Simulator, which provides a high-quality, authentic automotive control environment based on a midsized Ford Focus passenger car. The simulation is controlled by a bank of computers running DriveSafety's Vection software, which enables real-time data collection and updating of the displays. DriveSafety's HyperDrive Authoring Suite is used to model complex driving scenarios and to precisely control the presentation of stimuli within the simulated environment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Desire-for-Drug Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery (up to 3 months before surgery) and 1 year post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Desire-for-Drug Scale is a 4-item VAS measure commonly used in research on alcohol priming effects that study increases in motivation to drink after a dose of alcohol (e.g., Fillmore, 2001). The scale measures the motivation to consume alcohol (i.e., priming), assesses subjective ratings of its effect, and is viewed as an indicator of the reward a person associates with alcohol consumption. The measure of priming is assessed by an item that asks participants how much they &quot;have a desire for alcohol&quot;.</description>
