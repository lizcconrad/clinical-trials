      To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (Icotinib) with
      concurrent radiotherapy in older patients with esophageal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older patients with esophageal cancer have been correlated with poor prognosis because of
      having little chance to receive aggressive local therapy, including surgery or concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. EGFR is overexposed in most of the cases. In this phase II trial, the
      efficacy and toxicity of EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (Icotinib) with concurrent
      radiotherapy will be investigated in this setting.
