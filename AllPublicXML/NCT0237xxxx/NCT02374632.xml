  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After gastric bypass, 10-20% of patients will obtain a suboptimal weight loss, often defined
      as &lt;50% of the excess body weight. Exaggerated meal related secretion of gut hormones seem
      important for appetite reduction and subsequent weight loss after gastric bypass, however it
      is not clear whether different gut hormone responses are responsible for different
      postoperative weight loss responses. The purpose of the study is to investigate gut hormone
      secretion, vagal integrity and the effect of octreotide on ad libitum food intake in patients
      with suboptimal weight loss after gastric bypass and compare results to a matched group of
      gastric bypass operated patients with high postoperative weight loss but similar age, sex and
      preoperative BMI.
