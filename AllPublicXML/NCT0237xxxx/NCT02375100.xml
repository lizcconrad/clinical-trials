    <textblock>
      This study compares efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block and ilioinguinal nerve
      block for postoperative pain in patients undergoing inguinal herniorraphy with spinal
      anesthesia. One-third of the patients will receive standard postoperative pain
      regimen(control group), one-third will receive a transversus abdominis plane block (with
      ultrasound guidance) and the last group will receive an ilioinguinal nerve block(with
      ultrasound guidance) in addition to standard postoperative pain regimen. This study is a
      Randomized prospective open-label controlled study.
