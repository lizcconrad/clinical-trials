    <textblock>
      Cow's milk allergy is an immunologically mediated adverse reaction to milk proteins. In
      industrialized countries there is an incidence of 2-3% in children younger than 2 years.
      Cow's milk allergy may present with different clinical pictures and symptoms often
      nonspecific. Among the most common are certainly food refusal and failure to thrive until
      frameworks frank malnutrition. It was also noted that the cow's milk allergy can have a
      negative impact on the quality of life of the patient and his family.

      The treatment of this condition provides the setting of a diet that is free of the allergen
      to the base of the adverse reaction.

      There are some types of formulas for the treatment of this condition. The formulas based on
      amino acids are currently used in all cases non-responsive to treatment with the above
      formulas or in all those characterized by severe allergic reactions. Being made from amino
      acids such formulas are by definition non-allergenic. They have also proven to ensure a rapid
      resolution of symptoms favoring a resumption of growth, nutritional status, as well as lead
      to a rapid improvement in the quality of life of the patient and his family. However, the
      studies currently available to us concerning the effects of nutritional formulas based on
      amino acids affect short observation periods (usually less than 6 months) and were directed
      to a comparison only with hydrolysates of whey protein or casein and not with healthy
      subjects. To date thus lack consistent data on the nutritional effects in the medium to long
      term.
