    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and the length of effect on platelet
      build-up in the arteries of Durlaza™ as compared to immediate-release Bayer® aspirin 81 mg or
      subject's current aspirin 81 mg of choice in patients who have Type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors of developing cardiovascular disease.
