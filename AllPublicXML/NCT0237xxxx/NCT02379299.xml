  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate T1D treatment tool is a closed-loop glucose control system, i.e. a fully
      automated system for intensive insulin treatment. Such system will ease the burden of
      constant treatment decision-making and at the same time it has the potential to safely
      intensify insulin therapy such that more patients can reach treatment goals. Currently, no
      off-the-shelf closed-loop system exists but research efforts in this field have been
      intensified and resulted in great progress in recent years. Most closed-loop systems consist
      of an insulin pump, a CGM, and a control algorithm residing on a mobile computer that
      continuously (every 5-15 min) computes the optimal insulin dosage from the CGM values. For
      daytime blood glucose control, however, we believe that the system needs to be further
      advanced. Consequently, we have extended our single-hormone closed-loop system such that it
      now includes a second pump for glucagon delivery and correspondingly we have further
      developed our control algorithm to compute both insulin and glucagon dosages.

      We hypothesize that we have developed a safe and effective dual-hormone closed-loop system
      for patients with type 1 diabetes and that this system is superior to single-hormone
      closed-loop therapy. The aims of this two-phase project are to 1) demonstrate
      proof-of-concept and 2) to compare dual-hormone with single-hormone closed-loop glucose
      control.
