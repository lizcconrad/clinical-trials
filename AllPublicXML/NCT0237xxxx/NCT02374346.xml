      To evaluate the association of anaesthesia and surgery with postoperative headache in
      elective surgery patients By multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected during a
      six-month period from 446 patients undergoing elective surgery, a prospective single centre
      cohort study in a university hospital. Participants were interviewed preoperatively and for
      five days postoperatively regarding the appearance of headache; while demographics, life
      style, type of anaesthesia and surgery, the anaesthetic drugs administered and intraoperative
      adverse effects in elective surgery patients are recorded.

      A dedicated team interviewed patients preoperatively and during the first five postoperative
      days and collected data regarding medical history, surgery, anaesthesia and the presence of
      postoperative headache by manual record review. The frequency of preoperative headache was
      assessed by asking the subjects on the appearance or not of headache within the last year.
      Additional information were obtained to distinguish migraine which was deemed present only
      when the participants reported two or more of the following specific symptoms supporting this
      diagnosis as proposed by the International Headache Society; episodic headache (4-72 hours)
      with the following features: moderate or severe throbbing pain, worsened by movement,
      associated with nausea/vomiting, photophobia or phonophobia, with or without visual aura.

      Specifically, preoperative data included patients' demographics, marital status, life-style
      and habits, as caffeine consumption (&gt;200 mg/day or &gt;2 cups of coffee/day), alcohol (drink
      equivalent &gt; 15ml absolute alcohol) and tobacco consumption, previous experience or/and
      family history of headache. Intraoperative data included the type of anaesthesia (general,
      regional anaesthesia or their combination); anaesthetic drugs used; type and duration of
      surgery; intraoperative patients' position; and intraoperative adverse events including
      hypotension (decrease &gt;20% from baseline), hypertension (increase &gt;20% from baseline),
      hypercarbia (PaCO2 &gt;6 kPa) and hypoxia (SpO2 &lt;90%). Noticeably, the choice of anaesthetic
      technique and postoperative management were determined by the engaged anaesthesiologist.

      Postoperative headache was defined as a dichotomous variable (i.e. present or not present) by
      asking the participants twice daily for the first five days (or less if discharged earlier)
      after anaesthesia and surgery.
