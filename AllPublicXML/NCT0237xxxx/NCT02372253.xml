  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of using oral
      verapamil in subjects with recent onset T1D in order to downregulate TXNIP and enhance the
      patients' endogenous beta cell mass and insulin production. The objectives are therefore to
      assess parameters of beta cell survival (including new biomarkers), insulin production and
      glucose control and the feasibility of this approach and thereby provide the basis for
      future, larger/expanded, longer-term verapamil studies and the off-label use of this approved
      drug for T1D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass is a key factor in T1D, but therapies to halt this process
      are not available. The investigators have discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP),
      as a promising target in this regard and have now found that the commonly used
      anti-hypertensive drug and calcium channel-blocker, verapamil, effectively lowers beta-cell
      TXNIP expression in rodent beta-cells and human islets, promotes beta-cell survival and
      rescues mice from T1D. This makes verapamil a potentially attractive drug for T1D, but
      prospective clinical data are lacking. The investigators primary objective is therefore to
      conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      verapamil in adults with recent-onset T1D and to demonstrate that subjects on oral verapamil
      daily for 12 months will have improved insulin production (as an indirect measure of
      beta-cell mass).

      Results will have major translational implications with potential immediate impact on
      clinical care, encourage large clinical follow-up trials, evaluate markers of beta cell
      health and ultimately help develop a novel therapy that enhances the patient's own beta-cell
      mass and function.
