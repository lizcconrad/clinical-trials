      The purpose of this study is to establish a non-invasive objective measurement for the
      detection of concussions with the Jan Medical Device (JMD). The study will assess the ability
      of this device to demonstrate unique signals that correlate with concussions. The study will
      also test the athletes at baseline at rest and during exertion to determine if there is a
      difference in the signal from exertion alone. The JMD is a non-invasive band that is placed
      around the participants head. The JMD detects a unique pattern of signals based on
      displacement of the skull from changes in blood flow during individual heartbeats. The
      athletes will be tested longitudinally to assess to changes over time, in addition to changes
      after impact

    <measure>A Measure Assessing the Sensitivity and Specificity Rate Based on the Nautilus Neurowave Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Individual assessments were made within 2 days of recording</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate) measures the proportion of concussed participants that are correctly identified as such by utilizing the information within the Nautilus Neurowave data. Sensitivity (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of non-concussed participants that are correctly identified as such by utilizing the information within the Nautilus Neurowave data
The information that is evaluated from within this data is recognized through the computation of two parameters, R1 and R2. Both R1 and R2 are measured by computing the frequency spectrum using an FFT of the Neurowave data and computing a ratio of the signal intensities at specific higher frequencies against specific lower frequencies within that spectrum. Based on this computation, the recorded data is evaluated as coming from a concussed participant if R1 &gt;= 1.0 and R2 &gt;= 0.66 and is considered non-concussed otherwise.</description>

    <description>When a subject is suspected of a concussion, a Nautilus NeuroWaveTM System recording is obtained from the subject and the recording is evaluated by a Jan Medical concussion algorithm. The subject is declared concussed or not per the algorithm. This is compared to a SCAT test.</description>

    <description>All subjects at the start of study have a baseline recording using the Nautilus NeuroWaveTM System. These subjects are enrolled into the study as non-concussed and these recordings serve as control recordings. Additionally, some subjects from this cohort will be recorded again at the end of the study to obtain end of season recordings. These results are compared to a SCAT test.</description>

          <description>SCAT 2 was used to perform baseline testing in the athletes before the football season began. Of these, 9 without a concussion during the season, elected to have an additional recording done at the end of the year. If an athletic sustained an impact and sideline physicians or trainers regarded the impact as a concussion, the athlete had SCAT2 testing performed and JMD testing.The scale is based on total symptoms and symptoms severity score, with 0 being the least severe and 132 being the most severe. In other words, the higher the the score value, the worse the condition. Score range is 0-132.</description>
