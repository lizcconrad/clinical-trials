      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of telecoaching conducted by a counselor
      trained in motivational interviewing paired with a portion control device for obese patients
      receiving care in a certified patient-centered medical home. The investigators will conduct a
      randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a telecoaching
      intervention with a portion control device.

      The intervention will be provided during a 3-month period with follow-up through 6 months
      after randomization. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference measurements will be
      collected at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Participants will also complete
      measures assessing eating behaviors and physical activity at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.
