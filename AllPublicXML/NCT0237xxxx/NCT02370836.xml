      This study evaluates that effects of psycho-oncological education on distress and quality of

      the other half will receive usual care.

    <textblock>
      Solid tumor cancer patients who have completed chemotherapy with curative intent experience
      psychological distress. As a result these patients experience poorer quality of life (QOL),
      emotional vulnerability and unnecessary emotional suffering.

      Purpose: To determine whether the implementation of a nurse driven psycho-oncological
      educational session will decrease psychological distress levels and improve QOL among solid
      tumor cancer patients who have received and completed chemotherapy with curative intent.

      Methods: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) consisting of 28 eligible patients at Sibley
      Memorial Hospital will be used to compare the effect of psycho-oncological education to
      treatment as usual in reducing psychological distress and improving quality of life. The
      intervention group will receive one 60 minute session of psycho-oncological education. The
      comparison group will receive usual care only which includes a general information session
      offered prior to any treatment which addresses broad side-effects of treatment, an overview
      of the treatment process and identification of additional resources. Participants will be
      assessed for psychological distress and QOL levels at baseline and two weeks after the
      intervention.
