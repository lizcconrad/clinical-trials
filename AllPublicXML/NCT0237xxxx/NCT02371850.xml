  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, Open-label, Non-Randomized, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence Study to
      compare nicotine release after heating of a brand name (Nicoderm CQ) and generic (Aveva skin
      patch) nicotine skin patches in adult smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved nicotine
      transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more nicotine being absorbed
      through the skin than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known
      about how the release of nicotine is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that
      are also available over the counter. This study will use nicotine patches (brand name and
      generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are
      already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any
      placebos.

    <description>This is a single group assignment where each of 10 adult smokers completes 4 procedure days using a Nicoderm CQ nicotine patch (2 days) followed by the application of a generic Aveva patch (2 days). For each patch, heating is applied for one hour at hour 4 on the first procedure day and at hour 8 in the second procedure day (2 days per patch, or a total of 4 days per subject).</description>
