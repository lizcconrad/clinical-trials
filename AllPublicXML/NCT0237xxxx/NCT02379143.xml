  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various national &amp; international bodies like FDA, CSP has laid down the guidelines for the
      reasonable use of SWD electro therapeutic agent (EPA) ensuring safety &amp; effectiveness.

      However, it remains uncertain, whether the practicing physiotherapists are aware of the very
      existence of this guidelines and implementing them in daily practice. Any lack of knowledge
      about this background can endanger the patient safety leading to serious health hazards.

      In the present survey, 49 physiotherapy practitioners were interviewed with a self-report
      measure to investigate their knowledge base, mode of application of SWD (6 items) &amp; the
      awareness about recommended guidelines (5 items) etc.

      Study design: cross sectional survey design with the use of a self-report form to record the
      participant's views was used. Sampling frame consisted of physiotherapists working in private
      clinics in sub-urban area of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

      Institutional ethic committee of Terna Physiotherapy College granted permission to conduct
      this survey. The self-report forms were coded in order to conceal the identity of the
      therapist.

      In this survey 49 physiotherapists were interviewed with a self-report form consisting of
      total 23 item. In the initial section of this survey form a general information was collected
      regarding years of experience (1 item), Types of condition treated (1 item), No of patients
      treated (item 1) Duration of onset (item 1) &amp; the type of modality used (item 1). Specific
      items interrogating therapist's knowledge about the EMF generating modality were designed to
      retrieve the information about dosage prescription (7 item), acquaintance with recommended
      guidelines &amp; indications (item 5), years of experience with that particular modality (item1),
      Any kind of side effects observed (item 1), any action taken for the same (item 2), referring
      personnel for recommending this modality (item 1), overall therapist's experience with the
      effectiveness of this modality (item1).
