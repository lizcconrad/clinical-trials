  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKR) is a well established treatment modality for brain tumors and
      functional disorders of the brain. It relies on mathematical algorithms to predict dose
      distribution and to calculate the dose at arbitrary points in the head. For the last 25
      years, doses applied using Gamma Knife Radiosurgery have been calculated using a simple
      algorithm, called the Tissue Maximum Ratio algorithm (TMR). Dose planning using this
      algorithm, relies on a number of approximations to enable fast isodose computation during
      treatment planning. One of the most significant of these is the approximation of the head to
      water-equivalent density. The increased electron density of brain and bone (relative to
      water) and the near-zero density of air cavities in the skull may make significant
      perturbations to isodose and beam-on time calculations.

      With the advent of faster workstations, the effect of tissue in-homogeneities can finally be
      calculated in reasonable time during the treatment planning process; a newer, more modern
      algorithm known as convolution algorithm is now commercially available. It uses the values of
      density indicated in the CT scan to predict the dose distribution and is expected to more
      accurately calculate radiation dose, although it needs further investigation before clinical
      implementation. Inter- and intra-indication differences between the old and new algorithms
      need to be understood before this method can be confidently employed in a clinical setting.
      It is the aim of this study to understand the dosimetric differences between these dose
      calculation algorithms and to evaluate the implications of using the convolution algorithm
      for GKR. A large number of treatments will be re-planned using the convolution algorithm and
      compared to the TMR plans used to treat the patients. Beam-on-time, which is proportional to
      dose and a number of commonly used metrics for the targets such as coverage, selectivity,
      gradient index, and mean and maximum dose, will be estimated with both algorithms. Subgroup
      analysis will be done to assess whether any factor such as diagnosis, size of the head or
      location of the target could impact on the relative difference between the methods. The
      treatment plans will be compared and the potential implications on treatment planning will be
      elucidated.

    <description>The convolution algorithm, which uses the correlation between CT imaging density in Hounsfield units (HU) and electron density (ρe) of the tissues as input to predict dose distribution, can provide a better simulation of real delivered dose for GKR. By more accurately predicting the dose delivered, a better prediction of clinical effects can be made, increasing the potential clinical efficacy of treatment.
Convolution algorithm is now available in Leksell GammaPlan® 10 but there is not enough clinical data to support its use over TMR 10, which is the current clinical standard. Using convolution algorithm to recalculate the dose for the otherwise unaltered TMR 10 plan will provide valuable insight and understanding of the dosimetric differences between these planning algorithms.</description>

        The population of the study is all adult patients receiving treatment at the Gamma Knife
        Centre at Queen Square Radiosurgery Centre (QSRC). The sample will consist of the first 100
        patients (200 observations) receiving Gamma Knife treatment in QSRC who accomplish all the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study. This study does
        not involve group allocation or randomization of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients receiving Gamma Knife treatment for any diagnosis in the Gamma Knife
             centre at QSRC.

          -  The subject consents to participate in the study and consent to have a stereotactic
             non contrast CT scan of the brain after GKR has finished.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to consent

          -  Younger than 18 years of age: Children are not eligible to give consent by themselves
             and at the moment only adults are being treated at the QSRC.

          -  Patient is not suitable for CT scan: There are no absolute clinical contraindications
             for CT scan. However, for the purpose of the study, pregnancy is considered an
             absolute contraindication. Claustrophobia or anxiety disorders are considered a
             relative contraindication; however, this is more likely to affect the subject ability
             to tolerate Gamma Knife treatment and MRI scanning, which would make the patient not
             eligible or the study.

          -  Co-morbidity or previous treatment in the patient is not to be considered as exclusion
             criteria.
