  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in kidney transplant recipients
      (KTR) is controversial. The investigators performed a comparative, parallel-group,
      randomized, open-label study to assess, in a real clinical setting, the feasibility of and
      benefit derived from systematic search and antimicrobial treatment of all episodes of AB.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing KT between January 2011 and December 2013 in a tertiary-care center
      with an active transplantation program were systematically searched for AB within the first 2
      years after transplantation on a regular basis. During the first 2 months after
      transplantation all episodes of AB were treated. Thereafter, patients were assigned,
      according to a computer-generated randomization sequence, to group A (systematic
      antimicrobial treatment of all episodes of AB) or group B (no treatment). Treatment was
      chosen according to the results of the urine culture.
