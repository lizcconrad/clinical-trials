  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons who struggle with depression smoke at high rates and experience low quit rates in
      treatment. The best way to improve cessation treatment for this underserved population
      remains unknown. The proposed trial tests whether the combination of varenicline and
      behavioral mood management treatment enhances long-term abstinence for depressed smokers and,
      if so, whether this treatment achieves its effects through addressing the unique
      psychological factors that appear to maintain tobacco dependence for these smokers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 43% of persons with major depressive disorder (MDD) are daily smokers who are more
      likely to smoke heavily, show greater tobacco dependence, suffer more severe withdrawal, and
      experience lower quit rates than smokers without MDD. Little is known about treatment
      strategies that might optimize smoking cessation for smokers with MDD because almost all
      randomized clinical trials have excluded these smokers. This project answers many prominent
      but largely unanswered calls over the last decade to address tobacco dependence in persons
      with mental health disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD). Using a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design, the investigators will evaluate the
      efficacy of behavioral activation for smoking cessation (BASC) plus varenicline for treating
      tobacco dependence in smokers with current or recent (past two years) MDD. Five hundred and
      seventy-six daily (≥1 cigarettes/day) smokers will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of one
      of four treatments: 1) Standard behavioral cessation treatment (ST) + placebo; 2) Behavioral
      activation integrated with ST (BASC) + placebo; 3) ST + varenicline; or 4) BASC +
      varenicline. Both BASC and ST will be administered in eight 45 minute sessions, occurring
      weekly for the first four weeks and biweekly for the final eight weeks. Randomization will be
      stratified on clinical site (Northwestern, University of Pennsylvania), gender, and severity
      of depressive symptoms (minimal/mild vs. moderate/severe). The primary outcomes will be
      carbon monoxide (CO) verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24-weeks post-quit.
      Additional aims include assessing adverse event rates between varenicline and placebo arms,
      and testing for mediation of treatment effects by anhedonia, cognitive function (attention
      and memory), cigarette reward value, and craving and withdrawal. This randomized controlled
      trial will be the first adequately powered trial of BASC in this population; the first trial
      to evaluate varenicline among a community sample of smokers with MDD; and the first trial to
      assess the main and combined effects of these two treatments.

    <description>The goal of behavioral activation therapy is to increase engagement in rewarding activities, a problem for smokers with depression who find smoking especially rewarding and prefer it over many other traditionally rewarding activities, by reducing patterns of behavioral avoidance, withdrawal, and inactivity. In this study, behavioral activation will be integrated with standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment.
Treatment will be delivered in eight 45-minute sessions over 12 weeks occurring weekly for the first four sessions and biweekly for the final four sessions.</description>

    <description>Standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment is an effective treatment for nicotine dependence. Treatment focuses on self-monitoring of smoking behavior, identifying smoking triggers and alternative trigger management strategies, relaxation, social support for non-smoking, and relapse prevention. Treatment will be delivered in eight 45-minute sessions over 12 weeks occurring weekly for the first four sessions and biweekly for the final four sessions.</description>
