  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the aging population who will be affected by wet AMD and lack of effective GA
      treatment, it is crucial to assess the safety profile of repeated ranibizumab injections in
      AMD patients with GA, particularly the possible risk of GA development and enlargement. This
      potential adverse effect has significant implication in the discussions with patients
      regarding the risks and benefits of AMD treatment and injection frequency. While monthly
      injections provide slight improvement of visual acuity at 2 years (Martin et al., 2012), the
      risk of GA enlargement may offset this benefit in visual acuity.

      Previous studies assessed the association between intravitreal ranibizumab injections and de
      novo GA development in injection-naïve eyes (Martin et al, 2012, Querques et al., 2012.,
      Grunwald et al., 2014), rather than GA enlargement in patients with preexisting GA. To the
      best of the investigators knowledge, there has been no prospective study assessing the
      association between intravitreal ranibizumab injections and rate of GA progression in
      patients with pre-existing GA. There is also no prospective study comparing the morphological
      features of GA between patients who are receiving intravitreal injections and those who are
      not, nor the concordance of GA enlargement rate between the 2 eyes among patients receiving
      and not receiving treatment.

          -  Age &gt; 50 years old

          -  Patients with pre-existing GA secondary to AMD NOT requiring intravitreal injections
             (i.e. Dry AMD)
