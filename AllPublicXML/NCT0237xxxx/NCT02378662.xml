      The objectives of this study are to assess safety and to evaluate the biologic activity of
      TARGTEPO treatment in Peritoneal Dialysis patients

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study. Each patient will receive targeted dose of EPO
      delivered via TARGTEPO.

      The targeted doses will be determined according to 2 cohorts as follows: Group A (18-25
      IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day). The objective is to evaluate safety and biologic
      activity of TARGTEPO treatment when maintaining Hb levels within the target range of 9-12
      g/dl. Biological activity assessments will include duration of TARGTEPO secretion as measured
      by serum EPO levels above baseline.

             dialysis treatment for at least 6 months. Average Hb during last month between 9 to
             12g/dL.

          2. Kt/V &gt;1.

             receive ASA treatment between 100mg/d and 325 mg/d who cannot discontinue it for 1
             week prior to each Harvest or Implantation procedure

          4. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV).

          5. Grand mal seizures within 2 years of the screening visit.
