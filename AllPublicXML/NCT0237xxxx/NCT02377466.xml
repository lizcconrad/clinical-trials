  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of retosiban to prolong
      pregnancy and improve neonatal outcomes compared with placebo. It is a Phase III, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study and will be conducted in approximately 900
      females, aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact membranes
      in preterm labor between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks of gestation. Eligible maternal subjects
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either retosiban IV infusion or placebo
      IV infusion over 48 hours. If not previously administered, antenatal corticosteroid treatment
      should be administered as either (1) two 12-mg doses of betamethasone given intramuscularly
      24 hours apart or (2) four 6-mg doses of betamethasone administered intramuscularly every 12
      hours. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids is permitted if the antecedent
      treatment was at least 7 days prior to study enrolment. Investigators have discretion to use
      a standardized regimen of magnesium sulphate, as well as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis
      for perinatal group B streptococcal infection. Prior to randomization, each subject will be
      stratified by progesterone treatment and gestational age. The progesterone strata will
      consist of subjects on established progesterone therapy or subjects not on established
      progesterone therapy at Screening. The study will comprise 6 phases: Screening, Inpatient
      Randomized Treatment, Post Infusion Assessment, Delivery, Maternal Post-Delivery Assessment,
      and Neonatal Medical Review. The duration of any subject's (maternal or neonatal)
      participation in the study will be variable and dependent on gestational ages (GA) at study
      entry and the date of delivery.

             either in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination, (2) last menstrual period
             confirmed by the earliest ultrasound prior to 24 weeks gestation, or (3) the earliest
             ultrasound alone prior to 24 weeks gestation, whichever is the most accurate method
             available for each subject. In situations where prenatal ultrasound records are not
             available at the time the subject presents, the investigator will make every effort to
             obtain these records (either via computer records, directly from the subject's primary
             care obstetrician, or via telephone). However, in cases in which these records are not
             readily available (e.g., off hours, holiday), it is within the investigator's
             discretion to use GA based on a verbal history from the subject with the intent of
             getting confirmation from the medical records as soon as possible.

          -  Females must be diagnosed with preterm labor according to both of the following
             criteria: a) Regular uterine contractions at a rate of &gt;=4 contractions of at least 30
             seconds' duration during a 30-minute interval confirmed by tocodynamometry and at
             least 1 of the following, b) Cervical dilation &gt;=2 centimeter (cm) and &lt;=4 cm by
             digital cervical examination or c) If &lt;2 cm dilation by digital cervical examination,
             a cervical change consisting of an increase of at least 25% effacement or 1-cm
             dilation.

          -  Current or past tocolytic treatment as follows: a) Subjects in whom tocolytic
             treatment has not been initiated prior to consent are eligible for the study, b)
             Transferred or referred subjects for whom parenteral magnesium sulfate treatment has
             been started before Screening are eligible provided they meet all eligibility
             criteria, c) Subjects receiving a prohibited tocolytic in this study are eligible only
             if the treatment is stopped before randomization and provided they meet all
             eligibility criteria, d) Subjects with a historical failure of a tocolytic treatment
             in a previous episode of preterm labor during the current pregnancy are eligible
             provided they meet all eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fever with a temperature &gt;100.4 degree Fahrenheit (38 degree centigrade) for more than
             1 hour or &gt;=101 degree Fahrenheit (38.3 degree centigrade) in the 24 hours prior to
             the start of study treatment.

          -  Women with maternal-fetal conditions that potentially necessitate the need for
             delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or fetal compromise.

          -  A fetus with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that in the opinion
             of the investigator has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy or
             safety (for example: nonreassuring fetal status, intrauterine growth restriction,
             major congenital anomaly).

          -  Preterm premature rupture of membranes.

          -  Women with any confirmed or suspected contraindication to prolongation of pregnancy,
             such as placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, or placenta previa.

          -  Evidence of polyhydramnios (AFI &gt;25 cm) or oligohydramnios (AFI &lt;5 cm).

          -  Women with co-morbid medical or obstetric conditions that in the opinion of the
             investigator have the potential to complicate the pregnancy course and outcomes, such
             as uncontrolled hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes (if known, history of
             glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;8% at any time during pregnancy), or compromise the safety of
             the subject, such as underlying cardiovascular disorder (specifically ischemic cardiac
             disease, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease,
             arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy).

          -  Women with a history of substance abuse during the pregnancy or urine drug screen
             positive for cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), methamphetamine, or amphetamine.

          -  Women in whom the combination of history and screening test results is suggestive of
             abuse or dependency that may have the potential to complicate the pregnancy outcome.

          -  Women with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy
             or safety.

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator
             assessment).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products (IPs) or components
             thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or GlaxoSmithKline/ Pharmaceutical Product Development (GSK/PPD) medical monitor,
             contraindicates the subject's participation.
