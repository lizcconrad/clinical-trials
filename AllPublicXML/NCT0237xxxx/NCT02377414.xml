  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in healthy, adult Japanese women will characterize the PK, safety and tolerability
      of retosiban at the therapeutic doses planned to be evaluated in Phase 3. The PK data will be
      compared to a sub-set of Caucasian women given the same dose of retosiban. This study has two
      cohorts, cohort 1 will be a double-blind sponsor-open (subjects and investigator blinded and
      sponsor unblinded), randomized, continuous 48 hours (h) infusion study in healthy, adult
      Japanese women of child-bearing potential. Cohort 2 is an open label and continuous retosiban
      48 h infusion study in Caucasian, adult, healthy women of child bearing potential. So, the PK
      can be compared with those of Japanese women. Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled. In
      cohort 1, approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to retosiban and placebo
      (2:1 ratio) to have 18 women with 12 active, 6 placebo completed subjects. In Cohort 2, 8
      subjects will be enrolled to have 6 competed subjects. The total duration of a subject's
      involvement in this part is anticipated to be up to 6 weeks (including the 28 day screening
      period).

             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the medical monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within 56 days.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
