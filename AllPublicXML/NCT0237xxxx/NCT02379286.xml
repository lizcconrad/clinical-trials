      The research extends existing research conducted by Cristel A. Russell to assess the
      relationships between French teenagers' attitudes and beliefs towards alcohol and tobacco
      products and the degree to which they watch and relate to television series and music videos.
      We test whether the consumption of media (TV series and music video) are related to French
      youth's perceptions of the consequences related to the use of alcohol and/or tobacco and
      ultimately their intentions and behaviors. To do so, an online questionnaire will be passed.
      Teenagers will be recruited through a private research firm, Cint. Because the study focuses
      on teenagers (14-17 y.o), parental consent to participate to the study will be obtained prior
      to the teenager's one.
