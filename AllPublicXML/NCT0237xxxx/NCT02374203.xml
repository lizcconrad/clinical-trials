      The investigators first aim is to compare the EE and BEE in critically ill patients in
      Taiwan. The second aim of this study is to examine protein requirements in different age
      groups in critically ill patients, and their relationship to factors causing inadequate
      enteral nutrition, duration of mechanical ventilation, newly diagnosed infection and duration
      of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

      Background: Presently, the Harris-Benedict equation (BEE) multiplied by the stress factor and
      activity factor is used to calculate the total calorie needs of critically ill patients.
      Clinically however, there are variations in the definitions for stress and activity factors
      which could lead to errors in calculated results. The Indirect Calorimetry (IC) measurement
      is the gold standard to measure the critically ill patient's actual energy needs, since the
      relationship of measured energy expenditure (EE) and estimated basal EE (BEE) according to
      different age groups are taken into account. It is recommended that enteral nutrition be
      initiated within the first 24 to 48 hours of ICU admission. A high protein hypo-caloric (15
      kcal/kg; 1.7 g / kg protein) diet can reduce the risk of multi-organ failure and
      hyperglycemia.

      Aim: The investigators first aim is to compare the EE and BEE in critically ill patients in
      Taiwan. The second aim of this study is to examine protein requirements in different age
      groups in critically ill patients, and their relationship to factors causing inadequate
      enteral nutrition, duration of mechanical ventilation, newly diagnosed infection and duration
      of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

      Method: Critically ill patients, 20 years or older, who are mechanically ventilated and on
      nasogastric tube feeding will be selected. Exclusion criteria are the use of total parenteral
      nutrition, APACHE Π score &lt;15, ventilator duration &lt;48 hours, fasting &gt;5 days, brain death,
      terminal cancer and those on pacemaker. After evaluation of nutrition and calorie
      requirements using IC measurement and H-B formula calculation, patients will be 1:1
      randomized to the following two tube feeding regimens: 1. Original formula: supply energy
      according to the original feeding formula and high protein formula. The calories will be
      first be increased to reach the required energy needs (HB*1.0~1.3) then the amount of protein
      will be gradually increased to the reach the target value. 2. Adjusted formula: supply
      adequate protein intake initially (&gt;1.5 gm/kg BW; renal and liver failure: 0.8 ~ 1 gm/kg
      IBW); then gradually increase the calorie intake till the target is achieved. Data
      collection: 7 days feeding volume, gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, constipation,
      vomiting, abdominal distension, gastric residual volume, etc.), reasons for discontinuing
      enteral feeding (GI bleeding, investigations), duration of discontinued enteral feeding,
      diagnosis, other comorbidity, underlying disease, APACHE Π score, anthropometry, the type and
      daily amount of intravenous nutrition (calculated calories and protein), biochemistry, number
      of days on ventilator, newly diagnosed infection (ventilator associated pneumonia, urinary
      tract infection or bacteremia) duration of ICU stay, mortality, etc.
