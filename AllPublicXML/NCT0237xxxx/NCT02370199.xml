      This study evaluates 670 nm energy in the form of red light to stimulate blood flow changes
      in healthy adults. All participants will receive red light to their leg. They will also
      receive a continuous infusion of Definity (octafluoropropane) ultrasound contrast.

      670 nm energy in the form of red light dilates isolated blood vessels. This study seeks to
      measure vessel dilation in human subjects exposed to this energy at different irradiance
      intensities (25 milliwatts (mW)/cm2 and 75 mW/cm2). The intent of this protocol is to measure
      blood flow in the gastrocnemius muscle before and after exposure to 670 nm light energy. This
      protocol will be performed in healthy subjects, who do not meet exclusion criteria. The study
      consists of one visit. Blood flow measurement will be performed using contrast enhanced
      ultrasound, a method by which ultrasound contrast is continuously infused into the blood
      stream. Ultrasound records images in the area of interest and flow is related to the
      intensity of the contrast in each image. After baseline blood flow images are collected, the
      subject will receive red light energy to the gastrocnemius muscle with concurrent blood flow
      measurements with contrast ultrasound. The subject will be monitored post procedure and the
      study will then be completed.

    <description>Subjects will have baseline blood flow measured in the gastrocnemius using octafluoropropane infusion and ultrasound.After baseline flow measurements are obtained, a 670 nm light emitting diode will be placed 1 cm above the gastrocnemius muscle. The diode will not be in direct contact with the skin. Subjects will be exposed to 75 mW/cm2. Contrast images will be obtained up to 5 minutes after the commencement of light.</description>
