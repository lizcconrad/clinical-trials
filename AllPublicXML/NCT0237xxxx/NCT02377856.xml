  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection usually become chronicity if viremia
      persists after 6 months of infection. The result of using pegylated interferon plus ribavirin
      combination therapy upon these patients remains to be explored

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin has greatly improved the
      treatment efficacy and is the mainstream of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection.
      Current guideline suggests pegylated interferon monotherapy for patients with acute HCV
      infection. The efficacy might greatly improves if the treatment starts earlier. An estimation
      of 20 percents of patients could recover from acute infection spontaneously within 6 months
      after exposure,however. The present study aims to clarify the efficacy of pegylated
      interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for patients with hepatitis C six months after
      onset of acute infection

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18-80 years of age

          -  Patients have never been treated with traditional interferon plus ribavirin or
             peginterferon plus ribavirin

          -  Serologic evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection by an anti-HCV antibody test

          -  Detectable serum HCV-RNA for &gt; 6 months

          -  Compensated liver disease

          -  Negative urine or blood pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  All fertile males and females receiving ribavirin must be using two forms of effective
             contraception during treatment and during the 6 months after treatment end

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with ongoing pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Present therapy with any systemic anti-neoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment
             (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) within 6 months prior to
             the first dose of study drug

          -  Any investigational drug 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug
