  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to find out if the tibial and patellar components of the Stryker Triathlon
      Tritanium primary total knee replacement achieve adequate fixation to the underlying bone.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Primary Hypothesis:

      The investigators expect the tibial and patellar components of the Stryker Triathlon
      Tritanium knee to achieve adequate fixation to the underlying bone.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      The investigators expect that there will be no continuous migration between one and two years
      post-operative in the Triathlon Tritanium components.

      The investigators expect to see a correlation between radiolucent lines and migration
      characteristics using RSA.

      The investigators expect that inducible displacement exams taken at 2 years post-operative
      will be able to distinguish between patients identified by RSA measurements as having
      inadequate fixation.

      The investigators expect to see a significant difference in health status and functional
      outcomes before and after total knee replacement using the Triathlon Tritanium knee.
