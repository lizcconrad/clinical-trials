  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and
      fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for participants
      with tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.

      As of 20-March-2016, enrollment will be limited to PD-L1 positive participants.
