      A total of 53 patients will be enrolled in the safety run-in and expansion phases:

        -  Safety run-in phase - patients with EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm+), locally advanced or
           metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have progressed on previous EGFT TKI
           treatment.In the safety run-in phase of the study, the sample size may vary, depending
           on the number of dose levels evaluated and the number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)
           observed in each cohort.

        -  Expansion phase - patients who are EGFRm+ and cMet-positive with locally advanced or
           metastatic NSCLC, who have progressed on previous EGFR-TKI treatment.
