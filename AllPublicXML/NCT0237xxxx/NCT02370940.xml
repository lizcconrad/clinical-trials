      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether regular consumption of phytate dampens
      its negative effect on nonheme iron absorption.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phytate is one of the main inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption. High phytate consumption is
      of concern in developing countries because of the high prevalence of iron and zinc deficiency
      in these countries. In this study, we investigated the effect of habitual consumption of a
      high phytate diet on the inhibitory effect of phytate on nonheme iron absorption. Thirty-two
      non-anemic female subjects with ferritin ≤ 30µg/L were randomized into two groups, after
      matching for ferritin concentration. Each group consumed either high or low phytate foods
      that were provided for 8 wk. Iron bioavailability from a high phytate test meal was measured
      using area under the curve (AUC) for serum iron at baseline and after the intervention.

    <description>The high phytate diet group was required to consume a high phytate diet for 8 weeks. The high phytate foods were provided for subjects. They received whole grain ready-to-eat cereals, whole wheat pasta/spaghetti, tortillas, bagels, bread and dinner rolls, corn tortillas, brown rice, canned black beans, edamame and tofu, and were encouraged to consume generous amounts of nuts and other legume products high in phytate.</description>

    <description>The low phytate diet group was required to consume a low phytate diet for 8 weeks. They received foods similar to those for the high phytate diet group but which were made from refined wheat and white rice, eggs and cheese, and were instructed to avoid high phytate foods.</description>
