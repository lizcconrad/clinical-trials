      Following the first study conducted to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and
      its components in Turkey, it was aimed to demonstrate the change in general health condition
      of available patients after the period of time lapsed. This study will provide important
      information on the social and economic dimensions of metabolic syndrome and will contribute
      to development of preventive programs.

    <textblock>
      In the first METSAR-I study conducted in 2003, metabolic syndrome screening was made by two
      different team. Participants were visited at their addresses and informed about the research
      study and gave written consent. They were invited on an empty stomach for hospital visit on
      the day after. Pre-trained nurses completed the forms of patients during that second visit.
      After 11 years, a questionnaire by telephone survey will be applied to patients who
      participated in the METSAR-II study. The main goal is to determine the changes of metabolic
      syndrome population during that period.

        The previous study included 4.264 patients from 47 cities and we are going to try to get in
        contact all those patients. Data obtained from available patients will be analysed and the
