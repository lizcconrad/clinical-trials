  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment is the only approach with potentially defined clinical success for organic
      mitral valve (MV) regurgitation. Recurrent or persistent complaints after initial successful
      MV repair is a clinical challenge in current practice. Especially when echo parameters at
      rest are within or near normal ranges and patients presenting disproportionately symptomatic
      in relation to the observed results. However, while MV regurgitation is a hemodynamic
      disease, currently used 2-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at rest lacks
      information about hemodynamic changes. Physical stress echocardiography is a promising
      technique to complement nowadays rest TTE in order to improve interpretation of hemodynamic
      changes. However, normal values for exercise echo are lacking in this postoperative patients
      cohort. A prospective, observational trial to determine normal values in stress
      echocardiographic parameters in asymptomatic patients after successful MV repair for organic
      MV regurgitation, is therefore highly needed.

      Purpose of the SEP- study is to determine normal values in stress echocardiographic
      parameters in asymptomatic patients at least 6 months after successful MV repair for organic
      MV regurgitation. These normal values for stress echo are of utmost importance to correctly
      and accurate interpret stress echo results during postoperative follow-up and to improve
      clinical decision making in patients post MV repair.
