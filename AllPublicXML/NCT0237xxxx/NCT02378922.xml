      This clinical trial studies gene-modified, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-protected stem
      cell transplant in treating patients with HIV-associated lymphoma. Stem cells, or cells which
      help form blood, are collected from the patient and stored. They are treated in the
      laboratory to help protect the immune system from HIV. Chemotherapy is given before
      transplant to kill lymphoma cells and to make room for new stem cells to grow. Patients then
      receive the stem cells that were collected from them before chemotherapy and have been
      genetically modified to replace the stem cells killed by the chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of infusing gene-modified, HIV-protected
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) after high-dose chemotherapy for treatment of
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma.

      II. To observe the change in gene-modified cell levels before and after antiviral treatment
      interruption.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      II. To describe time to disease progression, progression-free survival, treatment-related
      mortality, time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, and incidence of infections.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of procedure on HIV-specific immune reconstitution.

      II. To observe the effect of HIV infection on the presence of gene-marked cells as determined
      by deoxyribonucleic (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients undergo high-dose chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy according to
      institutional guidelines.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant with LVsh5/C46
      (Cal-1) transduced autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) on day 0.

      Note: Patients continue to receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) throughout
      treatment, with a 7-day break for apheresis. Patients may be eligible for a structured
      treatment interruption of up to 12 weeks after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      with gene-modified cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 15 years post-HCT.
