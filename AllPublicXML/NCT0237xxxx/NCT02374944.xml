  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized control trial comparing hardware retention
      (HR) to removal of hardware (RH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: Hardware removal at 6
      months or Hardware retention for a minimum of 2 years.

      Consenting patients having previously undergone open reduction and internal fixation of
      Lisfranc injuries with an anatomic reconstruction within 6‚Äê8 weeks will be randomized to one
      of two treatment arms: removal hardware (RH) or hardware retention (HR).

      Outcome will be assessed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years from enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has Lisfranc injury that was treated within 28 days of injury.

          -  Subject must be enrolled in study between 6 and 8 weeks from time of initial fixation
             operation.

          -  The patient must be medically fit for anesthesia

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent for trial
             participation

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the study protocol including return for all

          -  Subject may have a bony, ligamentous, or combined lisfranc injury

          -  Demonstrated instability of the lisfranc complex on static, stress view or CT
             radiography.

          -  Associated injuries - other than the lisfranc complex ‚Äê are permitted provided those
             injuries are not deemed to significantly influence the rehabilitation or recovery of
             the patient at the discretion of the enrolling surgeon

          -  Adequate reduction to within 1mm of lisfranc complex at time of fixation

          -  Hardware across the midfoot (tarsal‚Äêmetatarsal joints 1‚Äê3)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a significant pre‚Äêexisting foot injury

          -  Subject has a delay in initial treatment greater than 28 days from time of injury

          -  Subject has an active infection in the area of surgical approach requiring surgical
             debridement

          -  Subject has concomitant injury which, in the opinion of the attending surgeon, is
             likely to impair rehabilitation or prolong fracture healing time (another long bone
             fracture, ipsilateral limb injury)

          -  Subject has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, Diabetes, fibrous dysplasia, chronic
             renal failure, Paget's disease, or osteopetrosis or any other pre‚Äêexisting pathologic
             condition affecting the Lisfranc complex

          -  Subject has a high risk of death from surgery (ASA physical status Class V)

          -  Subject is likely unable to maintain follow‚Äêup(no fixed address, plans to move out of
             town in the next year, states unable to comply with protocol, etc.)

          -  Subject has cognitive impairment or language difficulties that would impede the valid
             completion of questionnaires

          -  Subject is pregnant

          -  There has been loss of fixation or reduction prior to enrollment

          -  Previous corrective foot surgery

          -  Associated fracture of calcaneus, talus, or tibial plafond.

          -  Pathologic fracture

          -  Loss of fixation or reduction prior to enrollment
