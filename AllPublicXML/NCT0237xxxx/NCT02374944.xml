  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter prospective randomized control trial comparing hardware retention
      (HR) to removal of hardware (RH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: Hardware removal at 6
      months or Hardware retention for a minimum of 2 years.

      Consenting patients having previously undergone open reduction and internal fixation of
      Lisfranc injuries with an anatomic reconstruction within 6‐8 weeks will be randomized to one
      of two treatment arms: removal hardware (RH) or hardware retention (HR).

      Outcome will be assessed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years from enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has Lisfranc injury that was treated within 28 days of injury.

          -  Subject must be enrolled in study between 6 and 8 weeks from time of initial fixation
             operation.

          -  The patient must be medically fit for anesthesia

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent for trial
             participation

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the study protocol including return for all

          -  Subject may have a bony, ligamentous, or combined lisfranc injury

          -  Demonstrated instability of the lisfranc complex on static, stress view or CT
             radiography.

          -  Associated injuries - other than the lisfranc complex ‐ are permitted provided those
             injuries are not deemed to significantly influence the rehabilitation or recovery of
             the patient at the discretion of the enrolling surgeon

          -  Adequate reduction to within 1mm of lisfranc complex at time of fixation

          -  Hardware across the midfoot (tarsal‐metatarsal joints 1‐3)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a significant pre‐existing foot injury

          -  Subject has a delay in initial treatment greater than 28 days from time of injury

          -  Subject has an active infection in the area of surgical approach requiring surgical
             debridement

          -  Subject has concomitant injury which, in the opinion of the attending surgeon, is
             likely to impair rehabilitation or prolong fracture healing time (another long bone
             fracture, ipsilateral limb injury)

          -  Subject has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, Diabetes, fibrous dysplasia, chronic
             renal failure, Paget's disease, or osteopetrosis or any other pre‐existing pathologic
             condition affecting the Lisfranc complex

          -  Subject has a high risk of death from surgery (ASA physical status Class V)

          -  Subject is likely unable to maintain follow‐up(no fixed address, plans to move out of
             town in the next year, states unable to comply with protocol, etc.)

          -  Subject has cognitive impairment or language difficulties that would impede the valid
             completion of questionnaires

          -  Subject is pregnant

          -  There has been loss of fixation or reduction prior to enrollment

          -  Previous corrective foot surgery

          -  Associated fracture of calcaneus, talus, or tibial plafond.

          -  Pathologic fracture

          -  Loss of fixation or reduction prior to enrollment
