  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CART Pilot study was designed to provide preliminary observations (about performance and
      safety) and generate hypotheses for future studies . The primary goal of the study is to
      evaluate the performance at one year of second-generation ABSORB Bioresorbable Vascular
      Scaffold (BVS)(Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA , USA), the Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable
      Vascular Scaffold, in heart transplant recipients affected by cardiac allograft vasculopathy
      (CAV) and significative coronary stenosis.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to collect data about the procedural and clinical outcomes post-procedure , 30 days, 180
           days and at 1,2 and 3-year follow-up, of patients who underwent ABSORB BVS implantation
           in order to investigate the safety of the device in CAV population;

        -  to evaluate the progression of the disease and the its interactions with the study
           device by using data derived from multi-imaging invasive techniques.

      The vascular reparative therapy and in particular the BVS technology showing important
      advantages in terms of endothelial preservation, adequate vasomotion, and restoration of the
      media and adventitia of the vessel wall, could represent a new and more effective therapeutic
      option, compared to bare-metal and drug-eluting stent technologies, for transplanted
      patients, since all these mechanisms may, at least in part, counteract the detrimental
      changes leading to CAV, namely constrictive remodeling and rapid atherosclerosis progression.

      Subjects enrolled into the clinical study will be male or female derived from the heart
      transplant recipients population of every participating center. The clinical study will
      enroll 30 subjects. Subjects, who underwent the yearly expected coronary angiography
      follow-up after heart transplant surgery, meeting the general and angiographic inclusion and
      exclusion criteria (eligibility will be assessed by Heart Team consensus) will be asked to
      sign an informed consent form. Subjects who do not meet inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      subject to the standard follow-up of heart transplant (HTx) recipients and will undergo to an
      invasive evaluation after 365 ± 28 days.

      The study comprises two distinct phases:

        -  the enrollment phase which starts with the recruitment of the first subject and it is
           planned to last one year;

        -  the follow-up phase which is planned to last three years from the enrollment of the last
           patient.

      The total duration of the study will be of four years, including both the enrollment and the
      follow-up phases

        not

        Limited to the following:

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent
             Form

          -  Patient must be eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

          -  Patient is to be treated for de novo lesions located in previously untreated vessels.
