  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that does not change routine care.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the role of
      antibiogramme-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S. aureus strains and prescribed
      antibiotics) in the presence/absence of S. aureus strains at the end of a first regimen of
      antibiotics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives are:

      A. Should a first regimen of antibiotics fail, to describe the bacterial community present in
      the wound, and its potential to create biofilms.

      B. To investigate the role of antibiogramme-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S.
      aureus strains and prescribed antibiotics) in wound healing.

      C. To study the potential role of additional antibiofilmogramme data, as well as that of
      other pre-defined co-factors, in predicting wound changes.

      D. Create an S. aureus strain collection for future ancillary studies.

    <description>The study population is composed of diabetic patients with foot wounds (at least stage &gt;=2) that are infected by at least 1 strain of S. aureus. Patients whose antibiogrammes and Antibiofilmogrammes are concordant will fall into this group (the &quot;exposed&quot; group).
Upon inclusion, 1) all patients' wounds will be sampled, and 2) the associated bacterial strains identified via Vitek and 3) antibiograms performed; the latter are all part of routine procedure. 4) S. aureus isolates will be further analysed via an antiobiofilmogramme, which is an experimental element added by this research. At the end of the 1st regimen of antibiotics prescribed, if the treatment failed steps 1 to 4 can be repeated. 30 days after the end of the 1st regimen of antibiotics prescribed, steps 1 to 4 are systematically performed.</description>
