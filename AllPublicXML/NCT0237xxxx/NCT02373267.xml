      Screening of TMA patients for ADAMTS13 activity and the description of systemic organ damage

      This is a prospective diagnostic analysis enrolling 100 patients with clinically suspected
      thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) on the basis of laboratory findings such as
      thrombocytopenia, Coombs negative haemolytic anemia with increased LDH and increased
      schistozytes. As a first step of differential diagnosis, patients are classified by
      determining ADAMTS13 activity and antigen concentration and also analyzing for Shigatoxin and
      Shigatoxin producing bacteria respectively. Primary objective is to determine the relative
      incidences of the three major entities i.e. aHUS, STEC-HUS and TTP considering distribution
      of age and gender as well. Mean value of ADAMTS13 activity and antigen measured at date of
      first diagnosis is considered to line out a threshold value for ADAMTS13 activity pronouncing
      clinical apparent TMA. Furthermore the present study intends to characterize clinical
      presentation, clinical course and outcome of different TMA forms particularly with regard to
      treatment procedures. Monitoring of how ADAMTS13 activity and antigen changes in the course
      of the disease and in response to treatment is of particular concern for this study. Family
      history and special clinical conditions should be noted identifying potential genetic
      predisposition and definite clinical triggers leading to disease manifestation.
