  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will collect EEG data in normal, healthy volunteers without
      a history of prior brain injury. This data will be analyzed by computer (quantitative, or
      qEEG) and stored in a normative database so that, in the future, the investigators can better
      understand and characterize the brain damage that can result from carbon monoxide (CO)
      poisoning and other types of brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, prospective, non-comparative, non-invasive, minimal risk research study to
      obtain qEEG data on normal, healthy individuals to include in a normal control database for
      use in comparison with patients with CO poisoning and other types of brain injury. The use of
      anti-depressant medication use is relatively common in the general adult population. There is
      varying opinion whether anti-depressant medication alters an otherwise normal clinical EEG.
      We have included healthy individuals taking anti-depressant medication to determine if those
      medications influence the EEG. The EEG data will be collected, analyzed, and stored for use
      in future research studies and for clinical care. Evaluating patients with qEEG methodology
      may assist in diagnosis and treatment.

    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a relatively inexpensive measurement of basic brain activity. Traditional EEG techniques rely on the clinician to visually examine the electrical current waveforms to identify abnormal signal patterns and slowing. Abnormalities on EEG have been reported following CO poisoning, though the literature is scarce. While current EEG technologies record EEG signals digitally, rather than writing directly to paper, computer-assisted analysis of the data (quantitative EEG, or qEEG) has not been widely embraced, in part because clinicians are unsure what patterns revealed by computer-assisted analysis represent abnormal activity.</description>
