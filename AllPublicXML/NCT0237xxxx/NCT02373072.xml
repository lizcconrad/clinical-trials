    <textblock>
      This is a study with two sequential cohorts, each with three treatment periods. Single doses
      of PF-06649751 will be tested in this study, starting at a low dose and escalating to a dose
      projected to be under the current limits for drug concentration. Each cohort will aim to
      achieve approximately 9 completers. Primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, secondary
      endpoint is MDS-UPDRS part III.
