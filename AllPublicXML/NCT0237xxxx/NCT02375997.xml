  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic ESCC and gastric cancer patients
      experience a number of physical and psychosocial symptoms related to their cancer. Those
      patients endure the greatest level of distress from their disease relative to other cancer
      populations in China. Although new drugs have been applied in recent years, the median
      overall survival time of metastatic ESCC and GC patients are still around 12 months.
      Therefore, it is essential to maximize their quality of life (QOL) from the time of
      diagnosis. Multiple studies demonstrate that symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and anorexia are
      prevalent at diagnosis and worsen over time. As a result, suffering increases throughout the
      course of the illness. To be most effective, palliative care with intensive symptom
      management and psychosocial support should begin at the time of diagnosis, not once
      life-prolonging therapies have failed. And some studies have revealed that early palliative
      can even prolong the overall survival time in advanced lung cancer. The investigators then
      initiated a randomized phase III clinical trial with standard oncology care plus early
      palliative care or not in metastatic esophageal carcinoma and gastric cancer to observe
      whether the early palliative can improve the QOL and even prolong the overall survival time
      in those patients
