  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xeltis developed biodegradable patch prosthesis, the Vascular Patch Model COR-VP-001, to be
      used as a vascular patch to augment the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries. The
      prosthesis is immediately mechanically functional, while its physiochemical characteristics
      should enable cell infiltration and tissue formation.

      The Xeltis Vascular Graft Model COR-VP-001 is specifically designed to improve surgical
      outcomes by reducing synthetic material related complications and improving hemodynamic
      characteristics.

    <textblock>
      Xeltis has developed a medical device for treating pediatric cardiovascular patients
      requiring RVOT reconstruction. Xeltis' mission is to offer 'Solutions for a Lifetime' to
      cardiovascular patients. Xeltis has developed a unique technology based on novel
      biodegradable bio-materials allowing the regrowth of natural heart valves or blood vessels in
      patients' bodies from their own cells.

      The principle of Xeltis' COR technology (COR stands for Cardiovascular Organ Regeneration) is
      to implant a biodegradable prosthesis of a blood vessels that is shaped like the part to be
      replaced. The prosthesis is immediately mechanically functional, while its physiochemical
      characteristics should enable cell infiltration and tissue formation. Tissue is regenerated
      and functional by the time the polymer is biodegraded.
