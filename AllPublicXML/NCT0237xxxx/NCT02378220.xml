  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized into two groups, one receiving
      pharmacogenetic testing and the other not receiving pharmacogenetic testing. In this
      open-label trial, a pharmacist will make medication therapy recommendations using YouScript®
      Personalized Prescribing System for patients who receive genetic testing and standard drug
      information resources per usual for patients who do not undergo pharmacogenetic testing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups will be followed for 60 days. The number of re-hospitalizations and emergency
      department (ED) visits will be recorded as well as time to first re-hospitalization and time
      to first ED visit. Select OASIS metrics (e.g. M1034, M1242, M1710, M1720, M1745, M2110) and
      PHQ-2 will be evaluated and documented at time of admission to home health, at 30 days, and
      at 60 days for improvement in overall status, pain, confusion, anxiety, depression,
      disruptive behavior, and the need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The number of falls will be collected as
      well as the proportion of YouScript® recommendations accepted by study pharmacist and passed
      on to clinicians and the proportion of recommendations accepted by clinicians.
