  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this large multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical study
      is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cyclosporin A for primary Sjogren's syndrome
      associated pneumonitis(pSS-IP), which has important implications for the establishment of
      standardized diagnosis and treatment of pSS-IP.

    <description>A. The efficacy/safety are evaluated at V3, V4, V5 and V6, and the treatment is adjusted accordingly. Patients who experienced treatment failure (FVC absolute decrease &gt;15% of predicted values after 4 weeks of treatment) are suggested to switch to intravenous glucocorticoid + cyclophosphamide(CYC) 0.5-1 g/m2 every 4 weeks as the rescue therapy after unblinding, and continue to complete the subsequent follow-up. Each patient can only have one chance to be rescued. Patients who experience a second treatment failure should be withdrawn from the trial and be given empirical treatment. Patients who did not experience treatment failure continued to receive current treatment. B. For subjects with aggravated shortness of breath and dyspnea in between of two consecutive visits, the investigators should decide whether a visit should be increased to complete subsequent examinations.</description>

    <description>A. The efficacy/safety are evaluated at V3, V4, V5 and V6, and the treatment is adjusted accordingly. Patients who experienced treatment failure are suggested to switch to glucocorticoid + CsA 2-3mg/kg/d, BID as the rescue therapy, and continue to complete the subsequent follow-up. Each patient can only have one chance to be rescued. Patients who did not experience treatment failure continued to receive current treatment. B. For subjects with aggravated shortness of breath and dyspnea in between of two consecutive visits, the investigators in each center should decide whether a visit should be increased.</description>
