  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is nearly ubiquitous among individuals suffering from PTSD and is a major
      problem among service members returning from combat deployments. The proposed study aims to
      test a novel, inexpensive, and easy to use approach to improving sleep among service members
      with PTSD.

      Primary outcome measures will include not only PTSD symptom improvement but also include
      neuroimaging of brain structure, function, connectivity, and neurochemistry changes. The
      proposal is firmly grounded in the emerging scientific literature regarding sleep, light
      exposure, brain function, anxiety, and resilience. Prior evidence suggests that bright light
      therapy is effective for improving mood and fatigue, and our pilot data further suggest that
      this treatment may be effective for improving daytime sleepiness and brain functioning in
      brain injured individuals. Thus, this intervention, in our own research and in the work of
      others, has been shown to affect critical sleep regulatory systems. Improving sleep may be a
      vital component of recovery in these service members. Our approach would directly address
      this issue. Our preliminary data have shown that this approach is extremely well tolerated
      and is effective for improving sleep, mood, cognitive performance, and brain function among
      individuals with brain injuries.

      Finally, the potential impact of this study is high because of the capability of
      transitioning the research to direct clinical application almost immediately. If the bright
      light treatment is demonstrated as effective, this approach would be readily available for
      nearly immediate large-scale implementation, as the devices have been widely used for years
      in other contexts, are already safety tested, and commercially available from several
      manufacturers for a very low cost. Thus, the impact of this research on treating PTSD would
      be high and immediate.
