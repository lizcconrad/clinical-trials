    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of candidate dengue vaccine formulations, it is prudent to
      develop an appropriate challenge model. To this end, this first-in-human study will examine
      the safety and effectiveness of the Dengue 1 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) product
      and assess the ability of this virus strain to elicit an uncomplicated dengue-like illness.

             serum, L-glutamine, neomycin and streptomycin

         19. Planning to donate blood in the 1 year following inoculation with dengue

         20. Participation or planned participation in another vaccine, drug, medical device, or
             medical procedure clinical trial in the 4 weeks prior to this trial, during the trial,
