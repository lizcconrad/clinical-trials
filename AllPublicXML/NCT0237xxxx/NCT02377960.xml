    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pragmatic multi-centre, cluster randomized controlled trial is to test
      the effectiveness of tailored SMS-text message support combined with an
      information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model-based initiation of medication in
      helping outpatient care patients with hypertension to achieve blood pressure target and to
      enhance medication adherence.

      Background

      Usual blood pressure is strongly related to vascular and overall mortality and high blood
      pressure is globally the leading risk factor for cardiovascular and related diseases. It is
      also well established that pharmacologic blood pressure reduction prevents cardiovascular
      events and deaths in persons with hypertension.

      Today's physicians have plenty of knowledge and multiple effective and safety tools to treat
      hypertension but still majority of patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve
      the blood pressure target. Poor medication adherence has been widely accepted to be the most
      important factor in failing to control hypertension and even 50% of hypertensive patients
      quit the antihypertensive medication during the first year of medication.

      Numerous interventions to enhance medication adherence have been developed but even though,
      an intervention effective, simple and low cost enough to be carried out wide-scale in
      non-research settings is still to be found.

      Objectives

      To test whether a tailored SMS-text message support combined with an IMB model-based
      initiation of medication will increase the proportion of patients achieving the systolic
      blood pressure target at 12-month follow-up compared to usual care.

      Additional objectives include investigating whether the intervention have effect on

        -  Medication adherence

        -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure level

        -  Hypertension-related use of health care services

        -  Blood glucose, blood cholesterol, microalbuminuria, creatinine, ECG, body mass index,
           waist circumference exercising habits, smoking and alcohol use

        -  Perceived quality of life at base line and at 12-month follow-up

        -  Setting (physicians) and knowing (participants) an adequate BP target

      And, besides

      Detecting the participants who especially benefit from intervention

        -  Analyzing the quality and quantity of self-monitored BP and

        -  Assessing whether the IMB model-based structured initiation of medication can be used
           for screening of non-compliant patients and directing resources more accurately to them

        -  Collecting and analyzing participants' and physicians' feedback for future development
           of intervention

      Study design

      Pragmatic randomized controlled multicenter trial. The eight study centers are grouped to
      comparable pairs and randomized to function as intervention and control sites (2-cluster
      design).

    <measure>The proportion of patients achieving the systolic blood pressure target at 12-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients (%) achieving systolic office blood pressure (BP) target (&lt;140 mmHg) and home BP target (&lt;135 mmHg) are both analyzed separately using mixed effects model.
Both office BP and home BP are measured with a validated blood pressure monitoring device (Microlife Watch BP Home A or Microlife Watch BP Home N) after appropriate rest from the left arm with an appropriately sized semi-rigid conical cuff. Office BP is the mean of three measurements separated by 15 seconds. Home BP is measured correspondingly three times in the morning and in the evening on 7 consecutive days at 12 months. Home BP is the mean of all available measurements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measured medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence is assessed by pharmacy refill data and by self-report strategy (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, MMAS-8). Tresholds for good adherence are correspondingly (i) Medication possession ratio (MPR) 80 % or more and (ii) MMAS-8 with a score of 6 or more. Both are analyzed separately using generalized mixed effects model.
Besides, medication adherence is analyzed as follows:
Persistence: time (days) from the newly initiated medication order to (i) last dispensation before failing to refill within 180 days or (ii) end of follow-up period
Early non-persistence: newly initiated medication order dispensed within 30 days of the initial order with no refills within 180 days
Primary non-adherence: newly initiated medication order not dispensed within 30 days of the initial order</description>

Change in office BP and home BP are both analyzed separately using generalized mixed effects model. Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure are as well both analyzed separately using generalized mixed effects model.</description>

    <description>Knowing the target is assessed by questionnaire at baseline and at 12 months. The results are divided into three groups: (i) knows the adequate target (ii) knows the target but it is not adequate (iii) do not know the target.
The target is considered adequate if it differs less than 5/3 mmHg from the Finnish national guide lines for treating hypertension (Office BP target &lt;140/90 mmHg except diabetics &lt;140/80 mmHg. Home BP target &lt;135/85 mmHg except diabetics &lt;135/75 mmHg)</description>

    <description>Setting the target is assessed by examining the electric health record at 12 months The results are divided into three groups: (i) written target is set and adequate (ii) written target is set but not adequate and (iii) written target is not set.
The target is considered adequate if it differs less than 5/3 mmHg from the national guide lines for treating hypertension (Office BP target &lt;140/90 mmHg except diabetics &lt;140/80 mmHg. Home BP target &lt;135/85 mmHg except diabetics &lt;135/75 mmHg)</description>

    <measure>The quality and quantity of self-monitored blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The quality and quantity of self-monitored blood pressure measurements made prior to follow-up period is assessed first at base line. All participants are then equipped with a validated blood pressure monitoring device (Microlife Watch BP Home A or Microlife Watch BP Home N) with a memory space up to 250 measurements. The quality and quantity of self-monitored blood pressure measurements during the follow-up is assessed by examining the memory of every single device at and,the written follow-up form filled up by each participant at 12 months.
The target is considered adequate if it differs less than 5/3 mmHg from the national guide lines for treating hypertension (Office BP target &lt;140/90 mmHg except diabetics &lt;140/80 mmHg. Home BP target &lt;135/85 mmHg except diabetics &lt;135/75 mmHg)</description>
