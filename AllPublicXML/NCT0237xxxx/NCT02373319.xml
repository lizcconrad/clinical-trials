      The aims of this study are (1) to validate a self-screening method for cardiovascular (CV)
      risk that does not require the supervision of a health professional (including
      self-measurement of blood pressure, lipid profile evaluated by dry chemistry, and
      self-administered questionnaires on sex, age, diabetes, and tobacco consumption). (2) From
      these data, the investigators will generate personalized recommendations based on the best
      available evidence. The investigators will also analyze whether this innovative approach
      improves adherence to preventive recommendations for cardiovascular and other chronic
      diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary prevention activities based on some admittedly blunt screening instruments such as
      cardiovascular (CV) risk functions must be addressed to the whole population, prioritizing
      certain sectors of the population. However, the main limitation of current risk screening
      procedures is related to the natural history of cardiovascular disease, whose expression
      depends on the cumulative exposure to cardiovascular risk factors throughout a person's
      lifetime. Early prevention of cardiovascular disease is key to reduce this cumulative risk,
      thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events.

      The objectives of this study are (1) to validate a self-screening method for cardiovascular
      risk that does not require the supervision of a health professional (including
      self-measurement of blood pressure, lipid profile evaluated by dry chemistry, and
      self-administered questionnaires on sex, age, diabetes, and tobacco consumption). (2) From
      these data, the investigators will generate personalized recommendations based on the best
      available evidence. The investigators will also analyze whether this innovative approach
      improves adherence to preventive recommendations for cardiovascular and other chronic
      diseases.

      Cardiovascular risk measured with the self-screening method will be compared with the gold
      standard (cardiovascular risk supervised by health professional). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to the intervention (communication of cardiovascular risk and
      recommendation of personalized preventive actions) or control groups (communication of
      cardiovascular risk). Subjects will be reexamined one year after recruitment for assessing
      adherence to the preventive recommendations in terms of improvement in the control of
      cardiovascular risk factors.
