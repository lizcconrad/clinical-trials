  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia represents the loss of skeletal muscle and strength that occurs with aging. It is
      a major component of frailty and its effect on daily functioning, falls, and fractures has
      been well documented. Along with the population aging worldwide, the number of people with
      sarcopenia is expected to increase and, thus, contributing to dependency and the anticipated
      increase in health and social care costs. The cause of sarcopenia is multifactorial. Recent
      evidence suggests that some reversibility exists, highlighting the importance of intervention
      modalities. However, the role of nutritional supplementation and exercise programs, either
      individually or in combination, is still uncertain, and further randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) have been recommended by the International Sarcopenia Initiative. Therefore, the
      investigators plan to conduct a 24-month RCT to compare the effectiveness of 12-week exercise
      program alone, combined exercise program and nutrition supplement, and non-exercise control
      group on improving muscle mass, strength and power and physical performance in Chinese older
      people who have sarcopenia defined using the Asian Working Group Criteria (AWGC). The
      investigators hypothesize that compared with the non-exercise control group, there will be
      improvement in muscle strength, power and mass, and physical performance in the exercise
      alone group, and that there will be an additive effect with the combined exercise and
      nutrition supplement group. Chinese older people aged 65 years and over will be recruited for
      a brief screening of sarcopenia and cognitive status. Potential subjects will further
      undertake detailed body composition and biochemical measurements to check for their
      eligibility. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the three groups: exercise
      program alone, combined exercise program and nutrition supplement, or waitlist control group
      with the same exercise program offered after 24-week of study enrollment. Each group will
      have 45 subjects. Outcome measurements including muscle strength, power and mass, physical
      performance, instrumental activities of daily living and related biochemical measurements
      will be made at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>There will be 2 site sessions and 1 home session per week for 12 weeks. Each site exercise session will begin and end with a 5-10 minute warm-up and cool-down routine. The first part of the exercise program consists of 20-30 minute chair-based resistance exercises using Thera-Bands for muscle groups in both the upper and lower body. To target the development of muscle power in both the lower and upper extremities, participants will be instructed to perform each concentric movement 'as rapidly as possible,' and the eccentric movement in a slow and controlled manner. A 5-minute rest period will be given prior to the start of the second part of the exercise program that consists of aerobic exercises such as ball games using fitballs or Taichi. Participants will be asked to spend an hour/week on home exercise. Thera-Bands and a leaflet showing the exercise procedures will be given to them and their caregivers.</description>

    <description>This group will receive both the exercise program as well as the nutrition supplement. The components of the exercise program will be same as those of the exercise program alone group. Participants will also be asked to consume two sachets of Ensure NutriVigor every day during the 12-week intervention period. Ensure NutriVigor (one sachet of 54.1 g powder) contains 231 calories, 8.61 g protein, 1.21 g hydroxyl-methyl-butyrate (HMB), 130 IU vitamin D, and 0.29 g omega 3 fatty acid per serving. Participants will be instructed on how to prepare the supplement.</description>
