      A longitudinal study of function and participation in patients with stroke: An integrated
      brain imaging and biomechanical analysis

  <detailed_description>

      Brain damage may lead to various motor deficits, which further influence the function and
      participation. Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) is the common disorder for acquired brain
      damage. Neural network in patients with brain damage could also be used to determine their
      clinical behavior by identifying altered neural network associated with behavioral
      improvement. The investigators hypothesize that the level of brain image and biomechanical
      will change with time in patients with stroke. Under this hypothesis, the measures of
      biomechanical change are correlated with neural changes. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the function and participation in patients with stroke evaluated by clinical
      measures, biomechanical, psychological, physiological and multimodal brain image. The primary
      goal of this study is to establish, evaluate and follow-up biomechanical- and image-based
      biomarkers for the impairment of function and participation information processing present in
      patients with stroke.
