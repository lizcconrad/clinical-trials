        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female outpatients who are undergoing colonoscopy for a routinely accepted
        indication

        At least 18 years of age

        If female, and of child-bearing potential, is using an acceptable form of birth control
        (hormonal birth control, IUD, double-barrier method, depot contraceptive, abstinent, or
        vasectomized spouse).

        Negative urine pregnancy test at screening, if applicable

        In the Investigator's judgment, subject is mentally competent to provide informed consent
        to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with known or suspected ileus, severe ulcerative colitis, gastrointestinal
        obstruction, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon.

        Subjects who had previous significant gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. colostomy,
        colectomy, gastric bypass, stomach stapling).

        Subjects with uncontrolled pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypernatremia,
        hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, dehydration, or those secondary
        to the use of diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

        Subjects with a prior history of renal, liver or cardiac insufficiency.

        Subjects with impaired consciousness that predisposes them to pulmonary aspiration.

        Subjects undergoing colonoscopy for foreign body removal and/or decompression.

        Subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study.

        Subjects of childbearing potential who refuse a pregnancy test.

        Subjects allergic to any preparation components.

        Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not be included in the study for
        any reason, including inability to follow study procedures.

        Subjects who have participated in an investigational surgical, drug, or device study within
        the past 30 days.

        Subjects who withdraw consent before completion of Visit 1 procedures.
