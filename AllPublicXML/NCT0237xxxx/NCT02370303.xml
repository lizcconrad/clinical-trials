  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to isolate and measure circulating tumor cells in the blood
      stream to advance detection of cancer and treatment monitoring. In this study, the
      investigators will utilize the novel technology for circulating tumor cell detection in order
      to evaluate their presence in patients with lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to collect both blood and tumor samples from the patient's lung cancer in order
      to validate this technology in detecting circulating tumor cells. The investigators will also
      obtain a postoperative blood sample to see if there is a decrease in the overall circulating
      tumor cell measurement once the tumor has been surgically removed.
