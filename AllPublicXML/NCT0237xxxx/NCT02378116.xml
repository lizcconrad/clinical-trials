  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in heart surgery patients, our overall
      hypothesis is that systematic closing the left atrial appendage during surgery will reduce
      cerebral embolism coming from the thrombus formation in the left atrium.

      The specific hypothesis which sought tested is that closure of the left atrial appendage in
      connection with elective CABG and / or valve surgery will lead to fewer strokes and micro
      cerebral infarcts measured by MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are included prior to surgery. An MRI is performed at baseline. At the day of
      surgery, patients is randomized to closure/left open left atrial appendage.

      During surgery, a maximum of 15 ml blood and a right atrium biopsy are taken for further
      analyses. Additionally, a biopsy of the left atrium appendage is collected from the group of
      patients randomized for closure.

      The study group recommend a double closure. After discharge a second MRI is performed and the
      final MRI is performed after a minimum of six months.

      The final contact with the patient is done one year after surgery at the earliest. Where a
      clinical interview is done over the phone and the patients clinical records are screened for
      cerebral ischaemic events and atrial fibrillation.

      During the study period, some patients are elected for a bicycle stress test to test for
      levels of neurohormones, and some are elected for monitoring with Holter.

      There will also be performed transesophageal echocardiography on interested patients in order
      to test for the quality of surgical closure.

    <measure>Combined endpoint: Stroke and/or changes in number of micro cerebral infarcts identified with MRI at follow up compared to discharge from surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint is earliest one year after randomization. Follow-up is continued for the entire length of the study. The rationale for this is that this one intervention provides lifetime protection against ischaemic damage.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of increase of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) during exercise testing in open versus closed left atrial appendage. 20 Patients have been included and have finished the sub study as of Jan 2015</measure>
    <time_frame>Exercise test is scheduled three months after surgery. Blood samples are analyzed and levels of ANP are assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators want to test if the levels of NT-proANP (pro-hormone of atrial natriuretic peptide) will change during stress in patients with a closed left atrial appendage, compared to the control group. The test is performed on a ergometer-bicycle, with blood samples taken at baseline and after maximum exercise. The levels of neurohormones will then be analyzed.
The study is done in order to better map of the areas producing neurohormones in the heart.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Study of recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients with per-operative onset.</measure>
    <time_frame>Between three months and two years after surgery, the patients will be included for a 6-7 days monitoring of heart rhythm. Data last patient will have completed monitoring December 2015</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who develop atrial fibrillation after surgery, with no previous history of atrial fibrillation, and who are discharged in sinus rhythm, will be offered monitoring of heart rhythm with Holter monitor. Preferably for one week, in order to investigate, weather restoring sinus rhythm is permanent, or if debut of atrial fibrillation is onset of a new disease more than a symptom form surgery.</description>
