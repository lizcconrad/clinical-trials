    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure is a syndrome that renal function is decreased, and the patient number
      is increasing. In addition, patients on dialysis have also increased. Depending on the
      chronic renal failure aggravated, the deterioration of life caused by the conduct of dialysis
      patients is caused. In addition, a problem in dialysis treatment is ongoing economic burden
      surface to increase the life of the patient and family. A solution to this problem is, or
      stops the progression of chronic renal failure prior to dialysis, it is necessary to delay.
      As a treatment for inhibiting the progression of chronic renal failure is present, along with
      diet and blood pressure-lowering drugs or a drug therapy used by kremezin. However, the
      effect is not enough, new drug development is required.

      HD-003 is a novel compound, and found to inhibit the renal failure progression. It was found
      during the search active substance that appear when the inflammation in animals. The
      investigators confirmed that the substance is present in the urine of a person during the
      study, and later established a link between kidney disease hypotheses. When performing the
      test in animal model renal failure, chronic renal Through the non-clinical testing of the
      HD-003(general toxicity studies, reproductive, developmental toxicity test, mutagenicity test
      and antigen tests) showed that a very low toxicity. When going through the review of the
      safety and pharmacokinetic Phase 1 clinical study, it was confirmed a very satisfactory
      safety and tolerability. And pharmacokinetic results from the body's absorption in healthy
      subjects had been done well, a linear correlation was observed. Finally, it was confirmed
      that the most rapidly excreted into the urine.

      This study is a Phase 2a clinical trials performed in patients with chronic renal failure in
      3, 4 steps. The evaluation of changes in serum creatinine(sCr) in vivo indicator of renal
      failure according to the progress. Evaluating the inhibitory effect of HD-003 renal failure
      progression and dose setting, and to determine the safety.
