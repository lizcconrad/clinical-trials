  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desflurane is a halogenated ether with low solubility, giving rapid induction and emergence
      from anesthesia This character is suitable for Volatile Induction and Maintenance Anesthesia
      (VIMA). But desflurane can cause airway irritation when it used as a sole induction agent to
      adult or children, so there were many studies about reducing the airway reflex combined with
      desflurane.

      Remifentanil is a short acting opioid and is quickly hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterase in
      the plasma and multiorgan. Several studies suggest the optimal dose of remifentanil for
      reducing airway reflex or cardiovascular response for intubation combined with desflurane.
      But these studies were under 1 Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of desflurane and this
      point could be a limitation because desflurane concentration over 1 MAC increase airway
      irritation significantly. This study this study was designed to determine a median effective
      effect-site concentration (EC50) of remifentanil to prevent airway irritation during
      desflurane anesthesia over 1 MAC.

    <description>When the particapants arrived into the operating room, the investigators applied standard monitoring and after preoxygenation, 2 mg remifentanil was diluted into 50 ml of normal saline (40 Î¼g/ml solution) and was infused by Target concentration infusion (TCI) via syringe pump (Pilot Anesthesia 2. Fresenius vial, France) using the pharmacokinetic model. Investigator started to infuse remifentanil at 4 ng/ml and after the Ce of remifentanil reached the target concentration level, opened the dial of desflurane vaporizer at 4 vol%. After 30 seconds, increase the concentration of desflurane 8% and 12% at last. If there is no spontaneous respiration or loss of consciousness, the muscle relaxant esmerone 0.6mg/kg is injected and after 90 seconds the tracheal intubation is performed.</description>
