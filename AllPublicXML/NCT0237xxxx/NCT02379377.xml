      This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG)
      positron emission tomography (PET) in imaging patients with liver cancer before undergoing
      surgery or transplant. Diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-FSPG PET, may help find and
      diagnose liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the relationship between 18F-FSPG PET/computed tomography (CT) and pathology
      in patients with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) scheduled for liver resection
      surgery and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).

      II. To compare 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic CT imaging in patients
      with suspected HCC scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

      III. To compare the uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with 11C-acetate PET/CT in suspected HCC and
      background liver in patients scheduled for liver resection surgery or OLT.

      IV. To evaluate uptake of 18F-FSPG PET/CT in non-HCC liver tumors: benign and malignant
      compared to background.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FSPG PET and carbon-11 (11C)-acetate PET scans within 4-8 weeks of
      surgery or OLT.

    <measure>Change in lesion 18F-FSPG PET standardized uptake value (SUV) compared to background (normal liver tissue)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A two-sided type I error rate of 5%, using a paired t-test will be used to test that lesion 18F-FSPG PET SUV's are significantly greater than background (normal liver tissue). Diagnostic pathology and immunoreactivity (xC-, cluster of differentiation 44) from fresh liver resection specimens, and OLT when possible, will be carried out. SUV will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation as well as a five number summary including the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles and the minimum and maximum values.</description>

    <description>The paired t-test will be used to compare lesion counts. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation as well as a five number summary including the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles and the minimum and maximum values.</description>

    <measure>Detection of poorly differentiated HCC lesions with 18F-FSPG PET missed by 11C-acetate PET</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean and standard deviation as well as a five number summary including the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles and the minimum and maximum values. The paired t-test will be used to compare lesion counts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of PET imaging data (SUV) with ordinal immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring (0-3) of ex vivo liver tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>All imaging data (SUV) will be correlated to definitive, ex vivo diagnostic pathology and immunoreactivity (xC-, CD44), which will be carried out for every liver resection patient, and, when feasible, for every OLT patient. IHC scoring will be in terms of perceived strength of staining (scored on an ordinal scale of 0â€‘3). However, such correlations may not be possible with many of the OLT patients, given the highly variable timeframe from transplant eligibility to actual surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients whose Milan classification by novel imaging classification changed following validation by histological confirmation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The chi-square test will be used to compare categorical outcomes among independent groups (patient level sensitivity by imaging modality, HCC differentiation classification).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>18F-FSPG PET sensitivity and specificity as a function of standard uptake value (SUV) and definitive pathology.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation of multiple lesions within the same liver will be accounted for with models of sensitivity (every tumor detected) and specificity (only tumor detected); specifically, we are characterizing the ability of PET imaging (SUV) to detect tumors as compared to IHC (ordinal scoring) results. This treatment of lesion-based sensitivity and specificity has not been described in the HCC literature. Consequently, the analysis approach will be generalized by using generalized linear models (using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for clustered (lesions within the same liver) as appropriate) for proportions (binomial), counts (Poisson), and continuous (Gaussian) variables, assuming logit, log, and identity links. Standard goodness-of-fit and residual analyses will be conducted.</description>
