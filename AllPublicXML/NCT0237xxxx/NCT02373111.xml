  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photoaging is caused by the superposition of chronic ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage on the
      intrinsic aging process, and accounts for the majority of age-associated changes in skin
      appearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in UV-induced skin damage and
      diminish skin matrix protein levels, leading skin aging. Strategies utilizing endogenous skin
      antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have been examined.

      Astaxanthin mainly from marine algae and crustaceans is a kind of carotenoids which were
      well-known photo-protective agents with strong antioxidant activity. Several studies have
      revealed that supplementation of astaxanthin effectively protect skin against UV damage
      through free radicals.

      In addition, matrix metalloproteinase-1 induced by UV irradiation is an important step toward
      skin aging. Recently, many studies pointed out that phytoestrogens exhibit agonistic and
      antagonistic estrogen activities, suppressing activity of MMP-1 in skin. Isoflavone is a kind
      of phytoestrogen from soybean and mainly act on skin and bones, inhibiting MMP-1 effectively.

      The present study is designed to take isoflavone combined with astaxanthin to maximize their
      anti-aging ability and objectively measure the effects of the mixture on facial wrinkles,
      hydration, and elasticity.
