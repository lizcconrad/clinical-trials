  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the way physicians communicate with brain
      tumor patients. This study will look at how oncologists provide information about brain
      tumors, brain scan results, and treatment options. This study will look at how oncologists
      provide information about brain tumors, brain scan results, and treatment options.
      Ultimately, the investigators hope to use these findings to improve communication between
      patients, caregivers and their doctors.

    <description>This is a longitudinal study of patients with GBM with recurrent or multi-recurrent disease as determined by their neuro-oncologist (on the basis of clinical and/or radiological findings). Patients will indicate a single caregiver who will consent separately and perform separate assessments. The study assessments will evaluate the content of the discussion in which this change in disease status was communicated, as well as include patient-reported and caregiver-reported outcomes. We intend to accrue 160 total participants (80 patients and 80 caregivers) with complete post-discussion visit follow-ups over 18-24 months.</description>
