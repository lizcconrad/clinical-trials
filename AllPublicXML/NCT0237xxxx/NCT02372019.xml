  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether briefly reactivating a fear memory 20
      minutes prior to administering a social anxiety treatment will enhance the durability of
      treatment effects.

    <textblock>
      This study examines whether cognitive bias modification of interpretation (CBM-I) for
      socially anxious individuals can be augmented with the inclusion of a fear memory
      reactivation prior to administration of CBM. To date, CBM-I generally involves presenting
      participants with short vignettes that have ambiguous meaning. The ambiguity is resolved by
      having the subject complete a word stem at the conclusion of the paragraph, resolving the
      ambiguity in a positive/negative/neutral fashion. CBM attempts to retrain the tendency for
      socially phobic individuals to adopt negative interpretations of ambiguous events by
      repeatedly presenting trials resolving in a positive fashion. An inert control can be
      administered by having the majority of CBM trials resolve in a neutral fashion, without
      having the vignette end in either a positive or negative fashion.

      Reactivating a fear memory, followed by a short break, purportedly opens a window of several
      hours during which the fear memory is rendered labile, and so CBM given during this time
      should show greater durability of effects. However, manipulations given outside of this
      timeframe will presumably have no increased effects. Individuals exhibiting clinical levels
      of social anxiety, as measured with the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions:
      (1) fear reactivation administered 20 minutes prior to CBM, (2) fear reactivation
      administered 12-36 hours prior to CBM, and (3) fear reactivation administered 12-36 hours
      prior to an inert form of CBM. A variety of measures measuring anxiety, interpretation bias,
      and cognitions will be repeatedly assessed across the study, including at pretreatment, post
      treatment, and at one and two week follow up. Additionally, several potential moderators of
      treatment outcome will be assessed prior to engaging in treatment. At two week follow up,
      participants will also be given a speech stressor task to determine its effect on subsequent
      interpretation bias.

    <measure>Word Sentence Association Paradigm (WSAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment (assessed twice: before &amp; after fear retrieval), post-treatment (within 30 minutes following CBM administration), 1-week follow up, 2-week follow up (assessed twice at 2-week follow up: before and after a speech task stressor)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure of interpretation bias involves a series of trials in which an ambiguous sentence describing a social situation is presented, followed by the presentation of a single word corresponding to either a threat interpretation or a benign interpretation of the sentence. The participant's task is to indicate whether the sentence and the word are related.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ambiguous Social Scenarios Interpretation Questionnaire (ASSIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment, post-treatment (within 30 minutes following CBM administration), 1-week follow up, 2-week follow up (assessed twice at 2-week follow up: before and after a speech task stressor)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASSIQ is an alternative measure of interpretation bias, involving the presentation of an ambiguous social scenario, and the subsequent listing of three possible explanations corresponding to positive, neutral, and negative interpretations. Participants rate these explanations based on their likelihood of explaining the scenario. Stimuli are to be developed by the authors of the current study. In contrast to the WSAP, the ASSIQ is being used to assess more reflective aspects of interpretation bias.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief State-Trait Anxiety Inventory- State (BSTAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment (assessed 3x: before &amp; after fear retrieval, &amp; immediately before CBM), post treatment (within 30 minutes following CBM administration), 1-week follow up, 2-week follow up (assessed 2x at two-week follow up: before &amp; after speech stressor)</time_frame>
    <description>The BSTAI is a self-report measure comprised of six items taken from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, which together measure state anxiety. The BSTAI is highly correlated (r=0.93) with the full 20-item STAI. The instrument measures current state anxiety levels, but will also be administered immediately after the speech tasks to assess peak anxiety during the speech itself. During these instances, the wording of the BSTAI questions will be adapted to reflect this timing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of Speech Performance Measure (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow up (after speech stressor task)</time_frame>
    <description>This adapted 17-item measure will ask subjects to predict how others would rate the subject's own speech performance. It includes questions about both specific (voice steadiness) and global (appearance of confidence) items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Beliefs Related To Social Anxiety Scale (SBSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The SBSA is a self-report measure that includes 15 items assessing the presence of three types of self-beliefs common in socially anxious individuals: (a) excessively high self-standards, (b) conditional self-beliefs, and (c) unconditional self-beliefs. Assessments from this scale will be examined as a potential moderator of social phobia and interpretation bias improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpretation of Positive Events Scale (IPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IPES is a 13-item self-report questionnaire assessing negative interpretations of positive social events. Assessments from this scale will be examined as a potential moderator of social phobia and interpretation bias improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a self-report scale that is among the most commonly used measures of depression. Assessments from this scale will be examined as a potential moderator of social phobia and interpretation bias improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dot Probe Task</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The dot probe task will be used in the current study to determine whether attentional bias moderates change in interpretation bias. The computerized paradigm involves the repeated presentation of two stimuli simultaneously, with one stimulus representing threat and the other stimulus representing safety. 500ms after stimulus onset, both stimuli are removed and one is replaced with a probe (for example, a letter would appear behind the former location of the threat stimulus or the safety stimulus). The participant's task is to determine the location of the probe. Attentional deployment prior to probe onset is inferred by response time latencies to probe location. Assessments from this task will be examined as a potential moderator of social phobia and interpretation bias improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS-5 is a structured interview intended to diagnose a range of anxiety and related disorders according to DSM-5 criteria. It provides a dimensional assessment of key diagnostic features of various disorders. However, only the interview section for social anxiety disorder will be used in the current study. This measure will be used only as a screening for study eligibility.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a fear reactivation trial, which involves giving a one-minute impromptu speech after only 30 seconds of preparation time. 20 minutes afterwards, they will be given CBM for interpretation bias. Training will involve 84 social scenario vignettes, with 70 resolving positively, 7 resolving negatively, and 7 resolving neutrally. This training takes places during the &quot;memory reconsolidation window&quot; that opens after fear reactivation, during which time the fear memory is in a labile state and thus more amenable to rewriting.</description>

Training will involve 84 social scenario vignettes, with 70 resolving positively, 7 resolving negatively, and 7 resolving neutrally. Because this training takes places well outside of the &quot;memory reconsolidation window&quot; that opens shortly after fear reactivation, the reactivation is not expected to have any effect, and only serves as a control.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a fear reactivation trial, which involves giving a one-minute impromptu speech after only 30 seconds of preparation time. 12 to 36 hours afterwards, they will be given an inert form of CBM, which should not influence the direction of interpretation bias. Training will involve 84 social scenario vignettes, with 70 resolving neutrally, 7 resolving positively, and 7 resolving negatively. Because the CBM training takes places well outside of the &quot;memory reconsolidation window&quot; that opens after fear reactivation, the reactivation is not expected to have any effect, and the inert CBM training is not expected to have any effect either. This condition only serves as a control for the other two conditions.</description>
