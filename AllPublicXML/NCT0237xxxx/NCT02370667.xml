  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing exercise for people with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA) is essential for pain
      management, improved function, and chronic disease prevention. Exercise that decreases joint
      exposure to damaging loading while eliciting adequate muscular activation for strength
      improvements is ideal. The purpose of this 3-arm RCT is to compare mobility, strength, pain,
      and MRI outcomes between the low-loading biomechanical exercise program (BE), a traditional
      exercise program for knee OA (TE), and a control group completing meditation classes (M).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease affecting 1 in 10 Canadians. Osteoarthritis
      commonly presents in the knee joint and is associated with mobility limitations, pain, and an
      increased risk of other chronic health conditions such as heart disease. It is critical to
      implement exercise for people with knee OA as it can be an effective method for improving
      pain, mobility, and cardiovascular health. A biomechanical exercise program using static yoga
      postures has been established in the investigators lab based on minimizing damaging knee
      joint loads, while effectively exercising the musculature around the knee joint. The
      investigators pilot project (REB#13-510) showed that a 12-week yoga program using these
      biomechanical exercises improved pain and mobility while keeping the medial joint loading
      well below that experienced during normal level walking. The next step with this exercise
      program is to compare clinical and tissue outcomes with that of a regularly prescribed
      aerobic and strengthening program, as well as a control group completing meditation classes.
      The investigators aim to identify differences in clinical mobility performance outcomes,
      muscle and fat volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cartilage integrity using
      MRI between the three groups using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. The LEFS is scored from 0 to 80 with higher scores represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-reported Knee Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Change in self-reported knee pain was assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The KOOS pain score represents a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The NPRS pain score represents a score from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). NPRS ratings were provided following maximum isometric knee extensor exertions and flexor exertions. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Arthritis-related Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Higher numbers indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Depression was assessed with the Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, a 20-item scale developed for the general population with emphasis on affect. Elements of affect include mood, guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, appetite, and sleep. The CES-D is scored from 0 to 60 with a score of 16 or higher indicating depression. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Frailty Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS). The EFS is a brief screening interview for older adults to assess frailty that is commonly used in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The scale covers 8 domains: cognition, general health status, functional independence, social support, medication use, nutrition, mood, continence, and functional performance (defined as performance on the Timed Up and Go [TUG] test). The test is scored out of 17, with higher scores indicating higher levels of frailty. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

        <description>The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) consists of 20 items, on an adjectival scale, that assess difficulty during mobility tasks ranging from transfers to running. The LEFS is scored from 0 to 80 with higher scores represent better self-reported physical function. It is reliable and valid in knee OA and has superior sensitivity to change compared to similar measures. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

        <title>Change in Self-reported Knee Pain</title>
        <description>Change in self-reported knee pain was assessed with 3 valid and reliable questionnaires: the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) score, and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The KOOS pain score represents a normalized score from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms). KOOS scores closer to 100 indicate fewer symptoms. The ICOAP consists of two sub-scales: constant pain (5 items) and intermittent pain (6 items). The score from each subscale represents a normalized score from 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain). ICOAP scores closer to 0 indicate less pain. The NPRS pain score represents a score from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). NPRS ratings were provided following maximum isometric knee extensor exertions and flexor exertions. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

        <title>Change in Arthritis-related Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) measures arthritis-specific beliefs regarding perception of performance on certain tasks to cope with the disease. The ASES is measured using 20 questions on a 10-100 scale with respect to three main areas: pain management (5 questions), physical function (9 questions), and other symptoms (6 questions). Higher numbers indicate greater certainty that a participant can cope with a particular task as a consequence of their disease. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

        <description>Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS). The EFS is a brief screening interview for older adults to assess frailty that is commonly used in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The scale covers 8 domains: cognition, general health status, functional independence, social support, medication use, nutrition, mood, continence, and functional performance (defined as performance on the Timed Up and Go [TUG] test). The test is scored out of 17, with higher scores indicating higher levels of frailty. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference score (follow-up score - baseline score) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

        <title>Change in Inflammatory Markers (IL6, TNF, IL10)</title>
        <description>Cytokines interleukin-6 (IL6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-10 (IL10) are important markers of the inflammatory response. These markers will be assessed using standard blood draw and nasal swabs collected by a medical professional. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference in concentration in pg/ml (follow-up - baseline) was computed for each of the three study arms.</description>

            <description>The participants in this arm were asked to attend 3 group classes per week for 12 weeks at a local yoga studio taught by a certified yoga instructor. Four class times were offered per week. These classes included a warm-up, static poses shown to decrease knee joint loading, and a cool down including flexibility exercises. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention).</description>

The program included 15 minutes of walking per class, closed kinetic chain strengthening exercises on machines, and a cool down consisting of stretching. Participants were asked to come to class 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Certified Kinesiologists as well as student volunteers were available during all class times for program completion and progression. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention).</description>

These classes took place at an alternate area of the yoga studio to avoid contamination. Since it is known that exercise is beneficial for pain management and strengthening in knee OA, participants randomized to the control group were offered a free exercise pass following completion of the study. Measurements were obtained at baseline (before intervention) and at follow-up (following intervention).</description>
