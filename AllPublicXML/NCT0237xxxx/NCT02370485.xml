  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much of the LY2801653 drug is available in the
      body when given in 2 different formulations with and without a meal to healthy participants
      who are not able to have children. In addition, this study will measure how much of the drug
      gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. Information about
      any side effects that may occur will also be collected. The study will last about 27 days.
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
