  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulation following surgery has been found to be beneficial for patients; however, nurses
      and doctors struggle with getting post-operative, hospitalized patients to walk on their own.
      One promising strategy to address this might be an ambulation orderly, an employee whose
      single responsibility is to assure that patients walk 3-4 times per day. However, the effect
      of the ambulation orderly on post-operative physical activity has not yet been described. It
      is important to quantify what the ambulation orderly does in order to assess if this is an
      effective method for helping patients walk. As a result, the investigators will perform a
      pilot randomized controlled trial to test the effects of an ambulation orderly in patients
      hospitalized with recent cardiac surgery. Half of the patients will be assigned to walk with
      the ambulation orderly 3-4 times/day and the control group will be given standard nursing
      encouragement and assistance and encouragement to walk. The investigators will evaluate the
      average total daily step counts (over the hospital course, usually 4-7 days) and the change
      in walking distance between a baseline and a final 6 minute walk test. The investigators will
      also evaluate exercise physiologic parameters (heart rate, oxygen saturation) during
      ambulation, patient functional independence, and patient satisfaction.

      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized controlled trial at Baystate Medical
      Center, a 684-bed academic teaching hospital that serves as the referral center for a
      population of approximately 800,000 people living in Western Massachusetts.

      The responsibility of the ambulation orderly is to walk patients after having a cardiac
      surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass surgery or a valve replacement or repair. Patients
      will be randomized to receive visits from the ambulation orderly (ambulation group) or to
      receive the standard care of Baystate Medical Center (control group). The standard of care
      will be nurse-directed ambulation, as is currently done in all other nursing floors at
      Baystate Medical Center. Nurses will be instructed to walk with the patients as they did
      before the initiation of the ambulation orderly and as they do when the orderly is on
      vacation, at conferences, training, or away for illness.

    <description>This is for the patients who are randomized to receive the standard care of Baystate Medical Center. The standard of care will be nurse-directed ambulation, as is currently done in all other nursing floors at Baystate Medical Center. Nurses will be instructed to walk with the patients as they did before the initiation of the ambulation orderly and as they do when the orderly is on vacation, at conferences, training, or away for illness. These patients will not receive visits from the ambulation orderly.</description>

    <description>The responsibility of the ambulation orderly is to walk patients after having a cardiac surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass surgery or a valve surgery. Baystate Medical Center hired an ambulation orderly May 8, 2013. The ambulation orderly is generally a high school graduate with some training in safe lifting and exercise, but extensive training is not required. In general, the goal is to have 1 ambulation orderly present 7 days a week for 8 hr per day. When available, ambulation orderlies are responsible for walking the patients who have been cleared by the clinical exercise physiologist or nurse up to 4 times per day. The walking of the patients occurs through the halls of the 6th floor of the Mass Mutual wing of Baystate Medical Center.</description>
