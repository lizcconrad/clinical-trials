  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the well-known of complications post colonic polypectomy is bleeding usually occuring
      in the 2-week period following the procedure. Patients treated with oral anticoagulation
      (e.g. Warfarin) are a special and challenging patient group due to the need on the one hand
      to prevent thromboembolic events, and on the second hand to minimize the risk of
      post-polypectomy bleeding. Current practice guidelines recommend holding Warfarin treatment
      while bridging with LMW Heparin while resuming Warfarin treatment following the procedure.
      This practice was found to be associated with a much higher rate of bleeding compared with
      continuing Warfarin in a recent prospective trial in pacemaker transplanted patients. The
      fact that most post-polypectomy bleeding occurs within the 2-week period further questions
      the current practice of periprocedural bridging therapy. the investigators therefore
      hypothesize that patients with continuous Warfarin treatment may have similar
      post-polypectomy bleeding rates compared to patients receiving bridging therapy with LMW
      Heparin.

      This is a multicenter single-blinded prospective randomized trial comparing small
      post-polypectomy (polyps&lt;10mm) bleeding rates between two groups of patients: Continuous
      therapy with Warfarin, vs. LMW Heparin therapy while withholding Warfarin therapy (current
      practice).

      Oral anti thrombotic medications are commonly prescribed for patients with venous
      thromboembolism, chronic atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, etc. As
      gastrointestinal endoscopy in often required in these patients, one should consider the
      urgency of the procedure, the risk of bleeding (related both to antithrombotic therapy itself
      and to the type of endoscopic procedure) and the risk for thromboembolic events related to
      interruption of antithrombotic therapy.Current ASGE guidelines state that aspirin may be
      continued for all diagnostic and most therapeutic endoscopic procedures . As to oral
      anticoagulants (ie. warfarin), a distinction is made as to the risk of thromboembolism (high
      vs. low patient risk of thrombosis) and the risk of bleeding ( high vs. low procedure risk of
      bleeding). ASGE and ACCP Guidelines suggest discontinuing anticoagulation in the
      periendoscopic period in patients with low risk of thromboembolic events (appendix I), while
      continuing anticoagulation in patients with high risk of thromboembolic events. Switching to
      LMWH , termed &quot;bridging therapy&quot;, is suggested when anticoagulation need to be continued.
      However there is little evidence to support such an approach. In addition, there are a number
      of potential drawbacks to bridging therapy with heparin in the periprocedural period. This
      approach consumes considerable healthcare resources, involves a short period of normal
      coagulability (if not hypercoagulability) with an associated risk of thromboembolism.
      Finally, In a recent systematic review of 34 studies of anticoagulated patients (19 of which
      enrolled endoscopic procedures), bridging therapy was found to be associated with increased
      rates of overall and major bleeding, and no difference in thrombotic events, as compared to
      no bridging. Colonic polypectomy is considered to be a procedure with high risk for bleeding.
      The reported risk of polypectomy related bleeding ranges in various reports from as low as
      0.3% to as high as 6.1 %, averaging in most studies 1-2.5% Bleeding can be immediate or
      delayed, with the latter being a bit more frequent, occurring in up to 2% of patients, as
      early as few hours and as late as 29 days after the procedure, though mostly in post
      procedure days. Polyp size greater than 1-2 cm was found to be associated with increased risk
      for immediate and delayed postpolypectomy bleeding. As an example, bleeding occurred in ~1%
      of polypectomies &lt; 1 cm and in 6.5% of polypectomies &gt; 2 cm.Other factors found to be related
      to bleeding risk are age, location (Cecal and right colon &gt; rest of colon), cardiovascular
      and renal comorbidities, and use of anticoagulation. The continuation of anticoagulation
      further increases bleeding risk. In a 2004 retrospective study of 1657 patients undergoing
      polypectomy, post procedural bleeding rate was 2.2% (86% immediate, 14% delayed), and
      Warfarin was found to be associated with an Odds ratio of 13.37 for bleeding. In contrast to
      other studies, age, size and location of the polyp were not found to be associated with risk
      of bleeding. On the other hand, temporary suspension of anticoagulation therapy is
      associated, at least theoretically, with a risk of thromboembolic complications. The
      magnitude of that risk was reported to be low (~ 0.7%) in 2 retrospective studies and one
      meta-analysis but admittedly high risk patients were underrepresented. In fact, actual
      overall rates (with and without bridging) of perioperative thrombotic complications are
      higher and range from 0.9-1.8% , with a corresponding bleeding rate of 1.9%-2.7%.As to
      bridging therapy, evidence comes almost exclusively from retrospective studies. Recent
      meta-analysis showed that, compared to no anticoagulation, perioperative bridging therapy
      with heparin increased the overall risk of major bleeding without a significant decrease in
      the risk of thromboembolic events. Later on, a prospective, randomized study comparing
      bridging therapy with continued warfarin in patients with moderate-to-high risk of
      thromboembolism undergoing defibrillator or pacemaker surgery (a high bleeding risk procedure
      by definition) , found more major bleeding in the bridging group as compared to continued
      warfarin, with no difference in thrombotic outcome.Apart from the above mentioned paper, as
      far as the investigators know, no comparative prospective study compared bridging with
      continued warfarin.

      Polyps up to 1 cm in diameter have been safely removed in patients on warfarin therapy. In
      one retrospective series, warfarin was discontinued 36 hours prior to colonoscopy to avoid
      supra therapeutic INR. 3 out of 123 patients who underwent 225 polypectomies on warfarin had
      bleeding, only one of which required treatment. All patients were prophylactically treated
      with clips.19 In a recent randomized trial, 70 patients with a total of 159 polyps up to 1 cm
      in diameter underwent polypectomy while taking warfarin. Patients were assigned to have their
      polyps removed either eith a cold snare technique or electrocautery. Immediate bleeding
      occurred in 10 of 70 patients (14%) and was more common in patients who had their polyps
      removed using electrocautery (23% vs 6%). No delayed bleeding occurred in the cold group
      whereas 5 (14%) patients required endoscopic hemostasis in the electrocautery group.

      As immediate bleeding can be effectively managed endoscopically, the investigators should
      question if there is any potential benefit of periprocedural bridging in terms of preventing
      delayed bleeding (occurring during warfarin-LMWH overlap or following warfarin re-loading).

      Considering the fact that ~ 25% of patients will be found to have colorectal polyps in
      screening colonoscopy, and that the majority of these polyps are &lt; 20 mm, A cardinal question
      is whether the investigators should keep choosing among the two traditional policies: advise
      all our patients to stop warfarin ahead of screening colonoscopies,Or keep them
      anticoagulated and reschedule them to a therapeutic colonoscopy in the face of discovering
      colonic polyps (an approach that was found to be cost effective in one study comparing these
      two policies).

      The investigators think a third option might be better : keeping patients anticoagulated with
      warfarin, and perform polypectomies for polyps up to 20 mm, while re-scheduling patients with
      larger polyps.

      To summarize, the three most important conclusions from the data presented in this
      introduction are:

        1. Small polyps was shown to be safely removed under Warfarin

        2. Delayed bleeding occurs after bridging is finished

        3. Bridging therapy is probably related to increased bleeding, theoretically related to
           increased thromboembolic risk and is logistically complex Taken together, these
           background data underlies our logic to perform a prospective study comparing bleeding
           rates following polypectomies of small polyps in orally anticoagulated vs. bridged
           patients.

      Hypothesis:In patients with moderate to high risk of thromboembolic events undergoing
      elective colonoscopy, a strategy of uninterrupted oral anticoagulation will lead to
      equivalent bleeding rates compared with conventional bridging anticoagulation.

      Study Objectives:Primary study Objective : to evaluate the safety of polypectomy under
      Warfarin therapy compared to currently recommended bridging therapy with heparin or LMWH
      Study Design:Following signing on informed consent, patients on chronic Warfarin therapy
      meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria , who are scheduled for elective diagnostic
      colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, the first of which continue
      Warfarin treatment as usual while the second is switched to bridging therapy with LMWH
      according to recommendations of the ACCP guidelines. INR will be checked on the day before
      the colonoscopy (day -1) in both groups. Most recent CBC value (from recent 3 months) will
      serve as baseline value. If not available - CBC will be done during the recruitment period.
      On the day of colonoscopy (day 0), patients with INR values within therapeutic range or
      supratherapeutic value up to 0.5 units will proceed through colonoscopy. In case no INR value
      from day -1 is available, patient ambulatory INR values from the last three months will be
      reviewed and patient enrolled if &gt;=80% of values were within therapeutic window. The warfarin
      dose on day 0 will be taken only following the supervision period after the colonoscopy. In
      case the INR was more than 0.5 above therapeutic range on day -1, therapy will be resumed on
      day1. As to the colonoscopy, both groups will be scheduled to early morning and will be
      monitored for clinical follow up for 6 hours at Endoscopy unit. Polyps up to 10 mm (estimated
      using the open-forceps technique, forceps span=8mm) will be removed with cold or hot methods
      (according to physician preferences). Hemostatic clips will be applied if deemed necessary
      according to the performing physician judgement . In case of multiple polyps, the number of
      polypectomies done will be determined by the endoscopist. For polyps measuring &gt; 10 mm,
      colonoscopy will be rescheduled (but small polyps will still be removed during the index
      colonoscopy).Following the procedure, patients will be monitored for 6 hours at the Endoscopy
      unit. Delayed bleeding will be monitored by the patient on a daily follow up sheet.
      Ambulatory CBC will be done a week following the colonoscopy . Investigators will make Phone
      calls for follow up at day 5,10,14,30 . Outpatient clinic follow up will take place on day 30
      ± 7 days.Patients will be instructed to contact the investigating physician in case of black
      stools or BRBPR or otherwise come to ER in case of any continuous bleeding or bleeding
      perceived to be significant by patient or family.

      Study Procedures:Recruitment visit at GI institute outpatient clinics performed at least 1
      week ahead of the Colonoscopy;Patient's primary care physician will be contacted by the study
      coordinator upon signing the informed consent, in order to perform necessary blood test
      before and after the procedure.; colonoscopy (day 0);Follow up period of 14 days via phone
      calls and patient sheets;Clinical follow up visit at day 30 Sample Size:The bleeding rate
      post polypectomy in orally anticoagulated patient undergoing polypectomy of small polyps on
      Warfarin was reported to be as low as 1% in recent trials (see background). The rate of
      postpolypectomy bleeding in the general population is 1-2.5% . As bridging was found to
      increase bleeding compared to no bridging in the largest available meta-analysis, the
      investigators assume a bleeding rate of 4% in the bridging group. The sample size was
      estimated based on the complicated rates of delayed bleeding within 2 weeks after polypectomy
      and was based on detecting equivalence in proportions at the 5% level of significance with a
      power of 80%, yielding a sample size of 286 (143 each group) .

      Statistical Analysis:Descriptive statistics including 95% CIs will be calculated for all
      baseline variables using means, medians, SDs and interquartile ranges for continuous
      variables and rates and proportions for discrete variables for each treatment arm. For the
      primary outcome, clinically significant bleeding, treatment arms will be compared using
      chi-square test. Baseline characteristics will be compared and, if any clinically significant
      differences are identified, a logistic regression analysis will be conducted to compare
      clinically significant bleeding in between the two treatment arms adjusting for these
      differences. Same analysis will be followed for the secondary outcomes.

      Ethical issues:The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with
      the principles of the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot; guidelines and with the laws and regulations
      of the state of Israel.

      Written informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study.
