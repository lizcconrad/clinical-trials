  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giving both the gap existing between the current recommendations to prevent/detect
      comorbidities and the clinical practice in patients suffering from spondyloarthritis and also
      the specificity of some recommendations to rheumatic diseases, it seems logical to check
      these recommendations in a rheumatologic &quot;environment&quot;.

      This study with its two parts should be able to demonstrate:

        -  The importance of a systematic evaluation of comorbidities in Spondyloarthritis,

        -  The utility of a nurse-led program of self-assessment and self-management of the disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with spondyloarthritis will be invited by their rheumatologists to participate at
      this study in 21 centers in France.

      500 patients are planned to be included.

      After written informed consent will be obtained, the patients will be randomized in two arms:

        -  comorbidities

        -  self-assessment/self-management The patients will be seen again in the same center 12
           months later in order to collect the outcome measures

      The two primary objectives of this trial are :

        -  To evaluate the impact of a nurse led program of self-assessment of disease
           activity/severity and self-management on the level of satisfaction/coping

        -  To evaluate the impact of a nurse led program of assessment of comorbidities on the
           management of such comorbidities

      The Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities in SpA;

        -  To evaluate the level of adherence to recommendations of prevention of comorbidities;

        -  To evaluate the impact of the nurse led program of self-assessment / self-management on
           the amount of NSAID (Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) intake and the level of
           disability (e.g. functional disability)

    <description>Changes after 12 months in the comorbidity composite score.

    <description>This analysis will be purely descriptive and will include the percentage of patients with:
History of cardiovascular diseases
Hypertension
Diabetes
Hyperlipidemia
History of skin cancer, colon, uterus, breast, prostate
Percentage of patients at high risk of cancers when these risks are known (eg, family history of breast cancer, colon)

    <description>During the initial visit, the clinical research nurse exempt a learning program of assessment of disease activity/severity :
for assessing the activity in SpA;
for the calculation of BASDAI and the ASDAS-CRP
for the transfer technique and for the calculation of the disease activity on a monthly basis during the next 12 months.
for the risk of tobacco exposure
for the benefit of an NSAID intake in case of painful episode of the disease
for the benefit of home exercises
for the spine and indication of a treatment under the supervision of a physiotherapist in case of severe disease
for learning the patient to calculate his BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP Then, the patient will return home with his calculator and his notebook. Each month, the patient will be asked to perform the BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP calculations and to report the data on the notebook. 12 months later, the patient comes for a visit in the current practice to assess both such program and comorbidities.</description>
