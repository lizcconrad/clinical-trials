      Purpose: Subacromial impingement syndrome is the most common shoulder condition. Myofascial
      trigger points in teres major muscle can be associated with this syndrome. The investigators
      objective is to find out if adding manual therapy specifically for teres major trigger points
      can produce better results in these patients.

      Method: A randomized controlled pilot study was carried out. Fifty people were randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: intervention group or control group. Both groups received a
      protocolized physical therapy treatment while the intervention group additionally received
      manual therapy for teres major trigger points.
