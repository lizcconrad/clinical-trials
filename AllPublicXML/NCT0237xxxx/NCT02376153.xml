  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial to determine if the Air Barrier
      System device reduces the incidence of surgical site infection after total hip replacement,
      acetabular repair, posterior spinal fusion, and prosthetic vascular graft procedures.

      This project is an evaluation of a novel device, the Air Barrier System (ABS), to reduce the
      risk of prosthesis-related surgical site infection in a multi-center clinical trial. The ABS
      shields surgical incisions intra-operatively by creating a field of high-purity air
      surrounding an incision that prevents airborne microorganisms from entering the incision.

      This research will evaluate ABS performance in a prospective, randomized, blinded
      multi-center trial. The surgical procedures studied will include total hip arthroplasty,
      trauma-related acetabula reconstruction, posterior instrumented spine fusion, and prosthetic
      vascular graft procedures. Patients will be enrolled during the first two years of the study,
      and CDC guidelines require a one year follow-up period to monitor patients for potential
      prosthesis-related infections.
