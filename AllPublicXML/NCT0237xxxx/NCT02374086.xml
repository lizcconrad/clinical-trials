  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angina in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in women,
      and leads to increased risk for major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction,
      stroke, and heart failure. Annual mortality rates are ten-fold higher than mortality from
      breast cancer, and the lifetime cost of health care for women with non-obstructive chest pain
      is close to $1 million. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is a major etiological feature of
      this disease, and may contribute to disease progression. Despite our general understanding,
      effective treatment remains elusive. This pilot study will test whether regular exercise
      training can improve/reverse coronary microvascular dysfunction in women with angina but no
      obstructive coronary artery disease.

      We will study 10 women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no evidence of obstructive
      coronary artery disease.

      Procedures:

      Aerobic fitness: Incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a exercise bike to
      assess the maximal rate of oxygen consumption.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: To assess cardiac morphology and function. Cardiac
      perfusion imaging: Using MRI, we will assess the rate of uptake of a contrast media
      (gadolinium) at rest and in response to a vasodilating substance (adenosine) to evaluate
      myocardial perfusion reserve.

      Protocol:

      Participants will undergo aerobic fitness testing, cardiac MRI and perfusion imaging at
      baseline and following 8-weeks of regular exercise training.
