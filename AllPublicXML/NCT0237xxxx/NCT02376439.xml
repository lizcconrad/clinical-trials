      This research studies the energy balance behaviors (usual eating, physical activity,
      sedentary) and non-shared experiences of siblings discordant for weight (one sibling is lean
      the other is overweight). To accomplish this, siblings attend four laboratory sessions where
      they consume one of two types of kool-aid, smell the pizza, or rest quietly. Siblings then
      eat a dinner meal. Siblings also wear an activity monitor for one week and record their
      physical activity and sedentary activities in a habit book.

        Forty-eight sibling pairs (24 pairs of boys and 24 pairs of girls, 96 total adolescents)
        age 13 to 17 years who are discordant for overweight/obesity will be studied to assess
        potentially modifiable non-shared experiences within and outside the family environment
        that alter energy balance behaviors and contribute to adolescent overweight. We will also
        measure the height and weight of up to 3 of their best friends.
