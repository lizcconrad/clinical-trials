  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish proof of concept and identify the optimal
      efficacious dose for namilumab in RA in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate
      (MTX-IR) and in patients with an inadequate response to one tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-inhibitor (TNF-IR).

      The drug being tested in this study is called namilumab. Namilumab is being tested to treat
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in people who have an inadequate response to methotrexate, and in
      people who have an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor-inhibitor (TNF-IR). This
      study will look at improvement in disease activity in participants who take namilumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Namilumab 20 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Namilumab 80 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Namilumab 150 mg/mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive subcutaneous injection) - this is a medication that looks like
           the study drug but has no active ingredient.

      All participants will receive namilumab or placebo as specified in the protocol. A stable
      dose of methotrexate and daily folic acid will also be required treatments.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 40 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a
      follow-up assessment up to 18 weeks after the last dose of study medication.
