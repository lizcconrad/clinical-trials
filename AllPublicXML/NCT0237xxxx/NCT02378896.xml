      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized training program (called
      Personalized Computerized Inhibitory Training, or PCIT) coupled with cognitive behavioral
      therapies (CBT) consisting of Exposures and Response Prevention in treating obsessive
      compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients who previously underwent CBT, but still have residual
      symptoms.
