  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to evaluate whether the size of the endotracheal tube
      (ETT) that is used impacts the intracuff pressure that occurs when the airway is sealed. If
      there is excessive pressure in the cuff of a smaller ETT when it is inflated, there may be
      inherent risks associated with the use of a cuffed endotracheal tube that is less than the
      appropriate size. The investigators believe that the size of the tube chosen has an impact on
      the characteristics of the inflated cuff and hence the intracuff pressure and the sealing
      pressure are variable.

    <description>Our goal is to measure the intracuff pressure that is achieved when the airway is sealed with an ETT based on the formula (ETT=(age/4)+3) and compare it to the intracuff pressure when the airway is sealed with an ETT that is 1 size smaller (4.0 mm instead of 5.0 mm).</description>

    <description>Their tracheas will be intubated with an appropriately sized ETT using the standard formula. The cuff will be inflated to achieve a seal by the air-leak test when holding CPAP of 20 cmH2O and the intracuff pressure will be measured using a manometer.</description>

    <description>Their tracheas will be intubated with an ETT that is one size smaller (instead of a 5.0 ETT, we would use a 4.0 ETT). The cuff will be inflated to achieve a seal by the air-leak test when holding CPAP of 20 cmH2O and the intracuff pressure will be measured using a manometer.</description>
