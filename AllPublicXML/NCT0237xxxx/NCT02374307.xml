  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a falls-prevention program on quality
      of life, fear of falling, falls and physical function in older people receiving home-help
      services. The participants in the intervention group will perform the Otago exercise
      programme. The participants in the control group continue with their usual activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls and falls-related injuries are considered a serious public health issue in the older
      population. Strength and balance exercise in combination with information about falls
      prevention seems to be effective in reducing falls, but less is known about the effect of
      this kind of intervention on quality of life. Previous studies have shown that older people
      living at home and receiving home-help services seem to be at high risk of falling. We will
      therefore conduct a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a falls
      prevention program on quality of life, fear of falling, falls and physical function in
      community-dwelling older people who receive home-help services. In addition, the
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed.

    <measure>Changes in Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in health-related quality of life will be measured with the SF-36 which is a questionnaire of 36 items. The 36 items are grouped into eight health status scales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems and due to emotional problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning and mental health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of falls</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Falls will be defined as an event, i.e. fall, trip, slip, which results in the person coming to rest on the ground or floor or other lower level, and the participant will be asked: &quot;Have you had any fall including slip or trip in which you lost your balance and landed on the floor or ground or lower level?&quot;. This registration will be performed on monthly calendars which will be collected every third month.</description>

    <measure>Falls-efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale-International)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Falls-efficacy will be measured with the Falls Efficacy Scale-International, a self-report questionnaire of 16 items measuring level of concern about falling during 16 activities of daily living. Minimum score 16, maximum score 64.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic and validated questionnaire. It describes five dimensions of HRQL (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety depression) each of which can take one of five responses at five levels of severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems).</description>

    <description>This group will perform a 12-week individual tailored home exercise programme in accordance with the manual of Otaga exercise programme. Physiotherapist will visit the participants 5 times during the 12 weeks (at week 1,2,4,8 and 10) to prescribe and progress exercises. Motivational conversations on telephone will be performed the weeks when no visits are scheduled. Additionally, the participants will receive information on the first visit which will focus on motivation, importance of adherence and effectiveness of falls prevention. The participants are expected to do exercises on their own, and in that way perform exercises 3 times weekly. If safe, the participant will be provided with a walking plan and be encouraged to walk twice weekly.</description>
