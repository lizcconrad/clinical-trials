  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of screening for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction
      between 11-13+6 weeks' gestation utilizing the combination of uterine artery doppler,
      maternal blood pressure, maternal characteristics, placental volume, and maternal serum
      factors, including PAPPA-A, PLGF, AFP and free Beta HCG. This is a non interventional study.

      Preeclampsia (PE) is a condition which affects approximately 2% of all pregnancies and can be
      a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity/mortality (2). The suspected underlying
      mechanism of PE is thought to be impaired trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral
      arteries leading to impaired placental perfusion, placental ischemia and subsequent
      development of endothelial dysfunction (3). There is evidence that PE, which is commonly
      associated with fetal growth restriction, can be predicted effectively at 11-13 weeks
      gestational age by combined screening algorithms combining uterine artery pulsatility index
      (PI), maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and maternal serum concentrations of placental
      products including but not limited to plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and placental growth factor
      (PLGF) (4-6).

      Aim of Study/Hypothesis:

      The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm based on the combination of maternal
      factors, uterine artery pulsatility index, mean arterial pressure, placental volume and serum
      biomarkers to estimate patient specific risks for the development of Preeclampsia in a US
      population.

      A 5cc maternal blood sample will be obtained through standard blood draw. The blood will
      first be transferred onto a dry blood requisition form card. The blood sample will be
      refrigerated and the serum and dried blood spot samples will be sent to Perkin Elmer
      Laboratories (see attachment C for collection protocols). The maternal serum levels of
      PAPP-A, PLGF, AFP, and free Î² hCG will be measured according to a protocol established by
      Perkin Elmer Laboratories.
