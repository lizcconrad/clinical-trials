  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that mostly affects the spine.
      This results in back pain and stiffness, and causes difficulty with daily activities.
      Physical activity and exercise are key components of the management of ankylosing
      spondylitis, however many adults with ankylosing spondylitis do not meet physical activity
      recommendations. This study aims to investigate the effects of a twelve week intervention
      designed to increase physical activity and exercise in adults with ankylosing spondylitis.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. An intervention group will
      receive individual consultations with a physiotherapist. The aim of the meetings will be to
      motivate and support participants on an individual basis, with the goal of increasing weekly
      physical activity. The second group, the control group, will continue with their current
      management strategies. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention
      (after twelve weeks) and after a three month follow-up period. The primary outcome measure
      will be free-living physical activity over one week.

    <description>Participants in this intervention group will receive a twelve week 'Brief Intervention' delivered by a physiotherapist. Participants will have an initial consultation with a physiotherapist, followed by a number of follow-up sessions. The number and timing of follow-up sessions will be at the participant's discretion (a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 11 over the duration of the study). The follow-up sessions can be face-to-face, over the telephone, or video conferencing depending on participant preference. Participants may additionally opt-in for a weekly email or text message reminder of physical activity goals.</description>

    <description>'Brief Intervention' is the term used to mean verbal advice, discussion, negotiation or encouragement, with or without written or other support or follow-up. 'Brief Interventions' provide a structured way to deliver advice and involve the provision of formal help and follow-up. They aim to equip people with tools to change attitudes and handle underlying problems.</description>
