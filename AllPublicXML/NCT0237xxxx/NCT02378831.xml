  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WP200 and/or WP200U will be compared with a PSG system which is a digital physiological
      recorder system, cleared for use for clinical sleep studies. The manual scoring of the PSG
      data, performed by a trained and authorized scorer, according to the AASM (American Academy
      of Sleep Medicine) guidelines, serves as a &quot;gold standard&quot; for all determinations of
      efficacy.
