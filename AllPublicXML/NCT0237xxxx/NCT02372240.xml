      This is a phase 1/2 single arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of VLX1570 IV
      infusion administered with low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open label study to determine the safety and efficacy of VLX1570
      intravenous (IV) infusion administered with low dose dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16
      of a 28-day cycle in patients with confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma with relapsed or
      relapsed and refractory disease (RRMM).

      The phase 1 trial design follows an Initial Accelerated Titration design followed by a
      traditional &quot;3+3&quot; cohort design to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase 2 dose (RPTD) for the phase 2 portion of the study. It is anticipated that patients
      will receive 6 treatment cycles. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression, patients have the option of continuing treatment beyond 6 cycles, if the
      investigator determines that the patient may benefit further from it.

             hypercalcemia is allowed and subject may enroll if hypercalcemia returns to normal
             with standard treatment).

         17. Diagnosed with plasma cell leukemia, POEMS syndrome or amyloidosis.

         18. Patients with a history of ventral nervous system (CNS) myeloma or other CNS
