      This study aims to improve quality of cancer care for LEP patients through improving medical
      interpreters' ability to cope with difficult encounters. We propose to (1) identify the needs
      of medical interpreters working with cancer patients, and (2) develop and test a
      psychoeducational resiliency program at 3 DF/HCC cancer centers: MGH, DFCI, and BWH) intended
      to enhance interpreters' skills to effectively manage stressful encounters and to cope with
      the personal effects of encounters.

    <measure>Feasibility and Acceptability of Intervention (participant feedback questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant feedback questionnaire will be completed by participants, including questions about whether the logistics and content of the intervention were feasible and acceptable to them. Attendance to the sessions is also considered as a component of feasibility.</description>

    <measure>Psychological Variables including Perceived Stress and Resiliency ( PSS-1021 is a 10-item scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (4 weeks), and 12 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS-1021 is a 10-item scale designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised, or considered as stressful, and how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. Responses are on 4-item Likert scales and range from 10-40; higher score = greater stress.The Resiliency Scale is a 14-item self-report measure to assess one's ability to successfully deal with adversity.</description>
