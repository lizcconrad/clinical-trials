  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate rising dose levels of VS-5584 administered in
      combination with a fixed dose of VS-6063 in subjects with relapsed malignant mesothelioma to
      determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further development of this combination in
      this indication.

      This study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation of VS-5584) and Part 2
      (Expansion). Up to 56 evaluable subjects (i.e., subjects who complete at least 1 cycle [21
      days] of therapy) will be enrolled, assuming that:

        -  Up to 6 dose levels of VS-5584 are studied in Part 1 (Dose Escalation of VS-5584) in
           combination with a fixed dose of VS-6063 at 400 mg twice daily (BID) with a maximum of 6
           subjects enrolled per VS-5584 dose level, for a total of up to 36 subjects (exclusive of
           replacement subjects).

        -  Up to an additional 20 evaluable subjects may be enrolled in Part 2, the expansion
           portion of the study. Subjects will be treated with VS-5584 at the RP2D and schedule
           determined in the dose escalation portion of the study in combination with a fixed dose
           of VS-6063.

          3. Uncontrolled or severe concurrent medical condition (including uncontrolled brain
             metastases).

          4. Known history of stroke or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to the first
             dose of study drug.

          5. Any evidence of serious active infection.

          6. Undergoing active treatment for a secondary malignancy.

             of study drug or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.

          8. Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          9. Acute or chronic pancreatitis.

             (HbA1C) &gt;7%.

         11. History or evidence of cardiac risk.

         12. Known history of malignant hypertension.
