    <measure>CNC Word Recognition in Quiet</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The CNC Words test consists of 10 recorded lists of 50 monosyllabic words in CD format. For this study, two lists will be administered in quiet at a level equal to 60 dBA in the sound field and scored as a total number of words correct, which will be expressed as a percentage correct for this study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>AzBio Sentence Recognition in Noise</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The AzBio Sentence Test consists of 15 lists of 20 sentences each. AzBio sentences are spoken by different talkers in a conversational style with limited contextual cues that the listener can use to predict or 'fill in' unintelligible words. Each list includes 5 sentences from 4 different male and female speakers. Each word in the sentence counts towards the overall score.</description>
