  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estimates of the prevalence of acromegaly, a condition resulting from excess growth hormone
      secretion, are as high as 1:1000. If detected late acromegaly increases the risk of joint
      destruction, heart disease, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure, diabetes, and polyps in the
      colon. To have a greater effect on long-term outcomes this disease needs to be detected
      early. By screening a 'high risk' population (sleep apnoea clinic) the investigators may be
      able to detect these patients earlier and prevent late complications of the disease. At LTHT
      the referral pathway for new referrals to the sleep apnoea clinic involves initial attendance
      to pick up a pulse oximeter to wear overnight to measure oxygen levels. These readings show
      approximately 1:4 patients displays evidence of significant obstructive sleep apnoea to
      warrant referral to the treatment group for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),
      weight management, and occasionally mandibular adjustment.

      Patients attending the sleep apnoea clinic either as new referral or for review will be asked
      to participate in the proposed study. The study is cross-sectional in design incorporating
      two sub-populations within the sleep apnoea clinic. The first cohort comprises patients under
      follow-up known to have sleep apnoea, and the second cohort those patients prospectively
      attending the sleep apnoea clinic for assessment. If after an explanation of the study they
      agree to participate blood will be taken for assessment of IGF-I and they will be asked to
      complete a simple questionnaire.

      The aim will to be to screen 1000 consecutive patients. The questionnaire will incorporate
      five simple questions to be completed with a 'yes' or 'no' answer. Where IGF-I levels are
      elevated patients will be investigated further for the possibility of acromegaly. The
      presence of biochemically proven acromegaly will be used to determine if the simple question
      has sufficient sensitivity to use as a screening tool.
