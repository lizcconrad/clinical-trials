    <textblock>
      Low back pain is not a diagnosis; it is a symptom describing the presence of pain in the
      lumbar vertebral or paravertebral region without any reference to the structure or cause of
      the process. It is one of the most widespread diseases and one of the most common reasons for
      visits in primary care setting.

      Exercises to improve lumbar stability involving co-contraction of the transversus abdominis
      have proved to be effective in reducing pain and improving function. It has been stated by
      ultrasound images that specific stabilization exercises cause contraction of the deep
      abdominal muscles, but it remains unclear whether training produce thickness muscle
      improvement and if this improvement is related to clinical findings.

      To try to resolve this issue a project of an experimental trial, double-blind (patient and
      evaluator) with two groups randomly assigned is presented. All participants will be recruited
      in an primary care center of the Catalan Health Institut and will sign informed consent. All
      will receive a protocolized treatment with therapeutic exercises and thermotherapy and,
      additionally, those assigned to the intervention group were instructed in performing lumbar
      stability exercises.

      Pain (VAS), function (Roland-Morris Questionnaire) and the thickness of the transversus
      abdominis, internal and external oblique muscles (measured by ultrasound) at baseline, end of
      treatment protocol (12 sessions) and three months after the end of treatment will be
      assessed.

      Results in pain, function, and its correlation with the mean changes in the thickness of
      transversus abdominis will be analyzed.

    <description>Four individualized learning sessions will be held during the same period of protocolized physiotherapy. Biofeedback training using the ultrasound machine will be performed in the first session, in order to show the specific contraction of the abdominal muscles with the stability exercises. The other three learning sessions will be performed without feedback, for the patient learn the exercises to make at home during the follow-up period.</description>
