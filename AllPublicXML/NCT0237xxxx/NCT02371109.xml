      Routine screening for gonorrhoea and chlamydia involves urine samples in males and selftaken
      vulvovaginal swabs (VVSs) in females. As well as infecting the urethra (pee tube) and cervix
      (neck of womb), gonorrhoea and chlamydia may also infect the rectum (bottom) and throat (both
      called extragenital sites), often with no symptoms. In some people infection will be found at
      more than one site, but in others it will only be in one, and if all anatomical sites are not
      tested some infections will be missed. In certain women one third of infections may be
      missed, in men who have sex with men (MSM) up to 90% may be missed, if extragenital swabs are
      not taken. Currently, routine community testing does not include extragenital sites. Until
      recently these samples could not easily be taken outside clinical settings (hospitals,
      clinics or surgeries), but new DNA tests for gonorrhoea, called NAATs, now make this
      possible.

      However, they are expensive, and taking samples from extragenital sites would treble the
      costs. We propose that swabs from the three sites per person are pooled and analysed together
      rather than tested separately. This method would identify whether the person had the
      infection but not the anatomical siteÍ¾ this would not alter the management of the individual.
      Swabs from the rectum and throat have historically been taken by clinicians (doctors or
      nurses). The main attraction of community screening is that it is client led using selftaken
      samples. Recent studies suggest that selftaken swabs from the rectum and throat are
      acceptable to clients and may be as good as swabs taken by clinicians, but the
      costeffectiveness of this approach has not been investigated. Our aim is to establish whether
      in MSM and females selftaken samples that are pooled and processed by NAATs are as effective
      as the individual tests taken by clinicians.
