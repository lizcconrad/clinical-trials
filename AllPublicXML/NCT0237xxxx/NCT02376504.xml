      The primary objective of this project is to determine the effects of decreasing sedentary
      behavior at work by at least 3hrs/day using treadmill (walking and standing) and sit-to-stand
      (standing only) workstations on the health of overweight office workers.

    <description>This is a 12-month, cluster-randomized trial with an intent-to-treat design to determine the effects of using treadmill and sit-to-stand workstations at the workplace on health variables in overweight office workers (N=66) with seated desk jobs and (2) to compare the efficacies of treadmill and sit-to-stand workstations in decreasing workplace sedentary behavior. The intervention will examine the effects of using these workstations on weight, cardiovascular and metabolic health variables , musculoskeletal discomfort, psychological affect and job stress. The study will also measure change in time spent sitting, standing and walking will be measured using wearable non-invasive acceleration sensors.</description>
