  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate whether NSAIDS are more or less effective in bone
      healing than opioids in acute fracture pain. Participants will be randomized to one of three
      groups for first line treatment of pain related to the fracture.

    <textblock>
      Pain management in acute fractures is challenging and influenced by several factors
      contributing to pain perception. These factors include but are not limited to tissue damage
      by the local impact, mechanical stress at the fracture ends, and central perception of the
      noxious stimulus. Tissue damage and mechanical stress leads to inflammation and further to
      local swelling. Swelling itself is significant contributor in pain development.

      Ideal pain management would attack pain development at most sites possible. The current
      clinical practice in the US applies a derivate of an opioid analgesic combined with
      acetaminophen, thereby influencing pain development at central perception by the opioid
      analgesic and acetaminophen and a peripheral analgesic effect of acetaminophen. The exact
      mechanism of the peripheral effect is not known.

      This clinical practice disregards the positive effect of medications influencing the
      peripheral inflammatory response, namely nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
      NSAIDs affect pain development by blocking the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites,
      inhibiting peripheral inflammatory response and central pain perception. The major reason for
      not applying NSAIDs in the treatment of acute fracture pain is an experimental animal study
      showing decreased bone healing in relation to NSAID usage.

      However, clinical data thus far is inconclusive, whether bone healing is affected in humans
      and whether NSAIDs should be avoided in the setting of bone fractures.

      This proposed study will give an answer whether the usage of NSAIDs in acute fractures has a
      negative effect on bone healing.
