      Hypothesis At 12 months of age, the neurologic development of TVA of a non cochlear implanted
      profound congenital deaf infant would be different to the development of a normally hearing
      infant.

      At 24 months of age, the neurologic development of TVA of deaf infant implanted before the
      age of 18 months would be similar to the development of a normally hearing infant.

      Main aim The main aim of the research is to study, by means of functional near infrared
      spectroscopy (fNIRS), the neurologic development of the TVA at 24 months of age (+/- 1 month)
      in a group (n=40) of normally hearing infant and in a group (n=40) of profound congenital
      deaf children implanted before the age of 18 months.

      Main outcome Measure and localization of an increase of brain blood flow during an auditory
      stimulation &quot;voice&quot; type compared to a stimulation &quot;non-voice&quot; type. Comparison of the
      results between groups at 24 months of age +/- 1 month allows to analyse eventual
      differences.

      Secondary aims and outcomes To study by means of functional near infrared spectroscopy the
      neurologic development of the temporal voice area at 12 months of age (+/- 1 month) in a
      group of normally hearing infant and in a group of profound congenital deaf infant wearing a
      standard hearing device between the age of 11 and 13 months and who will receive a cochlear
      implant between 12 and 18 months of age.

      To study the association between fNIRS data and clinical data of the evaluation of
      comprehension of the spoken language at 24 months of age.

      Methods Two groups of 40 infants matching in age will be constituted. Less than 13 months old
      children will be included during a medical consultation in the ENT department of Necker
      hospital after complete information of both parents. Written consent of both parents will be
      required. An audiophonological checking will be done.

      Then a fNIRS examination will be programmed at the maternity of the Robert Debré hospital and
      done at the age of 12 months (+/- 1 month) and 24 months (+/-1 month). This fNIRS examination
      measures the modifications in brain blood flow during the listening of human voice sound and
      environmental sound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One or two among a thousand new-born will require hearing device or cochlear implantation
      before the age of 4 years to correct a hearing loss. Without any appropriate hearing
      stimulation, some brain area, including temporal voice area (TVA), will remodel. But this
      remodeling process is a deleterious phenomenon in case of future cochlear implantation.
      Therefore it seems to be crucial to better understand the impact of hearing loss on
      neurologic development of TVA in infant.

      Main aim and outcome:

      Main aim of the research is to compare cortical activation in the TVA at 24 months of age
      (+/- 1 month), by means of the measure of hemoglobin and/or desoxyhemoglobin concentration in
      the TVA during listening of human voice sound compared to non-voice sound (environmental
      sounds) (fNIRS method):

        -  in normally hearing infants

        -  in profound congenital deaf infants who received a standard auditory device before the
           age of 10 months and who were implanted between 12 and 18 months of age.

      Comparison of the results in these two groups at 24 months +/- 1 month will allow to evaluate
      the impact of hearing loss and of its rehabilitation by means of standard hearing device and
      then by cochlear implant on neurologic development of the TVA in infant.

      Main outcome is the recording of a difference in the measure of hemoglobin and/or
      desoxyhemoglobin concentration during listening of human voice sounds compared to
      environmental sounds in the TVA, in both groups of infants at 24 months old (+/- 1 month). A
      difference in localization of activations in the &quot;deaf&quot; group would suggest a modification of
      the neuro-development of the TVA due to the hearing loss. On the contrary, a similar
      localization of activated areas would suggest a &quot;picking up&quot; of the neuro-development of TVA
      due to the correction of hearing loss by means of an auditory device.

      Secondary aims and outcomes

      Compare cortical activation in the TVA at 12 months of age (+/- 1 month) by means of the
      measure of hemoglobin and/or desoxyhemoglobin concentration in the TVA during listening of
      human voice sounds compared to environmental sounds:

        -  in normally hearing infants

        -  in profound congenital deaf infants who received a standard auditory device before the
           age of 10 months and who were implanted between 12 and 18 months of age.

      Secondary outcome is the recording of a difference in the measure of hemoglobin and / or
      desoxyhemoglobin concentration in the TVA during listening of human voice sounds compared to
      environmental sounds in both groups of infants at 12 months of age (+/- 1 month).

      Comparison of the results in these two groups at 12 months +/- 1 month will allow to evaluate
      the impact of hearing loss and of its rehabilitation by means of standard hearing device and
      then by cochlear implant on neurologic development of the TVA in infant.

      Comparison of results obtained at 12 months (+/- 1 month) and 24 months (+/- 1 month) of age
      in both groups will allow the study of neurological development of TVA in normally hearing
      infants and in deaf infants wearing an auditory device for a period of one year.

      Study association between development of oral communication, measured by means of
      questionnaire of evaluation of communication development and of comprehension of oral
      language in infant, and activation of TVA at 24 months of age by means of fNIRS.

    <description>fNIRS is a non-invasive imaging method involving the quantification of chromophore concentration resolved from the measurement of near infrared (NIR) light attenuation, temporal or phasic changes. NIR spectrum light takes advantage of the optical window in which skin, tissue, and bone are mostly transparent to NIR light in the spectrum of 700-900 nm, while hemoglobin (Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) are stronger absorbers of light. Differences in the absorption spectra of deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb allow the measurement of relative changes in hemoglobin concentration through the use of light attenuation at multiple wavelengths.</description>
