      To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the safety for the treatments on malignant melanoma
      by combining semiantigen dinitrophenyl (DNP) in situ immunotherapy and laser therapy, and
      carry out monitoring on related immunological parameters of the patients.

      72 patients with stage III (b or c) or stage IV skin (which could not be excised by
      operations) malignant melanoma were treated by combining simple semiantigen DNP in situ
      immunotherapy and laser therapy respectively. The changes in peripheral blood CD4+CD25+Treg
      regulatory T cells (Treg), CD8+T, CD4+ T effector cells, IL-10, TGF-β and other inhibitory
      cytokines of the patients were detected, the changes in anti-DNP IgG antibody titer was
      monitored, the relationship between delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and survival was
      observed, and results of clinical follow-ups were also examined.

    <description>diluted dinitrophenyl(DNP) Vaseline (which equaled to 2% DNP 0.1ml) was started to be directly spread on the surfaces of primary or metastatic tumors of malignant melanoma patients since the first day of every circle of chemotherapy, simultaneously laser irradiation was carried out for 10 min, the power density of laser irradiation was 1W/cm2. The tumors were wrapped and blocked for two days to induce contact dermatitis. If lymph nodes had been cleared, sensibilization of 2×2cm was performed at occipital region. It was repeated once a week.</description>
