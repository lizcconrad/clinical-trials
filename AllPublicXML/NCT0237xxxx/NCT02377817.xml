    <textblock>
      Back and right-sided sleeping position in pregnant women has recently emerged as a potential
      risk factor for low birthweight (LBW) and stillbirth (SB) in the medical literature. Assuming
      that sleep position in pregnant women is modifiable, the same literature has indicated that
      this risk factor is modifiable; however, there is no evidence that this risk factor is truly
      modifiable.

      The proposed link between back and right-sided sleeping position in a pregnant woman and LBW
      and SB of her baby is multifactorial; however, it ultimately implicates the woman's body
      position in causing compression of one of the large veins that brings blood back to her
      heart. This compression, along with other factors relating to the woman, her placenta, and
      her developing fetus, may result in decreased blood flow (nutrition and oxygen) to her
      developing baby, which, depending on the extent and duration, could result in LBW or SB of
      her baby. If the back sleeping position during pregnancy has a causative role in LBW and
      subsequently SB, the literature indicates that up to 17% of LBW and consequently 26% of SB
      could potentially be prevented by changing position to avoid back sleep. Note that 20 million
      LBW and 2.6 million SB occur each year worldwide.

      Positional therapy (PT) is a safe and effective intervention for preventing people who snore
      or people who's breathing pauses during sleep from sleeping on their back - a position that
      makes their condition worse. The most basic form of PT modifies a person's sleeping position
      by either:

        -  Preventing them from sleeping on their back through restricting their movement, or

        -  Rather than restricting movement, significantly reducing the amount of time they spend
           sleeping on their back by applying pressure points to their body while they are on their
           back, which eventually causes them to shift into a different position and avoid lying on
           their back.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a PT intervention to modify the
      position of pregnant women from their back and right side to their left side while they sleep
      in late pregnancy.

      This study will help determine whether this potential risk factor is modifiable by way of a
      PT intervention, and whether it is feasible to intervene to reduce or prevent back and
      right-sided position sleep in late pregnancy. Demonstrating that the sleeping position of
      pregnant women can be modified through use of a simple, inexpensive PT intervention may be
      one of the keys to achieving significant reductions in LBW and late SB rates in Canada and
      worldwide.

      The utility of the PrenaBelt in modifying maternal sleeping position and the effect of the
      PrenaBelt on maternal respiratory and cardiovascular parameters during sleep and sleep
      staging in the third trimester of pregnancy will be evaluated via a two-night, randomized,
      cross-over, sham-controlled, triple-blind, sleep study in third trimester pregnant women.

      Two nights: one night with a positional therapy (PT) device and one night with sham-PT device
      to determine treatment effect on outcomes.

      Randomized: participants will be randomized to treatment order: sham-PT on first night, then
      PT on second night, or vice versa. This will avoid the potential impact of changes to sleep
      across the two nights resulting from familiarization with the equipment, which could bias the
      results.

      Cross-over: on the second night, each participant will be crossed over from PT to sham-PT (or
      vice versa, depending on randomization order) to allow each participant to act as her own
      control for comparison of treatment effect on outcomes.

      Sham-controlled: a sham-PT device that has the same fit and form of the PT device but without
      the ability of function (pressure points) will be used as a control. The purpose of a sham-PT
      device is to identify any specific benefit of one element of a PT device (e.g., fit or form)
      above and beyond all benefits that might be attributed to everything else about that device
      (e.g., function). Note that there is no established effective therapy for the population for
      the indication under study.

      Triple blind: participants, sleep technologists monitoring and scoring the sleep tests, and
      the specialized sleep physician reviewing and reporting the sleep test results will be
      blinded to the intervention received each night.

      Laboratory: conducting this study in a controlled lab setting will allow for continual, real
      time monitoring of various cardiovascular, respiratory, and sleep parameters of each
      participant by the sleep technologist. This contributes to a more controlled and safer study
      overall.

      Sleep test: body position, various cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, and sleep
      parameters will be continuously recorded while the participants are sleeping. Sleep lab
      procedures will be followed by the personnel conducting, scoring, reviewing, and reporting
      the sleep tests from participant preparation through discharge

    <intervention_name>PrenaBelt</intervention_name>
    <description>The PrenaBelt is a belt-like, positional therapy (PT) device designed specifically for pregnant women. While the PrenaBelt does not prevent the user from lying on her back or right side during sleep, it is expected to significantly decrease the amount of time she spends in these two positions via the mechanism of PT. PT is a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive, long-established, safe, and effective intervention for preventing people with positional-dependent snoring or obstructive sleep apnea from sleeping on their back - a position that exacerbates their condition.
The PrenaBelt is worn at the level of the waist. By virtue of its design and position on the user's body, the PrenaBelt affects subtle pressure points on the back and right side of the user when she lies on her back or right side, respectively, activating her body's natural mechanism to spontaneously reposition itself to relieve discomfort, thereby reducing the amount of time she remains on her back or right side.</description>
