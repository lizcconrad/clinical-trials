      To evaluate epidemiological features of risk factors for aortic dissection (AD) in Chinese
      XinJiang Province patients.

    <textblock>
      The epidemiological features of risk factors for aortic dissection (AD) in China were
      obtained from developed population in east of China, however, such information was not
      available for the remote population. Moreover, people in the western region have significant
      difference with developed population in lifestyle, diet, ethnic and so on. Therefore, the aim
      of our study was to evaluate epidemiological features of risk factors for AD in Chinese
      remote patients. We anticipated that this analysis would provide helpful information
      preventing and controlling AD in Chinese XinJiang Province.

    <description>Diagnosis of aortic dissection was based on history and physical examination, and confirmed by imaging, visualization at surgery, and/or postmortem examination. Simple aortic aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm were excluded. Simple aortic aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm were excluded. Surgical and endovascular treatments were the main interventions and performed in the case group.</description>

        Between March, 2015 and March, 2016, we aim to collect 100 patients with AD as the case
        group. As the control group, 100 patients without AD were obtained from the hospitalized
        patients in the same period.
