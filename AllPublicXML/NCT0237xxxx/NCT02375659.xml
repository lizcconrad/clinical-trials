  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Across the U.S. Skin of Color (SOC) clinics have been established with the goal of providing
      medical care and supporting research related to patients with skin of color. There have been
      no formal studies evaluating why patients seek medical care at SOC clinics or treatment
      outcomes. Reasons may include past experiences with other providers, the perception that
      providers working in these clinics have a special interest or knowledge in caring for
      patients with skin of color and thus may provide better care, the expectation of cultural
      sensitivity, the hope that their provider may have a similar ethnic background, and/or ease
      of communication with their provider. Through focus group discussions we aim to identify the
      factors influencing a patient's choice to seek medical care at a SOC clinic and to gain
      insight into the presence and impact of racial concordance between provider and patient. The
      current study will focus on self-identified African American patients with interest in
      conducting similar sessions with patients of other ethnicities and races in the future.

    <description>Audiotapes of focus group discussions will be transcribed, and the transcripts will be analyzed via a 'long-hand' inductive approach by two dermatologists and one psychologist. For each of the 8 posed focus group questions, the reviewers will independently induce a common thematic response. Collectively, they will then compare their independently derived themes, identifying themes of agreement and disagreement. Areas of disagreement will be further reviewed until a mutually agreed upon final set of themes is identified. The raw data corresponding to the item in question will be classified according to its theme.</description>

    <description>Each focus group (4 total) will be approximately 90 minutes in duration. A trained facilitator will pose 8 scripted questions to the focus group participants and manage the conversation, ensuring all participants have an opportunity to respond and steering the conversation to remain on task. A note-taker will also be present at the focus group to document via handwritten notes the flow and content of the focus group conversation. All focus groups will be audio taped and transcribed.</description>
