  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and the effect of food on
      KQ-791. Each participant may receive up to 3 single doses of KQ-791 (at up to 3 different
      dose levels) and 1 placebo dose over the course of the study. Up to 6 escalating dose levels
      may be studied, in two distinct groups or cohorts.
