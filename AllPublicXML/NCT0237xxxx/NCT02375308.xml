      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of an Hypnotherapeutic Treatment of
      Depression to Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Depression in patients with mild to moderate
      Major Depressive Episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be an effective psychological treatment
      of mild to moderate Major Depressive Episodes. Effective treatments, however, show a
      reduction of depressive symptoms only up to 50 % (Luty et al., 2007) which is one reason for
      the modification of the well-established CBT in the last years. Following the 'third wave'
      approaches of CBT, e.g. Emotion-Focussed Therapy or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy,
      techniques like meditation or the use of systemic or Gestalt techniques within CBT has been
      applied. Within this context, Hypnotherapy-based strategies can also show an improvement of
      the current state of the art in depression psychotherapy. However, only few studies conducted
      randomised controlled trials to study the efficacy of hypnosis for depression as e.g. the
      comparison of cognitive hypnotherapy to CBT-alone (e.g. Alladin and Alibhai, 2007). With the
      present study, the efficacy of the Hypnotherapeutic Treatment of Depression (HDT) will be
      compared to the CBT-based Activation-focussed Cognitive Treatment of Depression (ACDT). Both
      treatments are individually administered and includes 20 sessions. We expect HDT not being
      inferior to ACDT in the reduction of depressive symptoms after six months of treatment.
