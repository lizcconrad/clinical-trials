  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, single-center, small sample size, randomised, parallel-group, controlled
      study, the investigators aim to assess efficacy and safety of addition of nimotuzumab to CS
      chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Sixty-two
      patients are required and randomly assigned (1:1) to each group.

      The control regimen (CS chemotherapy) is recommended as the standard first-line regimen for
      advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction in japan.
