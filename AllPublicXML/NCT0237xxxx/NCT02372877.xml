  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the AMICUS Red Blood Cell
      Exchange (RBCx) System (Exchange and Depletion/Exchange procedures) in patients with sickle
      cell disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Red Blood Cell Exchange is to remove a patient's red blood cells (RBCs) and
      replace the blood volume removed with either healthy donor RBCs and/or colloid/crystalloid
      solutions. Depending on the RF used, the procedure can be considered an RBC Exchange or RBC
      Depletion/Exchange procedure. The RBC Depletion/Exchange procedure is a modification of the
      RBC Exchange procedure. The AMICUS RBCx protocol provides the ability to use various RFs
      including healthy donor RBCs or a combination of fluids, such as saline followed by RBCs. In
      RBC Exchange and the exchange portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures, RBC units are
      used as the RF, while colloid and/or crystalloid solutions are used as the RF in the
      depletion portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures. A new operating protocol on the
      AMICUS Separator that enables the device to perform Red Blood Cell Exchange (RBCx) procedures
      in accordance with the replacement fluid(s) (RF) prescribed by a physician for patients with
      sickle cell disease

    <time_frame>Actual FCR will be assessed by taking a pre-procedure sample from the patient on the day of the procedure and a post-procedure sample approximately 10-15 min after procedure completion.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will evaluate the mean ratio of the Actual FCR (FCRa) to Target FCR (FCRt) as measured by the patient's Hb S pre-procedure and post-procedure. The predefined mean ratio of the FCRa to FCRt is 0.75 to 1.25.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with documented diagnosis of a type of sickle cell disorder who require RBC
             Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange treatment.

          -  Medically stable subjects who have been previously treated for sickle cell disease
             with RBC Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange.

          -  Subjects, or subject's legal representative, who have provided signed informed
             consent, and assent when applicable, prior to participation.

             group, Rhesus factor D (Rh (D)) compatible, unexpired replacement RBC products.

          -  Subjects with sufficient vascular access to accommodate the RBCx procedure as
             determined by the medical staff responsible for obtaining intravenous access.
