  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The share of young workers falling into early work disability is an increasingly important
      problem in Norway. Early withdrawal or exclusion from the labor market leads to large
      individual and societal costs. The SEED-trial is a randomized controlled trial aiming to
      provide evidence-based knowledge about different approaches to prevent permanent disability
      and increase labor market participation in this important and vulnerable group. The trial
      includes young adults aged 18-30 years who are at risk of early work disability, and the
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions, both aimed at facilitating
      participation in working life:

        1. Traditional Vocational Rehabilitation (TVR), offering training and preparation for the
           labor market in a sheltered environment

        2. Supported Employment (SE), focusing on competitive employment in real-life settings
           without long-lasting preceding training

      Both interventions are currently provided by The Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration
      (NAV). Supported Employment was introduced recently and is currently being implemented, while
      traditional vocational rehabilitation with sheltered employment has been around for years.
      However, no Norwegian controlled studies have been conducted on these practices in this
      population. The current study will therefore provide new knowledge of the effect of
      traditional as well as new and promising interventions to increase labor market participation
      and prevent early disability.
