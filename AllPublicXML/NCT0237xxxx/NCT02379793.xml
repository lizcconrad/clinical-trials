          3. Aged 20 to 40 years inclusive.

          4. Subjects without signs of skin irritation/disease/disorders/symptoms or blemishes on
             test sites (e.g. erythema, dryness, roughness, scaling, scars, moles, sunburn).

          5. Subjects without a significant abnormality, as judged by the (sub)investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Body Mass Index outside the range 18-25 kg/mÂ²

          2. History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          3. History of allergic reaction to any medications.

          4. Any disease that could in any way confound assessment of the test sites.

          5. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any component of LEO 80185 gel.

          6. Known or suspected hepatic, renal or cardiac disorders.

          7. Known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcaemia or
             albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference range from the sample taken during
             screening.

          8. Subjects suspected of infection based on the infection testing results from the sample
             taken during screening (Hepatitis B surface antigen, HCV antibody, HIV
             antigen/antibody, serological test for syphilis).

          9. Use of systemic, locally injected or inhaled corticosteroids within 4 weeks of Day 1.

         10. Use of vitamin D or calcium supplements, or systemic vitamin D analogues within 4
             weeks of Day 1.

         11. Use of any medication (systemic or topical) within 2 weeks of Day 1.

         12. Subjects who have received treatment with any non-marketed drug substance (i.e. an
             agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration)
             within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of Day 1, whichever is longest.

         13. Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial.

         14. Previously enrolled in this clinical trial.

         15. Previous or current photo-induced or photo-aggravated disease (e.g. abnormal response
             to sunlight).

         16. Exposure to excessive or chronic ultraviolet radiation (e.g. sunlight, sun lamps,
             tanning booths or photo-therapy) within 4 weeks of Day 1.
