  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to see how safe the use of short-term fasting is in breast cancer patients who
      will receive chemotherapy before undergoing surgery and to examine if the use of short-term
      fasting will decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and how much a tumor shrinks while
      receiving chemotherapy.

      Patients will fast 24 hours before and 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy
      which will consist of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks for four cycles
      followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks for four cycles (dose-dense AC + T) or docetaxel (T)
      every 3 weeks for four cycles. Trastuzumab (H) and Pertuzumab (P) will be given concurrently
      with docetaxel for a total of 4 cycles before surgery. For patients who do not achieve
      pathological complete remission (pCR), adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin (A) plus
      cyclophosphamide (C) every 3 weeks for four cycles will be given, followed by trastuzumab
      every 3 weeks to complete 1 year of treatment. For patients with pCR, only trastuzumab every
      3 weeks will be given adjuvantly to complete 1 year of treatment (TPH + AC).

            <description>Will receive docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab every three weeks for four cycles (one cycle is defined as 21 days). An injection of pegfilgrastim will be administered after chemotherapy with docetaxel. The appropriate surgery will be done three to six weeks after completing the last cycle of docatexel. If the study doctor determines that additional chemotherapy is needed (based on tumor shrinkage), patients will receive both doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every three weeks for four cycles and after the fourth cycle you will receive trastuzumab every three weeks for one year or patients will receive trastuzumab alone every three weeks for up to one year</description>
