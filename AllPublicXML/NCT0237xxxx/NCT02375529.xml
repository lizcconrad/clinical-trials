    <textblock>
      Background: Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is increasingly being used as
      a minimally invasive surgery with potential benefits over 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      (LC) in terms of postoperative pain and faster recovery.

      Methods: Seventy-three patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis were randomized to SILC
      (n=37) or LC (n=36). Data measures included operative details, adverse events, postoperative
      pain and analgesic requirements, success of the ambulatory process, return to normal activity
      and return to work, cosmetic results and quality of life score.

    <description>Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (SILC): The umbilicus is grasped and a 2 cm vertical skin and fascial incision is performed. A multiport (TriPort®) is inserted under direct vision. Principles of cholecystectomy are the same as traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</description>

    <description>Four Ports Conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (4PCL): A 10mm supraumbilical incision is made and the pneumoperitoneum insufflated through a Veress needle. 4 ports are introduced: 2 of 10mm in supraumbilical and left flank and 2 of 5mm in epigastric and right flank.</description>

    <description>A 2.5-cm incision is made through the everted umbilicus down to the midline fascia, and through the fascia and the peritoneum. The multichannel port (Olympus) is introduced. Carbon dioxide is insufflated (12 mmHg) and a 30 degree 10-mm laparoscope is introduced. The operating table is put in the reverse Trendelenburg position (20 degrees), left side down. A pre-curved grasper and the monopolar electrocautery are introduced through the other 2 ports of the trocar and the dissection of the gallbladder starts in a retrograde manner. The triangle of Calot is exposed, the cystic duct and artery are separately dissected and ligated with 5 mm clips. The monopolar electrocautery is used to remove the gallbladder from the liver bed. The gallbladder is removed along with the port system from the abdominal cavity. The fascia at the port site is closed and the umbilicus is inverted.</description>

    <description>An 11-mm periumbilical port, a 10-mm left upper quadrant port , 5mm subxyphoid port, and 5-mm right lower quadrant port were used in 4-port LC. We adopted the single surgeon technique in the 4-port LC using 30-degree operating telescopes that was inserted into the umbilical port. Retraction of the gallbladder was done by the long grasping forceps through the 5-mm right lower quadrant port, whereas dissection was accomplished through the 10-mm left upper quadrant port. The cystic duct and cystic artery were clipped by a 5-mm multiple clip applicator. The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical port after the position of the operating telescope was changed.
Nontransparent surgical adhesive tape was applied to the standard 4-port sites at the end of the operation .</description>
