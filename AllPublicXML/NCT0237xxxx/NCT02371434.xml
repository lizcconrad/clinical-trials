      The aim of this trial is to collect evidence of the safety of administering autologous
      CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) to living-donor renal transplant
      recipients. In addition, the study will determine whether post-transplant nTregs infusion
      allows a tapering of conventional maintenance immunosuppression within 60 weeks after
      transplantation.

      The ONE Study aims to explore the feasibility, safety and efficacy of regulatory cell
      therapies as adjunct immunosuppressive treatments in the context of living-donor renal
      transplantation.The clinical trial presented here (ONEnTreg13) will test autologous,
      polyclonally expanded CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ nTregs as a somatic cell-based medicinal product.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether administration of nTregs to recipients of
      living-donor kidney transplants is safe and able to polarize the immunological response of
      the recipient away from graft rejection and towards graft acceptance, allowing a reduction in
      the doses of pharmacological maintenance immunosuppression.

             transplantation conference, registered by ET (Euro Transplant) and having a positive
             vote from the living donor ethic commission (Lebendspendekommission) at the Berlin
