      The PREACT Registry aims to see whether data from Pharmacogenomic Testing (PGx) can help
      healthcare providers manage patient medication regimens and assess if the testing has an
      effect on reducing medication side effects, hospitalizations and emergency department visits.

      The way an individual processes a drug is in part determined by their genes, and there is
      known to be genetic variation between humans in the way drugs are metabolized. The study of
      the way genes affect a person's response to drugs is known as &quot;Pharmacogenomics.&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pharmacogenomic testing has been performed within 12-months prior to eligibility
             assessment for genes known to influence metabolism of at least one target drug

          -  Subject is 2 years of age or older

          -  Subject is not taking an investigational medication or in a clinical trial that would
             interfere with participation in the registry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90-day period
             preceding the receipt of pharmacogenomic test results

          -  Subject (or subject's parent/guardian) is unable to provide an accurate history due to
             mental incapacity, in the Investigator's opinion.
