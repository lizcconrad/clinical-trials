  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapy for early colorectal cancer is radical Total Mesorectal Excision (TME).
      Colorectal surgical resections are accompanied with high morbidity of up to 33% and 90 days
      mortality of up to 9% in the fragile elderly patients as is seen in the results of the Dutch
      Surgical Colorectal Audit (DSCA) of 2013. Additionally, rectal cancer surgery is associated
      with substantial loss of health related quality of life due to defecation disorders,
      incontinence, sexual dysfunction and stoma related morbidity. These disadvantages are
      acceptable when radical surgery is the only option for cure. Advances in technology enabled
      the development of local excision of early rectal cancer with precise endoluminal
      microsurgery or local endoscopic excision resulting in a significant decrease in short- and
      long term morbidity. However current evidence is of inadequate quality to conclude on the
      oncologic safety of local treatment for early rectal cancer. Imaging can predict outcome and
      tailors treatment in more advanced cancer but fails in early cancer. Pathological assessment
      of the excised tumor tissue provides the optimal information on tumor stage, tumor
      characteristics and tumor differentiation, thereby it enables to predict the risk of
      recurrence after local treatment alone. For early rectal cancers, with a low risk on
      recurrence based on favourable tumor characteristics local excision is seen as safe and these
      patients do not require an additional treatment. However, for patients with early rectal
      cancer with a higher risk on recurrence based on tumor characteristics there is no consensus
      on the additional treatment after local excision. According to the National guideline these
      patients receive a TME procedure. However, for this subgroup of patients local treatment
      followed by chemoradiotherapy might also be oncological safe. Current evidence is of
      inadequate quality to be conclusive. For this subgroup of patients with early rectal cancer
      with high risk tumorcharacteristics the TESAR trial is designed, in which patiens will be
      randomised after local endoluminal excision between an additional TME-procedure (standard)
      and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Primary endpoint of the study will be local recurrence at 3
      three year follow-up.
