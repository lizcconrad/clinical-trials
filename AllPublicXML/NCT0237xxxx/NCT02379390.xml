      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority in term of radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) of
      cabazitaxel versus either enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone in patients with
      metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) who have disease progression while
      receiving AR targeted therapy (abiraterone plus prednisone or enzalutamide) within 12 months
      of treatment initiation (≤12 months).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To compare efficacy for:

        -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and Time to PSA progression (TTPP).

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Tumor response rate and duration of tumor response.

        -  Pain response and time to pain progression.

        -  Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.

        -  To analyze messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) including androgen-receptor splice
           variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) as a biomarker in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).

        -  To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.

      The duration of the study per patient will be approximately 2 years. Each patient will be
      treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal
      of further study treatment, and each patient will be followed after completion of study
      treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of patient consent.
