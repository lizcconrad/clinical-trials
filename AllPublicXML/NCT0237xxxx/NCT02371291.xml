  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our collection of memories for personal experiences plays an important role in shaping our
      sense of who we are as people. These memories, termed autobiographical memories, can also be
      helpful in social situations, for sharing the details of our experiences with other people,
      reminiscing about pleasant times and solving problems by remembering what has and hasn't
      worked in the past. Different types of autobiographical memory are helpful to us depending on
      the particular situation the investigators are in at the time. Recent research has shown that
      experiencing depressed mood can affect how we relate to our autobiographical memories, so
      that instead of providing a rich source of personal information in a helpful and flexible
      way, the types of memories that come to mind are more narrowly focused on difficult or
      negative experiences. This can cause low mood to persist over time.

      The purpose of this study is to test a newly-developed therapeutic training package for
      depressed mood (MemFlex), designed to encourage helpful and flexible ways of relating to
      autobiographical memories. The MemFlex programme consists of a one-to-one orientation session
      with the researcher to introduce the training package, followed by a workbook that is
      completed at home.

    <description>The MemFlex programme draws on cognitive bias modification and memory specificity training techniques (Raes et al., 2009; Dalgleish et al., 2014), and was developed by clinical psychologists. MemFlex is primarily self-guided and aims to reduce autobiographical memory biases associated with depression. The training material is presented over one face-to-face session and eight self-guided sessions. In the initial session, the researcher introduces cued-recall tasks which are used throughout the workbook, and guides the participant in completion of these tasks. When understanding of the basic principles is satisfactory, the researcher assists the participant to set a schedule for completion of the workbook over the following four weeks. The participant will receive weekly emails during this period, encouraging them to complete the workbook. They will also receive a phone call from a team member at the beginning of week three to check progress.</description>

    <description>The psychoeducation condition will also complete an initial face-to-face session. This session will cover the symptoms and causes of depression, and the workbook will be introduced. As in the MemFlex condition, the workbook will consist of eight self-guided sessions that the individual will be required to complete over four weeks. The participant will receive weekly emails during this period, encouraging them to complete the workbook. They will also receive a phone call from a team member at the beginning of week three to check progress, and clarify any difficulties with the workbook material. The workbook content will cover the presentation of depression and basic information on factors associated with depression, such as worry, procrastination, and sleep difficulties. Each session consists of information on psychological theories of the topic, followed by a series of questions about the material to ensure participant engagement. The workbook was developed by clinical psychologists.</description>
