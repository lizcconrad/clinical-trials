      Dr. Parker (the &quot;Investigator&quot;) and Semmes Murphey Foundation (&quot;Foundation&quot;) are conducting a
      study of outcomes and safety associated with degenerative discs at Semmes-Murphey Clinic,
      P.C. (&quot;Semmes-Murphey&quot;). This study will look at a product that is derived from human tissue,
      that will be injected into the affected disc. With this study, the investigators hope to find
      a safe and effective way to treat degenerative disc disease.

      Dr. Parker (the &quot;Investigator&quot;) and Semmes Murphey Foundation (&quot;Foundation&quot;) are conducting a
      study of outcomes and safety associated with degenerative discs at Semmes-Murphey Clinic,
      P.C. (&quot;Semmes-Murphey&quot;). This study will look at a product that is derived from human tissue,
      that will be injected into the affected disc. With this study, we hope to find a safe and
      effective way to treat degenerative disc disease.

      This study will compare injectable placental tissue extract called BioDGenesis (&quot;Active
      Product&quot;) to injectable Normal Saline (&quot;Placebo&quot;). The Active Product is supplied by BioD,
      LLC (&quot;BioD&quot;). You have a 50 percent chance of receiving the Placebo

      The study will last for 52 weeks. After all patients have been enrolled in the study and have
      completed 26 weeks, the Investigator will conduct a safety and efficacy analysis. If the
      investigator determines that the Active Product is more effective than Placebo in treating
      degenerative disc disease and there are no safety concerns with the Active Product, patients
      who received Placebo will have the option of receiving the Active Product through week 52.
