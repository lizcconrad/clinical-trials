  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will pilot and test a new online communication tool, Loop, developed within a
      research framework with participatory and user-centred design. This pilot trial focuses on
      advanced cancer as an example of complex care. Cancer care involves many healthcare
      providers, spanning hospital to home. There is no organized way for them to communicate. Loop
      is a practical tool for ongoing collaboration in the patient's actual team of care that
      engages patients. The study will answer the questions: does Loop improve communication
      efficiency, engage patients and family physicians, and show early benefits in quality and
      health care costs?

    <description>The randomization is at the level of attending healthcare professional who identifies patients for recruitment. For each participant in the intervention arm, a secure space (called a Patient Loop) is created in the online clinical communication system. A Patient Loop can be accessed by the patient, their caregiver, and the healthcare providers who have permission to do so through an algorithm of invitation, authentication and careful partitioning. In each Patient Loop, team members can post messages that can be read and responded to by the entire team. Each Patient Loop consists of a patient, their caregiver and at least two healthcare professionals.</description>

    <description>Loop is a secure online communication system centered on the patient that assembles the patient's actual healthcare team for ongoing collaborative care. The patient and caregiver are integral members of the team. Loop is cross-organizational, cross-setting and interprofessional. It is for ongoing, interactive, contextual, team-based communication. Loop is explicitly for asynchronous communication, not instant messaging. The stream of messages is stored and can be sorted for ease of viewing. The tool was developed with user-centred design and requires no prior training.</description>
