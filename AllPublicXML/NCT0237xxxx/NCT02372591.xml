  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is very common in persons with a history of addiction, but few studies have examined the
      best treatment of pain in this population. This is a study to determine the pain relief
      provided by intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) or buprenorphine given to persons maintained
      on stable doses of methadone or buprenorphine who have chronic musculoskeletal pain.
      Experimental sessions will require overnight stays on a residential research unit. In these
      sessions, persons will be exposed to standard experimental pain techniques at baseline and
      then rate the relief (if any) provided by the study medication when exposed to the same
      techniques. Persons will be asked to participate in 3 sessions, each separated by at least 7
      days.

    <description>The participant places a hand up to the wrist in a circulating water bath maintained at approximately 4 degrees Celsius (up to 5 minutes). The time at which pain develops is the threshold. The time a volunteer's hand remains underwater before pain is unbearable is tolerance.</description>
