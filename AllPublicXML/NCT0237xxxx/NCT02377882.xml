    <textblock>
      The investigators tried to explore an alternative non-depolarizing muscle relaxant
      (rocuronium) and its optimal dosage to replace succinylcholine for IONM during thyroid
      surgery.Time frame of outcome measure was during 30 to 70min after rocuronium injection.
      Specific time points at which the will be assessed and for EMG signals will be presented.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy is the most common and serious complication after
      thyroid surgery, and ranks among the leading reasons for medicolegal litigation of surgeons.
      Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) are being applied to prevent RLN injury during thyroid
      surgery. IONM has been used as a means not only to localize and identify the RLN, but also to
      predict cord function and elucidate the surgical pitfalls during preparation of RLN.

      Muscle relaxant is necessary for general anesthesia; it can facilitate tracheal intubation
      and stable conditions for surgery. However, the use of muscle relaxant might diminish the EMG
      response during IONM and interfere with the interpretation of IONM results. Eighty patients
      were randomized to receive one (group 1, n=40) or two (group 2, n=40) effective dose (ED95)
      of rocuronium to facilitate EMG endotracheal tube insertion. Evoked potentials were obtained
      per 5 minutes by stimulating vagus nerve from the time point of 30 to 70 minutes after
      administration of rocuronium. The magnitude of evoked potential at each time point and
      tracheal intubating condition were compared between groups. Accelerometry [twitch (% TW)] was
      used to monitor the quantitative degree of neuromuscular transmission. The aim of this study
      was to explore an alternative non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (Rocuronium) and its optimal
      dosage to replace succinylcholine for IONM. The ED95 of rocuronium is 0.3mg/kg and 2×ED95 is
      generally recommended as a standard intubation dosage.

    <description>V1 signal means an EMG signals obtained from the vagus nerve before identification of RLN.
V2 signal—The final testing of the vagus nerve EMG signals was performed after complete hemostasis of the operative field.
The amplitude (μV) of V1 and V2 signals and the correlated degree of neuromuscular transmission (% TW) were recorded and analyzed.</description>
