    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the efficacy of two stress management
      interventions in reducing blood pressure (BP) in patients who have prehypertension (BP
      between 120/80 and 139/89). It is expected that participants will be better able to control
      their BP through reducing stress and increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors.

    <measure>Change in 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring with the Oscar 2 oscillometric blood pressure monitor. The Oscar will be programmed to take three blood pressure measurements per hour from 6 AM till 11 PM and two BP measurements per hour from 11 PM to 6 AM. During each reading, participants will be instructed to drop their arms to their sides as soon as they sense the cuff inflating, and to keep it relaxed and still until a few seconds after the deflation has finished. Ambulatory SBP and DBP will be derived by computing the mean of all valid readings obtained during waking hours and nighttime sleep.</description>
