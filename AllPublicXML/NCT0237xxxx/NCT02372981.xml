  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel minimally invasive techniques were established for prolapsing haemorrhoids to minimise
      the drawbacks of the golden standard of haemorrhoidal treatment, conventional
      haemorrhoidectomy techniques. Ligation techniques, such as Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal
      artery ligation (DG-HAL), were introduced to reduce the arterial inflow of the AVP and thus
      prevent the haemorrhoidal zone from being part of the continence system. Apart from
      inappropriate application of this surgical alternative for higher grade haemorrhoids, high
      recurrence rates of up to 38% after DG-HAL are due to technical failure of the ligation
      technique itself. This is a prospective randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy
      of additional Doppler-guided ligation of submucosal haemorrhoidal arteries in patients with
      symptomatic grade III haemorrhoids.

      All consecutive patients with symptomatic grade III haemorrhoids are randomly allocated to
      one of the two study arms: (A) DG-HAL with mucopexy or (B) mucopexy alone. Endpoints are
      pain, faecal incontinence, bleeding, residual prolapse and vascularisation of the anorectal
      vascular plexus. Vascularisation of the anorectal vascular plexus is assessed by
      transperineal contrast enhanced ultrasound.

    <description>Mucopexy with DG-HAL is performed using a specific device consisting of a proctoscope equipped with a Doppler probe and a light source. The proctoscope model in our study has a sliding part comprising the operating window and Doppler probe for better proximal and distal movement without repositioning the proctoscope during mucopexy.</description>
