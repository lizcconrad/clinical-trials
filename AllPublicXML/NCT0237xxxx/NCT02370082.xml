  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the SAVI SCOUT® Surgical Guidance
      System (SAVI SCOUT). The SAVI SCOUT is a medical device, used to provide real-time guidance
      during localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy procedures, by helping the surgeon locate
      and remove the desired tissue (i.e., the lesion and surrounding normal tissue). The SAVI
      SCOUT has been 510K cleared.

      The SAVI SCOUT is intended to assist surgeons in the location and retrieval of a non-palpable
      abnormality as localized by radiographic or ultrasound methods. In this study, the ability of
      the SAVI SCOUT to guide surgeons to find a lesion will be evaluated instead of the standard
      technique of wire localization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using radiography or ultrasound guidance, the SAVI SCOUT reflector will be placed
      percutaneously up to 7 days prior to the scheduled excisional procedure. During surgical
      excision, the SAVI SCOUT system will be used to locate the reflector, which will be removed
      along with the surrounding breast tissue.

      Final data analysis will be completed within 1 month after the last patient is treated.

      Final assessment of the surgical results will be completed by the surgeon during a routine
      follow-up visit within 1 month following the surgical excision or lumpectomy procedure.

      Main Objective: to show that the SAVI SCOUT technique can be used to safely and effectively
      locate a non-palpable breast lesion during a localized excisional biopsy or lumpectomy
      procedure.

      Up to 10 sites and 150 patients will be enrolled.
