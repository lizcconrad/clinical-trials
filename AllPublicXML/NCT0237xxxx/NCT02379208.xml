      The purpose of this study is to evaluate rate of progression in newly diagnosed open angle
      glaucoma with different types of perimetry. Would it be possible to find the rapidly
      progressing individuals sooner by doing perimetry more often? Is there a difference between
      different types of perimetry in early glaucoma? What would be the optimal timing of perimetry
      in newly diagnosed glaucoma? In addition the quality of life in glaucoma patients will be
      evaluated with two types of questionnaires in three different time points. The enrolled
      patients will receive appropriate treatment according to glaucoma management guidelines.
