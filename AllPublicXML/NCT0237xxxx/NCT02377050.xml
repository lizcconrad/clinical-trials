      The primary hypothesis is that preterm infants who are less than or equal to 32 weeks
      gestation and weigh 1001-2500 grams at birth will have an increase in weight gain with a
      feeding goal of 180-200 ml/kg/day more than the commonly used feeding goal of 140-160
      ml/kg/day

      The proposed trial is designed to test the primary hypothesis that in preterm infants
      weighing 1001-2500 grams at birth and who are less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation,
      feeding goals of 180-200 ml/kg/day will increase weight gain (g/k/day) from time of
      enrollment to discharge home or 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA)(whichever comes first) more
      than the commonly used feeding goal volume of 140-160 ml/kg/day (usual feeding goal). This is
      a pilot study to determine the safety of increased volumes of feedings as opposed to
      fortification of feedings.
