    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well inter-disciplinary educational methods work in improving
      adherence to isolation protocols in patients with Clostridium (C.) difficile infections. An
      inter-disciplinary educational method may help to prevent the spread of infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To lower rates of C. difficile transmission through improved adherence to recommended
      isolation protocols.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Improve resident knowledge of infection control procedures and engagement in quality
      improvement initiatives.

      OUTLINE:

      Residents and nurses are given a short presentation on isolation protocols for diarrhea and
      enteric pathogens approved by Infection Control and covering their recommendations.

      After completion of study, residents and nurses complete post-tests to determine the
      effectiveness of the training every 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of C. difficile infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rates of infection before vs. after implementation of the intervention will be plotted by quarter and year over the entire study period, to examine possible time trends in the pre-intervention period. Rates during the post-intervention period will be compared to those in the pre-intervention period using logistic regression, adjusting for season of the year, age, race, and other potentially confounding factors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with an isolation order placed concurrently with the order for C. difficile</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion will be compared pre- vs. post-intervention using logistic regression, adjusting for potentially confounding factors such as season, age, and race. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to summarize the time from ordering C. difficile until the isolation order is placed, as well as the time from when the order was placed until it was acknowledged by the nurse, separately for pre- and post-intervention time periods. The curves will be compared between time periods using a logrank or Wilcoxon test allowing for the possibility of censored data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in scores post-test minus pre-test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in scores post-test minus pre-test will be calculated for each resident or nurse. The distribution of pre- and post-test scores and of the difference in scores will be summarized graphically and statistically using mean, median, standard deviation, and inter-quartile range. A paired t-test or non-parametric test such as the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to test whether there was an improvement in score from pre- to post-test. Analyses will be carried out separately for residents and nurses, as well as for residents and nurses combined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention of information</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For residents or nurses who retake the exam, test scores will be summarized graphically and statistically for pre- and post-test, at the original and repeat session. Retention will be gauged by comparing the test score of the re-test with the pre- and post-test scores from the original test, using contrasts in a randomized block analysis of variance model, or using pairwise signed rank tests on the differences in scores.</description>
