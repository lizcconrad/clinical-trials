  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have devised a simple method to continuously measure the endotracheal tube cuff pressure
      (CP) using an invasive pressure monitoring setup (IPMS), which is used routinely in the
      operating room to monitor arterial or central venous pressures. We have previously confirmed
      both in vitro and in vivo (previous IRB approved protocol), a clinically applicable agreement
      of the IPMS readings with the values obtained from a standard manometer (gold standard). In
      the current study, we will prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head
      position and CP in patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery and also measure the oxygen
      and nitrous oxide saturation in the oropharynx.
