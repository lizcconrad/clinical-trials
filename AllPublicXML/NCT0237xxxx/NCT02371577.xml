    <textblock>
      This is phase 2 study of the immunomodulatory drug, lenalidomide, to evaluate potential
      beneficial effects on the immune system of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      and CLL-associated immunodeficiency. 17 patients will be enrolled with CLL, small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (SLL), or monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), and measurable immune compromise,
      but not an iwCLL indication for CLL therapy (ie non-progressive disease).

      but not an iwCLL indication for CLL therapy (ie non-progressive disease). Lenalidomide will
      be administered orally for 21 days of each 28 day cycle, starting at a 2.5mg dose, with dose
      escalation each cycle to a maximum of 25mg in the absence of any grade 2 or higher
      hematologic or non-hematologic adverse events. Treatment duration to primary endpoint
      assessment is 6 cycles, though patients will not be restricted from continuing lenalidomide
      off-study, if clinically indicated
