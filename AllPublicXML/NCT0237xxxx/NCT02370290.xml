      This pilot research trial studies quantitative imaging metrics derived from contrast enhanced
      computed tomography (CECT) in enhancing assessment of disease status in patients with kidney
      cancer. Quantitative imaging is the extraction of quantifiable features from radiological
      images for the assessment of disease status. Collecting quantitative imaging metrics from
      CECT imaging may help doctors predict tumor aggressiveness and nuclear grade (tumor stage)
      and assess treatment response and prognosis in cancer imaging.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the role of quantitative imaging metrics (QIM) as a potential DIAGNOSTIC
      biomarker.

      II. To investigate if QIM parameters can differentiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
      from papillary RCC.

      III. To evaluate the tumor grade of the target lesion as assessed by QIM from CECT for
      agreement with the pathological (Fuhrman) grade.

      IV. To investigate the role of QIM as a potential PROGNOSTIC biomarker. V. To develop a novel
      method of calculating renal tumor contact surface area (CSA) using advanced image-processing
      technology (MATLABÂ®, 3 dimension [D] Synapse) and predict peri-operative variables such as
      blood loss, operative time and post-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in
      patients undergoing partial nephrectomy (PN).

      VI. To develop QIM that would help in predicting postoperative functional outcomes such as
      predicted surgically resected volume and postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' clinical and imaging data are collected from routine multiphase CECT imaging and
      used to establish and validate the classification/prediction rule for QIM.
