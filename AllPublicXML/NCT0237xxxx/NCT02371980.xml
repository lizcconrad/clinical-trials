  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine (5, 10, and 20 mg)
      versus placebo during the first 28 weeks of the 32-week double-blind treatment period in the
      prevention of relapse in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) who responded to
      acute treatment with vortioxetine 10 mg.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested for
      the prevention of relapse in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who respond to daily
      treatment with vortioxetine. This study will look at relapse rates of MDD in people who take
      vortioxetine.

      The study will enroll approximately 1100 participants. All participants will receive
      vortioxetine 10 mg open-label for the first 16 weeks of the study. Participants who meet the
      appropriate MDD response criteria from the Week 8 Visit through Week 16 Visit will be
      eligible for randomization into the double-blind treatment period. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 10 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 55 weeks. Participants will make 19 visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>The change between MADRS total score at each week assessed or final visit and MADRS score at baseline in the double-blind period. MADRS is a 10-item clinician rated scale to measure overall severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 6 (most abnormal) with a total score range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>
