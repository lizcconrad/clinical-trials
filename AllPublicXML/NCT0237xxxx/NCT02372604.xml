  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU), defined by the persistence of daily or almost daily
      urticaria over 6 weeks, affects 0.5% to 1% of the general population. In more than half of
      the cases, it lasts more than 2 years. It can dramatically alter the quality of life, in
      particular sleep, and generates numerous consultations and hospitalizations, with an average
      annual cost per patient close to 2000 euros in Europe. The treatment is based on the
      validated 2nd generation anti-H1 antihistamines dosage of one tablet per day whose
      effectiveness is satisfactory, however about half the time. In cases of severe CSU refractory
      to treatment with anti-H1 licensed dosage, few therapeutic alternatives exist, still
      off-label: the monketulast, an anti-leukotriene, ciclosporine or methotrexate, as
      immunosuppressants. Various studies have shown the important benefit of an expensive anti-IgE
      biological: the omaluzimab. Several open studies have also suggested superior efficacy and
      good tolerability of anti-H1 in higher dosage (double, triple or quadruple) including
      levocetirizine.

      The off-label use of these high dosages of anti-H1 is growing very rapidly in France, tending
      to replace the use of anti-H1 first generation or substitution to another 2nd generation
      anti-H1 recommended by the French Society of Dermatology.

      This study, under the aegis of the Urticaria Group of the French Society of Dermatology,
      intends to compare the efficacy of levocetirizine 4 tablets/day versus 1 tablet/day in the
      treatment of CSU resistant to anti-H1 licensed dosage.
