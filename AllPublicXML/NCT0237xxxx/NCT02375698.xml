    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled safety and immunogenicity
      study in adults who have recently been successfully treated for drug-susceptible pulmonary
      Tuberculosis (TB). The safety and immunogenicity profile of escalating doses of AERAS-456 in
      HIV-negative subjects recently treated for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB will be
      investigated. The study will be conducted at one or more sites in South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first evaluation of AERAS-456 in subjects who have completed a full
      course of treatment prescribed for pulmonary TB. Subjects will begin screening for study
      participation when they have completed 4 calendar months of TB treatment. Subjects meeting
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized within a study group in a 3:1 ratio (N=18
      AERAS-456; N=6 placebo) to receive two 0.5 mL intramuscular injections of AERAS-456 or
      placebo eight weeks apart, on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is HIV-negative.

          2. Is male or female aged 18 through 60 years on Study Day 0.

          3. Has completed the written informed consent process.

          4. Has a diagnosis of confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis and is on standard TB treatment.

          5. Is confirmed to be Mtb negative by either 2 GeneXpert tests or 2 cultures from sputum
             samples taken on 2 different days at least 1 week apart, the first after at least 4
             calendar months of TB treatment and the second day not later than after 5 calendar
             months (with a window of plus 1 week) of treatment.

          6. Agrees to complete the prescribed course of TB treatment (completion of TB treatment
             can occur after vaccination on Study Day 0; subject must have completed at least 5
             calendar months of TB treatment on Study Day 0; if TB treatment is completed before
             randomization/vaccination then the time from completion of TB treatment to

             days prior to administration of study vaccine up until two months after the last

          6. History or laboratory evidence of any possible immunodeficiency state.

          7. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the study vaccine.

          8. Received any non-BCG TB vaccine previously.

          9. For female subjects: Currently pregnant, lactating/nursing, or a positive urine HCG.

         10. Severe anemia, defined as hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or a hematocrit less than 30

             Study Day 0.

         11. History of autoimmune disease or immunosuppression.

         12. Used immunosuppressive medication within 42 days before Study Day 0 (inhaled and

         13. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 42 days before Study Day 0.

         14. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 6 months
             before Study Day 0, or planned participation in any other investigational study during
             the study period.

         15. Received any licensed vaccine within 28 days before Study Day 0, or receipt of any
             vaccine or immunomodulating agent through Study Day 63.
