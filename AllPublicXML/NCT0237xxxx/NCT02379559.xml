  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of an exercise intervention on
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) components and biomarkers related to prostate cancer in Black men
      with MetS who are at increased risk of prostate cancer.

      The specific aim for the proposed study is to examine the feasibility and impact of a 6-month
      two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) on MetS components and biomarkers related to
      prostate cancer in Black men with MetS. Due to the striking racial disparities of prostate
      cancer, this proposal will focus on the impact of an aerobic and resistance exercise
      intervention on MetS and biomarkers related to prostate cancer in Black men. Specifically,
      our proposed clinical trial compares an aerobic and resistance exercise intervention to an
      attention control group among Black men.
