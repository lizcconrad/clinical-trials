    <description>Patients may be randomized to the experimental arm. Patients randomized to this arm will take 12 tablets of SA-ER per day. The total daily dose will be achieved by taking 4 tablets 3 times per day (in the morning, in the early evening, and before bedtime). Each dose should be taken with food (ie, within 30 minutes after a meal or a snack.) Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SA-ER or matching placebo for 48 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and before any research-related procedures are conducted

          -  Have a documented diagnosis of GNEM, HIBM, DMRV, or Nonaka disease due to previously
             demonstrated mutations in the gene encoding the GNE/MNK enzyme (genotyping will not be
             conducted in this study)

          -  Able to provide reproducible force in elbow flexors (i.e. two dynamometry force values
             with no more than 15% variability in the dominant arm) at Screening

          -  Able to walk a minimum of 200 meters during the 6MWT at Screening without the use of
             assistive devices, including a cane, crutch(es), walker, wheelchair or scooter (AFOs
             are permitted)

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures

          -  Participants of child‐bearing potential or with partners of child-bearing potential
             who have not undergone a bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and are sexually active must
             consent to use a highly effective method of contraception as determined by the site
             investigator (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives,
             vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier methods, surgical
             hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation, or true abstinence [when this is in line with
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject], which means not having sex because
             the subject chooses not to), from the period following the signing of the informed
             consent through 3 months after last dose of study drug

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause for at least two
             years, have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening, or who have had a
             total hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ingestion of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), SA, or related metabolites; intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIG); or anything that can be metabolized to produce SA in the body
             within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit

          -  History of more than 30 days treatment with SA-ER and/or SA-IR in prior clinical
             trials in the past year

          -  Has had any hypersensitivity to SA or its excipients that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          -  Has serum transaminase (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or gamma-glutamyl
             transpeptidase [GGT]) levels greater than 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) for
             age/gender, or serum creatinine of greater than 2X ULN at Screening

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or anticipated requirement for any investigational agent prior to
             completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe
             participation in the study

          -  Has a concurrent disease, active suicidal ideation, or other condition that, in the
             view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance
             or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or would
             affect safety
