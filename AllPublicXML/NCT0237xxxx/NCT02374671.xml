      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VisAbility
      Implant System (VIS) for the improvement of near visual acuity in presbyopic patients. This
      is a prospective clinical study that will enroll and determine eligible a total of 360
      subjects ranging in age between 45 and 60 years of age at up to 14 clinical sites. Subjects
      will be implanted with the VisAbility Implant model SGP-046 in the primary eye and then in
      the fellow eye no sooner than 14 days later. Subjects will be examined at one day, one week
      and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-operatively.

      The study will also include a 60 subject randomized controlled sub-study at 3 investigational
      sites. Subjects enrolled and eligible at these sites will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to a
      surgery group or a control group. Subjects randomized to the surgery group will undergo
      surgery and will be followed for 24 months in the same manner as the larger non-randomized
      surgical group. Subjects randomized to the control group will be followed for 6 months, and
      will be eligible to undergo surgery after completion of this 6-month follow-up period.

      The primary endpoint is achievement of distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) of
      Snellen equivalent 20/40 or better (at 40 cm) and at least 10 letters (ETDRS) improvement in
      DCNVA in the primary eye.

      This endpoint will be evaluated against two objectives, a) 75% or more of primary eyes
      achieve the effectiveness endpoint at 12 months postoperative and b) the percentage of
      primary eyes achieving the effectiveness endpoint at 6 months postoperative (6-month
      responder rate) is higher than the percentage in the randomized control group.

    <description>The VisAbility Micro Insert (Model SGP-046) is an injection molded curved scleral implant molded from PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate), a material with an extensive history of long-term implantation in the human eye, including intraocular lenses (IOLs). Four (4) VisAbility Micro Insert segments are placed in a single presbyopic eye to improve near vision.</description>
