    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to document the effectiveness of a honey-based medical
      device (Hyalumel) in the management of pressure ulcers. The effectiveness of the medical
      device will be judged according to the evolution of the surface of the wound at the end of 12
      weeks of treatment.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following items between the two
      arms of the study:

      A. The evolution of skin microbiota in the wound B. The evolution of the surface and the
      depth of the wound during follow-up C. The healing process D. Patient and caretaker
      acceptability
