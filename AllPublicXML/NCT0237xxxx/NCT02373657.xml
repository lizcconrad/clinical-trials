  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trachoma is a blinding disease caused by ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. The Carter
      Center and Proctor Foundation have been jointly conducting trachoma research in the Goncha
      Siso Enese woreda of Amhara for the past 8 years, through a series of clinical trials. We
      have found that repeated mass administration of oral azithromycin can greatly reduce the
      prevalence of trachoma, but mass antibiotics have been unable thus far to eliminate
      infection. The World Health Organization recommends not only antibiotics for control of
      trachoma, but an entire SAFE strategy (Surgery for in-turned eyelids, Antibiotics, Facial
      hygiene promotion, and Environmental improvements such as latrines and water points).
      Trachoma is more common in villages and households with poor access to water and latrines, so
      improving the public health infrastructure is thought to be important for limiting
      transmission of trachoma. However, there is very little evidence to support the efficacy of
      installing new water points for trachoma. There has been only one previous attempt to study
      the role of hand dug well installation for trachoma control, and this study, conducted in
      Niger, found that installing wells was not effective. We now propose a project to improve the
      public health infrastructure of Goncha Siso Enese woreda by helping with the construction of
      water points (e.g., hand-dug wells) and providing hygiene education, in order to determine
      whether improving access to water and hygiene information will be effective for control of
      trachoma and soil-transmitted helminths.

    <description>In these seven communities we built a well in a central location for all state team residents. We plan on providing &quot;tippy-taps&quot; (water and soap dispensers), instruction in soap-making, and hygiene education to these communities. We will also put fly traps in the communities to see if wells reduce flies. We plan on performing monitoring visits at 12 months and 24 months, in order to assess clinically active trachoma, ocular chlamydia infection, nasopharyngeal macrolide resistance, soil transmitted helminths, and childhood growth (height and weight). We will also perform assessments of the adequacy of the intervention, by conducting household surveys to assess hygiene behavior, access to water and latrines, and fly density.</description>
