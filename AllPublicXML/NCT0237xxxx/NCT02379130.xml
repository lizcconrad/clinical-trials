    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Family Nurture Intervention in
      preschool aged children between 2.5 and 4.5 years of age who were born prematurely and
      exhibit developmental deficits. The new approach is based on improving aspects of maternal
      nurturing behaviors as well as mother-child co-regulation, which are important to early
      development. Since young children with developmental deficits are often easily upset, mothers
      will be taught how to co-regulate with their child through comfort and calming interactions
      during 11 clinic visits. Assessments in the follow-up clinic will test the immediate and
      long-term effects of this new approach to the nurture of children who were born early and
      demonstrate developmental problems and behavioral problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mother-infant interactions are the foundation for the organization of the infant's
      neurobiological, sensory, perceptual, emotional, physical, and relational systems (Hofer,
      1987). For the developing infant, one of the most critical sources of regulatory input is
      through contact with the mother and her nurturing behavior. The infant's responses to the
      mother provide feedback that shapes her behavior as well. There are many co-regulatory
      processes embedded in these synchronous and reciprocal interactions which cross
      neurophysiological and neurobehavioral domains (Als, 1999). A necessary but detrimental
      separation between mother and infant is created at a critical period when mother-infant
      co-regulation should be developing. Regardless of NICU or well-baby nursery care, the
      physiological challenges associated with being born too soon, along with disturbances in
      normal mother-infant interactions are key factors underlying the risks of early and late
      preterm infants for a broad range of early and midlife disorders (DeBoer, et al., 1984 if
      this does not include late preterm, find another reference). This study compares common early
      interventions such as occupational, physical, and speech therapy with a Family Nurture
      Intervention (FNI), instituted at age 3 to 4 for preschool aged children with developmental
      delays. This is a developmental time point at which delays including deficits in emotion
      regulation, language, cognition, and attention are identifiable. The investigators
      hypothesize that the Family Nurture Intervention will alter a wide range of physiological
      regulatory capacities and will result in improved indices of mother psychological and child
      neurobehavioral outcomes.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary Cortisol Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol is the hormone produced at the end of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis and is used to measure stress levels. Mothers and children will be asked for a saliva sample for cortisol determination throughout the intervention program.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxytocin (OT) Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Variance in Vagal Tone (High Frequency Heart Period Variability)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using data obtained during each follow-up visit, we will characterize various parameters of cardiac function and regulation including assessments of parasympathetic modulation of heart rate.Heart rate and respiration will be digitized at 2000 samples/sec, and undergo further mean and interval calculations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>SDQ is a brief parent-report behavioral screening questionnaire for 3-16 year olds. It consists of 25 items that are divided into 5 categories: emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Habits Questionnaire (SHQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>SHQ is a 64-item parent report instrument about their child's sleep across the first 5 years of life, beginning at age 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>STAI is the definitive instrument for measuring anxiety. It comprises 2 separate self-report scales of 20 items each that measure state and trait anxiety (Spanish version also available). The S-Anxiety Scale (measuring state), has been found to be a sensitive indicator of changes in transitory anxiety. The T-Anxiety scale has proven useful for identifying persons who differ in motivation or drive level. The STAI has been used in studies examining parents of hospitalized children, the transition to a maternal role, and perception of illness severity in infants.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will be using the short form of 36 items, which only requires 10 mins to complete. This form of the PSI (1983) is from a 101 item questionnaire that includes the following 13 scales: Adaptability, Acceptability, Demandingness, Mood, Distractibility/Hyperactivity, Reinforces Parent, Depression, Attachment, Restriction of Role, Sense of Competence, Social Isolation, Relationship with Spouse, and Parent Health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents are asked to list first names or initials for each significant person in their lives who provides personal support to them. Then they indicate the kind of relationship for each person on this network list. Using a 5-point rating scale they describe the amount of support available from each person on their network list for 8 questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mom's Support Circle Scale</measure>

    <description>This questionnaire was specifically created for the current study. It assesses who will support and who is supporting the mom with her child. It assess how 'available' and 'helpful' each potential support person (e.g., husband, sibling, grandparent, friend) is on a rating scale from rated from 1 (less) to 5 (more).</description>

    <description>Children in the FNI group will continue to attend any intervention programs that they are already enrolled in. In addition, they will be asked to attend 1 clinic visit per week for 6 weeks over the course of 12 weeks. During each visit, the mother-child will meet with trained Nurture Specialists. The Nurture Specialists will facilitate and encourage the mother and child to engage in nurturing and calming activities, including sustained touch, vocal soothing, and an odor cloth exchange. FNI families will be asked to participate in a 6 month post-enrollment follow-up visit and a 12 month post-enrollment follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>Children in the PNI group will continue to attend any intervention programs that they are already enrolled in. They will be asked to attend 1 clinic visit per week for 6 weeks over the course of 12 weeks to meet with clinical personnel who will collect measures regarding the child's behavior and development. At each visit, study staff will meet with mothers to facilitate a lesson plan on appropriate play and nutrition. NPI families will be asked to participate in a 6 month post-enrollment follow-up visit and a 12 month post-enrollment follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>The intervention begins with Block play. The child will be asked to play blocks with the mother during a eight minute video acquisition which will be coded for mother child interaction analysis. At the end of the video period the child will sit on the mother's lap. The pair will be asked to talk and play with each other as they customarily do. If the child becomes restless the mother will be coached by the nurture specialist to further engage the child with soothing and calming; the mother will be helped to bring the child back into a calm state through sustained physical contact, comfort touch, soothing words, and eye contact. The mother will also be helped to verbally express her feelings toward her child and to tolerate her child's full range of feeling.</description>
