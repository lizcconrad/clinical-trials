  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of North Carolina will test the effectiveness of the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention's AFIX model for increasing HPV vaccination coverage among
      adolescents. AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives and eXchange) consists of brief quality
      improvement consultations that immunization specialists from state health departments deliver
      to vaccine providers in primary care settings. Using immunization registry data, the
      specialist evaluates the clinic's vaccination coverage and delivers education on best
      practices to improve coverage. We will compare changes in HPV vaccination coverage before and
      after consultations for high-volume pediatric and family medicine clinics across three study
      conditions: traditional consultations (in-person group), virtual consultations (webinar
      group), or no consultations (control group). In each participating state, 30 clinics will be
      randomly assigned to each study arm, for a total of 90 clinics per state, or 270 clinics
      overall. The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in coverage for HPV
      vaccine initiation among 11-12 year old patients, from baseline to 6-month follow-up.
      Secondarily, we will compare the change in coverage for other vaccines and age groups.

It has four main components: 1) Assessment of a provider's current immunization practices and vaccination levels, 2) Feedback of the assessment results and strategies to improve coverage levels, 3) Incentives to improve coverage levels, and 4) eXchange of information and resources necessary to facilitate improvement. Relevant AFIX information will be communicated to vaccine providers using several intervention and quality improvement components.</description>
