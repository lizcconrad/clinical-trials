      This pilot phase II trial studies P1101 (polyethyleneglycol [PEG]-proline-interferon
      alpha-2b) in treating patients with myelofibrosis. PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b is a
      substance that can improve the body's natural response and may slow the growth of
      myelofibrosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for clinical response (complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], or
      clinical improvement [CI]) as defined by International Working Group-Myeloproliferative
      Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria in a cohort of intermediate-2/high risk
      myelofibrosis (MF) patients. Response in a second cohort of early stage MF patients will also
      be described.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the adverse event profile of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort
      (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs
      intermediate-2/high risk).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) with P1101 for patients with
      myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      II. To evaluate the impact of P1101 on bone marrow and histological features of myelofibrosis
      including cytogenetics, blast percentage, fibrosis, and JAK2-V617F allele burden by cohort
      (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.

    <measure>Changes in patient-reported symptoms and QOL as measured by MPN-SAF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported symptoms and QOL will be described at each time point using the mean, confidence interval, median, and range. Changes in individual symptoms, changes in a symptom scale composed of symptoms specific to MF patients, and changes in the MPN TSS will be investigated. Graphical procedures will include stream plots of individual patient scores and plots of average values over time. Correlational analyses will be done to determine the relationships among patients-reported symptoms and QOL, as well as with clinical outcomes and clinician-assessed symptoms.</description>
