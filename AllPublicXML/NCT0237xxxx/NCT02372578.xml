    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess analgesic efficacy of ASP3662 relative to placebo in
      subjects with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) as well as assess the safety and
      tolerability of ASP3662 relative to placebo.

      The analgesic effect is evaluated by measuring percent responders, change in daily worst pain
      score, change in average daily pain score, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC).
