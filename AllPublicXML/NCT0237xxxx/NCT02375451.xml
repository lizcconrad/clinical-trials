    <textblock>
      Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in
      adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The
      investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before
      and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital
      for thyroid disease.

      Radioiodine (I-131) therapy for thyroid disease is known to decrease salivary function in
      adult patients. The impact of pediatric I-131 exposure on salivary function is unknown. The
      investigators goals are to answer this question by measuring salivary gland function before
      and after I-131 administration in children who receive radioiodine therapy at our hospital
      for thyroid disease. We will use a Modified Shirmer Test to measure saliva production and a
      questionnaire to evaluation symptoms of xerostomia.
