  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned research aims to delay the onset of drug use and reduce harmful use and abuse
      among Hispanic youths. The culturally-tailored prevention program will be delivered to youths
      by computer. Over 5 years, the program will be developed and tested in a randomized clinical
      trial. The intervention program will include 10 initial sessions, followed by annual booster
      sessions. Outcome measurements will involve baseline, post-intervention, and three annual
      follow-up data collections.

      The study's primary hypothesis is that rates of 30-day alcohol and drug use will be lower
      among participants assigned to receive the intervention. If proven to be efficacious, the
      program will be revised and disseminated nationally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      America's largest ethnic minority group, Hispanics are also a youthful population: one-third
      of Hispanic Americans are less than 18 years old. Unfortunately, young Hispanic Americans are
      an at-risk population more likely than their majority culture peers to drop out of school,
      become involved in the criminal justice system, fall prey to violence, and face lifelong
      economic problems. Hispanic youths are also at risk for early drug use and subsequent harmful
      use and abuse. As early as eighth grade and relative to their Black and White peers, Hispanic
      adolescents report higher rates of most harmful substances. Drug use continues to pose
      problems for Hispanic youths throughout adolescence and into adulthood.

    <description>Youths in the intervention-arm will interact online with the initial intervention program between pretest and posttest measurement occasions and will interact with booster sessions subsequent to 1- and 2-year follow-up measurement occasions. Owing to the expense associated with developing a treatment-as-usual intervention for computer delivery in the control arm, youths assigned to the control arm will receive no intervention.</description>
