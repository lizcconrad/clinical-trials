      The primary objective of the study is to proof the successful use of Geistlich Bio-Oss® and
      Geistlich Bio-Gide® (already registered medical devices) in bony peri-implant defects due to
      peri-implantitis disease.

      Patient who will considered eligible at the screening visit will undergo surgical treatment
      procedure within 2 weeks. At the day of the surgery the patients will be randomized into the
      2 treatment groups.

      The subjects will be then prescribed postoperative antibiotics (Azitromax 500 mg day one and
      250 mg day 2-4).

      Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (400mg x 3) for two days to all
      subjects. Subjects will rinse twice daily with Chlorhexidine mouth rinse and use modified
      oral hygiene procedures during the first 5 weeks of healing. Subjects will receive
      professional prophylaxis as required.

      Subjects will be instructed on appropriate oral hygiene throughout the study and will be
      given appropriate oral hygiene instructions. Instructions on post-operative care will be
      repeated at each visit. In particular the following points have to be covered during the
      first month after surgery: Chlorhexidine rinses, avoidance of brushing, usage of interdental
      cleaning devices, avoidance of chewing on or trauma to the treated area. In addition subjects
      will be instructed not to smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day during the entire study
      period and not to consume alcohol during antibiotic therapy.

      Sutures will be removed after 14 days. Photos will be taken during the whole study to
      document the healing process.

      Further follow up visits will be scheduled 6 weeks and 3,6,9,12 months post-surgery.

          -  Presence of peri-implantitis

          -  A peri-implant intraosseous defect with at least 3 mm defect depth as seen on an
