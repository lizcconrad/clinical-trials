  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the characterization of many aetiologic genetic changes. The specific causative
      factors in the development of sporadic colorectal cancer remain unclear. This study was
      performed to detect the possible role of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in
      developing colorectal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fresh biopsy specimens have been obtained from the colonic mucosa overlying the colorectal
      cancer as well as from the colon of the healthy controls. Culture, genotyping and virulence
      of EPEC were done using (nutrient broth culture, and PCR). Strains biochemically identified
      as E. coli were selected from the surface of a MacConkey's plate and were serogrouped by
      slide agglutination tests

    <description>Strains biochemically identified as E. coli were selected from the surface of a MacConkey's plate and were serogrouped by slide agglutination tests to detect EPEC using O-specific nonavalent E.coli antiserum (O26, O55, O86, O111, O114, O119, O124, O125, O126, O127, O128, O142), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).</description>

    <description>The specimens were immediately transferred to the lab, inoculated in nutrient broth and vortexed for a few seconds then incubated overnight. The following day the broth culture was subcultured on enteric isolation media. Identification of E. coli was carried out by using standard biochemical methods.</description>
