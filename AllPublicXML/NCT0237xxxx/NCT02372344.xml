      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food timing on pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      AZD0585 and the effect of food timing on tolerability and safety of AZD0585 in healthy male
      Japanese subjects.

      This study is an open-label, randomized, cross-over design with three single-dose treatment
      periods and a washout of at least 10 days in between each treatment visit. The study period
      consists of 5 visits to the study centre: Visit 1 (enrolment), Visit 2 (first single-dose
      treatment), Visit 3 (second single-dose treatment), Visit 4 (third single-dose treatment) and
      Visit 5 (follow-up).

      Target subject population is healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20-45 years. Following an
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 4 g AZD0585 will be administered on 3
      separate occasions (fasting, before meal, and after meal) in a randomized crossover fashion
      with different food restrictions.

Analyses of the outcome measures presented are for baseline-adjusted data for total EPA and DHA since the presence of endogenous levels of these fatty acids would likely contribute to intra-subject variability and affect the analyses and interpretation. The geometric mean was calculated as the exponential of the arithmetic mean calculated from data on a log scale.</description>

        <description>To investigate the effect of food timing on PK (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC]) of single dose of 4 g AZD0585 in healthy male Japanese by assessing plasma concentrations of total eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and total docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and PK parameters over time under the three proposed conditions (fasting, before meal, and after meal).</description>

        <title>The Effect of Food Timing (Fasting, Before Meal, and After Meal) on PK (Cmax) of AZD0585 in Healthy Male Japanese.</title>
        <description>To investigate the effect of food timing on PK (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) of single dose of 4 g AZD0585 in healthy male Japanese by assessing plasma concentrations of total EPA and total DHA, and PK parameters over time under the three proposed conditions (fasting, before meal, and after meal). Analyses of the outcome measures presented are for baseline-adjusted data for total EPA and DHA since the presence of endogenous levels of these fatty acids would likely contribute to intra-subject variability and affect the analyses and interpretation. The geometric mean was calculated as the exponential of the arithmetic mean calculated from data on a log scale.</description>

        <title>The Effect of Food Timing (Fasting, Before Meal, and After Meal) on PK (AUC0-72) of AZD0585 in Healthy Male Japanese.</title>
        <description>To investigate the effect of food timing on PK (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours [AUC0-72]) of single dose of 4 g AZD0585 in healthy male Japanese by assessing plasma concentrations of total EPA and total DHA, and PK parameters over time under the three proposed conditions (fasting, before meal, and after meal). Analyses of the outcome measures presented are for baseline-adjusted data for total EPA and DHA since the presence of endogenous levels of these fatty acids would likely contribute to intra-subject variability and affect the analyses and interpretation. The geometric mean was calculated as the exponential of the arithmetic mean calculated from data on a log scale.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected from pre-dose (Day -1) up to 72 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).</time_frame>
        <population>The PK set included all healthy subjects in the safety population (ie, who received at least 1 administration of AZD0585 and for whom any post-dose data were available) with at least 1 detectable total EPA and total DHA plasma concentration.</population>
