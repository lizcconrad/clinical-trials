  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nose bleeding (epistaxis) is a common emergency. It is often difficult to estimate blood loss
      and the current hemoglobin of patients. In patients with oral anticoagulation, it is
      important to measure the level of hemodilution. Several situations with the importance of the
      fast determination of these parameters have been identified in previous studies [1,2]. The
      blood sampling from the venous punction is the standard in these investigations. However,
      this requires the corresponding painful puncture and also the time required at the
      laboratory.

      Since many patients present themselves with active bleeding, it is obvious that this blood
      could be used for determining the following parameters: Hemoglobin and INR/Quick. The nose
      blood can be analyzed with commercial rapid test devices. If these devices could generate
      same or similar results and after further validation of the method, painful punctures could
      be waived.

      Patients with active epistaxis are verbally elucidated about the study and the verbal consent
      is obtained. According to the agreement a few drops of nose blood are preserved. Subsequently
      the standard therapy is performed. This blood sample is promptly analyzed with the rapid test
      devices.

      We successfully applied the exception to the analysis of blood samples prior to obtaining the
      written consent due to following reasons: Analysis with the rapid test devices needs to be
      immediate and without delay in order to satisfy quality standards prescribed by the
      manufacturers. In addition, patient's treatment should not be delayed.

      Simultaneously, a venous blood sample for the corresponding values is carried out according
      to medical indications. After the treatment of the acute emergency and thus after the
      greatest stress situation, we ask the patient again whether he agrees to the study
      conditions. The written consent is obtained in the end of the acute treatment.

      Both inception and termination of the research project will be reported within 90 days of the
      Ethics Committee.
