  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use a clinical trial to test Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS)
      to examine the efficacy of TNS as a new treatment for PTSD in veterans. Recruitment will take
      place at the PTSD Outpatient Clinic at the VA GLA. Study participants will be asked to
      complete, at most, 9 assessments/questionnaires regarding their PTSD symptoms and quality of
      life, use the TNS device every night for 8 hours, log their use of the device, and attend
      weekly visits to monitor safety and complete assessments. Each subject will be asked to
      attend 8 visits over the course of 8 weeks. Subjects who receives the sham-controlled
      treatment will have an additional follow-up phone visit 4 weeks after the week 8 endpoint to
      examine symptom improvements.

      Enrollment and subject-related procedures are projected to take approximately 36 months.
      Preparations for clinical trial, clinical trial/study procedures and data analysis will
      occupy a 6 month period, a 36 month period, and a 6 month period, respectively. The duration
      of this project is approximately 4 years.

TNS will be performed for approximately 8 hours each night, a protocol that subjects found acceptable in the pilot work.</description>
