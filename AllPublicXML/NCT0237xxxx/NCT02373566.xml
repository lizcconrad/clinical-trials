    <textblock>
      In this study the efficacy of an acellular dermal template (Novomaix), combined with split
      thickness skin grafts, for use in patients with full thickness skin defects, is tested.
      Results will be compared intra-patient with those obtained after conventional treatment with
      split thickness skin grafts. The investigators expect this treatment to provide better
      outcome regarding scar quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using dermal substitutes in combination with a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is a well
      acknowledged therapy in burns and reconstructive surgery. Nevertheless, the ideal substitute
      is not available yet. We therefore want to investigate the use of an acellular dermal
      template (Novomaix), in combination with STSG, to treat these defects. Patients with with
      full thickness skin defects will be included in this study. This phase II study aims to
      investigate the efficacy of the use of this dermal matrix, with regard to scar quality as
      determined for elasticity at 3 months after treatment. Moreover, graft take (5-7 days after
      treatment), epithelialisation (5-7 days and 2-3 weeks), and scar quality (3 and 12 months
      after treatment, as determined for elasticity, colour/pigmentation, and using a subjective
      scar assessment scale) will be evaluated.
