  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to measure the serum levels of cytokines and chemokines
      that are known to increase during multiple sclerosis relapses.

      Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that are important in cell
      signaling.

      The second purpose of the study is to test the cytokine/chemokine changes measured in the 3rd
      and 6th months on the efficacy parameters.
