  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to define imaging and molecular bio-markers for prediction of radiotherapy
      response of squamous cell carcinomas, in an early treatment phase.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head &amp; neck, anal canal, cervix, esophagus or
      lung will be assessed before start of radiotherapy and 1-2 weeks after start.
      Multi-parametric MRI and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron
      emission tomography (PET) will be performed in parallel to metabolomic analyses of tumour
      tissue. The investigators will correlate changes in imaging bio-markers to corresponding
      changes in tissue or blood bio-markers by repeated imaging and biopsies for better
      understanding of the image parameters.

      The data from the two assessments will be used for identifying imaging bio-markers,
      predictive for outcome. The patient data will be divided into one set of data for hypothesis
      generation and another set for validation.

        Patients with previously untreated squamous carcinoma aimed for radiotherapy with curative
        intent of the oral cavity, oropharynx, uterine cervix, oesophagus, anal canal or lung.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Morphologically (pathology or cytology) verified, previously untreated squamous cell
             carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, oropharynx, uterine cervix, oesophagus or lung.

          2. The patient should be planned for treatment with radiotherapy alone or in combination
             with concomitant medical therapy

          3. The tumour shall be radiologically and/or visually identifiable and accessible for
             biopsy without the need for general anaesthesia or other major interventions

          4. The patient must be at least 18 years of age, able to understand the given information
             and, leave a written informed consent to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is unwilling to participate in the study

          2. Patients with adjuvant post-operative radiotherapy (i.e. no visible remaining tumour)

          3. Pregnancy or lactation

          4. Contraindications to investigations with MRI, gadolinium contrast or PET-tracers

          5. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2.

          6. Severe co-morbidities that are judged to significantly compromise survival in a
             two-years perspective.
