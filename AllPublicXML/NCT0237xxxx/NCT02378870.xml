    <textblock>
      This phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study
      evaluating efficacy and tolerability of Osteodex of patients with metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Osteodex is a poly-bisphosphonate containing three known
      substances; dextran, alendronate and guanidine.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the relative change of response markers to bone
      metabolism (B-ALP and S-P1NP) The following objectives will also be evaluated: overall
      survival, PSA response, other response markers related to bone metabolism (S-CTX and
      osteocalcin), safety, tolerability, pain and quality of life.

      Males, diagnosed with CRPC, who fulfil the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The subject will be informed orally and
      in writing about the study procedures and give written informed consent, prior to study
      start. At the screening visit the following examinations are performed: Physical examination,
      medical history and concomitant medication. Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, height, body
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured. Blood samples are drawn and urine sample is
      collected. ECG is recorded. Bone scan and PET-CT are also performed. At the next visit,
      baseline, the subject is examined physically and heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured, ECG is recorded, blood samples drawn and urine
      sample collected. FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire are filled out by the subject. Adverse
      events and concomitant medication is documented and the first dose of the investigational
      product is given.

      The subject is surveyed for 3 hours at the hospital.

      The duration of the study for the individual subject will be approximately 30 weeks from
      screening to the follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose. Each subject will receive at
      least 7 doses and maximum 13 doses of investigational product.

      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be designated and will be responsible to
      monitor/review all study related safety data. After review of safety data the DMC will
      provide recommendation as to whether the dose escalation can proceed as planned according to
      the protocol.
