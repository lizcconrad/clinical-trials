      This is a single centre, prospective, non-randomised pivotal clinical investigation to be
      undertaken at St Mark's Hospital, Harrow, UK.

    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 30 patients undergoing endoscopic resection of complex colorectal
      polyps and be used to demonstrate safety and performance of the CROMA Electrosurgical System
      microwave coagulation modality. Study data will complement existing data to support a CE
      marking application for the CROMA Electrosurgical System (combined RF and microwave
      modalities).
