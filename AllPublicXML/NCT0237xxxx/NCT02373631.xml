  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness of conventional physical therapy
      (manual physical therapy, exercise, range of motion, and stretching) versus conventional
      physical therapy combined with dry needling in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
      Physical therapists commonly use conventional physical therapy techniques and dry needling to
      treat knee OA, and this study is attempting to find out if the addition of dry needling to
      conventional physical therapy has an equal, greater, or lesser effect than conventional
      physical therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with knee OA will be randomized to receive 1-2 treatments per week for 6 weeks (up
      to 10 sessions total) of either: (1) Dry Needling and conventional physical therapy or the
      (2) Conventional physical therapy (manual physical therapy, exercise, range of motion and
      stretching)
