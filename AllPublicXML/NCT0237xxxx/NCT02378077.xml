      This study is being done to determine whether eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) play
      an important role in human fat metabolism and inflammation.

      This study is being done to determine if fish oil supplement could play a role in reducing
      inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity in your fat tissue.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eosinophil content</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of eosinophils content in different depots of fat tissue (subcutaneous and visceral) of lean vs obese, non-diabetic volunteers. Evaluation will be conducted on subfraction of stroma vascular component of whole fat tissue subjected to Flow cytometry. Using cell surface markers we will isolate different cell population which will then be reported as a fraction of total cells as well as normalization per gr of whole tissue. Outcome will be assessed on whole sample size at study completion</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship between eosinophils content and insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Will explore whether differences in eosinophils content in different fat depots will correlate with insulin sensitivity of all subjects enrolled in the study. Results will be expressed as a linear regression between insulin sensitivity indices expressed as mg/ml x Kg of total body weight x min and eosinophils content expressed as fraction of total cell number. Outcome will be assessed on whole sample size at study completion</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of fish oil supplementation on eosinophils content and anti-inflammatory molecules</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>We will test whether 3 months of fish oil treatment positively affects insulin sensitivity by changing the number of eosinophils or the level of anti-inflammatory molecules. Determination by Elisa of cytokines before and after treatment will be compared (Arbitrary units) and flow cytometry w/ same approach described in outcome one will be applied before and after fish oil</description>

    <description>To determine whether eosinophil content of adipose tissue is related to insulin sensitivity. We will use euglycemic clamps, fat biopsy (obtained during a scheduled abdominal surgery) and fat aspiration for analysis of subcutaneous (Sc) and omental (OM) adipose tissue from obese, insulin resistant and lean, insulin sensitive volunteers to test the hypothesis that, as in mice, eosinophil content in human subcutaneous and omental white adipose tissue, inversely correlates with body weight, with skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Lean, healthy person with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less, or you are obese, BMI
        between 30 and 50, and non-diabetic.

        Lean healthy controls will not be on any medication and will be undergoing elective
        abdominal surgery excluding those involving acute inflammation (i.e. acute cholecystitis,
        bowel perforation, or diverticulitis).

        Obese, non-diabetic subjects will have a BMI between 30 and 50 and be taking no medications
        affecting glucose metabolism or lipid metabolism. These subjects will be identified from a
        pool of patients undergoing an elective abdominal surgical procedure such as inguinal
        hernia repair, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, planned cholecystectomy, but also
        bariatric surgery.

        Volunteers will not be taking corticosteroid therapy or have a history of asthma, COPD or
        atopic syndrome. All subjects will undergo a medical history intake and a physical
        examination followed by an OGTT to confirm normal glucose.
