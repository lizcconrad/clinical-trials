  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the traditional surgical treatment for early-stage breast
      cancer patients. There are evidences indicating that oncoplastic-BCS (displacement technique)
      could improve cosmetic outcomes and/or quality of life, and has similar oncological safety as
      traditional BCS does. However, there are no prospective trial comparing oncoplastic-BCS vs.
      traditional BCS in terms of cosmetic outcomes and oncological safety. In this study, the
      investigators are going to address this issue by assigning patients into traditional and
      oncoplastic-BCS group, based on their preference.
