    <textblock>
      The aim is to built a Therapeutic Education Program for patients treated with radical
      prostatectomy in order to improve their sexuality.

      This study is carried out in two steps :

        -  Identification of specific educational objectives through a sociological study, with
           interviews and focus groups conducted and analyzed by a sociologist. Patients from the
           urology department of the hospital center (CH) Lyon Sud - Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL)
           will be included

        -  Development of the program by a caregiver education expert (Centre Hygée), adapted
           partly from results of the qualitative study and partly from concepts and tools from the
           Education Sciences.

      8 patients and 2 urologists will be interview to explore the educational needs and to create,
      expand and validate an interview guide. Exploratory interviews with urologists will address
      information given to patients on post radical prostatectomy sexual dysfunction, prescribing
      practices, monitoring therapy (PDE5 inhibitors, IIC, Vacuum), and patients adverse effects
      management.

      Focus groups will be conduct to :

        -  Identify the representations associated with erectile dysfunction

        -  Identify the representations related to treatments for erectile dysfunction.

        -  Score patient knowledge about treatments and their managements.

        -  Identify common or original strategies to improve adherence, reduce side effects and
           overcome the disadvantages of the treatments.

        -  Assessing the needs and expectations of patients
