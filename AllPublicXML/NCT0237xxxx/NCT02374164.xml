    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of
      febuxostat after a single oral dose of 80 mg febuxostat XR and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of febuxostat after single oral doses of 40 and 80 mg febuxostat XR.

      The drug being tested in this study is called febuxostat extended- release (XR). This study
      is evaluating the effect of food on how febuxostat-XR moves throughout the body. This study
      will also look at the side effects and all safety results in people who took the study drug.

      This 3-way crossover study will enroll approximately 36 participants. Eligible participants
      will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of the 3 treatment sequences at 1:1:1 ratio.
      Sequence defines the order in which participants receive Regimens A (febuxostat XR 80 mg
      after a high fat meal), B (febuxostat XR 40 mg after fasting) and C (febuxostat XR 80 mg
      after fasting):

      Sequence 1: A, B, C

      Sequence 2: B, C, A

      Sequence 3: C, A, B The dose in a period and the dose in the subsequent period will be
      separated by a minimum 7-day washout interval. This single-centre trial will be conducted in
      the United States.

      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic including three 4-day periods of
      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.

             1 of Period 1).

         15. Has poor peripheral venous access.

         16. Has donated or lost 450 mL or more of his or her blood volume (including
             plasmapheresis) or had a transfusion of any blood product within 30 days prior to Day
