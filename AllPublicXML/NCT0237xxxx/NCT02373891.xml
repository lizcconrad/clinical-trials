      Acebrophylline is metabolized by being separated into Ambroxol and 7-theophylline when orally
      administered as a salt composed of an acid-base as a compound that was synthesized by and
      chloride (salifying) the ambroxol to 7-theophylline. Acebrophylline is selectively applied to
      the bronchial or lung tissue and inhibit the activity of phospholipase bronchoalveolar shows
      the expectorant action to raise the surface activity of the alveolar, leukotrienes (LTs) and
      by suppressing the production of prostaglandins (PGs), showed potent anti-inflammatory
      activity, bronchial was celebrated by reducing the bronchial hyperreactivity to normal state
      is allowed to recuperate or extended.

      It was developed to improve compliance improve pharmaceutically Acebrophylline that intake
      twice daily 100mg to Surfolase CR that intake once daily 200mg
