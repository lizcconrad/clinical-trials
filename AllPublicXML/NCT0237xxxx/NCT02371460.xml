      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (or
      DHA, an omega-3 lipid) supplementation in lactating mothers providing breast-milk to their
      infant born below 29 0/7 weeks of gestational age (GA) improves BPD-free survival at 36 weeks
      post-menstrual age (PMA). Half of participants will receive docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an
      omega-3 lipid, while the other half will receive a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year in Canada, 1500 babies who are born early (prematurely) develop a serious lung
      disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD causes major health problems in these
      infants, especially in their early childhood. In most situations, breast-milk is the ideal
      source of nutrition for growth and development of premature babies. However, diets of
      Canadian mothers are generally deficient in omega-3 lipids (essential fats), resulting in
      lower protection from these omega-3 lipids in mother's milk-fed infants. Previous research
      has shown that giving DHA to mothers of premature babies is safe both for the mother and for
      their baby, and is an efficient way of helping babies meet their dietary requirements from
      breast-milk. Furthermore, this previous research also suggests that this intervention may
      reduce the risk of BPD in premature babies receiving breast-milk.
