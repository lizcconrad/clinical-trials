  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered as heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens in healthy adult
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different
      sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants. The study consists of a screening
      period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at
      Baseline [Day 1] followed by a boost on Day 29 or 57 and a post-boost follow-up, until all
      participants have had their 21-day post-boost visit (Day 50 or Day 78). The participants who
      received active vaccine will enter a long-term follow-up. The total duration of the study
      will be about 1 year for participants who received vaccine and about 3 months for
      participants who received placebo. Immunogenicity and safety will be monitored during the
      study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and the
             investigator's clinical judgment

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test immediately
             prior to each study vaccine administration, and practice adequate birth control
             measures from 28 days before the prime vaccination until at least 3 months after the
             boost vaccination as specified in the study protocol. If not heterosexually active at
             screening, must agree to practice adequate birth control measures if they become
             heterosexually active during their participation in the study (from screening onwards
             until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination).

          -  Must be available and willing to participate for the duration of the study visits and
             follow-up, provide verifiable identification, and have a means to be contacted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been vaccinated with a candidate Ebola vaccine

          -  Has been diagnosed with Ebola disease or exposed to Ebola including travel to West
             Africa in the last 12 months. West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries
             of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone. Participants who anticipate traveling to
             epidemic Ebola areas before the start of the long-term follow-up period will also be
             excluded. During the long-term follow-up period, travel to epidemic Ebola areas is
             allowed but during this period sampling can only take place if participant has
             returned at least 1 month from the epidemic Ebola area to ensure the samples are not
             carrying the Ebola-virus

          -  Has received any Ad26- or MVA-based candidate vaccine in the past

          -  Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines),
             including known allergy to egg or aminoglycosides

          -  A woman who is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the boost vaccination

          -  History of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet
             alone; thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12
             months; uncontrolled hypertension as defined in the study protocol; or, major
             psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12 months that in
             the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation
