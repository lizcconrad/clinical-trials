  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both EGFR and HER-2 receptors. This
      study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Pyrotinib or Pyrotinib in
      combination with Docetaxel in patients with HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.
