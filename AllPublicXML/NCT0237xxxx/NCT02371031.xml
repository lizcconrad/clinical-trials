    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the potential of using FDOPA-PET/MRI for improving
      surgical planning and providing non-invasive prognostic information in patients with gliomas
      that have substantial non-enhancing regions. The results will be used to develop larger
      adequately powered studies.

    <description>We will consider our primary endpoint successful if FDOPA-PET changes the surgical plan in at least 4 of the 20 patients (20%), a much lower margin than previously reported with [C-11]methionine which is on the order of 60-70% of cases. When safe and feasible, these discrepant areas identified on FDOPA-PET/MRI will undergo tissue sampling. However, tissue sampling of discrepant areas may not be possible in all patients, and this decision will be made by the treating neurosurgeon.</description>

    <description>Patients with known or suspected brain gliomas that are non-enhancing or have substantial non-enhancing regions will undergo FDOPA-PET/MRI within 2 weeks prior to planned standard of care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy. In the same planning session, the MRI alone will be reviewed and then the FDOPA-PET data will be added to the planning.
In the event that a patient cannot undergo MRI or PET/MRI is not available (e.g. due to maintenance), FDOPA-PET/CT can be performed instead at the discretion of the responsible physician.
When feasible and at the discretion of the neurosurgeon performing the resection, areas of suspected tumor identified on the FDOPA-PET/MRI study but not the MRI alone will undergo tissue sampling.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected diagnosis of intracranial glioma with substantial non-enhancing
             regions as assessed by contrast enhanced MRI. For the purposes of this study, gliomas
             with substantial non-enhancing regions are defined as having contrast-enhancing
             volumes of less than 50% of the total estimated tumor volume. Gliomas that do not have
             any contrast-enhancing regions are eligible for this study.

          -  Standard of care surgical resection and/or stereotactic biopsy of the brain tumor
             planned within 2 weeks of the FDOPA-PET/MRI study.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Measurable disease on MRI defined as tumor measuring at least 1 cm in two
             perpendicular dimensions.

          -  Karnofsky performance of &gt; 50 corresponding to ECOG categories 0, 1, or 2. Patients
             who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be
             considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73
             m^2

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative must be able to understand and willing to
             sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing PET/MRI: contraindication to gadolinium contrast enhanced brain
             MRI (i.e., allergy to gadolinium contrast, MRI-incompatible implantable devices, GFR &lt;
             30 mL/min/1.73, and severe claustrophobia). At the discretion of the responsible
             physician, FDOPA-PET/CT may be performed if PET/MRI is contraindicated or unavailable.
             If FDOPA-PET/CT is performed, the patient must have undergone a contrast-enhanced MRI
             for fusion with FDOPA-PET no more than 4 weeks before the FDOPA-PET/CT.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the brain tumor. Prior biopsy or surgical
             resection of the glioma without additional therapy is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             urine or serum pregnancy test no more than 3 days prior to FDOPA injection.
