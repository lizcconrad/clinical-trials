    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness. Ginkgo biloba may be part of an effective
      treatment strategy for glaucoma because it has been shown to improve blood flow, it has
      antioxidant properties, it can relax smooth muscle, and it can protect neurons from damage.
      The goal of our study was to determine whether Ginkgo biloba would result in increased ocular
      blood flow which may protect against glaucoma damage.

      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness. Glaucoma progression sometimes occurs
      despite apparent control of intraocular pressure. Therefore, there may be other factors
      involved in glaucoma progression in some patients. Evidence is mounting that glaucoma
      patients are more likely to have abnormal ocular blood flow and vasospasm compared to those
      without glaucoma. Also, a study showed that those with progressive glaucoma had decreased
      blood flow compared to those with stable glaucoma or healthy controls. Endothelin-1, a potent
      vasoconstrictor, may be involved in these blood flow abnormalities. If the dysregulation of
      blood flow is causally related to the progression of glaucoma, then therapies aimed at
      improving the regulation of blood flow may help to prevent this progression.

      Ginkgo may be part of an effective treatment strategy for glaucoma because it has been shown
      to improve peripheral and cerebral blood flow. Other properties of Ginkgo that may aid in the
      treatment of glaucoma include antioxidant properties, inhibition of platelet activating
      factor, relaxation of smooth muscle, and neuroprotective properties. Ginkgo may be
      particularly useful in relaxing vasospasm. Two controlled trials have examined the effect of
      Ginkgo on ocular blood flow in healthy subjects. One randomized crossover trial found that 2
      days of Ginkgo increased the end diastolic velocity in the ophthalmic artery compared to
      placebo. However, another trial found that 1 dose of Ginkgo had no significant effects on
      ocular blood flow parameters. In people with normal tension glaucoma, Park et al found that 4
      weeks of Ginkgo increased peripapillary retinal blood flow. Two randomized controlled trials
      have examined the impact of Ginkgo biloba on visual field in people with normal tension
      glaucoma with conflicting results. Clearly, there is a need for more research on this topic.

      The goal of our study was to determine whether Ginkgo biloba would result in increased ocular
      blood flow, reduced vasospasm, and reduced endothelin-1 levels.

Patients took 60 mg of Ginkgo or a placebo twice daily by mouth for two weeks. The placebo consisted of 40 mg of corn starch. Ginkgo and the placebo were encapsulated to ensure identical appearance.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We focused this trial on vasospastic glaucoma patients because we believed that these
             would be the patients most likely to benefit from the ability of Ginkgo to improve
             blood flow.

          -  Patients who had been identified from previous research as being vasospastic on the
             Transonic Laser Doppler Flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY) were contacted
             and asked if they would like to participate in the trial.

          -  We recruited vasospastic patients with early or moderate primary open-angle glaucoma
             with a typical visual field defect with an abnormal Glaucoma Hemifield Test and a Mean
             Deviation worse than -2 decibels, and an optic nerve head showing retinal nerve fiber
             layer or neuroretinal rim loss characteristic of glaucoma.

          -  There was no restriction for intraocular pressure at time of diagnosis although at the
             time of recruitment intraocular pressure had to be effectively controlled either by
             ocular hypertension therapy or by surgery.

          -  If a patient had two eyes eligible, data from the right eye only was used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  those taking anticoagulant therapy,

          -  those with blood disorders or diabetes,

          -  women who were pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or who were breast-feeding,

          -  patients with a history of seizures or who were currently taking anti-convulsant
             medication, and

          -  those who could not return for 2 follow-up visits at 4 and 6 weeks.

          -  those patients who are already taking Ginkgo were asked if they were willing to stop
             for 6 weeks before the study.
