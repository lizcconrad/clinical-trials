  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common cause of childhood death worldwide. Millions of children survive,
      but are left with impaired health. Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury (sAKI) is increasingly
      recognized as a significant factor associated with long-term mortality among different
      patient populations. Renal dysfunction and subsequent chronic kidney disease is implicated in
      the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The investigators overall
      hypothesis is that, in the pediatric population, sepsis-related AKI will have unrecognized,
      long-term consequences with regard to kidney function, endothelial function, blood pressure
      control, and overall health.

      This will be a three-arm cross-sectional control-cohort outpatient evaluation. Subjects with
      sAKI and a random selection of non-sAKI subjects who agree to participate in another study of
      quality of life survey will be asked to participate in the outpatient study. Subjects will be
      asked to come in to the Clinical Research Center for 24-hour monitoring and participate in
      the outpatient study where urinary and serum studies to measure glomerular filtration rate,
      renal plasma flow followed by blood pressure monitoring, peripheral arterial and applanation
      tonometry.
