      This will be a prospective, open-label, 125 subject (maximum), two-year multicentre
      investigation to assess the safety, effectiveness and rotational stability of the modified
      600C (axis marks) intraocular lens (IOL) in subjects undergoing cataract extraction.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged ≥21 years of age.

          -  Cataract for which phacoemulsification extraction and posterior IOL implantation has
             been planned for the operative eye.

          -  Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) projected to be better than 20/30 (+0.18
             logMAR) in the operative eye after cataract removal and IOL implantation.

          -  Calculated IOL power requirement within the range +8.0 to +34.0D

          -  If present, subject must have corneal astigmatism of &lt;1.50 D in the operative eye.

          -  Expected dilated pupil size ≥ 5.0 mm in diameter to visualise the axis markings

          -  Subject must provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject must be able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 24 months
             after surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery in the operative eye.

          -  Microphthalmia

          -  Corneal decompensation or endothelial insufficiency

          -  Pseudo exfoliation

          -  Pars planitis

          -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders in the operative eye
             (e.g.,macular degeneration or other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause
             future visual acuity losses to a level of 20/30 (+0.18 logMAR) or worse.

          -  Inability to achieve secure placement in the designated location e.g. absence of a
             secure peripheral anterior capsule, zonule laxity or dehiscence; posterior synechiae
             to the capsular bag

          -  Active ocular disease in the operative eye, e.g., clinically significant dystrophy,
             chronic severe uveitis, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or chronic glaucoma.

          -  Concurrent participation in another drug or device investigation.

          -  Patients who are expected to require retinal laser treatment.

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing or plan to become pregnant during the study.
