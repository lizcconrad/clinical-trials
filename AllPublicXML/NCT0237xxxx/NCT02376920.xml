  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveal Melanoma is a rare cancer with approximately 3,000 cases diagnosed in the US every
      year. Nearly half of these experience spread of their cancer outside the eye. The
      DecisionDx-UM gene expression test classifies an individual's tumor as low risk (class 1) or
      high risk (class 2) of spreading. This study is being done to collect information about how
      physicians are using the DecisionDx-UM results to design individual treatment plans. It will
      also track outcomes or the uveal melanoma population that received DecisionDx-UM testing.
