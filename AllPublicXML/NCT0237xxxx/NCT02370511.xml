      The purpose of this trial is to establish the safety and feasibility of the Edwards SAPIEN
      XT™and SAPIEN 3™ device and delivery systems in patients with severe symptomatic calcific
      mitral valve disease with severe mitral annular calcification who are not candidates for
      standard mitral valve surgery.

      Design:

      A prospective pilot study enrolling extremely high surgical risk patients with symptomatic
      severe calcific mitral valve disease undergoing implantation of an Edwards Sapien XT or
      SAPIEN 3 valve in the mitral position.

      There are two arms in this study evaluating two separate patient populations described below:

        -  Native Mitral Valve with severe Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC): Patients with
           symptomatic severe disease of a native mitral valve due to severe mitral annular
           calcification.

        -  Valve in ring: Patients with symptomatic failing surgical rings resulting in severe
           mitral regurgitation or stenosis.

      The delivery approaches include: standard transeptal, modified transeptal approach with a
      guidewire externalized through a sheath percutaneously placed in the left ventricle, surgical
      trasnapical and surgical transatrial delivery approach with or without surgical resection of
      the anterior MV leaflet (in the native mitral valve arm).

      The MITRAL Trial site investigative team (heart team) consists of dedicated representatives
      from cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology, echocardiology, neurology, study
      coordination and other multi-disciplinary team members consistent with a transcatheter aortic
      valve replacement (TAVR) model.

      Endpoints

      Most endpoints were defined following the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC)
      recommendations.

      The primary safety endpoint is technical success at exit from the cath lab and procedural
      success at 30 days.

        -  Technical success (at exit from the cath lab) is defined as:

             -  Successful vascular and/or TA access, delivery and retrieval of the transcatheter
                valve delivery system

             -  Deployment of a single valve

             -  Correct position of transcatheter valve in the mitral annulus

             -  Adequate performance of the prosthetic heart valve (MVA &gt; 1.5 cm2) without residual
                mitral regurgitation grade ≥2 (+)

             -  No need for additional surgery or re-intervention (includes drainage of pericardial
                effusion)

             -  The patient leaves the cath lab alive

        -  Procedural Success (30 days) in defined as:

             -  Device success at 30 days

             -  No device/procedure related SAE's including: death, stroke, MI or coronary ischemia
                requiring PCI or CABG, stage 2 or 3 AKI including dialysis, life threatening
                bleeding, major vascular or access complications (arterial, venous, or TA - any
                event requiring additional unplanned surgical or transcatheter intervention),
                pericardial effusion or tamponade requiring drainage, severe hypotension, heart
                failure or respiratory failure requiring intravenous pressors or invasive or
                mechanical treatments such as ultrafiltration or hemodynamic assist devices
                including intra-aortic balloon pump or left ventricular assist device, or prolonged
                intubation for ≥48 hrs, or any valve-related dysfunction, migration, thrombosis, or
                other complication requiring surgery or repeat intervention.

        -  Device success is defined as:

        -  Stroke free survival with original valve in place

                without associated hemolysis

             -  No increase in AI from baseline and LVOT gradient &lt; 20 mmHg increase from baseline

             moderate mitral valve stenosis. Qualifying echo must be within 60 days of the date of
             the procedure.

          2. Patient is symptomatic from mitral valve disease, as demonstrated by reported NYHA

          3. The patient is at least 22 years old.

          4. The heart team agrees (and verified in the case review process) that valve
             implantation will likely benefit the patient.

          5. The heart team agrees that medical factors preclude operation, based on a conclusion
             that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the
             probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically, the STS score is ≥15% or the
             probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity is ≥ 50%. The surgeons'
             consult notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion
             and include a printout of the calculation of the STS score to additionally identify
             the risks in the patient (some medical factors and definitions are provided below). At
             least one of the cardiac surgeon assessors must have physically evaluated the patient.
             All patients must be approved by the Patient Selection and Procedure Management
             Steering Committee (at least 2 member votes, one must be a cardiac surgeon).

          7. The study patient agrees to comply with all required post-procedure follow-up visits

          2. Patient is symptomatic from mitral valve disease, as demonstrated by reported NYHA
             Functional Class II or greater, or symptoms during stress test, or severe hemolytic
