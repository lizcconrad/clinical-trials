      The purpose of this work is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous Mesenchymal
      sc (MSC) therapy in women suffering from POF.

      Stem cells (sc) are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. They
      are self sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the
      remarkable potential to develop in many different cell types in the body. Premature ovarian
      failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated
      with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility, and elevated serum gonadotropins. This
      work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous Mesenchymal sc (MSC)
      transplantation in women suffering from POF. Out of 112 high risk patients for POF, 10 cases
      were diagnosed as POF. The ten POF patients were scheduled for MSC transplantation at Al-
      Azhar University Hospitals. MSC preparation from the bone marrow of the iliac crest was
      laparoscopically injected in the ovaries. Endometrial fractional biopsy is
      histopathologically (HP) and Immunohistochemically (IH) stained and evaluated according to
      Edessy stem cells score (ESS) (1).

    <description>Out of 112 high risk patients for POF diagnosis was established in 10 cases. Endometrial fractional biopsy was taken, stained with H&amp;E stain and by Immunohistochemical (IH) staining by stem cell marker OCT4. IH expression of stem cell was evaluated before and after transplantation according to Edessy Stem Cell Scoring (ESS). After laparoscopic injection of stem cell sample in the ovaries, participants were followed up monthly for a period of one year by hormonal (FSH, LH and E2), clinical (resuming menstruation and pregnancy), US (folliculometry), histopathological (HP), and IH expression of stem cell (stem cell positivity and scoring according to ESS).</description>
