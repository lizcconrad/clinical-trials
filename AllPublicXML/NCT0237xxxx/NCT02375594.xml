  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise park equipments for the elderly are designed taking into account the physical and
      cognitive capabilities and needs of elderly individuals. These equipments are usually built
      in public spaces, and may be part of public health initiatives to promote active lifestyles
      in the elderly.

      Previous research has provided clear evidence on the short-term efficacy of exercise programs
      in improving physical function and level of physical activity in community-dwelling elderly.
      The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to assess whether an exercise intervention
      conducted in an exercise park equipment is able to achieve sustained improvements in physical
      function and level of physical activity, that are maintained for at least 3 months after the
      end of the intervention. The target population are community-dwelling elderly that are
      insufficiently active.

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will attend a 3-month long program of 2 weekly one-hour exercise sessions in the exercise park equipment, guided by a physical therapist. The sessions will comprise a combination of aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility exercises. Up to 20 participants exercising simultaneously in the equipment under the guidance of an experienced LAPPSET physical therapist.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will receive usual advice on healthy habits. During the study, they will be offered to attend the talks on healthy living for elderly periodically organised by their primary care centre (CAP Vallcarca - Sant Gervasi). At the end of the study, they will be invited to an exercise session at the exercise park equipment, conducted by the study physical therapist.</description>
